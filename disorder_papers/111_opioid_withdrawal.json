Prominent features are the late onset of these symptoms, several days after treatment has been discontinued, and the sometimes difficult diagnosis, since patients are usually unaware of their dependence on these drugs. Reinstituting benzodiazepine treatment, then withdrawing it progressively are the best curative measures. Prevention is easy if treatment is gradually rather than abruptly withdrawn in all patients who receive the compound in high dosage for more than one month.",

There are many reasons behind a man gets addicted to these substances such as recreation purpose, drugs used for long time for treatment of any disorder and gets addicted, unemployment, stress, emotions, professional pressure and social status. It provides enjoyable feelings which results in creating a strong urge to use the substances again and again. These drugs can cause physical dependence or psychological dependence or both. Over time, drug tolerance is produced which means to get the same effect more quantity of the drug is needed. These substances are very harmful physically, mentally, financially and socially too. If someone suddenly terminates using these substances after heavy or long term use, the body needs time to recover and number of withdrawal symptoms arises. These withdrawal symptoms can’t be treated by medications only but it needs counselling and support as well. This article reviews i. the drug abuse (opioid &amp; non-opioid), alcohol and nicotine addictions with their withdrawal symptoms and medications used to treat these symptoms ii. Rehabilitation centers running and other steps taken by Government of India to aware people especially the youths of the country about the harmful effects of these substances.",

      "title": "Physical activity, participation and health-related quality of life in chronic fatigue syndrome and multiple osteochondromas",
      "abstract": "WSAS Work and Social Adjustment ScaleChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is, according to the CDC-1994 criteria, a disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue of a new or definite onset, which is present for at least six months.The fatigue is not the result of exertion, is not alleviated by rest and leads to a significant reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social and personal activities.In addition, the fatigue has to be accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms, which have to be present for at least six months: impaired short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscles pain, pain in several joints, headache of a new type, pattern or severity, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours [6].Besides the CDC-1994 criteria [6], over 20 other case definitions have been developed with differences in main symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria [14,15].Consequently, these case definitions vary in sensitivity and specificity, but consensus on a uniform case definition has not been reached.Since the CDC-1994 case definition is the most frequently cited and most extensively validated [14], this case definition will be used throughout this thesis to define CFS.Estimates of prevalence rates vary in relation to case definitions and study designs [16,17], and range between 0.2% -2.2% for developed countries [16][17][18].The total prevalence of CFS in Europe is estimated around 2 million [19].CFS is 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in women than men [16,17] and is most common in young adults with its peak at 20-40 years of age [16].Information on incidence rates is even more scarce and is estimated at 15/100.000adults per year in de United Kingdom [18].Limited attention has been given to the societal impact of CFS in Europe [19], but a significant economic burden has been identified due to both direct as indirect or hidden costs.Direct costs encompass mainly various medical costs, and indirect costs consist of occupational limitations (productivity loss, absenteeism, work incapacity) and nonmedical, often hidden costs such as informal care given by the patient's social context CFS can be considered a non-specific disorder characterized by chronic fatigue that may be accompanied by chronic pain.The aetiology of MO is clear and, consequently, MO can be classified as a specific disorder explaining the localized (nociceptive) pain due to the structural deformities.However, as with many chronic disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain remains not fully understood.The pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain complaints is hypothesized to be multifactorial and can differ depending on the underlying disease [42][43][44].This thesis is particularly interested in the impact of chronic fatigue in patients who also experience chronic pain.environmental and personal factors can either be facilitating or restricting [49].As presented by the ICF (Figure 1), all concepts are inseparable and insight into the association between all concepts is necessary to clarify the impact of CFS and MO (health condition) on a person's physical activity level (PAL), activities, participation and HRQOL. Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

      "title": "[Heroin addiction].",
      "abstract": "Heroin is an illicit, highly addictive drug. It is either the most abused or the most rapidly acting member of opioids. Abusers describe a feeling of a surge of pleasurable sensation, named as \"rush\" or \"high\". Repeated administration of high doses of heroin results in the induction of physical dependence. Physical dependence refers to an altered physiological state produced by chronic administration of heroin which necessitates the continued administration of the drug to prevent the appearance of a characteristic syndrome, the opioid withdrawal or abstinence syndrome. Withdrawal symptoms may occur within a few hours after the last administration of heroin. Symptoms of the withdrawal include restlessness, insomnia, drug craving, diarrhea, muscle and bone pain, cold flashes with goose bumps, and leg movements. Major withdrawal symptoms peak between 48 and 72 hours after the last dose of heroin and subside after about a week. At this time, weakness and depression are pronounced and nausea and vomiting are common. Nevertheless, some chronic addicts have shown persistent withdrawal signs for many months or even years. Heroin addiction is considered as a behavioural state of compulsive drug use and a high tendency to relapse after periods of abstinence. It is generally accepted that compulsive use and relapse are typically associated with the status of heroin craving or heroin hunger that are difficult to define but appear to be powerful motivational significance in the addiction process. The route of administering heroin varies largely and may indicate the degree of seriousness of the individual's addiction. Intravenous administration seems to be the predominant method of heroin use, but recently a shift in heroin use pattern has been found, i.e. from injection to sniffing and smoking. Frequent injections coupled with widespread sharing of syringes increase the risk of contracting HIV, hepatitis B, C and other blood-borne infectious diseases. Long-term use of heroin has also severe medical consequences such as scarred veins, bacterial infections of blood vessels, liver and kidney diseases, and lung complications.",

As a mood state, depression is characterized by feeling despondent or unhappy, while depression as a mood disorder is a persistent set of symptoms as described in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV). Specifically, major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric condition in which diagnostic criteria require five or more depressive symptoms, one of which must include either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure. Other depressive symptoms include significant weight loss, sleep changes (i.e., insomnia or hypersomnia), psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, diminished ability to think or concentrate, and recurrent thoughts of death. MDD is also distinguished from normal symptoms of sadness by criteria for symptom severity and duration: symptoms of depression must have been present during the same two-week period, be present all or most of the time, and represent a change from a previous level of functioning.",

      "abstract": "A common neurological condition known as epilepsy is characterized by recurrent bouts of uncontrollable body movements that affect only a portion of the body (partial) or the full body (generalized), occasionally accompanied by loss of consciousness and control over bowel or bladder function. Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure. The duration of postictalphase varies from minutes to hours depending on the type of seizure, the frequency and intensity of seizures, and the length of the seizure.",

The alcohol withdrawal syndrome is produced by the emergence of the biological mechanism of neurological tolerance to ethanol. The clinical manifestations of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome are due to the hyperexcitability of the central nervous system: agitation, excitability, tremor, convulsions, status epilepticus, delirium, sympathetic hyperactivity. Usually benign, the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is frequently manageable on an ambulatory basis, as long as no clinical counter-indication is present such as a serious previous alcohol withdrawal syndrome, previous withdrawal convulsions, a significant medical or psychiatric comorbidity, a high level of alcohol consumption, a pregnancy, or the lack of an effective familial or social support. The ambulatory management of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome requires frequently the use of a sedative drug. Benzodiazepines used orally for a duration of 3 to 5 days are actually considered a first choice. Inability to work and drive is frequently present for several days.",

      "title": "Secondary headache attributed to exposure to or overuse of a substance",
      "abstract": "Background Secondary headaches attributed to exposure to or the overuse of a substance are classified under chapter eight in the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition. Three distinct sub-chapters consider: 1. Headache attributed to exposure to a substance, 2. Medication overuse headache, and 3. Headache attributed to substance withdrawal. Headache attributed to exposure to a substance refers to a headache with onset immediately or within hours after the exposure, while medication overuse headache is a headache occurring on 15 or more days per month that has developed as a consequence of regular usage of acute headache medication(s) for more than three consecutive months in a patient with a pre-existing primary headache disorder. The withdrawal of caffeine, oestrogen, and opioids is most often associated with the development of headache. Discussion Despite the current headache classification, there is no certainty of a causal relationship between the use of any substance and the development of headache. Some substances are likely to provoke headache in patients that suffer from a primary headache disorder like migraine, tension-type headache or cluster headache, while others were described to cause headache even in people that generally do not get headaches. Toxic agents, such as carbon monoxide (CO) are difficult to investigate systematically, while other substances such as nitric oxide (NO) were specifically used to induce headache experimentally. If a patient with an underlying primary headache disorder develops a headache, in temporal relation to exposure to a substance, which is significantly worse than the usual headache it is considered secondary. This is even more the case if the headache phenotype is different from the usually experienced headache characteristics. Medication overuse headache is a well-described, distinct disease entity with only marginally understood pathophysiology and associated psychological factors. Managing medication overuse headache patients includes education, detoxification, prophylactic treatments and treating comorbidities, which is reflected in available guidelines. Viewing medication overuse headache as a separate entity helps clinicians and researchers better recognise, treat and study the disorder. Conclusion Identification of substances that may cause or trigger secondary headache is important in order to educate patients and health care professionals about potential effects of these substances and prevent unnecessary suffering, as well as deterioration in quality of life. Treatment in case of medication overuse and other chronic headache should be decisive and effective.",

      "abstract": "Abstract There are numerous reasons why stopping antidepressants might be prudent, including harms (for example, emotional numbing, sexual issues, and other physical health consequences) outweighing benefits, use beyond guideline recommendations, and patient preference. Withdrawal effects arise due to adaptation to chronic use of antidepressants – often termed physical dependence, distinct from addiction. Withdrawal effects can manifest as either physical or psychological symptoms and can often be mistaken for a return of an underlying condition or onset of a new physical or mental health condition. The most severe withdrawal effects are suicidality, akathisia and protracted withdrawal syndromes which can last for months or years and can sometimes be debilitating. Careful tapering can minimise these effects. After long‐term use tapering should be gradual (months or years), and adjusted to a rate that the individual can tolerate. Dose reduction should be conducted in a hyperbolic pattern (so that decrements become smaller and smaller as the total dose gets lower) to reflect the hyperbolic relationship between dose and receptor occupancy. In order to facilitate gradual hyperbolic tapering formulations other than widely available tablets will be required, including liquid versions, compounded versions or off‐label use of existing formulations. Switching from one antidepressant to fluoxetine can be problematic. Every‐other‐day dosing for antidepressants other than fluoxetine is likely to lead to withdrawal effects.",

It is further believed by some that severely limiting the number of prescriptions will greatly reduce the number of deaths due to opioid overdoses occurring as a consequence of the opioid epidemic.

      "abstract": "Drug-induced headache is a common yet often misinterpreted symptom. Patients suffering primarily from migraine or headache caused by tension are susceptible to this affect due to their massive consumption of medication. The frequent or daily intake of painkillers or migraine medication over periods of weeks or months may lead to a new type of headache characterised by dull, pressure-like and diffuse permanent pain. The appropriate therapy in this case is a withdrawal of analgesics, for which the patient needs to be hospitalised. The recovery process after hospitalisation depends heavily on the after treatment. Factors for a favourable prognosis are the length of the abuse period (less than 5 years), the use of dihydergot as a pain-killer, motivation of the patient and the support of the family and the patient's immediate environment.",

Withdrawal symptoms occur within 6–12 hours of stopping smoking and include intense craving, depressed mood, insomnia, anxiety, restlessness, irritability, difficulty in concentrating and increased appetite. Nicotine withdrawal can be misdiagnosed as depression, anxiety, sleep disorders and mania. Withdrawal can also exacerbate the symptoms of schizophrenia.",

Today, occupational stress has become an epidemic spreading like wildfire. Organizations lose much money in stress-related accidents, lost productivity, absenteeism, and medical insurance costs. Physical symptoms of occupational stress are: headaches, digestive problems, sleep deprivation, rashes or hives, heartburn, night sweats, diminished sexual desire, menstrual irregularities, chronic back pain, muscle tensions, loss of appetite, weight gain. Emotional or mental symptoms of occupational stress are: increased anger, frustration, depression, moodiness, anxiousness, problems with memory, fatigue, and increased use of nicotine, alcohol and drugs. Work related symptoms are: increased absenteeism, accidents on the job, and complaints from coworkers, decrease in work productivity, and difficulty in understanding office procedures, job absenteeism, and taking long coffee breaks, excessive personal time on the telephone or internet. Many attempts have been made to identify causes of stressful job events. There are essentially three different, but overlapping, approaches to the definition and study of stress. The engineering and physiological approaches are obvious among the earlier theories of stress, while the more psychological approaches characterize contemporary stress theory.",

      "title": "Safe Deprescribing of Benzodiazepines and Z‐drugs",
      "abstract": "Abstract Most guidelines recommend that benzodiazepines and z‐drugs used continuously for more than 4 weeks should be withdrawn, if the patient is agreeable, because of the unfavourable balance of harms (including physical dependence, addiction, tolerance and withdrawal effects) and benefits. Withdrawal effects arise due to adaptation to chronic use of benzodiazepines and z‐drugs – often termed physical dependence, distinct from addiction. Addiction is an issue only for a small minority of benzodiazepine users whilst withdrawal effects and physical dependence affect a much larger group of patients taking medication as prescribed. Withdrawal effects can manifest as either physical or psychological symptoms and can often be mistaken for a return of an underlying condition or onset of a new physical or mental health condition. The most severe withdrawal effects are suicidality, akathisia and protracted withdrawal syndromes which can last for months or years and can sometimes be debilitating. Careful tapering can minimise these effects. After long‐term use tapering should be gradual (months or years), and adjusted to a rate that the individual can tolerate. Dose reduction should be conducted in a hyperbolic pattern (so that decrements become smaller and smaller as the total dose gets lower) to reflect the hyperbolic relationship between dose and receptor occupancy. In order to facilitate gradual hyperbolic tapering sometimes formulations other than widely available tablets will be required, including liquid versions, compounded versions or off‐label use of existing formulations. Switching from one benzodiazepine to a longer‐acting drug like diazepam can sometimes be helpful.",

      "abstract": "Summary Since 1990, significant efforts have been made towards developing interventions to prevent depression. Depression is a serious medical illness that involves brain. Persons of any age-children or adults may develop depression symptoms. Symptoms such as intense sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities, sleep disturbances or oversleeping, change in appetite and deceased energy level; feeling of helplessness and thoughts of suicide are sequels to stress induced depression. The primary clinical manifestations of major depression are significant depression of mood and impairment of function. Mood and anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses. Clinical depression must be distinguished from normal grief, sadness, disappointment and the dysphoria or demoralization often associated with medical illness. Physical changes also occur, particularly in severe, vital, or melancholic depression. These include insomnia or hypersomnia; altered eating patterns, with anorexia and weight loss or sometimes overeating; decreased energy and libido; and disruption of the normal circadian and ultradian rhythms of activity, body temperature and many endocrine functions. Depressed patients usually respond to antidepressant drugs, or, in severe or treatment-resistant cases, to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This review focuses on knowledge of depression, pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures for its treatment and future directions for the field of depression prevention.",

      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

      "title": "Steps Following Attainment of Remission",
      "abstract": "Article Abstract Depressive disorders require long-term treatment with antidepressants, psychotherapy, or both. The goal of antidepressant therapy is complete remission of symptoms and return to normal daily functioning. Studies have shown that achieving remission and continuing antidepressant therapy long after the acute symptoms remit can protect against the relapse or recurrence of the psychiatric episode. Many patients, however, inadvertently or intentionally skip doses of their antidepressant, and even discontinue it, if their symptoms improve or if they experience side effects. Antidepressant discontinuation may increase the risk of relapse or precipitate certain distressing symptoms such as gastrointestinal complaints, dizziness, flu-like symptoms, equilibrium disturbances, and sleep disorders. Documented with all classes of antidepressants, these reactions may emerge within a couple of days, or even hours, after the abrupt discontinuation of an antidepressant with a short half-life. These distressing responses may be mistaken for a relapse or recurrence. It is important to recognize the potential for these sequelae and educate patients about the need to take all antidepressants at the doses prescribed, warning them of the symptoms that may occur if they skip doses or stop their medication too quickly. Antidepressants should be tapered slowly over a period of days, weeks, or even months, depending on the dose, duration of treatment, and pharmacologic properties of the agent, as well as the patient's individual response. This article reviews the risks and reactions associated with discontinuation of antidepressants. It offers guidelines for distinguishing relapse and recurrence from discontinuation responses as well as for prevention and management of the antidepressant discontinuation syndrome.",

      "abstract": "The diagnostic category of adjustment disorder was introduced in the DSM-III-R 1. Prior to that, it was called transient situational disturbance. The DSM-IV 2 and ICD-10 3 descriptions of adjustment disorder are broadly similar. The main features are the following: a) the symptoms arise in response to a stressful event; b) the onset of symptoms is within 3 months (DSM-IV) or 1 month (ICD-10) of exposure to the stressor; c) the symptoms must be clinically significant, in that they are distressing and in excess of what would be expected by exposure to the stressor and/or there is significant impairment in social or occupational functioning (the latter is mandatory in ICD-10); d) the symptoms are not due to another axis I disorder (or bereavement in DSM-IV); e) the symptoms resolve within 6 months once the stressor or its consequences are removed. Adjustment disorders are divided into subgroups based on the dominant symptoms of anxiety, depression or behaviour. Since its introduction, the category of adjustment disorder has been the subject of criticism on three fronts. The first was that it constituted an attempt to medicalize problems of living and did not conform to the criteria for traditional disorders such as having a specific symptom profile 4. The second was that it was a \"wastebasket diagnosis\" which was assigned to those who failed to meet the criteria for other disorders 5. The third was on its diagnostic instability 6 and that its main utility was to serve as a \"justification\" for diagnosis-based reimbursement operating in the healthcare system of the US. Despite this, the category has been retained in the further classifications, in large measure due to its clinical utility. Adjustment disorder continues to be diagnosed in a range of clinical settings. Consultation-liaison psychiatry is the context in which the diagnosis is most likely to be made. Around 12% of referrals are so diagnosed in university hospitals in the US 7, a figure that resembles that in European hospitals 8. Nevertheless, the frequency with which adjustment disorder is now diagnosed seems to be declining, in parallel with an increase in the diagnosis of major depression 9, possibly due to the availability of psychotropic drugs, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), that are safer in those who are medically ill than the older agents. So, changes in the prevalence of adjustment disorders may reflect a change in the \"culture of prescribing\", stimulating changes in the \"culture of diagnosis\" 10. Adjustment disorder has been reported to be almost three times as common as major depression (13.7 vs. 5.1%) in acutely ill medical in-patients 11 and to be diagnosed in up to one third of cancer patients experiencing a recurrence 12. In obstetric/gynaecology consultation-liaison 13, adjustment disorders predominated over other mood disorders. Among those assessed in an emergency department following self harm, a diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% of those interviewed, while a diagnosis of major depression was made in 19.5% of cases 14. None of the major epidemiological studies carried out in the community, such as the Epidemiological Catchment Area Study 15, the National Comorbidity Survey Replication 16 or the National Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys 17 included adjustment disorder among the conditions examined. An exception was the Outcome of Depression International Network (ODIN) study 18, which found a prevalence of only 1% for adjustment disorder in five European countries. A possible reason for this was that mild depression was included in the depressive episode category, inflating that category at the expense of adjustment disorder. By contrast, a study of elderly people from the general population 19 found the prevalence of adjustment disorder to be 2.3%, similar to that of major depression. Adjustment disorder is reported to be very common in primary care, but relevant epidemiological studies in this setting are rare and report rates of the disorder range from 1 to 18% 20,21 among consulters with mental health problems. Concerning psychiatric settings, a study of intake diagnoses into outpatient clinics 22, combining clinical evaluation and the use of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID, 23), found that adjustment disorder was the most common clinical diagnosis, made in 36% of patients, whereas the diagnosis was made in about 11% of cases using SCID. Among psychiatric inpatients, 9% of consecutive admissions to an acute public sector unit were diagnosed with adjustment disorder 24. Quantifying the prevalence of adjustment disorder in child and adolescent populations is difficult, due to changes in the diagnostic criteria over time 25. In the younger age groups, unlike adults, adjustment disorder carries with it significant morbidity and a poor outcome, frequently developing into major psychiatric illness 25,26. A general population study in Puerto Rico 27 found a rate of 4.2% among 14–16 year old people, while the total psychiatric morbidity was 17.8%. A similar rate was found in children aged 8–9 in Finland 28. Among outpatients, figures of 5.9–7% have been reported 29,30. In child liaison psychiatry, over one third of those with recent onset diabetes were so diagnosed 31, making it the most common psychiatric disorder to follow this well defined stressor. The current diagnosis of adjustment disorder assumes that there is a stressor which acts as a trigger and that the condition is self-limiting. So, adjustment disorder is closer to the definition of a discrete disorder as proposed by Kendell 32 than most other disorders in psychiatry, since its etiology and course are encapsulated within the diagnosis, while the definition of many other mental disorders is cross-sectional and based on symptoms alone. Yet, the current classifications impose a hierarchical model that assumes equivalence in how adjustment disorder and other diagnoses are construed. As currently classified, adjustment disorder is a sub-threshold diagnosis, that is trumped once the symptom threshold for another diagnosis is met. There is an inherent belief that a sub-threshold condition is less severe than a full-blown disorder such as major depression, the diagnosis by which adjustment disorder is most often superseded. Yet, the evidence for this is lacking, and there is empirical data 33 that, when measures of symptom severity or social functioning are examined, there is no difference between those with mood disorders and adjustment disorder. Furthermore, up to 25% of adolescents with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder engage in suicidal behaviour 34, while among adults with this disorder the figure is 60% 35. Adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide 36, while among all suicide deaths in the developing world it is the most common diagnosis 37. These data show that, far from being a mild condition, adjustment disorder has a significant impact on behaviour. On the other hand, the current classifications fail to distinguish between adaptive and maladaptive reactions to stress. The DSM-IV tries to address this problem by stating that a diagnosis of adjustment disorder is only made when the distress is of clinical significance 38. There are two components to this: the distress must be in excess of what would normally be expected and/or there is an impairment in social or occupational function. In relation to the first of these, one of the most insightful critics of the DSM-IV, J. Wakefield 39, points out that it would allow the top third in the normal distribution of mood reactivity to be classified as disordered, and that it does not take into account the contextual factors that might cause this excess in distress. For example, the loss of a job for one person might be manageable while for another it could heap poverty on a family resulting in distress that might not be inappropriate under the circumstances. Cultural differences in the expression of emotion also need to be considered. In liaison psychiatry, where the diagnosis of adjustment disorder is most frequently made, a knowledge of \"normal\" coping with illness in that specific culture is essential and the diagnostic process will be guided by the extent to which an individual's symptoms are in excess of this. Some might argue that the fact of visiting a doctor indicates abnormal distress, yet the tendency to consult is also determined by factors additional to illness, including cultural and personal attitudes to symptoms. So, the mere fact of a consultation should not of itself be taken as a proxy measure of excessive distress. Neither should the decision to refer to psychiatric services, since this too is governed by factors that are not always related to symptom severity (e.g., a wish \"to do something\" under pressure from a patient in the face of continuing distress). Because adjustment disorder is a diagnosis made in the context of a stressor, there is a danger that any distress following such an event might be labelled as a disorder 40. Clinical judgement, therefore, plays a large part in making the diagnosis of adjustment disorder in the current criterion vacuum and future classifications should accord weight to culture, context and personal circumstances in differentiating normal from pathological distress. The second criterion, requiring impairment in functioning, is arguably a more robust indicator of disorder, since it is this which leads to treatment seeking. For example, the inability to work is potentially a significant indicator of impairment. However, there may be situations where functioning is reduced in the presence of non-pathological reactions. For instance, if the circumstances are especially traumatic, such as the loss of a child, the period of impaired function may be longer than anticipated in those with non-pathological responses. The evaluation of functioning in children places special demands on the assessor, since it has to be set against the demands of the developmental stage, and the degree of dependency and autonomy in key relationships. The presence of pre-existing impairment and extant vulnerabilities, such as learning disability and developmental disorders, must also be considered when making the evaluation. The ICD-10, contrary to the DSM-IV, requires the presence of both excessive symptoms and functional impairment for the diagnosis of adjustment disorder, thus narrowing the application of this category. Because of the hierarchical nature of ICD-10 and DSM-IV, adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed once the criteria for another condition are met. The condition that most frequently trumps adjustment disorder is major depression/depressive episode. This is evident from studies that compare the clinical with the research approach. For example, in a study of those presenting because of self-harm, a clinical diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% and one of major depression in 19.5% of cases, but using SCID the proportions changed to 7.8% and 36.4% respectively 14. However, there is a point of departure between the two conditions when other variables are considered. Suicidal behaviour occurs earlier in the course of adjustment disorder as compared to major depression 41 and the interval from suicidal communication to completion of suicide is shorter 42. The socio-demographic profile and childhood risk variables differ between the two groups 41. Among adolescents dying by suicide, there is much less evidence of prior emotional or behavioural problems 42. In addition, the readmission rates for those with adjustment disorder are significantly lower than for those with major depression, generalized anxiety or dysthymia 43 and hospitalization is also shorter 6. This highlights the need for the clearer operationalization of adjustment disorder in future classifications. A further but lesser area of potential overlap is with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The conflation is not so much related to the symptoms of these disorders but to the stressors themselves. There has been an expansion in the stressors that are deemed to trigger PTSD, from those that are potentially life threatening, as originally described, to events that are less traumatic, such as financial problems or watching distressing images on television – a phenomenon called \"criterion creep\" 44. In clinical practice, a diagnosis of PTSD is often made reflexively 45 once such an event is identified, although adjustment disorder might be a more appropriate diagnosis. Overall, it is clear from the data available that adjustment disorder is sufficiently severe and distinct from other disorders, especially major depression, to warrant upgrading from its sub-syndromal status to that of a full-blown and independent mental disorder. Criteria for the DSM-IV revision have already been suggested 46. The Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS, 47) and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI, 48) do not incorporate adjustment disorder at all. The Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN, 49) do include adjustment disorder, but only at the end of the interview, in section 13, which deals with \"inferences and attributions\". This comes after the criteria for all other disorders have been completed, and there are no specific questions with regard to adjustment disorder to assist the interviewer, relying instead on clinical judgement. The SCID 23 also includes a section dealing with adjustment disorder, but the instructions to interviewers specify that this diagnosis is not made if the criteria for any other mental disorder are met, with the de facto effect of relegating it to a sub-syndromal status. In light of the very low threshold for diagnosing major depression, even in studies using SCID and purporting to be inclusive of adjustment disorder, major depression will often supersede adjustment disorder, irrespective of the context in which the symptoms have arisen. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI, 50) also incorporates a section on adjustment disorder but, as in SCID, that disorder is trumped when any other diagnosis is made. So, while structured interviews have greatly facilitated epidemiological research in psychiatry, the possibility that they are overly rigid, having been designed for use by lay interviewers, cannot be excluded. This is especially pertinent for a diagnosis such as adjustment disorder, which relies heavily on clinical judgement, context and presumptive longitudinal course rather than symptoms alone. As a result of the problems with the current crop of structured diagnostic instruments, attempts have been made to identify suitable screening instruments for adjustment disorder. Because there is symptom overlap with major depression, there is a possibility that instruments which screen for depression might identify people with adjustment disorder. A number of scales have been used for this purpose, including the Zung Depression Scale 51, which has been shown to be an adequate screen for adjustment disorder and major depression combined 52, but when compared to SCID has inadequate sensitivity and specificity 53. A study of health care workers with \"reactive depression\", an old-fashioned diagnosis but one which encapsulates the concept of adjustment disorder most closely, found little correlation with the Zung scale score 54. Efforts to develop a screening instrument using a coping measure have also been unsuccessful 55. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, 56) has been used for screening purposes in cancer patients, but it does not distinguish between major depression and adjustment disorder 57. Similar problems arose when the 1-Question Interview and the Impact Thermometer 58 were tested for their ability to screen for adjustment disorder. The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology 59 might have a role in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression and has been used in one study reporting that non-environmentally induced disorder had more melancholic symptoms and a different quality to the mood changes compared to environmentally triggered disorder 59. Further investigation of this is clearly required. Adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed in the absence of a stressor. The event must be external and occur in close time proximity to the onset of symptoms. The longer the time period between the triggering event and the onset of symptoms, the less likely is the diagnosis to be adjustment disorder. For this reason, a period between the event and symptom onset of 3 months in DSM-IV and 1 month in ICD-10 is required. Caution must be exercised when this gap is relatively long, for two reasons: firstly, those who are depressed often attach significance to particular events, that in themselves were neutral in effect at the time, in an \"effort at meaning\"; secondly, recall bias may lead to an unreliable date of the event. The 3 month upper limit may prove to be excessively long and it is difficult to ascertain the empirical data on which this is based. Concerning the type of event, there is little to assist the clinician in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression. While 100% of those with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder have recent life events, 83% of those with major depression also report such events, with more related to marital problems and fewer to occupational or family stressors in the adjustment disorder group 60. Such differences, while statistically significant, are unlikely to be clinically meaningful in an individual patient, since they are not exclusive as precipitants to either major depression or adjustment disorder. And the events can range in severity from those that are generally regarded as mild, such as a row with a boyfriend, to those that are more serious. This will be mediated by individual vulnerability. In the preamble to the section on adjustment disorder, the ICD-10 states that \"individual vulnerability and risk plays a greater role than in other disorders\" such as PTSD or acute stress reactions. However, it is unclear on what evidence this is based. By contrast, the DSM-IV is silent on this issue. The possibility that a diathesis-stress model operates is worthy of consideration and personality is arguably the most obvious predisposing factor. There have been few studies directly comparing adjustment disorder against other disorders to allow definitive claims about the role of personality, and caution is advisable in the current state of knowledge. The relevant studies can be classified in two broad groups: those directly examining adjustment disorder and those examining diagnoses akin to adjustment disorder. The prevalence of personality disorder among those with adjustment disorder in comparison to those with other depressive disorders seems to be not different 20, although studies are few and numbers small. Among personality dimensions, neuroticism emerged as a factor predisposing to adjustment disorder in a military sample 61. Attachment style has also been examined, and maternal overprotection was found to be a risk factor for later adjustment disorder 62,63, while paternal abuse was associated with the severity of the disorder 63. Studies using terminologies that imply a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, such as \"reactive\", \"non-endogenous\" or \"situational\" depression, are also of interest, although there is a caveat that these conditions may not be identical to adjustment disorder due to differences in the definitions in the earlier classifications. One such study 64 found that the strongest relationship was between premorbid neuroticism and a non-endogenous symptom pattern and evidence of \"oral dependent\" personality. The findings in relation to neuroticism and a non-endogenous pattern of symptoms were replicated by others 65 in studies of subjects and their relatives 66. The absence of clear symptomatological criteria for adjustment disorder in either DSM-IV or ICD-10 means that greater weight is attached to clinical judgement than in most other current conditions. Symptoms of low mood, sadness, worry, anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration, having their onset following a recent stressful event are likely indicators of a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, although it must be borne in mind that major depression can also present similarly. Mood disturbance is often more noticeable when the person is cognitively engaged with the event, such as when speaking about it, while at other times mood is normal and reactive. The removal of the person from the stressful situation is associated with a general improvement in symptoms. In the case of those who develop adjustment disorder in response to serious illness, changes in mood are related to changes in the illness itself. The more typically \"melancholic\" the symptoms are — e.g., diurnal change, early morning wakening, loss of mood reactivity — the less likely is the diagnosis of adjustment disorder. A family history of depression might also suggest a depressive episode. Due to the low symptom threshold for diagnosing major depression, it is easy to make a diagnosis of this condition rather than adjustment disorder. While the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines on depression recommend a period of \"watchful waiting\" 67, so as to allow for the possibility of spontaneous resolution, under pressure from the patient and his/her family, or the doctor's own desire \"to do something\", a diagnosis of major depression (or generalized anxiety) may be made and antidepressants prescribed. Difficulties also arise when the stressor, and hence the symptoms, is persistent and has little likelihood of resolving. Antidepressants may be prescribed on pragmatic grounds, as there is no way of establishing if the symptoms are likely to spontaneously remit or if they are now independent of the initial trigger and constitute major depression. The absence of a response to antidepressants should raise the possibility that this is an adjustment disorder, so that psychological therapies are offered rather than engaging in protracted trails of multiple medications. A further consideration is that what appears to be a single stressor (e.g., a diagnosis of a serious physical illness) may be associated with ongoing symptoms as different facets of the diagnosis impinge upon the patient (e.g., the initiation of painful treatments, treatment failures, etc.). Failure to appreciate that rolling stressors prolong symptoms might lead to an erroneous diagnosis of major depression. The role of the consequences of the initial stressor in prolonging symptoms is recognized in the DSM-IV definition of adjustment disorder. Based on the predominant symptoms, several subtypes of adjustment disorder are recognised by DSM-IV and ICD-10 (Table 1). The subtypes are broadly similar in the two classifications but, apart from adjustment disorder with depressed mood, they have received little attention. The depressed subtype is the most common in adults, while the subtypes with predominant disturbance of conduct or of conduct and emotions are more commonly diagnosed among children and adolescents. The distinction between adjustment disorder and a normal stress response is based on the severity of symptoms and their duration; the impact on functioning taking into account the nature of the stressor; the personal and interpersonal context in which it has occurred; cultural norms with regard to such responses. PTSD and acute stress disorder require the presence of a stressor of a magnitude that would be traumatic for almost everybody and the symptom constellation is also specific, although both of these have recently been challenged 40. Moreover, not everybody exposed to such traumatic events responds by developing PTSD and the possibility that other disorders can follow instead needs to be considered. For those not meeting the PTSD diagnostic criteria, but with significant symptoms and/or functional impairment, adjustment disorder should be considered a possible alternative. What may appear to be an adjustment disorder, because of the sub-threshold level of the symptoms or the lack of functional impairment, might be an axis I disorder in evolution that only emerges as a recognizable syndrome after a period of watchful waiting. Thus, the revision of an index diagnosis of adjustment disorder may be necessary at times, especially if there are persisting symptoms in spite of termination of the stressor. Few studies have examined the disorders that are comorbid with adjustment disorder, an exercise that is hampered by the fact that the criteria for this disorder preclude axis I comorbidity. Yet, a recent study 19 found that almost half of patients exhibited comorbidity with major depression or PTSD. Surprisingly, complicated grief and adjustment disorder were not significantly comorbid. The relationship between substance abuse and adjustment disorder is also deserving of mention, since it may explain the seeming instability of the adjustment disorder diagnosis. Firstly, substances may be misused for relief of symptoms such as anxiety and depression, which are prominent in adjustment disorder. Substances such as alcohol are themselves depressogenic and may present with mood changes leading to misdiagnosis. This may explain why in one study 6 several patients with an admission diagnosis of adjustment disorder were relabelled on discharge as having a primary diagnosis of substance misuse. The evidence base for the treatment of adjustment disorder is limited, due to the paucity of studies. A further problem is that these are self-remitting conditions, so that trials of interventions may fail to identify any benefits due to spontaneous resolution. In general, brief therapies are regarded as being the most appropriate, with the exception that, when stressors are ongoing, prolonged supportive measures may be necessary. However, there is a caveat for children and adolescents diagnosed with adjustment disorder, since there is evidence 26 that a majority of adolescents eventually develop major mental disorders. Practical measures may be useful to assist the person in managing the stressful situation. A person being bullied at work might decide to invoke an internal redress system or may seek the support of the trade union. A person in an abusive relationship might seek a barring order. A vulnerable person taking on too much work may benefit from simple, directive advice. Harnessing family members' input, involving supportive agencies such as social services or encouraging involvement in a support or self-help group may alleviate distress. Psychological therapies, delivered individually or in groups, span the range including supportive, psychoeducational, cognitive and psychodynamic approaches. Relaxation techniques can reduce symptoms of anxiety. Facilitating the verbalization of fears and emotions and exploring the meaning that the stressor has for the individual might also ameliorate symptoms. In persons who engage in deliberate self-harm, assistance in finding alternative responses that do not involve self-destruction may be of benefit and to date dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has the best evidence base 68. Ego enhancing therapy was found to be useful during periods of transition in older patients 69. \"Mirror therapy\", a therapy including psychocorporeal, cognitive, and neurolinguistic components, was effective in patients with adjustment disorder secondary to myocardial infarction 70. Cognitive therapy was helpful when administered to patients with adjustment disorder who experienced work-related stress 71 and among army conscripts with adjustment disorder 72. In a study of terminally cancer patients 73, similar improvements were found in those with adjustment disorder and other psychiatric diagnoses. Some of these psychological interventions have been tested in specific medically ill groups, such as those with cancer, heart disease or HIV. While improvements in coping have been demonstrated, it is unclear if subjects had adjustment disorder, some were open pilot studies (e.g., 74) and survival and quality of life rather than symptoms were the outcome measures in others (e.g., 75). The basic pharmacological management of adjustment disorder consists of symptomatic treatment of insomnia, anxiety and panic attacks. The use of benzodiazepines to relieve these is common 76. While antidepressants are advocated by some 77, especially if there has been no benefit from psychotherapy, there is little solid evidence to support their use. Nevertheless, those with sedative properties targeting sleep and anxiety may have a role when benzodiazepines are contraindicated 78, such as in those with a history of substance dependence. There are few trials specifically directed to the pharmacological treatment of adjustment disorder and these are mainly on subjects with the anxiety subtype 79,80,81,82,83,84,85. A study 79 comparing a benzodiazepine with a non-benzodiazepine found that the anxiolytic effects of each were similar, although more responded to the non-benzodiazepine. Two randomized placebo-controlled trials examined herbal remedies, including extracts from kava-kava 80 and valerian plus other extracts 81, and demonstrated a positive effect on symptoms. A study found that tianeptine, alprazolam and mianserine were equally effective 82, while a pilot study of cancer patients with anxious and depressed mood found trazodone superior to a benzodiazepine 83. One study in primary care 84 examined the response of patients with major depression and with adjustment disorder to antidepressants, using reported changes in functional disability based on case note information. Overall, the adjustment disorder group was twice as likely to respond to antidepressants. However, as this was a retrospective case note study, the relevance of the findings is questionable. One study compared pharmacological and psychological interventions in subjects with adjustment disorder randomly assigned to supportive psychotherapy, an antidepressant, a benzodiazepine or placebo, and found that all improved significantly 85. Overall, these studies lend little support for the superiority of antidepressants, and arguably for any specific treatment, in the management of adjustment disorder, but further studies are clearly required. Adjustment disorders are common mental disorders, especially in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Their prevalence seems to be higher in children and adolescents, in whom they are associated with significant morbidity and a poorer outcome than in adults. Suicidal behaviour is common in both adolescents and adults with these disorders, and adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide. There are major problems with the diagnostic criteria for adjustment disorder in both ICD-10 and DSM-IV. The most prominent of these is the status as sub-syndromal conditions. This has resulted in their being the subject of little research. Furthermore, current classifications fail to provide guidance on distinguishing these disorders from normal adaptive reactions to stress, and encourage the diagnosis of major depression in people with self-limiting reactions to stressors. Treatments for adjustment disorders are underinvestigated, although brief psychological interventions are likely to be the preferred option.",

When treatment with a CNS drug is discontinued, patients can experience classic new withdrawal symptoms, rebound and/or persistent postwithdrawal disorders, or relapse/recurrence of the original illness [6, 9, 14] . New and rebound symptoms can occur for up to 6 weeks after drug withdrawal, depending on the drug elimination half-life [2, 3] , while persistent postwithdrawal or tardive disorders associated with longlasting receptor changes may persist for more than 6 weeks after drug discontinuation. Initial withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs have been reported to be more frequent and severe when high-potency drugs and drugs with a short elimination half-life have been used [9, 10] . CNS drugs with a shorter elimination half-life and rapid onset of action also carry a higher risk of dependency and high-dose use [9, 10] . Withdrawal symptoms can be relatively short-lasting, lasting for a few hours to a few weeks with complete recovery, while others may persist and last for several months [1, 15, 16] . Fava et al.

They have recommended the Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in clinical practice, and have advanced the treatment of depression and other mental disorders. However, more studies are needed on the effects of decreasing and discontinuing these medications after their long-term use [1] . Withdrawal symptoms may occur with all SSRIs and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [1] , similarly to other CNS drugs, including benzodiazepines [2–4] and antipsychotics [5, 6] . Withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drugs produces psychiatric symptoms that can be confounded with true relapse or recurrence of the original illness [1, 2, 7] . When discontinuing or decreasing SSRIs, withdrawal symptoms must be identified to avoid prolonging treatment or giving unnecessarily high doses [6, 8] . Different types of syndromes have been described with the withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drug classes, including benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants, opiates, barbiturates, and alcohol: (1) new withdrawal symptoms (classic withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs) [1, 4–6, 9–12] , (2) rebound [2, 6, 9, 13–16] , and (3) persistent postwithdrawal disorders [7, 17, 18] ( table 1 ).

Early emergent medical management consists of life support and an etiology survey, and subsequent treatment can be classified into 4 stages: (1) early SE, (2) established SE, (3) refractory SE, and (4) super-refractory SE. For early SE, benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and diazepam, are the agents of choice, given to terminate the seizure activity rapidly. For established SE (20-30 min after SE onset), the therapeutic strategy is to give parental antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin, valproic acid, and levetiracetam. At the stage of refractory SE (1-2 hours after SE onset), the conventional treatment is induction of general anesthesia using midazolam or propofol. Superrefractory SE is defined as SE that continues, or recurs, for at least 24 hours after the onset of anesthetic therapy. In addition to treatments used in established and refractory SE, other potentially effective therapies include ketamine, magnesium, inhalational anesthetics, immunotherapy, ketogenic diet, induced hypothermia, and neurosurgery. The principle of SE therapy is rapid seizure control and correction of underlying problems. Future well-designed clinical trials are mandatory to establish the standard treatment, especially in settings of established, refractory, and super-refractory SE.",

Infants also develop some kind of addition in the womb when exposed to some antidepressants such as barbiturates and benzodiazepine.

It is differentiated from schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia by the duration of the psychosis. The diagnosis is often anticipatory or retrospective due to the diagnostic requirement of complete remission within 1 month. Brief psychotic disorder is an acute but transient disorder with the onset of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior At least one of these symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications. The disturbance in behavior cannot be better accounted for by schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorder with psychotic features, or be a direct result of a drug, medication, or medical condition like thyrotoxicosis, sarcoidosis, or syphilis.",

      "title": "The benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome",
      "abstract": "Abstract Physiological dependence on benzodiazepines is accompanied by a withdrawal syndrome which is typically characterized by sleep disturbance, irritability, increased tension and anxiety, panic attacks, hand tremor, sweating, difficulty in concentration, dry wretching and nausea, some weight loss, palpitations, headache, muscular pain and stiffness and a host of perceptual changes. Instances are also reported within the high‐dosage category of more serious developments such as seizures and psychotic reactions. Withdrawal from normal dosage benzodiazepine treatment can result in a number of symptomatic patterns. The most common is a short‐lived “rebound” anxiety and insomnia, coming on within 1‐4 days of discontinuation, depending on the half‐life of the particular drug. The second pattern is the full‐blown withdrawal syndrome, usually lasting 10–14 days; finally, a third pattern may represent the return of anxiety symptoms which then persist until some form of treatment is instituted. Physiological dependence on benzodiazepines can occur following prolonged treatment with therapeutic doses, but it is not clear what proportion of patients are likely to experience a withdrawal syndrome. It is also unknown to what extent the risk of physiological dependence is dependent upon a minimum duration of exposure or dosage of these drugs. Withdrawal phenomena appear to be more severe following withdrawal from high doses or short‐acting benzodiazepines. Dependence on alcohol or other sedatives may increase the risk of benzodiazepine dependence, but it has proved difficult to demonstrate unequivocally differences in the relative abuse potential of individual benzodiazepines.",

It is diagnosed, after excluding other potential causes of delirium, with a clinical history of carbon monoxide poisoning, narcotic overdose, myocardial infarction, or another global cerebral hypoxic event. The diagnosis can be supported by neuroimaging evidence of diffuse hemispheric demyelination sparing cerebellar and brainstem tracts, or by an elevated cerebrospinal fluid myelin basic protein. Standard or hyperbaric oxygen following CO poisoning may reduce the likelihood of DPHL or other neurologic sequelae. Bed rest and avoidance of stressful procedures for the first 10 days following any prolonged hypoxic event may also lower the risk. Gradual recovery over a 3 to 12 month period is common, but impaired attention or executive function, parkinsonism, or corticospinal tract signs can persist. Stimulants, amantadine or levodopa may be considered for lasting cognitive or parkinsonian symptoms. Anticipation and recognition of DPHL should lead to earlier and more appropriate utilization of health care services.",

      "title": "Magnesium Deficiency. Etiology and Clinical Spectrum",
      "abstract": "Abstract Magnesium deficiency may complicate many diseases. The causes include the following: inadequate intake during starvation or increased requirement during early childhood, pregnancy, or lactation; excessive losses of magnesium as a result of malabsorption from the gastrointestinal tract or from the kidneys during use of diuretics; and to a combination of the two, as in alcoholism. Most often the etiological factors have been operative for a month or more. Acute hypo‐magnesemia can occur without previous Mg deficiency after epinephrine, cold stress and stress of serious injury or extensive surgery. The clinical manifestations depend on the age of the patient and may begin insidiously or with dramatic suddenness, or there may be no overt symptoms or signs. The manifestations can be divided into the following categories: totally non‐specific symptoms and signs ascribable to the primary disease; neuromuscular hyperactivity including tremor, myoclonic jerks, convulsions, Chvostek sign, Trousseau sign (rarely), spontaneous carpopedal spasm (rarely), ataxia, nystagmus and dysphagia; psychiatric disturbances from apathy and coma to some or all facets of delirium; cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation and sudden death; hypocalcemia which is responsive only to Mg therapy; and hypokalemia which is not easily nor completely corrected without Mg therapy. The diversity of etiologies and the multiplicity of manifestations result in confusion and controversy. The documentation of normal renal function is absolutely necessary for maximum doses. The order of magnitude of dose is 1.0 meq Mg/kg on day 1, and 0.3 to 0.5 mEq/kg per day for 3 to 5 days. In emergencies such as convulsions or ventricular arrhythmias, a bolus injection of 1.0 gm (8.1 meq) of MgSO 4 is indicated. Therapy of Mg deficiency in the presence of renal insufficiency requires smaller doses and frequent monitoring. Complete repletion occurs slowly.",

      "abstract": "The management of acute extrapyramidal effects (EPEs) induced by antipsychotic drugs is reviewed. EPEs associated with antipsychotics include acute dystonias, pseudoparkinsonism, and akathisia. Acute dystonias consist of abnormal muscle spasms and postures and usually occur three to five days after antipsychotic therapy begins or the dosage is increased. Acute dystonias should be treated with anticholinergic medications or benzodiazepines. Antipsychotic-induced pseudoparkinsonism has the same clinical appearance as idiopathic parkinsonism. Symptoms generally appear within the first three months. Pseudoparkinsonism is managed by lowering the anti-psychotic dosage or by adding an anticholinergic agent or a mantadine; switching to a low-potency agent or an atypical antipsychotic may also help. Akathisia is characterized by subjective feelings of restlessness and anxiety and objective signs of motor activity, such as inability to sit still. This EPE appears days to weeks after antipsychotic exposure begins and can be difficult to manage. If reduction of the antipsychotic dosage or a switch to a less potent antipsychotic is not practical or effective, an anticholinergic, beta-blocker, or benzodiazepine may be added. Lipophilic beta-blockers, especially propranolol and metoprolol, appear to be the most effective treatments. Anticholinergic agents are commonly given to prevent acute dystonias, especially in high-risk patients, but long-term prophylaxis is controversial. Atypical antipsychotics may have less potential to induce EPEs. Options in the management of antipsychotic-associated EPEs include using the lowest effective dosage of antipsychotic, treating the reactions with medications, and changing the antipsychotic to one with less potential for inducing EPEs.",

      "abstract": "We present diagnostic criteria for mal de débarquement syndrome (MdDS) for inclusion into the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders. The criteria include the following: 1] Non-spinning vertigo characterized by an oscillatory perception (‘rocking,’ ‘bobbing,’ or ‘swaying’) present continuously or for most of the day; 2] Onset occurs within 48 hours after the end of exposure to passive motion, 3] Symptoms temporarily reduce with exposure to passive motion (e.g. driving), and 4] Symptoms persist for &gt;48 hours. MdDS may be designated as “in evolution,” if symptoms are ongoing but the observation period has been less than 1 month; “transient,” if symptoms resolve at or before 1 month and the observation period extends at least to the resolution point; or “persistent” if symptoms last for more than 1 month. Individuals with MdDS may develop co-existing symptoms of spatial disorientation, visual motion intolerance, fatigue, and exacerbation of headaches or anxiety. Features that distinguish MdDS from vestibular migraine, motion sickness, and persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD) are reviewed. Motion-moderated oscillatory vertigo can also occur without a motion trigger, typically following another vestibular disorder, a medical illness, heightened psychological stress, or metabolic disturbance. Terminology for this non-motion triggered presentation has been varied as it has features of both MdDS and PPPD. Further research is needed into its phenomenological and biological relationship to MdDS, PPPD, and other vestibular disorders.",

Epilepsy can cause many consequences, such as using long-term antiepileptic drugs.It is important to know when drug administration starts and the right drug selection. The choice of type of drug is mainly based on the type of seizure. Other factors to consider are the age of the patient and the existing comorbidities. In the course of efforts to achieve seizure free, sometimes the addition of drugs or drug substitution is needed. Absolute drug substitution is done if serious side effects occur to the patient. The other indication of drug substitution is if there is no improvement in the frequency and severity of the seizure.After a seizure-free period is reached, the next problem is when to stop the drug. Discontinuation of the drug has the consequence of the risk of recurrent seizures. But on the other hand, the cessation of AED in some cases corrects the side effects that arise from the drug. Some literatures suggest the termination of OAE begins after 3 years of seizure free. But when referring to the definition of epilepsy issued by ILAE in 2014, that epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who have remained seizure-free for the last 10 years, with no seizure medicines for the last 5 years, then the cessation of the drug is carried out after 5 years of seizure-free period.",

      "title": "Late Onset Depression",
      "abstract": "In the older population, one of the serious health concerns that are associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) is a depressive disorder. Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

      "abstract": "The World Health Organization reported a lifetime prevalence of 2.4% for BD-I, BD-II and sub-threshold types of bipolar disorder (BD). Depressive episodes are more common than manic episodes for many BD patients. Studies show that depressive mood persists in 2/3 of life, even if they are under treatment. It may be difficult to diagnose BD in the event of depression in the first episode. The correct diagnosis and the treatment can be delayed for 6-8 years, and even longer if disorder starts in adolescence. It is reported that 40% of the patients who were initially diagnosed as unipolar were later diagnosed as BD. The features that enable us to diagnose BD depressive episode: 1) family history of BD or psychosis 2) early onset with depression 3) cyclothymic temperament characteristics 4) four or more depressive episodes in 10 years 5) agitation, anger, insomnia, irritability, excessive talkativeness or other 'mixed' or hypomanic features or psychotic symptoms during depressive episode, 6) clinical 'worsening' caused by the appearance of mixed symptoms after AD treatment 7) suicidal thoughts and attempts 8) substance abuse 9) hypersomnia in the depressive episode or sleeping too much during the day, overeating, psychomotor agitation. The number of studies conducted on BD depressive treatment is limited, the information was obtained by excluding this group from the studies or by compiling the information obtained from the treatment of unipolar depression. In this review, acute and maintenance treatment of the depressive episodes of BD will be discussed according to the treatment algorithms.",

The aim of defining diagnostic criteria of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo is to help clinicians to understand the terminology related to orthostatic dizziness/vertigo and to distinguish orthostatic dizziness/vertigo due to global brain hypoperfusion from that caused by other etiologies. Diagnosis of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo requires: A) five or more episodes of dizziness, unsteadiness or vertigo triggered by arising or present during upright position, which subsides by sitting or lying down; B) orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia syndrome or syncope documented on standing or during head-up tilt test; and C) not better accounted for by another disease or disorder. Probable hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo is defined as follows: A) five or more episodes of dizziness, unsteadiness or vertigo triggered by arising or present during upright position, which subsides by sitting or lying down; B) at least one of the following accompanying symptoms: generalized weakness/tiredness, difficulty in thinking/concentrating, blurred vision, and tachycardia/palpitations; and C) not better accounted for by another disease or disorder. These diagnostic criteria have been derived by expert consensus from an extensive review of 90 years of research on hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo, postural hypotension or tachycardia, and autonomic dizziness. Measurements of orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate are important for the screening and documentation of orthostatic hypotension or postural tachycardia syndrome to establish the diagnosis of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo.",

There are very few reports of withdrawal reactions following discontinuation of clomipramine since it has not been in use in the US until recently. 2 patients with withdrawal symptoms following discontinuation of clomipramine are presented. A 45-year-old man had general somatic symptoms, including headache, myalgia, weakness, fatigue (flu-like syndrome) and nervousness and insomnia after clomipramine, 75 mg/d, had been discontinued abruptly. All symptoms disappeared without treatment after 3 days. A 47-year-old woman presented mainly with severe insomnia, anxiety, agitation, jitteriness and tension after discontinuing a low dose of 25 mg/d of clomipramine. Symptoms disappeared after she started self-treatment with 50 mg/d of the drug. It is important to differentiate withdrawal symptoms from relapse of the primary psychiatric disorder.",

Discontinuation symptoms are those that are followed by the suspension or reduction of a medication measure. They are high limitated, reversible by the drug’s reintroduction and they cannot be explained by recurrence of the disruption to which the medication was prescribed. These symptoms do not imply the dependence in medicines. Antidepressants, especially tricyclics, are known for being associated to a group of common symptoms during the discontinuation. These symptoms includes: gastric intestinal disruption and/or general factors(nauseas, vomits, abdominal pain, diarrhea, anorexia, shiverrings, malaise, weakness, tiredness, myalgias, cephalea) initial or avarege insomnia, frequently followed by dreams and/or vivid nightmares pain attacks and delirious abnormal movements(acathisia, Parkinson’s disease). The discontinuation symptoms of ive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are several, and the most commons are generalized malaise, nauseas, cephalea, lethargy, anxiety, paresthesias, confusion, tremors, sudorese, insomnia, irritability and memory disorders. The objective of this thesis is to effect a revision of the medical literature with regard to the discontinued syndrome of antidepressants, its prevalence and main symptoms. As a result, it was found a large prevalence of discontinuation symptoms, such of TCAs as of SSRIs. Among them, the ones of shorter middle life, such as paroxetine, have more probability to cause discontinuation symptoms. The employed method consists in a survey carried out by MEDLINE in indexed medical magazines. Through this revision, it is conclude that the discontinuation symptoms of antidepressants are frequent and it can lead to a refusal of the medical treatment.

These include impaired attention and concentration (often due to preoccupation with morbid or worrying thoughts); anxiety, which usually accompanies depression; irritability; agitation or retardation; fatigue after sleepless nights; and weakness due to insufficient food intake. In addition, depressed patients may take risks with little regard to the consequences, make suicidal gestures or attempts that go wrong, and take alcohol or other substances that impair functioning to relieve distress. In keeping with these considerations are the reductions in performance in tests of cognitive and psychomotor function in depressed patients.1\n\nIf depression causes or contributes to accidents in these ways then therisk of accidents might be expected to fall as the disorder improves in response to treatment with antidepressant drugs (or other treatment). On the other hand, the unwanted effects of antidepressants may adversely affect cognitive and psychomotor function (especially in those with pre-existing cerebral impairment), thereby increasing the risk of accidents. This is particularly the case in patients who do not respond to treatment and thus are impaired by both the depression and the drug.

      "abstract": "Five cases of dependence on popular analgesics containing barbiturates as the active ingredient have been presented. In all of these cases the patient developed the habit of using the drugs in the second or third decade of life in order to accomplish relief from headache. A rapid increase in tolerance took place in a few months, with most of the patients eventually requiring several times the usual dose. Symptoms of chronic intoxication were often milder than those with other habituating drugs. No antisocial acts as a result of the abuse were observed. Headaches as a manifestation of chronic intoxication may be considered to have played a role in establishing analgesic dependence. The abstinence syndrome developed a few hours after withdrawal: a generalized convulsion occurred first, followed by various disturbances of consciousness and then by a hallucinatory-delusional state. These symptoms cleared up in three days to a week, while a corresponding course was followed by the EEG findings. Withdrawal symptoms didn't appear at the time when allopyrabital as the active ingredient of popular analgesic preparations was replaced with cyclopyrabital but did appear in four cases at the very time when bromvalerylurea was substituted as the active principle of these preparations. Even at that time such a syndrome was not manifested in one case, suggesting the possibility of a cross-reaction of allobarbital and cyclo-barbital and of barbiturate and bromvalerylurea.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The withdrawal syndromes after discontinuance of alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedative drugs, such as chloral and paraldehyde, are all similar. The severity of a withdrawal reaction is largely determined by the daily dose, the duration of administration and the rate of fall of the drug levels after withdrawal, as well as the propensity of the individual patient. The time course of a withdrawal reaction is determined by the drug's clearance. Alcohol has a half‐life of a few hours; withdrawal symptoms may develop within 6–8 hours of abstinence and convulsions in 12–48 hours. After discontinuance of short‐ or medium‐acting barbiturates (half‐life 8–40 hours) symptoms may develop in 1–3 days, followed by convulsions and delirium after 3–8 days. Symptoms and seizures may develop in the 1–10 days after withdrawal of benezodiazepines. In patients with no prior history of epilepsy the types of seizures most commonly induced by drug withdrawal are generalized convulsions, but partial seizures are not uncommon if there is a focal cerebral lesion, or a previous history of partial seizures. Paroxysmal activity and photosensitivity may occur after barbiturate withdrawal in non‐epileptics, more commonly in severe withdrawal reactions. Similar EEG changes may be seen after alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal, but photosensitivity does not appear to have been shown to be a feature of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Depresija je cesto nedijagnosticirana i nelijecena u starijih osoba cemu pridonosi mit da je depresivnost uobicajena u osoba starije životne dobi i prirodna reakcija na promjene koje starija životna dob nosi.Uz uobicajene simptome depresije prema MKB-10 Međunarodnoj klasifikaciji bolesti i srodnih zdravstvenih problema, kod osoba starije životne dobi postoje specificni dodatni simptomi: a) pritužbe na bolove, umor, gubitak apetita, poteskoce usnivanja i prosnivanja, tjeskoba, palpitacije ; b) razdražljivost, promjene raspoloženja, konstantne pritužbe, nista sto se ucini za osobu nije dovoljno dobro ; c) poteskoce u koncentraciji i pamcenju, pretjeran osjecaj tuge, nemogucnost uživanja u ranijim aktivnostima i d) pricanje o beskorisnosti ne vrijedi vise nikome. U klinickoj slici u starijih osoba u odnosu na mlađe cesce su prisutni: agitacija, psihomotorna retardacija, hipohondrijaza/somatizacije, histrionsko ponasanje, bitno smanjenje unosa hrane i tekucine te pseudodemencija. Dijagnosticki postupci obuhvacaju obavezno uz anamnezu i heteroanamnezu, MMSE, tjelesni pregled, EKG, laboratorijske pretrage + dodatne dijagnosticke pretrage - određivanje vitamina BI 2, folne kiseline, Fe, hormona stitnjace, EEG te CT/MR mozga. Terapijske preporuke: Lijecenje treba zapoceti niskom dozom (pola pocetne doze u odraslih osoba) i polagano titrirati. Lijek prvog izbora je iz skupine SIPPS jer ga starije osobe dobro podnose, a dokazana im je ucinkovitost kod depresija u osoba starije životne dobi. Ako uz maksimalnu dozu ne dođe do zadovoljavajuceg poboljsanja, potrebno je promijeniti lijek unutar skupine SIPPS-a. Sljedeci je korak promjena lijeka u antidepresiv iz skupine inhibitora ponovne pohrane serotonina i noradrenalina. U slucaju rezistencije i kžd prisutnih psihoticnih simptoma dodaju se antipsihotik i stabilizator ri%položenja. Kod jetrenih ostecenja biramo tianeptin i mirzaten. Kod izrazito suicidalnih pacijenta može se dodati klozapin u vrlo niskoj dozi od 6, 25 mg u vecernjoj dozi. Pocetne doze i raspon doza antidepresiva u starijih osoba iznosi Vl- Vi doze za mlade odrasle osobe. Prikaz slucaja: Bolesnica u dobi 76 godina, lijecena u sedam navrata u KB Vrapce pod dijagnozama granicnog poremecaja licnosti, vaskularnedemencijenakonpreboljelog CVI-a i vaskularne depresije. Sklona je dramaticnim demonstrativnim ispadima, somatizacijama i manipulativnom parasuicidalno'm ponasanju. Inace osjetljiva je na psihofarmake zbog vaskularnog parkinsonizma. Znacajno je da unatoc poboljsanju raspoloženja zbog primijenjene diferentne antidepresivne terapije (duloksetinom i mirzatenom) pacijenticu nije bilo moguce otpustiti iz bolnice, a da u vrlo kratkom periodu ne uslijedi rehospitalizacija zbog manipulativnog parasuicidalnog ponasanja zbog nezadovoljstva smjestajem. Ishod i tijek samog lijecenja vaskularne depresije kod ove pacijentice određuje i otežava ipak primarni poremecaj u strukturi licnosti uz pocetnu vaskularnu demenciju, a izbor antidepresiva ogranicava vaskularni parkinsonizam.",

      "abstract": "RESUMEN La cefalea por uso excesivo de medicamentos (CUEM) se define como la presencia de cefalea diaria o casi diaria (15 dias o mas de evolucion), que se produce en pacientes con antecedente de cefalea primaria que usan excesivamente medicamentos. Esta entidad esta asociada a coomorbilidad psiquiatrica, por lo que las caracteristicas clinicas se hacen mas complejas con el paso del tiempo. El manejo fundamental se basa en la suspension del medicamento sobre el que se centra el abuso (analgesicos, ergotamina, triptanes y opioides). Sin embargo, es necesario tomar en consideracion que la suspension de estos medicamentos puede asociarse a otros problemas como “cefalea de rebote”, sindrome de abstinencia o convulsiones epilepticas; incrementando las tasas de recaida en estos pacientes. PALABRAS CLAVES. Cefalea. Medicamentos, Cefalea de tipo tensional, Trastornos migranosos, Cefaleas secundarias. (Martha R. Alvarez S, Ronald G. Garcia G, Federico Arturo Silva S. Cefalea por uso excesivo de medicamentos: implicaciones clinicas y terapeuticas . Acta Neurol Colomb 2010;26:195-201). SUMMARY The medication overuse headache (MOH) is define as daily or almost daily headache (15 days or more) in patients with history of primary headache who takes excessive medications. This pathology is associated with psychiatric conditions, reason why with the time the clinical characteristics become more complex. The basic treatment is stopping the medication (analgesic, ergotamine, triptans or opioids), but this could bring us another problem called “rebound headache”, withdrawal sindrome or epileptic convulsions. These symptoms could increase the relapsing rate on this patients.",

Other uses of botulinum toxin type A that are widely known but not approved by FDA include spastic disorders associated with injury or disease of the central nervous system including trauma, stroke, multiple sclerosis, or cerebral palsy and focal dystonias affecting the limbs, face, jaw, or vocal cords. Treatment and prevention of chronic headache and chronic musculoskeletal pain are emerging uses for botulinum toxin type A.Many of the conditions for which botulinum toxin type A has been explored are common and difficult to treat. Temporary improvement in symptoms is associated with botulinum toxin type A injection, and repeat treatment often is required. The drug is well tolerated and has a wide margin of safety.",

      "title": "First Episode Psychosis Following COVID-19 Vaccination: a Case Report.",
      "abstract": "Vaccines are crucial to ending the COVID-19 pandemic. An mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine can cause mild to moderate side effects. A number of cases of cardiac, gastrointestinal, and psychiatric side effects have been reported as rare side effects associated with the COVID-19 vaccine. This article presents a patient, who after the second injection of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, immediately developed anxiety, nonspecific fear, and insomnia as the prodromal phase of psychosis. Starting from the second week, the patient manifested delusions of persecution, delusions of influence, thoughts insertion, and delusional behaviour, culminating in the suicide attempt. The duration of psychosis was eight weeks, and symptom reduction was observed only after the gradual administration of antipsychotics over four weeks. The investigations of the patient did not support any structural changes of the brain, any severe medical conditions, a neurological abnormality, a confusion or a state of unconsciousness or alterations in laboratory tests. Psychosis due to the use of alcohol or psychoactive substances was excluded. The psychological assessment of the patient demonstrated the endogenous type of thinking, and the patient had schizoid and paranoid personality traits strongly associated with schizophrenia. This case indicates a strong causal relationship between the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine injection and the onset of psychosis. We intend to follow up this case for possible development of schizophrenia and understand that the COVID-19 vaccine could possible play a trigger role in the development of primary psychosis. Longer-term supporting evidence is needed to estimate the prevalence of psychosis following vaccination with the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine.",

      "title": "Generalized Restless Body Syndrome: A case of opioid withdrawal- induced restlessness extending beyond the legs",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Restless leg syndrome (RLS) has been described in those undergoing opioid withdrawal as a factor exacerbating heroin dependence. RLS, however, has not been described as involvingmore than the legs.Therefore, a case of generalized Restless Body Syndrome (RBS) induced by opioid withdrawal is reported. Methods: Case Report: The case involves a 67-year-old male with a history of major depressive disorder, Parkinson's disease, RLS, and chronic pain treated with opioids. Opioid use included hydrocodone/acetaminophen, hydromorphone, fentanyl patch, tramadol, and buprenorphine/naloxone. During opioid detoxification, he experienced new-onset restlessness throughout his body for three days, hindering sleep and prompting constant walking for relief. Restlessness resembled RLS sensations, affecting the thorax, abdomen, back of legs, lower back, arms, and legs, excluding the face. The sensation felt like periodic electric waves, worsened at night or during inactivity, and improved with walking. Similar sensations occurred during opioid or buprenorphine/naloxone withdrawal, particularly when reducing buprenorphine/naloxone to 1mg/day, and resolved upon reintroduction of buprenorphine/naloxone. Results: Neurological Examination: Recent recall of 2 out of 4 objects in three minutes without improvement with reinforcement. Facial akinesia, decreased blink frequency, 2+ cogwheeling in both upper extremities, Stooped shuffling gait, and resting tremor in both upper extremities were noted. Neuropsychiatric Test: Go-No-Go Test: 4/6 (abnormal). Beck Depression Inventory Type-II score: 9 (Minimal depression). Michigan Alcohol Screening Test: 35 (Problem drinker). Center for Neurologic Study Lability Scale: 8 (average). Discussion: The semiology of RBS exhibits similarities to RLS but involves additional areas such as the upper extremities, thorax, and back. While this could indicate a variant of RLS, it could also be a distinct condition. It has been observed that opioid withdrawal can trigger RLS and cause jerking movements in both upper extremities. Alternatively, this may not be RLS but rather a form of serotonin syndrome induced by opioid use, including fentanyl, and can result in generalized myoclonus. Although RLS associated with opioid withdrawal is well-documented, the underlying mechanisms responsible for its extension throughout the body, including the neck, remain unclear. One possibility is a generalized polyneuropathy affecting the upper limbs and lower extremities, particularly in iron deficiency. The coexistence of Parkinson's disease in this patient may have increased their susceptibility to RBS. Alternatively, dopamine replacement therapy used to treat Parkinson's disease may have rendered them more prone to abnormal movements, such as choreiform movements or sensations interpreted as a restless body. The absence of facial involvement suggests that the trigeminal spinothalamic tract was unaffected. It is plausible that variants of RBS may occur in individuals undergoing opioid withdrawal, potentially necessitating low-dose opioids for treatment. Therefore, evaluation of RBS as part of the assessment for opioid withdrawal is warranted.",

      "title": "[Clinical practice guideline. Diagnosis and treatment of insomnia in the elderly].",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is the difficulty to initiate or to maintain sleep. It also has to do with waking up too early at least for a month. A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.El insomnio es la dificultad para conciliar o mantener el sueño; también consiste en despertar demasiado temprano al menos durante un mes. Un paciente con insomnio presenta consecuencias diurnas como fatiga, somnolencia, deterioro de la memoria, cambios en el estado de ánimo, en la concentración, así como en su desempeño social o familiar, entre otros. La asociación de este padecimiento con la salud física y mental es importante debido al impacto que tiene en la calidad y la esperanza de vida de los que lo padecen. Desafortunadamente, el insomnio suele pasar desapercibido o no tratarse, lo cual contribuye al empeoramiento de condiciones médicas y psiquiátricas. Esto se acentúa más en los adultos mayores, grupo por demás vulnerable. En relación con el tratamiento se recomienda aplicar la siguiente combinación: 1) la búsqueda y el manejo de causas secundarias de insomnio, 2) alguna terapia no farmacológica que incluya medidas de higiene del sueño, 3) tratamiento farmacológico. No es recomendable comenzar el tratamiento con un hipnótico sin haber descartado fármacos o enfermedades que provoquen o exacerben este padecimiento. Tampoco se recomienda el uso de neurolépticos, melatonina, antihistamínicos o benzodiacepinas de vida media larga. Las consecuencias incluyen limitación en las actividades de la vida diaria, pérdida de la funcionalidad, deterioro en la calidad de vida, incremento en la morbimortalidad, además del empeoramiento de las condiciones crónicas prexistentes.",

      "title": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper airway collapse during sleep that is highlighted by a reduction in, or complete cessation of, airflow despite documented on going inspiratory efforts. Due to the lack of adequate alveolar ventilation that results from the upper airway narrowing, oxygen saturation may drop and partial pressure of CO2 may occasionally increase. The events are mostly terminated by arousals. Clinical consequences are excessive daytime sleepiness related to the sleep disruption. Minimal diagnostic criteria have been defined for OSAHS. Patients should have excessive daytime sleepiness that can not be better explained by other factors, or experience two or more of the following symptoms, again that are not better explained by other factors: choking or gasping during sleep; recurrent awakenings from sleep; un-refreshing sleep; daytime fatigue; and impaired concentration. All patients should have more than five obstructed breathing events per hour during sleep. An obstructive apnea or hypopnoea can be defined as an event that lasts for ≥ 10 s and is characterized by an absence or a decrease from baseline in the amplitude of a valid measure of breathing during sleep that either reaches >50% with an oxygen desaturation of 3% or an arousal (alternatively a 30% reduction with 4% desaturation). The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends these definitions. The Task Force of the AASM also states that there are common pathogenic mechanisms for obstructive apnea syndrome, central apnea syndrome, sleep hypoventilation syndrome and Cheyne-Stokes breathing. It was more preferable to discuss each of these separately; although, they could be placed under the common denominator of \"sleep-disordered breathing syndrome\". The definition of OSAHS using two components, daytime symptoms and breathing pattern disturbances during sleep, may suggest that there is a tight correlation between the two. However, unfortunately this is not the case. The breathing pattern abnormalities, mostly described by an Apnea/Hypopnoea Index (AHI), only weakly correlate with quantified measures of sleepiness, such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). This probably means that interindividual sensitivity, with some individuals coping better with sleep fragmentation than others, does compromise the relationship between the AHI and daytime sleepiness scores. In addition, epidemiological studies show a broad range of sleepiness in the general population. Obviously, epidemiological studies investigating the prevalence of OSAHS are all biased by the lack of a uniform definition. The prevalence of an AHI of >5 events · h-1 in a general population (without taking into account symptoms of sleepiness) has previously been estimated to be 24% in a male population. When symptoms of sleepiness were also taken into account, the prevalence decreased to 4% in males and 2% in females.",

Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

      "title": "DSM-5 substance use disorder: how conceptual missteps weakened the foundations of the addictive disorders field",
      "abstract": "DSM-5, following the recommendations of its substance-related disorders workgroup, radically reformulated the diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder (SUD). The changes have generated considerable controversy and concern, and are here reviewed and evaluated. DSM-IV included two substance use disorders, substance dependence and substance abuse. Dependence attempted directly to capture the concept of addiction as a psychiatric disorder, understood as impaired-control use. (The label addiction itself was narrowly rejected in earlier DSM revisions due to its purportedly pejorative nature.) Dependence diagnosis required any three or more of seven possible symptoms indicating impaired-control substance use, including two physiological dependence symptoms (tolerance, withdrawal) and five behavioural symptoms (giving up activities, continuing use despite harmful physical or psychological effects, trying to stop but cannot, taking larger amounts than intended, spending much time obtaining and taking the substance). Abuse diagnosis represented problematic use and required any one or more of four possible substance-related symptoms, including hazardous use (most commonly, driving while intoxicated), interpersonal problems (e.g., arguing with spouse), failure to fulfill role obligations at work, school, or home, and legal problems. 'Abuse' has long been a questionable disorder category. The 'dependence syndrome' model of addiction as impaired control over use 1, 2 is generally accepted as the most plausible conceptual justification for understanding addiction as a true psychiatric disorder rather than as moral weakness, social deviance, or rational choice. Since DSM-III-R, DSM diagnostic criteria for substance use disorders have been based on this model. Consistent with the model, the original intention was for 'dependence' to be the sole addiction disorder category 3. However, pragmatic concerns about having a diagnostic label for anyone needing help with substance use overrode validity concerns, and the abuse category was included in successive DSM editions until DSM-5. DSM's 'abuse' criteria clearly conflated social deviance with addictive pathology. ICD's parallel but narrower 'harmful use' category rejects face-invalid abuse criteria such as hazardous use and insists on substance-caused physical or mental health problems, thus at least ensuring medical need for intervention. Two rationales have been used to justify the DSM's 'abuse' category despite its face invalidity. First, the dependence syndrome model portrays addiction as a 'biaxial' concept with two components, an impaired-control motivational dysfunction and a harmful consequence component involving negative social, psychological, and physical consequences of excessive use 1. The model asserts that harmful consequences by themselves do not imply addiction (e.g., heavy recreational drinking without alcoholism can cause liver cirrhosis or automobile accidents). Nonetheless, the components are sometimes interpreted as distinct categories of psychiatric disorder: impaired-control use (dependence/addiction) and a residual category of harmful use without dependence (abuse). However, as both the DSM-5 definition of mental disorder and the 'harmful dysfunction' analysis of mental disorder 4, 5 make clear, harm without an underlying dysfunction is not a medical disorder. The biaxial conception, properly understood, requi-res both impaired control and consequent harm as components of every diagnosis of substance use disorder 6 and thus provides no support for an 'abuse' disorder category. Second, it is commonly claimed that abuse is mild or prodromal dependence, thus justifying its disorder status. This empirical claim has been amply disconfirmed. Substance abuse—however worthy of intervention—does not predict later dependence at substantial rates and does not correlate with validators in the same pattern as dependence 7. Abuse is also highly contextually anchored; for example, a large percentage of abuse diagnoses are due to driving under the influence of alcohol, which occurs at increased rates among those of higher socioeconomic status simply because they have automobiles 8, 9. To its credit, DSM-5 finally eliminated the substance abuse category. However, rather than acknowledging that the abuse category lacks conceptual validity as an addictive disorder and placing it in the Z Codes for non-disordered problems often treated by clinicians, DSM-5 took another route. Much of the abuse category was assimilated to dependence, in keeping with the empirically discredited 'mild or prodromal dependence' account of abuse. The workgroup relied heavily in its deliberations on factor analyses and item response theory analyses of abuse and dependence symptom items, most of which fail to discriminate abuse symptoms from dependence symptoms as distinct clusters or syndromes. However, researchers have long noted that the DSM dependence items are poorly worded to draw the dependence/abuse distinction among the highly correlated dependence and abuse items 10. Nonetheless, rather than taking the conceptual implausibility of the technical results as confirming the need for rewording and reevaluating the items and strengthening the validity of the dependence criteria, the workgroup interpreted the technical results as refuting the idea of there being abuse that is not a form of dependence: 'The \"abuse category\" has been eliminated from the proposed structure because of the lack of data to support an intermediate state between drug use and drug addiction' (11, p. 867). The implication was that abuse symptoms (including, e.g., hazardous use, despite all the contrary considerations) could be considered variants of dependence symptoms and could validly be retained as impaired-control measures. Conceptual grounding in the dependence syndrome model was thus abandoned in favor of obeisance to a literal reading of the technical results. The consequences for the decision process are vividly presented in the following description by a workgroup member of a scene that could be right out of one of Solomon Asch's social psychology experiments in which group pressure causes an individual to affirm things that are plainly false: 'I was one of the last holdouts against combining the abuse and dependence criteria because, to me, the dependence process and its consequences do seem conceptually distinct. However, as I looked around the table at my colleagues in our in-person meeting on this issue and considered the overwhelming abundance of evidence in favor of combining the abuse and dependence criteria, I found I no longer had grounds to hold to my position' (12, p. 703). In fact, the evidence for homogeneity of dependence and abuse was not 'overwhelming'. The failure of a technical method to clearly discriminate two things, or the demonstration that two things are intercorrelated in ways that allow them to fit a unidimensional mathematical model, is not a demonstration that two things do not exist. It is only a demonstration that the specific method of analysis using the specific selected measures does not discriminate them if they do exist—and in this case, we have strong independent clinical and personal evidence that the two entities, addiction and harmful use, do exist. Unidimensionality of item response analysis results can mean many things other than that there exists only one entity varying in severity 13, and no far-reaching conclusion can be drawn before alternative hypotheses are systematically tested, a task not undertaken by the workgroup. Moreover, there are many other sources of potential evidence that were not given weight. Observing that DSM-5′s decisions were based on a highly selective citing of evidence, Edwards concluded that the workgroup's reconceptualization 'goes against clinical experience, which suggests that people can develop destructive and disruptive drinking behavior without clinical symptoms of dependence' (14, p. 701), as for example in college students' harmful binge drinking independent of addiction. The workgroup's premature embrace of specific technical analyses to override compelling clinical and conceptual realities brings to mind Wittgenstein's famous admonition: 'In psychology there are experimental methods and conceptual confusion… The existence of the experimental method makes us think we have the means of solving the problems that trouble us; though problem and method pass one another by' (15, p. 232; emphasis in original). DSM-5 thus moved the abuse criteria, with all their validity problems, into an expanded category renamed 'substance use disorder' (SUD). Only the 'legal problems' criterion was abandoned because it was rarely used and plainly a matter of social deviance, not pathology. Additionally, a new 'craving' criterion was added both because craving is intuitively a phenomenological counterpart to impaired control and because it is an attractive target of pharmacological intervention. With 11 possible symptoms rather than 7, the idea was that SUD represents an enlarged and more valid impaired-control category with dimensional structure ranging from mild to severe cases; 2 or 3 symptoms is 'mild', 4 or 5 'moderate', and 6+ 'severe' SUD. Mechanically combining existing abuse and dependence criteria in SUD without reformulation exacerbated a problem of symptom criterion redundancy, weakening validity. Criteria overlap in meaning so that it is possible to satisfy multiple criteria and spuriously reach diagnostic threshold due to just one actual feature. For example, one can imagine satisfying the three symptoms of failure to fulfill role obligations, use despite social/interpersonal problems, and activities given up or reduced, all based on the same problem, lessened marital engagement due to time spent drinking with one's friends. Yet this one feature has low face validity for indicating impaired-use disorder. With so many more symptom options in SUD than in the former dependence category, it becomes much easier for an individual to meet three criteria. Thus, one might think that to maintain validity, the threshold number of symptoms needed for diagnosis would be raised to a higher number. This would be especially true because the added abuse symptoms appear to have less validity than the former dependence symptoms in identifying impaired-control dysfunction. Thus, the number of symptoms needed to have confidence that there is a dysfunction should be increased. The workgroup did the opposite; they lowered the number of symptoms required for diagnosis to 2. This is probably the most controversial substance-related change made by the DSM-5. If one considers SUD an expanded impaired-control addiction category analogous to dependence, then this change dramatically increases—indeed, more than doubles—the estimated prevalence of addiction. DSM-5′s SUD revision with its 2-symptom diagnostic threshold allows continued diagnosis of those with two abuse symptoms (e.g., drives under the influence and argues with spouse about it) and those with one abuse and one dependence symptom (e.g., has developed some tolerance to alcohol and drives under the influence). Moreover, diagnosis newly applies to those with two dependence symptoms (e.g., increased tolerance and drinks larger amounts than intended), dubbed by the literature as 'diagnostic orphans' as if they had been incorrectly abandoned rather than purposely placed below a plausible diagnostic threshold. However, studies show that these groups resemble former abuse cases more than dependence cases in prognosis. In terms of addiction as impaired control, the evidence is that probably they are mostly false positives, as validity evaluation of DSM-5 SUD suggests. DSM-5 has been heavily criticized for the lowered SUD diagnostic threshold. Before looking at the rationales offered for this change, one might ask: 'What did this effort yield in terms of increases in diagnostic validity and clinical utility?' Clinical utility for now appears weakened, primarily because virtually all treatment studies have used dependence samples. Consequently, nothing is known about what works with the much larger and more heterogeneous SUD category. Predictive studies have generally shown quite different long-term outcomes for members of the DSM-IV dependence category and the added SUD cases. Nor do the 'mild' SUD cases correspond to the former abuse cases, so that no simple translation is possible. More importantly for long-term scientific purposes, recent analyses present a markedly disappointing picture regarding validity 6. Looking at alcohol use disorder (AUD), which is by far the largest SUD category, DSM-5 AUD provides no gain at all in predictive validity or correlation with crucial validators relative to DSM-IV combined alcohol dependence and abuse. For example, DSM-5 AUD is not significantly different from DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse in levels of standard lifetime validators including episode duration, number of episodes, frequent heavy drinking, number of symptoms, suicidal ideation, service use, and family history. One-year validator results are similarly without validity gains. Alternatively, if one construes SUD as an expanded impaired-control category and compares DSM-5 AUD to DSM-IV alcohol dependence, then DSM-5 AUD represents a major loss of validity 6. DSM-5 AUD is significantly lower than DSM-IV alcohol dependence on every one of the above-mentioned validators except episode duration. Depending on the baseline of comparison, DSM-5 AUD shows no validity gain or substantially decreased validity relative to DSM-IV. Concerns that the threshold of two or more criteria is too low…(e.g., that it produces an overly heterogeneous group or that those at low severity levels are not 'true' cases)…were weighed against the competing need to identify all cases meriting intervention, including milder cases, for example, those presenting in primary care. Construed one way, this argument is a textbook example of begging the question. Mild cases of a disorder are still true cases, and no one is objecting to identifying mild cases of addiction. The objection is that the added cases—which are indeed symptomatically mild—are not mild cases of addictive disorder but rather not true cases of addictive disorder at all. Just as sneezing due to dust in the air is not a mild case of a cold, developing some tolerance to alcohol over time from social and mealtime drinking and driving home from social occasions after drinking is not generally mild addictive disorder. The workgroup's reply that we need to identify all cases including the mild ones begs the question of validity. However, the explanation was probably intended as asserting a pragmatic point, that although the added cases may not be true cases of impaired control, for practical reasons we must be able to diagnose them as disorders to help them. The problem with this pragmatic argument is that it abandons validity as the criterion for category formulation, thereby undermining the integrity of research needed for developing more effective methods for helping those with true addictions. When there was a separate category of abuse, the pragmatic argument was more compelling because the invalidity was segregated in its own category and scientific study could focus on dependence. The present approach leaves the field with no reasonably valid target category for scientific study. The reality is that no one set of criteria is capable of both identifying the addicted and identifying all who could use help for substance use. Identifying the latter group while talking as if one is identifying the former group creates a state of confusion worse than before and presents an obstacle to scientific progress. [T]he substance use disorders criteria represent a dimensional condition with no natural threshold….To avoid a marked perturbation in prevalence without justification, the work group sought a threshold for DSM-5 substance use disorders that would yield the best agreement with the prevalence of DSM-IV substance abuse and dependence disorders combined. This argument offers an example of the classic 'sorites' or 'balding man' fallacy—the fallacy of inferring from the fact there is no sharp boundary between a concept and its opposite that therefore the distinction can be drawn anywhere one likes. The fact that the division between addiction and non-addiction is fuzzy does not imply that the threshold is entirely arbitrary and can be placed to accomplish such extraneous goals as preserving prevalence rates generated by other criteria that have been acknowledged to be invalid. A fuzzy concept can still have many reasonably clear cases, and the boundary should be drawn with an eye to avoiding the classification of conceptually relatively clear cases on the incorrect side of the distinction. Day shades into night, and childhood into adulthood, and the boundaries are fuzzy, but day/night and child/adult still have clear cases that make these vague distinctions extremely useful, and despite the vagueness, there are ways of drawing the distinctions that would be manifestly incorrect. If one can arbitrarily draw a concept's boundary anywhere one wishes, one has in effect discarded the distinction. That, I suggest, is in effect what DSM-5 did with the concept of 'addiction' when it arbitrarily placed the SUD threshold at 2 of 11 symptoms to achieve the goal of preserving earlier prevalence rates, without careful attention to the face conceptual validity of the cases that would fall on either side of the new threshold. Another argument in defense of the 2-symptom threshold concerns dimensionalization in service of prevention. The lower SUD threshold can be seen as part of DSM-5′s move toward dimensional criteria that allow for diagnosis of prodromal and mild conditions to promote prevention. The question is whether the lower end of the severity dimension represents disorders at all, or whether the risk of disorder is sufficiently high to warrant the massive numbers of additional diagnoses. Challenged to justify the fact that the new criteria will pathologize mild conditions, the workgroup Chair, Charles O'Brien, explained as follows: 'We can treat them earlier. And we can stop them from getting to the point where they're going to need really expensive stuff like liver transplants' (17, p. A11). However, this justification is based on an assumption that study after study has shown to be false, namely, that DSM-IV cases of abuse and dependence orphanhood that are newly classified as SUD are an early stage of dependence and have severe outcomes over time. To take O'Brien's example seriously, the established alcohol consumption risk factor for liver cirrhosis requires heavy drinking for decades, which is unlikely to occur at the milder end of the SUD spectrum. There are about 27 000 yearly U.S. cirrhosis deaths (from all causes, not just alcohol), <0.01% of the population, whereas DSM-5 extends the SUD 'impaired control' label to approximately an additional 7% of the entire population each year (about 21 000 000 people) over and above the 5% or so identified by DSM-IV dependence 6. There is no evidence that the cirrhosis cases come out of the added group in significant numbers, nor that such massive diagnostic overreach is a feasible let alone cost-effective way of addressing the prevention of cirrhosis or identifying those at risk. Putting substance-related symptoms together and calling the result a 'severity dimension' of SUD does not make SUD a construct-valid disorder. Non-disordered conditions can be severe (e.g., pain in childbirth, normal grief, binge drinking upon arrival at college). Moreover, the diagnostic threshold should be the point at which the diagnostician is justified in attributing a disorder (e.g., impaired control) rather than a non-disorder 18. In SUD's polythetic diagnostic criteria set, every symptom is given equal weight in meeting diagnostic threshold requirements, so adding weaker indicators of dysfunction from the former abuse criteria allows ample false positives to arise when the diagnostic threshold is reached by combinations of weak symptoms. The workgroup denied the accusation that the new criteria would add to disorder diagnoses: 'a concern that \"millions more\" would be diagnosed with the DSM-5 threshold is unfounded' (16, p. 841). This answer (which contradicts the 'prevention' argument that presupposes increased diagnosis) disingenuously construes the baseline as DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse, which, by design, DSM-5 SUD matches in prevalence. The critics of course have in mind a comparison to DSM-IV dependence, which was generally considered the 'real' impaired-control category. As noted, many millions more are indeed diagnosed by DSM-5 SUD. The name change from 'dependence' to 'substance use disorder' was justified by the claim that the label 'dependence' confused addiction with 'physiological dependence' consisting of tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. The workgroup argued, correctly, that physiological dependence is an expectable consequence of the body's adaptation to some medications, including opioid pain medication, and not sufficient by itself to imply addiction (i.e., impaired-control use) 19. This understanding was already reflected in DSM-IV's text and its three-symptom dependence threshold which required at least one additional behavioural symptom of impaired control even when tolerance and withdrawal were present. Nonetheless, the workgroup argued that the verbal confusion of 'dependence' with 'physiological dependence' was a problem in pain medicine, where doctors and patients may resist adequate opioid medication for fear of inducing physiological dependence that is misconstrued as addiction. The potential for confusion certainly exists. However, there is no solid evidence that physicians' or patients' reluctance about opioid medication for non-cancer pain was generally based on this verbal confusion. Nevertheless, the urgent, overriding importance of this terminological change to facilitate prescription of opioid medication was emphasized by the workgroup's Chair: 'Of all the changes proposed by the DSM-5 work group, this one consistently is greeted by standing ovations when presented to audiences of physicians with the responsibility for the treatment of pain' (20, p. 705). This emphasis in the DSM-5 revision process represented a major historic misstep. At the time the workgroup was making these arguments, a massive problem of abuse of opioid medication for non-cancer chronic pain was emerging in the United States, with resultant heroin addiction and a startling number of overdose deaths, as well as associated social dislocations reaching into communities where it had rarely been seen before. Earlier arguments that it was safe to extend opioid use to non-cancer pain were clearly overstated ovations by pain physicians notwithstanding. Perhaps some physician and patient caution about prescription opioid painkillers was not such a bad thing after all. The DSM-5 workgroup was blind to this growing problem that, as they deliberated, was reaching epidemic proportions. If the opioid misstep had stopped at a purely terminological change, it would have been minimally impactful on research and clinical diagnosis, but it did not. Recall that DSM-5 lowered the SUD diagnostic threshold from DSM-IV's 3 of 7 symptoms to any 2 of 11 symptoms, including tolerance and withdrawal. Thus, the DSM-5 workgroup actually created the very problem that supposedly they were trying to address; they made it possible to diagnose SUD (i.e., addiction) based on the two physiological dependence symptoms alone, thus potentially confusing physiological adaptation with impaired-control use. This self-created problem conflicted with the goal of facilitating prescription of opioids for pain. An important exception to making a diagnosis of DSM-5 substance use disorder with two criteria pertains to the supervised use of psychoactive substances for medical purposes, including stimulants, cocaine, opioids, nitrous oxide, sedative-hypnotic/anxiolytic drugs, and cannabis in some jurisdictions. These substances can produce tolerance and withdrawal as normal physiological adaptations when used appropriately for supervised medical purposes. Under these conditions, tolerance and withdrawal in the absence of other criteria do not indicate substance use disorders and should not be diagnosed as such. Note that the labeling of withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use of opioids and other medications as 'normal' in order to argue that withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use should not be used as an indicator of SUD involves a potentially misleading equivocation on the meaning of 'normal'. Having withdrawal symptoms when cutting down on opioids is not a normal human condition in the sense of 'non-disordered' and is recognized as a separate category of DSM disorder. Moreover, withdrawal disorder often leads to impaired-control use and so has traditionally been a central indicator of addiction. Withdrawal is 'normal' only in the weak sense of being an expectable reaction as the body adjusts to the presence of the substance. However, many disorders are expectable under certain conditions, such as a broken bone when a certain level of pressure is applied to a limb. Prescribed use may expectably induce the complication of withdrawal disorder, and by itself, this does not imply addiction, but calling it 'normal' and eliminating it from SUD criteria suggest that physicians should not be concerned about it in the context of assessing addiction in patients, and this is far from the case. Equivocation aside, the ad hoc approach of excluding the tolerance and withdrawal symptom criteria only when evaluating SUD in medically supervised substance use has two fatal problems. First, it is conceptually incoherent. If, as the workgroup argued, tolerance and withdrawal are not a use disorder when the drug is prescribed, then they are not a use disorder when the same drug is not prescribed, for the very same reason provided by the workgroup—namely, they do not by themselves imply impaired-control use. Moreover, the workgroup's approach yields the absurdity that changes in laws can cause and 'cure' disorders. For example, the criteria allow the absurdity that if a medical marijuana user having only tolerance and withdrawal symptoms moves from a state where cannabis use is legal and medically supervised to a state where its use is illegal, and continues precisely the same pattern of medical use with the same symptoms, the individual has gone from being non-disordered to being disordered. Even the results of research will differ by locale due to differences in the legal status of various substances. Second, this approach violates the DSM-5′s (and harmful dysfunction analysis') definition of mental disorder, which states that the existence of disorder cannot be merely a matter of deviance or conflict with society. Yet, the only difference between the disordered and the non-disordered under DSM-5′s SUD criteria may be that one is taking the substance in accordance with legal rules while the other is not. This approach makes DSM-5 diagnosis overtly an instrument of social control unrelated to disorder status, the very outcome that the definition of mental disorder was designed to avoid. The most troubling implication of these conceptually misguided features of DSM-5 SUD diagnosis is that, with an opioid abuse epidemic upon us, diagnosing an individual who may be developing an opioid SUD while taking prescribed pain medication is now more difficult than before. Such an individual who is experiencing marked tolerance and withdrawal symptoms (which are excluded from consideration) must display two additional behavioural symptoms to be diagnosed, rather than just the one required by DSM-IV. The timing for such ill-conceived changes could not be worse. An additional issue is that there is a degree of arbitrariness to the workgroup's focus on physiological dependence as a potential source of false-positive addiction diagnoses among individuals taking prescribed medication. It has long been observed that taking prescribed opioids can lead to false-positive versions of many of the behavioural SUD symptoms as well. For example, a rural individual attempting to escape chronic pain may well spend much time and give up other activities to maintain an opioid prescription if the only available pharmacy is in a distant town. It is also clear that craving when confronted with triggers can exist even without impaired-control use—and the workgroup recognized this by allowing craving to persist consistent with an individual being in remission. Again, the workgroup might have spent more effort systematically refining the symptom items to achieve greater conceptual validity. To conclude, I have argued that the concerns about DSM-5 SUD diagnostic criteria are quite justified, and the arguments put forward by the DSM-5 workgroup to address critics' concerns generally spurious. Despite some welcome improvements including the elimination of the abuse category and the clarification of terminology, DSM-5′s substantial changes to SUD diagnosis fail to strengthen validity or clinical utility and diverge markedly from projected ICD-11 criteria. In adding highly face-invalid criteria such as hazardous use and social conflicts to a category that is supposed to represent a motivational dysfunction of impaired control, and then lowering the diagnostic threshold to a level that allows weaker-validity criteria by themselves to qualify for diagnosis, DSM-5 has cast into doubt the hard-fought and still controversial validity of SUD as a category of psychiatric disorder. The changes weaken and even abandon the conceptual foundations of the substance disorders field as part of psychiatry. My analysis presupposes that there is such a thing as impaired control of use that warrants psychiatric diagnosis. This assumption is currently under challenge from a variety of quarters. If this assumption is false, then by all means we should move on to a different conceptualization of the kinds of compulsive harmful substance use that we now conceptualize as addiction. The problem is that the DSM-5 workgroup verbally retained the impaired-control framework while reformulating diagnostic criteria in ways inconsistent with that framework. This undermines the ability to pursue good science addressing the validity of the concept of addiction and of the impaired-control model. If ICD-11 resists the temptation to move toward some of DSM-5′s innovations, it will provide a much-needed alternative approach to addictive disorder diagnosis that could become the field's preferred standard for advancing addiction science.",

      "abstract": "Opioids are drugs that are used to manage wide range of chronic painful diseases. They are classified as broadspectrum analgesics. They are frequently prescribed to manage cancer and chronic pain, post-operative pain among certain other conditions. However, there is a well-known phenomenon of psychological addiction that can develop with the use of opioids leading to prolonged use, abuse and misuse which undermines their clinical efficacy associated with their use. Although in some conditions long-term opioid therapy is needed. According to clinical recommendations, long-term opioid therapy involves taking opioids every day for more than three months. The criteria for defining long-term opioid therapy in clinical settings and research, however, vary. Certain conditions are associated with its long-term use including impaired cognitive effects, sedation, constipation, nausea, vomiting, physical dependence, tolerance, and respiratory depression which are quite common with the opioid treatment. Clinical concerns regarding addiction may hinder appropriate prescribing, resulting in insufficient pain management. Delay in stomach emptying, hyperalgesia, immunologic and hormonal abnormalities, muscular rigidity, and myoclonus are examples of less prevalent effects reported with long-term opioid use. Opioid induced constipation is commonly reported in long-term use and may get severe enough to necessitate stopping the opioids and cause underdosing and insufficient analgesia. Respiratory and sleep disorders also frequently observed in longterm users of opioids. Also, incidence of new episode of depression is quite commonly linked to the chronic use of opioid. The purpose of this research is to review the available information about common conditions associated with long term opioid usage.",

      "title": "Treating Bipolar Mania in the Outpatient Setting: Enlist the Help of Family, Employ Evidence-Based Pharmacologic and Psychotherapeutic Strategies",
      "abstract": "Manic episodes, by definition, are associated with significant social or occupational impairment. (1) Some manic patients are violent or engage in reckless behaviors that can harm themselves or others, such as speeding, disrupting traffic, or playing with fire. When these patients present to a psychiatrist's outpatient practice, involuntary hospitalization might be justified. However, some manic patients, in spite of their elevated, expansive, or irritable mood state, never behave dangerously and might not meet legal criteria for involuntary hospitalization, although these criteria differ from state to state. These patients might see a psychiatrist because manic symptoms such as irritability, talkativeness, and impulsivity are bothersome to their family members but pose no serious danger (Box, page 40). Box Manic, but refusing inpatient treatment Accompanied by her husband and mother, Mrs. W. age 31, is seeking help for insomnia and anxiety. She reports that she has been unable to sleep more than a few hours a night for the last 2 weeks and is having spontaneous panic attacks. Her affect is elevated, she is hyperverbal and loud, and she repeatedly stands up and paces during the interview. Mrs. W's husband tells you that she doesn't sleep. has spent $1,000 in the last week on random items, is calling her friends and her doctors all day and night. and is so easily distracted that she cannot safely take care of their infant. These behaviors are abnormal for Mrs. W when she is well, he reports. but also occurred during a previous manic episode. He says she is doing nothing dangerous and she hasn't voiced any threats of self-harm or violence toward others. Mrs. W's family is concerned about her behavior. Because you are unable to involuntarily commit Mrs. W to a psychiatric hospital. you recommend that she voluntarily check herself into a hospital. Her family strongly supports this idea, but Mrs. W refuses. In this situation, the psychiatrist can strongly encourage the patient to seek voluntary hospitalization or attend a partial hospitalization program. If the patient declines, the psychiatrist is left with 2 choices: initiate treatment in the outpatient setting or refuse to treat the patient and refer to another provider. Treating non-dangerous mania in the outpatient setting is fraught with challenges: * the possibility that the patient's condition will progress to dangerousness * poor adherence to treatment because of the patient's limited insight * the large amount of time required from the psychiatrist and care team to adequately manage the manic episode (eg, time spent with family members, frequent patient visits, and managing communications from the patient). There are no guidelines to assist the office-based practitioner in treating mania in the outpatient setting. When considering dosing and optimal medication combinations for treating mania, clinical trials may be of limited value because most of these studies only included hospitali7ed manic patients. Because of this dearth of knowledge, we provide recommendations based on our review of the literature and from our experience working with manic patients who refuse voluntary hospitalization and could not be hospitali7ed against their will. These recommendations are organized into 3 sections: diagnostic approach, treatment strategy, and family involvement. Diagnostic approach Making a diagnosis of mania might seem straightforward for clinicians who work in inpatient settings; however, mania might not present with classic florid symptoms among outpatients. Patients might have a chief concern of irritability, dysphoria, anxiety, or insomnia, which may lead clinicians to focus initially on non-bipolar conditions. (2) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] During the interview, it is important to assess for any current DSM-5 symptoms of a manic episode, while being careful not to accept a patient's denial of symptoms. …",

      "title": "Amphetamine Use as a Risk Factor for Low-Dose Risperidone–Induced Acute Dystonia",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Antipsychotic-induced acute dystonia is defined as sustained abnormal postures or muscle spasms that develop within 7 days of starting or rapidly raising the dose of an antipsychotic medication.1 Risk factors include young age, male sex, previous instance of acute dystonia, use of psychoactive substances, rapid titration, and use of high-potency antipsychotics.2 Although second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) have a lower risk than first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) to induce acute dystonia, significant differences exist between SGAs in their ability to induce extrapyramidal symptoms.3,4 The following case report describes a young male patient abusing amphetamine who, shortly after initiating low-dose risperidone, developed acute dystonia that did not occur with olanzapine use.\r\n\r\nCase report. Mr A, a 24 year-old man, was admitted because of paranoid delusional thinking and agitation following daily use of amphetamine. He had no other medical history. A few months earlier, he had been hospitalized in the exact same circumstances and was treated successfully with olanzapine 10 mg daily without presenting any motor anomalies. Olanzapine was prescribed after discharge from the hospital, but Mr A stopped the medication a few weeks later. When he was readmitted more than 4 months later, risperidone orally disintegrating tablet 2 mg was introduced at bedtime. The following morning, the patient developed a sensation of thick tongue, had difficulty swallowing his saliva, and experienced neck and jaw rigidity. No respiratory difficulty was noticed. Within 30 minutes following the administration of diphenhydramine 25 mg intramuscularly, the dystonic symptoms diminished and resolved completely within the next few hours. Risperidone was replaced by olanzapine 10 mg at bedtime, and complete resolution of the psychotic symptoms was obtained without recurrence of dystonic symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe exact pathophysiology of acute dystonia remains unknown but probably involves blockade of dopamine D2 receptors in the striatum. It has been proposed that by blocking serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, SGAs increase dopamine release by substantia nigra neurons in the basal ganglia, which would explain the lower risk of dystonic reactions compared with FGAs. Psychostimulant drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines, are considered a precipitating factor for acute dystonia.5,6 Although these substances may initially enhance release of dopamine in the striatum,7 their long-term use is associated with striatal dopaminergic down-regulation.8 In our case report, amphetamine abuse appears to increase the risk of an acute dystonic reaction with risperidone but not with olanzapine. One could argue that the blood concentration of amphetamine had decreased by the time olanzapine was prescribed and this could reduce the risk of dystonia. However, on the first hospitalization the patient did not have a dystonic reaction when treated with olanzapine although he was taking similar quantity of amphetamine on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nAlthough both risperidone and olanzapine have similar binding affinities to dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, only olanzapine has significant anticholinergic properties.3 In our patient, the addition of the anticholinergic drug diphenhydramine to risperidone significantly reduced the dystonic symptoms, suggesting that acetylcholine is involved in some way in the etiology of this motor side effect. In a recent study, patients at risk for acute dystonia used anticholinergic drugs more often when treated with risperidone than with olanzapine.9 Therefore, blockade of 5-HT2 receptors alone by an SGA may not be sufficient to prevent a dystonic reaction in high-risk patients. In our patient, the induction of dystonic symptoms by risperidone was not likely due to an increase in dopamine D2 blockade by risperidone, as dose equivalence studies suggest that risperidone 3 mg is equivalent to olanzapine 10 mg.10,11\r\n\r\nThis case report suggests that low-dose risperidone, but not olanzapine, can induce an acute dystonic reaction when amphetamine abuse is present. We propose that the anticholinergic activity of olanzapine, in addition to its serotonin 5-HT2 blockade, contributes to the lower risk of dystonic reaction compared with risperidone. Therefore, an SGA having both anticholinergic and anti–serotonin 5-HT2 activity might be a better choice to prevent acute dystonia in high-risk patients.",

      "abstract": "Background COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread psychosocial distress. In addition to pandemic associated psychological distress, there is increasing evidence to suggest direct effects of the COVID- 19 virus itself and the subsequent host immunologic response on Central Nervous System manifesting in the form of wide range of neuropsychiatric complications in both acute and post recovery phase. Neuropsychiatric manifestations The data available from similar epidemics of SARS and MERS CoV, revealed common neuropsychiatric manifestations including (a) Neurological: Headache, Impaired sensorium ranging from mild drowsiness to delirium and coma, dysfunction of olfaction and taste sensation, seizures, encephalitis, encephalopathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), acute cerebrovascular events, narcolepsy and other neuromuscular and demyelinating processes (b) Psychiatric: Depressed mood, anxiety, impaired memory and insomnia in acute phase and even in post-illness stage, depressed mood, insomnia, anxiety, irritability, memory impairment, fatigue, traumatic memories and sleep disorder were frequently reported. A diverse group of presentations, increasingly referred to as “long Covid,” is also being described in patients who reported with wide variety of symptoms including disabling fatigue and cognitive difficulties, persisting for many months after acute infection. Psychoneuroimmunology of COVID-19 Though exact neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown , the present available data based on laboratory studies on SARS-CoV-2 and research on its taxonomically similar coronaviruses such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV suggest its potential to enter the CNS via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptors. Other mechanisms causing CNS dysfunction include cytokine driven inflammatory responses and wider systemic effects such as endotheliopathy, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and clotting abnormalities. Additional mechanisms for neuropsychiatric disorders include autoimmunity and psychological trauma of life threatening illness and pandemic related socioeconomic stressors. The relative contributions of these mechanisms to neuropsychiatric sequelae remain largely unknown. Role of psychiatrist Psychiatrist has an important role in not only managing concerns, fears, and misconceptions at the local community and broader public level but also in early identification, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19 related neuropsychiatric manifestations, and hence should be an integral part of COVID-19 treating team. Management The management of neuropsychiatric complications of COVID requires a multidisciplinary team input due to the multisystemic nature of the illness, particularly in severe cases. Adopting bio-psychosocial strategies and judicious use of psychotropic medications is essential for better results. Conclusion Covid-19 is likely to have important neuropsychiatric effects in both the short and longer term. Although the mechanisms to neuropsychiatric complications is still under study, the better understanding will not only augment screening of at-risk individuals but also help in prevention and management of these neuropsychiatric complications.",

In clinical practice benzodiazepine misuse is generally encountered in one of the three following situations: as part of a complex presentation of polysubstance dependence, in patients who have been prescribed therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines and have difficulty stopping use, and rarely, dependence on benzodiazepines as the primary drug of abuse. Determining the extent of the problem is hindered by various definitions of abuse and dependence. In this chapter, we follow the use of previous publications: ‘‘The terms abuse and misuse refer to the use of a drug in a manner that is not consistent with generally accepted medical practice or social and legal custom, e.g., use without a valid prescription or deliberately to produce intoxication, pleasure or a high’’ (Ciraulo and Sarid-Segal, 2005, p. 1300).

Induction of mania in our patient is keeping with the literature regarding induction or worsening of hypomanic or manic symptoms at a lower dose of quetiapine. Hypomanic or manic symptoms at a low dose of quetiapine are brief and seem to reverse the effect by either discontinuing the causing agent or increasing it dose. Quetiapine being an atypical antipsychotic possess antidepressant property at low doses as well as mood stabilizer at higher doses. At lower dose, due to its serotonergic antagonism property, quetiapine appears to induce or worsen hypomanic or manic symptoms. As the dosage increases its dopamine antagonistic activity become more prominent and the medication acts as a mood stabilizer.

A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

      "abstract": "The estuarine dinoflagellate Pfiesteria piscicida gen. et sp. nov. produces exotoxin(s) that can be absorbed from water or fine aerosols. Culture filtrate (0.22 microns porosity filters, > 250 toxic flagellated cells/ml) induces formation of open ulcerative sores, hemorrhaging, and death of finfish and shellfish. Human exposure to aerosols from ichthyotoxic cultures (> or = 2000 cells/ml) has been associated with narcosis, respiratory distress with asthma-like symptoms, severe stomach cramping, nausea, vomiting, and eye irritation with reddening and blurred vision (hours to days); autonomic nervous system dysfunction [localized sweating, erratic heart beat (weeks)]; central nervous system dysfunction [sudden rages and personality change (hours to days), and reversible cognitive impairment and short-term memory loss (weeks)]; and chronic effects including asthma-like symptoms, exercise fatigue, and sensory symptoms (tingling or numbness in lips, hands, and feet; months to years). Elevated hepatic enzyme levels and high phosphorus excretion in one human exposure suggested hepatic and renal dysfunction (weeks); easy infection and low counts of several T-cell types may indicate immune system suppression (months to years). Pfiesteria piscicida is euryhaline and eurythermal, and in bioassays a nontoxic flagellated stage has increased under P enrichment (> or = 100 micrograms SRP/L), suggesting a stimulatory role of nutrients. Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellates have been tracked to fish kill sites in eutrophic estuaries from Delaware Bay through the Gulf Coast. Our data point to a critical need to characterize their chronic effects on human health as well as fish recruitment, disease resistance, and survival.",

These include acute stress disorder (ASD), feelings of depression and guilt, and other anxiety reactions, such as panic attacks. The essential features of ASD are similar to those of PTSD. ASD can be diagnosed if a person has been exposed to a traumatic event in which the person experiences feelings of dissociation, reexperiences symptoms, shows marked avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event, and experiences hyperarousal. For the diagnosis of ASD to be given, the distress must be present for a minimum of two days and a maximum of four weeks and must occur within four weeks of the traumatic event. Other common reactions to extreme stressors include physical complaints, such as chronic pain, fatigue, stomach pains, breathing problems, and headaches, and self-destructive or impulsive behavior, such as alcohol or drug abuse, high-risk sexual behavior, suicidal impulses, and fast or reckless driving.",

      "title": "Zolpidem Extended-Release: A Single Insomnia Treatment Option for Sleep Induction and Sleep Maintenance Symptoms",
      "abstract": "It is imperative that primary care clinicians have a thorough understanding of insomnia, because they are often the first point of contact for patients who seek assistance when they have difficulty sleeping. Insomnia may appear with different presentations: sleep onset, sleep maintenances, sleep offset, nonrestorative sleep, or a combination of these symptoms. Untreated symptoms result in clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of following-day functionality. Physicians, pharmacists, and other clinicians should be aware of the conditions that contribute to, are antecedent to, and associated with insomnia. These pathophysiological conditions include advanced age; female gender; respiratory, gastrointestinal, vascular, and rheumatologic pain syndromes; and other conditions such as depression and/or anxiety. Additional health factors contributing to insomnia include chronic pain, stressors, grief reaction, pharmacotherapeutic side effects, lifestyle contributors such as social/recreational drugs, phytopharmaceuticals, and ethanol use. The pharmacotherapy focus in this article is a modified-release formulation of the BZ1 (omega1) receptor agonist zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety studies that compare 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release (Ambien CR™CIV) and 10 mg original zolpidem were initially conducted in healthy volunteers to assess the potential for an improved clinical profile. Zolpidem extended-release (12.5 mg and 6.25 mg extended-release dosage forms) is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance. Zolpidem extended-release is devoid of any short-term use limitation and can be prescribed for the duration of medical necessity. The modified-release zolpidem is a two-layer tablet with a biphasic release profile, releasing the first layer immediately, whereas the second layer is released at a slower rate. Plasma concentrations are maintained for a longer period of time versus the immediate-release zolpidem formulation. Pharmacokinetic analysis has also demonstrated that the time to maximum concentration (tmax) and terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release are similar to those of 10 mg zolpidem indicating a similar rapid onset of action and an elimination profile that reduced the risk of next-day decrements in performance. Zolpidem's CYP 450 hepatic metabolism uses as a substrate CYP3A4 (major) and 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6 as minor pathways. Zolpidem extended-release dosage forms diminish sleep latency, number of awakenings, and wakefulness after sleep onset and augments total time asleep.",

The syndrome may occur in cases of apparent health or show itself as an exacerbation during any form of schizophrenia.

The symptoms are: A prodromal phase which lasts from 2 weeks to a few months and shows the usual schizophrenic pattern. First Phase.—Increasing perplexity and intense anxiety; incoherence; extreme restlessness; a \"blind drive for annihilation\" and suicidal tendencies; acrocyanosis, increased blood-pressure. Second Phase.—Motor restlessness changing to a more primitive pattern; consciousness becomes increasingly clouded; unusual hematopoietic changes of the blood; blood pressure falls; pulse is rapid and weak; pupils are dilated and react sluggishly to light; reflexes are decreased; high elevation of temperature; pronounced cyanosis; petechial hemorrhages into the tissue; sudden respiratory death or vasomotor collapse.

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

Laboratory tests may be considered to assess for significant comorbidities, differential diagnoses, or contraindications to treatment. Management of MDD depends on its severity and may include psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or both. The drugs most commonly used are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Treatment should be continued for at least 16 to 24 weeks to prevent recurrence.

Getting sober from alcohol or other drugs is one of your first recovery tasks. If you can’t quit on your own, or if you relapse after short periods of abstinence, you may need to be detoxified or attend a structured substance abuse or dual-diagnosis treatment program to break the cycle of addiction. Abstinence is recommended because continued substance use can have a negative effect on your mood disorder and your motivation and can give an “incorrect” reading of the level of some antidepressant medications in your bloodstream. You also have to stabilize the acute symptoms of your mood disorder, such as mania, depression, or suicidality. Otherwise, it will be harder to stop using substances.",

Acute opioid withdrawal can be debilitating and include a range of symptoms such as anxiety, pain, insomnia, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Whereas acute opioid withdrawal only lasts for 1-2 weeks, protracted withdrawal symptoms can persist for months after the cessation of opioids. Insufficient management of opioid withdrawal often leads to devastating results including treatment failure, relapse, and overdose. Thus, there is a critical need for cost-effective, nonopioid medications, with minimal side effects to help in the medical management of opioid withdrawal syndrome.

      "title": "Drug Trials in Status Epilepticus: Current Evidence and Future Concepts",
      "abstract": "Summary: Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurologic emergency with high morbidity and mortality. After many advances in the field, several unanswered questions remain for optimal treatment after the early stage of SE. This narrative review describes some of the important drug trials for SE treatment that have shaped the understanding of the treatment of SE. The authors also propose possible clinical trial designs for the later stages of SE that may allow assessment of currently available and new treatment options. Status epilepticus can be divided into four stages for treatment purposes: early, established, refractory, and superrefractory. Ongoing convulsive seizures for more than 5 minutes or nonconvulsive seizure activity for more than 10 to 30 minutes is considered early SE. Failure to control the seizure with first-line treatment (usually benzodiazepines) is defined as established SE. If SE continues despite treatment with an antiseizure medicine, it is considered refractory SE, which is usually treated with additional antiseizure medicines or intravenous anesthetic agents. Continued seizures for more than 24 hours despite use of intravenous anesthetic agents is termed superrefractory SE. Evidence-based treatment recommendations from high-quality clinical trials are available for only the early stages of SE. Among the challenges for designing a treatment trial for the later stages SE is the heterogeneity of semiology, etiology, age groups, and EEG correlates. In many instances, SE is nonconvulsive in later stages and diagnosis is possible only with EEG. EEG patterns can be challenging to interpret and only recently have consensus criteria for EEG diagnosis of SE emerged. Despite having these EEG criteria, interrater agreement in EEG interpretation can be challenging. Defining successful treatment can also be difficult. Finally, the ethics of randomizing treatment and possibly using a placebo in critically ill patients must also be considered. Despite these challenges, clinical trials can be designed that navigate these issues and provide useful answers for how best to treat SE at various stages.",

      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonin activity in the central and peripheral nervous systems that can lead to symptoms such as altered mental status, autonomic instability (e.g., hyperthermia and hypertensive tachycardia), and neuromuscular abnormalities (e.g., clonus and tremor). We present the case of a 29-year-old male healthcare worker with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD), temporal lobe epilepsy, and suspected obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) who presented with sudden-onset agitation, confusion, and abnormal limb movements after his third consecutive 12-hour overnight shift. He had been on stable outpatient doses of escitalopram 20 mg and bupropion XL 150 mg daily for over six months, with naltrexone 50 mg added three months earlier for off-label psychiatric use. In the emergency department, he was treated for presumed seizure or psychosis with multiple sedatives and antipsychotics and subsequently intubated. EEG showed no epileptiform activity, and lumbar puncture was unremarkable. Neurologic findings, including hyperreflexia, clonus, and rigidity, along with rapid clinical improvement following cyproheptadine and benzodiazepines, supported a diagnosis of serotonin syndrome. The patient denied overdose or substance use, and toxicology review concluded that polypharmacy with serotonergic and modulating agents was the likely trigger. We present a young adult who developed serotonin syndrome without overdose, likely due to the cumulative serotonergic effect of multiple prescribed medications at therapeutic doses. This case emphasizes the importance of clinical vigilance in patients with neuropsychiatric comorbidities on centrally acting agents, even in the absence of recent medication changes. It illustrates that even therapeutic combinations of serotonergic and modulating agents can precipitate life-threatening toxicity.",

      "title": "Alcohol withdrawal syndrome: how to predict, prevent, diagnose and treat it.",
      "abstract": "(1) When people who are physically dependent on alcohol stop drinking, they experience an alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The symptoms generally resolve spontaneously within a week, but more severe forms may be associated with generalised seizures, hallucinations and delirium tremens, which can be fatal. (2) We carried out a literature review in order to obtain answers to the following questions: how to predict or rapidly diagnose a severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome; how to prevent and treat this syndrome; how to manage severe forms; and how to deal with the risk of vitamin B1 deficiency. (3) The main risk factors for severe withdrawal syndrome are: chronic heavy drinking; a history of generalised seizures; and a history of delirium tremens. (4) Anxiety, agitation, tremor, excessive sweating, altered consciousness and hallucinations are signs of a severe withdrawal syndrome. (5) Individual support and effective communication seem to reduce the risk of severe withdrawal syndrome. (6) Oral benzodiazepines are the best-assessed drugs for preventing a severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly the risk of seizures. When given for a maximum of 7 days, the adverse effects are usually mild. (7) Clinical trials of other antiepileptics suggest they are less effective than benzodiazepines, and their addition to benzodiazepine therapy offers no tangible advantage. (8) Betablockers increase the risk of hallucinations, and clonidine increases the risk of nightmares, and the efficacy of these two drugs is not well documented. Neuroleptics increase the risk of seizures. There are no convincing data to support the use of magnesium sulphate or meprobamate (the latter carries a risk of serious adverse effects). Acamprosate, naltrexone and disulfiram are not beneficial in alcohol withdrawal. (9) Gradual withdrawal, i.e. ingestion of decreasing amounts of alcohol, has not been compared with other methods but is generally not recommended. (10) There are no specific recommendations on hydration. Note that excessive water-sodium intake carries a risk of pulmonary oedema in patients with heart disease. (11) As vitamin B1 deficiency is frequent and can lead to serious complications in alcohol-dependent patients, oral vitamin B1 supplementation is widely recommended, despite the absence of comparative trials. High doses must be used to compensate for poor absorption. Intravenous administration is best if patients have very poor nutritional status or severe complications such as Gayet-Wernicke encephalopathy (a medical emergency), even though rare anaphylactic reactions have been reported after vitamin B1 injection. (12) Planned alcohol withdrawal in specialised hospital units has been extensively studied. Outpatient withdrawal may be more appropriate for patients who are at low risk of developing severe withdrawal syndrome. (13) A large proportion of alcohol-dependent patients were excluded from trials of withdrawal strategies. These include elderly patients, patients with serious psychiatric or somatic disorders, and patients who are also dependent on other substances. (14) An oral benzodiazepine is the best-assessed treatment for a single episode of generalised seizures or hallucinations during alcohol withdrawal. (15) In randomised comparative trials benzodiazepines were more effective than neuroleptics in preventing delirium-related mortality. Currently, with appropriate fluid-electrolyte support, continuous monitoring of vital signs, and respiratory support if necessary, the mortality rate for delirium tremens is under 3%. (16) In practice, patients who are attempting to stop drinking alcohol need close personal support and communication, and a reassuring environment, as well as regular monitoring for early signs of a withdrawal syndrome; the latter may require benzodiazepine therapy.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: The co-existence of depression and chronic disease is frequent. This association leads to a worse evolution, of both the psychiatric framework and the chronic disease. However, the depression diagnosis is not always evident and even when it is identified correctly it is often under-treated, either for reasons imputable to the doctor or due to the patient's poor adhesion to the therapeutics. Description of the case: Maria frequently attends medical appointments complaining of dizziness, tinnitus, fatigue and bone and joint pains. The identified health problems include entities with a potential aetiological role in these symptoms, which are overvalued by the patient. However, the latter complied only irregularly with the pharmaceutical therapeutics and kept lifestyle detrimental to the control of such health problems. After multiple appointments of similar pattern she admitted, upon questioning, irritability, anhedonia, tendency for social isolation, hypersomnia and depressive humour, which she attributed to her physical aflictions. After several attempts to introduce anti-depressive medication, which the patient waived a few days later, alleging side effects, medical appointments at fortnight intervals resulted in a better compliance with the therapeutics, both anti-depressive and other, less complaints and better control of her chronic diseases. Comment: The emphasis on the somatic symptoms and the fact that they could be explained within the context of the patient's co-morbidity, therefore withdrawn as criteria of depression suspicion, led to the masking of the latter over time. The doctor must always consider the frequency of depression associated with chronic diseases, in order to achieve better diagnosis acuity. The inclusive approach, accounting for symptoms that are irrespective of being explained by the coexisting pathology, lessens the risk of not diagnosing an oligosymptomatic depressive framework, notwithstanding the fact that it may generate false-positive features. On the contrary, the excluding approach used for some time retarded the (false-negative) diagnosis and the treatment, with repercussions on the control of the whole health problems and on the patient's quality of life.",

Symptoms and complaints could be misinterpreted. Differential diagnostic assessments would be difficult either if the person has OCD or another diagnostic entity with OCD related symptoms. If clinicians in residential or outpatient settings do not realize this, the patients may suffer from inadvertent pharmacological treatment efforts, to no avail. A representative case of the former is presented. Withdrawal of all psychotropic medications cold turkey did not increase symptom load during the following weeks, indicating little benefit from medications. Because of continued complaints from the patient, psychotropic medications were gradually reintroduced, without any improvement. OCD patients may not be helped by extensive use of psychotropics and doctors responsible for them should employ other methods of reducing OCD symptoms than lumping together diverse psychotropics. There is evidence for the value of intensive cognitive behaviour therapy, but also for addressing the social conditions of the patients.",

In brief, every patient who undergoes major surgery experiences an electrolyte disturbance that may cause a psychotic or delirious reaction.

The clinical picture of seizure headaches includes the following features: they are usually diffuse or bifrontal; they begin abruptly at any time and last for minutes or several hours; in the majority of cases they are accompanied by nausea and vomiting and followed by postictal lethargy or sleep; there are no precipitating factors; they respond to anticonvulsants. The factors which differentiate between seizure headache and migraine are discussed. Seizure headache can be the sole clinical manifestation of seizure foci in the limbic system and other parts of the cortex. Some of these patients will have other autonomic phenomena such as pallor and abdominal pain; nearly all have nausea and vomiting. RÉSUMÉ Six cas de céphalées paroxystiques chez l'enfant, provenant de troubles comitiaux sont présentés. L'allure clinique des cephalées critiques présente les caractères suivants: elles sont habituellement diffuses ou bi‐frontales, elles commencent brutalement à n'importe quel moment et durent de quelques minutes à plusieurs heures. Dans la majorité des cas, elles sont accompagnées de nausées et de vomissements et suivies d'une léthargie post‐critique ou de sommeil; il n'y a pas de facteurs annonciateurs; les médications anticomitiales sont actives. Les facteurs qui différencient céphalées critiques et migraines sont discutés. Les céphalées critiques peuvent être la seule manifestation clinique de foyer comitial dans le système limbique et les autres parties du cortex. Quelques sujets présentent d'autres manifestations végétatives telles que pâleurs et douleurs abdominales. Presque tous ont des nausées et des vomissements. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Es wird über sechs Kinder mit paroxysmalen Kopfschmerzen infolge eines Krampfleidens berichtet. Das klinische Bild der Krampf‐Kopfschmerzen bietet folgende charakteristischen Befunde: Die Schmerzen sind gewöhnlich diffus oder bifrontal, sie beginnen abrupt, können zu jeder Zeit auftreten und dauern Minuten bis einige Stunden an. In der Mehrzahl der Fälle klagen die Patienten über Übelkeit, erbrechen und fallen anschliessend in einen postiktalen Dämmerzustand oder Schlaf; es gibt keine ursächlichen Faktoren; die Kopfschmerzen sprechen auf die Behandlung mit Antikonvulsiva an. Auf die unterschiedlichen Befunde bei krampfbedingten Kopfschmerzen und bei Migräne wird ausführlich eingegangen. Krampfebedingte Kopfschmerzen können die einzige klinische Manifestation von Krampffoci im limbischen System und anderen Teilen des Cortex sein. Bei einigen Patienten treten auch andere vegetative Symptome wie Blässe und Bauchschmerzen auf. Nahezu alle Kinder Klagen über Übelkeit und Erbrechen.

      "abstract": "Abstract Elderly individuals, particularly those with cognitive impairment, are oftentimes restless during the night, and this increases the distress of relatives, professional carers and themselves. A number of conditions other than dementia need to be considered from nyctophobia and insomnophobia, to pain, specific motor disorders during sleep, parasomnias as REM-sleep behaviour disorder, dipping, hypoglycemia, withdrawal or excessive tea, coffee and alcohol consumption. A clear-cut differential diagnosis between dementia and delirium is not always possible, as dementia is the major risk factor for confusional states decreasing the vulnerability by anticholinergic medication and any other disruptive factor, biological or psychological. Treatment of nocturnal agitation usually requires (1) reassurance and re-orientation; (2a) the discontinuation of anticholinergic substances; (2b) symptomatic psychotropic intervention; and (3) causal treatment of underlying problems. Benzodiazepines should only be used at the lowest necessary dosage for the shortest possible time, particularly in individuals who are already benzodiazepine-dependent. Quetiapine or mirtazapine at low dosages can be employed in patients with psychotic or depressive symptoms. Melatonin and its derivatives hold promise for chronic circadian rhythm disorders. There is no “one fits all” recipe for this notorious problem and each case needs to be examined individually.",

However, a few case reports have described neuropsychiatric symptoms following PPI use. In this report, we present a case of visual hallucinations secondary to PPI usage and propose possible mechanisms. In this case, a 65-year-old man with no psychiatric history developed acute visual hallucinations following initiation of omeprazole, in the absence of delusions, paranoia, and other psychotic symptoms. The visual hallucinations began after the patient started treatment with omeprazole and resolved almost immediately upon discontinuation of omeprazole. To treat symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease, omeprazole was replaced with famotidine, and the visual hallucinations did not recur after the omeprazole had been discontinued. No other psychotic signs or symptoms were present in this patient throughout the duration of his hospitalization. Although the scientific literature provides limited information on psychosis related to PPI use, a growing number of case reports and studies in recent years have suggested that neuropsychiatric symptoms may occur after PPI use. It is our hope that this case report adds to the scientific and medical knowledge in this area.",

O DSM 5 trara o tipo conforme o tempo e intensidade dos sintomas apresentados. Em relacao aos Transtornos Depressivos apresentam as mesmas caracteristicas que o episodio depressivo, presente no Transtorno Bipolar, acompanhado de alteracoes somaticas e cognitivas que afetam significativamente a capacidade de funcionamento do individuo. O que difere entre eles sao os aspectos de duracao, momento ou etiologia presumida. E relevante destacar a importância de um diagnostico correto, para tratamento dos Transtornos que, na maioria das vezes, e realizado atraves de tratamento medicamentoso e psicoterapia.Ainda, ressaltamos que a elucidacao e a compreensao desses transtornos sao fundamentais, sendo que, quanto mais precoce for o diagnostico, possivelmente, melhor sera o prognostico.",

      "abstract": "Combat scene, a wounded or dead hoplite lies on the ground, black-figured hydria, Cleimachos (potter), 560-550 BCE. Louvre, (Museum), Paris, France. Photo credit: Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY. Diagnosing concussion has posed a special challenge in current military conflicts, as some symptoms and clinical findings are similar to acute stress reaction and other conditions. The Department of Defense (DoD) currently defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as: a traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force that is indicated by new onset or worsening of at least one of the following clinical signs, immediately following the event: 1) any period of loss of a decreased level of consciousness (LOC), 2) any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury, 3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking, etc.), 4) neurological deficits (weakness, loss of balance, change in vision, praxis, paresis/plegia, sensory loss, aphasia, etc.) that may or may not be transient, or 5) the presence of an intracranial lesion (1). Diagnosing TBI currently depends on a thorough history and the patient's status at the time of injury, and there is currently no single objective test or diagnostic biomarker for concussion/mild TBI (mTBI). Advancing diagnostic efforts, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command is funding biomarker studies to identify the unique biological effects of TBI and leverage knowledge to develop more objective diagnostic tools to determine the severity of brain injury. TBI severity within the DoD are currently classified as mild/moderate/severe (1). Concussion/mTBI involves normal structural imaging, LOC for up to 30 min, alteration of consciousness up to 24 h, and post-traumatic amnesia up to 24 h. If a patient meets criteria in more than one category of severity, the provider assigns the higher severity level. Definition standardization remains a problem as concussion grading systems and definitions published by various organizations make comparing findings from various research studies extremely difficult. A collaborative effort among the DoD, Veterans Health Administration, Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Brain Trauma Foundation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is developing a medically useful definition and staging criteria for mTBI/concussion. We live in a sport-crazed society, and although injury is usually an accepted consequence of “playing the game,” there is a heightened awareness about sport concussions. Pick up a newspaper, or watch the evening news or “Sports Center,” and you're bound to read or hear something about sport concussions. The media are obsessed with this topic, particularly with the negative news that makes headlines and ultimately sells newspapers. Even so, there is good news to report, and progress is being made. Forty-nine states have passed concussion laws in the past 4 years, aimed at educating athletes, parents, and coaches about the symptoms of concussion and the dangers of continuing to play while still symptomatic. According to the CDC, Emergency Department diagnosis of youth sport concussions has increased by an estimated 60% over the past decade (2). Surprisingly, this is good news, as it speaks to the increased public awareness and better recognition of concussion, as opposed to an increase in actual concussions. Concussion remains a major military concern given the short- and long-term impacts to our service members; recent conflicts have sparked an increase in TBI research funding designed to accelerate medical innovation. There were 266,810 service members in the DoD from 2000 to 2012 who were diagnosed with TBI—81.7% of these injuries concussions (3). Although the risk for TBI is certainly higher in the combat environment, the majority of these injuries (83.4%) is actually nondeployment-associated (3). In parallel to sport-concussion awareness, military medicine has also taken significant policy steps to promote early identification and concussion treatment (4). In 2010, the DoD published a policy mandating that any deployed service member involved in a potentially concussive event (such as 50 m from a blast, vehicle collision or rollover, blow to the head, etc.) receive a medical evaluation using the Military Acute Concussion Evaluation; receive a minimum 24 h of downtime, even if he was not diagnosed with a concussion; and must be re-evaluated prior to returning to duty (5). Since then, the DoD has screened over 14,950 deployed service members for concussion and has staffed 11 Concussion Care Centers in Afghanistan that promote concussion recovery and medical oversight (internal DoD data; personal communication). The U.S. Army is implementing this concept worldwide to ensure one standard of concussion care, whether the injury occurs on the battlefield or in garrison. The Veterans Administration-DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines (6) were rated as the highest concussion-management guideline in a 2011 edition of Brain Injury (7). Beginning in 2009, the DoD has published numerous TBI clinical recommendations in collaboration with civilian experts in the areas of cognitive rehabilitation, driving assessment, postinjury neurocognitive testing in the deployed environment, management of neuroendocrine dysfunction, assessment and treatment of dizziness, and management of visual dysfunction (8), and an additional three clinical recommendations will be published this year to include graded return to activity, sleep disturbances, and use of neuroimaging. The tests for detecting concussion and tracking recovery are becoming more sensitive, especially when used in combination with other tools to create a multimodal approach to concussion assessment. Despite all that has been accomplished, caring for service members and athletes at risk for sustaining cerebral concussion has always been a challenging task and never more so than in today's litigious society. Concussion is different from other injuries, in that we still rely heavily on an athlete's or a service member's subjective reporting of symptoms for decisionmaking, and we lack the neuroimaging protocols that might allow us to identify the damage and understand its severity. The cause-and-effect relationships, or lack of same, between repetitive head trauma and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are the subject of significant debate. Several published case reports have described tau deposits in the brains of deceased contact-sport athletes, but most of the neuroscience community does not believe that controlled experimental research has yet identified a causal relationship linking repetitive head trauma in sports and CTE(9–12). Innovative neuroimaging techniques are on the horizon and will eventually permit tau and other proteins to be traced in vivo. This should allow for prospective investigations comparing head-impact exposure with tau accumulation, leading to earlier detection and interventions for these chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In the meantime, our responsibility is to safely care for our service members and athletes, to educate them about what is known and unknown regarding the long-term effects of repetitive head trauma, and to ensure that family members, coaches, and military unit leaders implement supportive recovery practices. Unfortunately, the large amount of misinformation on this topic sometimes results in hysteria rather than rational thinking. Concussions are like snowflakes: no two are alike, and no cookbook or calendar can specify exactly how they should be treated. Therefore, we need to go the extra mile. In many cases, it's a matter of counseling our service members and our athletes about the short- and long-term risks of not reporting symptoms, returning to play or duty while still experiencing symptoms, or not modifying risky behaviors that can predispose them to future concussions. We need individualized and sport-specific return-to-play progressions that ensure that service members and athletes are physically and cognitively prepared to return to activity. No checkbox system can be applied to every concussion, and as concussions are diverse and unique injuries that affect each athlete differently, we must learn how to treat them individually. Likewise, concussed service members and athletes are unique, and we must work to understand what makes them different. Sports medicine clinicians must play the important role of counselor to our athletes. Getting to know each athlete's mindset and reaction to injuries allows us to build trust and forge honest lines of communications, thus enabling us to develop an appropriate and individualized plan for managing concussion, which is just as vital as knowing how to interpret the results of a cognitive or balance test. Within a 6-month period, four major consensus or evidence-based documents focused on concussion management will have been released, including the new “Zurich International Guidelines” or the Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport: the 4th International Conference on Concussion in Sport (13–16). This, along with other manuscripts published or soon to be published by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, the American Academy of Neurology, and the National Athletic Trainers' Association, should all be mandatory reading for sports medicine clinicians, as they will define the standard of care for sports medicine clinicians for at least the next 4–5 years. These documents are well-prepared and will make significant contributions to the sports medicine community. The landscape is changing, and these evidence-based guidelines are leading us in a better direction. Although the neuroscience community has learned much about concussion in the last two decades, we admittedly have much more to investigate and to understand.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To quickly diagnose migraine without aura in a busy practice clinical in India and other developing countries. Background: Differentiating migraine from episodic tension type headaches is difficult if one strictly follows International classification of headache disorders- 3rd edition beta version (ICHD 3 Beta), as there are many overlapping statements. Another problem is applying criterion E, not better accounted for by another ICHD 3 beta diagnosis. Duration, presence of head pain and associated migraine diagnostic symptoms except vomiting and nausea are not mandatory to diagnose Episodic syndromes that may be associated with migraine (ICHD 3 Beta code 1.6) or Periodic syndromes (ICHD2) that are commonly precursors of migraine. Methods: A retrospective chart review was done on 6,200patients. All were diagnosed as Migraine without aura, Probable migraine or Benign secondary headaches, and the following four common features were identified- recurrent headaches / activity affected / absolutely normal in between episodes/ no red flags present. History of two more additional helpful diagnostic features was also noted - Common migraine triggers precipitating these headaches and family history of migraine or its synonyms. Exclusion criteria include aura, autonomic manifestations, headaches lasting more than 3 days, headaches with migraine features that are not activity dependent, post dromal symptoms, fever and other systemic disorders. Results: 92% of patients fulfilled the four simple migraine diagnostic features. 88% had one of the common migraine triggers precipitating their headaches and 91% had family history of migraine. Conclusion: Recurrent activity affected headaches with absolute normality in between episodes and without any red flags, should lead one to consider the diagnosis of migraine without aura.",

      "title": "What Is Personality Disorder?",
      "abstract": "What Is Personality Disorder? Hanna Pickard (bio) The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 689) defines personality disorder (PD) as: A. An enduring pattern of experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of an individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas: 1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events); 2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response); 3. Interpersonal functioning; and 4. Impulse control. B. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations. C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood. E. The enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder. F. The enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., head trauma). Unlike schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other Axis I conditions, PD is not conventionally understood as an illness or disease. Rather, as the name implies, it is a disorder of the personality: an ‘enduring pattern of experience and behavior.’ Metaphorically speaking, it is a condition that is internal to the kind of person someone is, a part of who they are. It is not an external condition that befalls them. Very roughly, personality is the set of characteristics or traits that make us the kind of person we are: the ways we are inclined to think, feel, and act in response to particular circumstances, as well as more generally. All of us have one. PD occurs when the set of characteristics or traits that make a person the kind of person they are causes severe psychological distress and impairment in social, occupational, or other important contexts: the ways a person is inclined to think, feel, and act do them harm, directly or via the effects they have on relationships, work, and life more generally conceived. Diagnosis of a PD requires that these characteristics or traits be long-standing, pervasive, difficult to control or change, and markedly different from cultural expectations. Equally, the distress and impairment caused must be sufficiently extreme to warrant clinical attention: the person needs clinical care and help. Nonetheless, all of us possess characteristics or traits that sometimes incline us to think, feel, and act in ways that cause us distress and adversely affect our social, occupational, or other functioning. PD lies on a continuum with normal human personality. The broad category of PD is currently divided into three subcategories or ‘clusters.’ Cluster A comprises paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal PD. These are more colloquially known as the odd [End Page 181] and eccentric or ‘mad’ PDs. Cluster B comprises narcissistic, borderline, histrionic, and antisocial PD. These are more colloquially known as the dramatic, emotional, and erratic or ‘bad’ PDs. Cluster C comprises obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, and dependent PD. These are more colloquially known as the anxious and fearful or ‘sad’ PDs. A person cannot be diagnosed with any particular PD unless there is clinically significant distress and impairment. But, given that this condition is met, which kind of PD they have depends on what kind of personality they have–on the nature of the problematic pattern of experience and behavior. Stepping back and considering the wider context, the picture painted of PD is bleak. PD is associated with genetic factors (Jang and Vernon 2001) and also environmental conditions (Paris 2001). These include dysfunctional families, where there is breakdown, death, institutional care, and parental psychopathology; traumatic childhood experiences, with high levels of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse or neglect; and social stressors, such as war, poverty, and migration. There are high levels of comorbidity among PDs, and between PDs and psychotic disorders, eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse (Moran 2002). Finally, there is also a strong association between PD and violence and crime, self-harm, and suicide (Moran 2002). As this picture...",

Overdose is a serious complication of opioid use, characterized by depressed level of consciousness and respiratory depression. It can be treated with naloxone. Withdrawal symptoms include dysphoria, yawning, tearing, diarrhea, cramps, nausea, and piloerection. Buprenorphine, methadone, clonidine, and lofexidine can be used to ameliorate the symptoms of withdrawal. However, supervised withdrawal alone rarely leads to long-term abstinence. There are a number of psychosocial treatments, including self-help groups, outpatient therapy, and residential treatment; the data on their effectiveness are limited. Pharmacotherapy with an opioid agonist (methadone or buprenorphine) is the most effective treatment. Long-acting injectable naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, is also effective, but it is more difficult to initiate.",

      "abstract": "Taking opiates for medical purposes without supervision of healthcare professionals and non-medical purposes can cause different consequences such as delirium or even injury, and may cause addiction over a longer period of time. The most common recreational opium is heroin, while opium is rarely used. Opiate groups include opium, morphine, heroin, methadone and codeine. Addiction is manifested through physical and psychological dependence. Physical or biological dependence refers to the change in the biological state of the organism, while psychic addiction implies the forced necessity of entering the substance into the organism in order to restore good mood and to avoid the suffering of certain substances. Addiction leads to acute intoxication characterized by euphoria, facial redness, pruritus, impaired breathing depth, hypotension and bradycardia. Apart from the symptoms of acute intoxication, the use of opiates can lead to serious and even lethal consequences such as neurological diseases, hepatitis, HIV and AIDS. Treatment of opiate dependence implies treatment with naloxone and clinical treatment. Very important for the treatment of overexpression is to determine tolerance to opiates to determine the required dose of the drug. In the Republic of Croatia, the legal framework for the fight against drug abuse is based on the Criminal Code and the Law on Combating Drug Abuse, while at the European Union level the National Strategy for the Suppression of Drug Abuse in the Republic of Croatia was adopted. This research was carried out in order to determine the existence of differences in urban and rural addicts with regard to social demographic characteristics.Research has shown that addicts in urban areas are equally to addicts in rural areas by the time of arrival to the drogs band that addicts in urban and rural areas relatively early start with addiction treatment. The study included 57 respondents divided by sex and area of residence. From the data on opiate abuse by observing the most addicted counties, it is represented in Zagreb and Zagreb County, followed by Istrian and Krapina-Zagorje County. Heptane is the most widely used main source consumed in the city of Zagreb.",

      "title": "Can Vitamin D Deficiency Produce an Unusual Pain Syndrome?",
      "abstract": "An unusual pain occurred in five patients in the presence of compromised vitamin D status and resolved 5 to 7 days after supplementation with vitamin D in the form of ergocalciferol. The pain had a hyperesthetic quality and did not respond to the use of analgesics, including opiate derivatives. Treatment with therapeutic levels of a tricyclic antidepressant did not bring relief of symptoms. In one case, months after treatment and subsequent improvement of vitamin D status and pain, the vitamin D status again declined and the pain recurred. The pain again resolved with vitamin D replacement and improvement of levels. There may be a pain syndrome associated with vitamin D depletion that appears as hyperesthesia worsened by light, superficial pressure or even small increments of movement. This pain restricts mobility and function and may lead to further complications, such as pressure sores. (<i>Arch Intern Med.</i>1991;151:1662-1664)",

      "title": "Síndrome de sobreentrenamiento",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

Many psychotropic compounds exhibit short durations of action, making repeated daily administration necessary. Patients discontinue their medication, with frequent relapses and rehospitalizations for many reasons, including the sense of wellbeing, fear, neglect, lack of insight, poor judgment, delusions, disturbed communication, miscalculation of visits, or expense.<sup>1</sup>In contrast to the physically ill who maintain treatment because they suffer from their symptoms, psychiatric patients, particularly schizophrenics, may have no such reminder. In the follow-up of one of our recent studies,<sup>2</sup>one-fourth of the discharged patients were rehospitalized with active psychotic symptoms within four to eight weeks of a self-induced drug free period. To avoid discontinuation of medication, recurrence of psychosis, and rehospitalization, a longer acting psychotropic compound was needed, similar to depot insulin used in diabetes, and the development of such a compound among the phenothiazines was encouraged.",

Parental alienation may affect men's mental health: a) parental alienation negatively influences mental health of male children and adolescents who are victims of parental alienation. Alienated children/adolescents display guilt, sadness, and depressed mood; low self-esteem and lack of self-confidence; distress and frustration; lack of impulse control, substance abuse and delinquent behavior; separation anxiety, fears and phobias; hypochondria and increased tendency to develop psychosomatic illness; suicidal ideation and suicide attempt; sleep and eating disorders; educational problems; enuresis and encopresis; b) parental alienation negatively affects the mental health of adult men who were victims of parental alienation when they were children and/or adolescents. Long-term effects of parental alienation include low self-esteem, depression, drug/alcohol abuse, lack of trust, alienation from own children, divorce, problems with identity and not having a sense of belonging or roots, choosing not to have children to avoid being rejected by them, low achievement, anger and bitterness over the time lost with the alienated parent; c) parental alienation negatively influences mental health of men who are alienated from their children. Fathers who have lost some or all contact with their children for months or years following separation or divorce may be depressed and suicidal.",

      "title": "2824 – Acute psychosis and buprenorphine withdrawal: abrupt vs. progressive could make a difference",
      "abstract": "Buprenorphine, a partial μ-opioid agonist and κ-opioid antagonist, is frequently used in the treatment of heroin dependence, and to prevent complications arising from intravenous injection and social consequences of heroin use. Psychosis occurring after discontinuation of buprenorphine or other opioids has been described, but is uncommon. We report the case of a 37-year-old man, suffering from opiates dependence, presenting acute and intense psychotic symptoms beginning after an abrupt discontinuation of buprenorphine, which he was taking for two years as substitution therapy for heroin dependence. The initial medication by risperidone, up to a dose of 8 mg/day was inefficient to control psychotic symptoms. Four weeks later, buprenorphine was finally restarted at 8 mg/day, which allowed a complete remission of psychotic and anxiety-related symptoms. The antipsychotic medication was gradually discontinued two months later, allowing the patient to remain symptom-free eighteen months later. We discuss the potential role of abrupt withdrawal syndrome in the apparition of the psychotic symptoms and the presence of a latent psychotic disorder. An interesting issue in our case report is that a correctly conducted antipsychotic treatment did not succeed in stopping symptoms of delusions, even after four weeks, while reintroducing buprenorphine did, showing in this context an antipsychotic effect. This case report highlights the importance of taking opiate dependence into account in patients with recent onset of psychotic symptoms, even several weeks after withdrawal.",

Diagnostic criteria require: I. Progressive motor weakness of more than one limb, and II) absent muscle stretch reflexes. Features that strongly support the diagnosis are: 1. Cease of progression of weakness by 4 weeks, relative symmetrical involvement of the limbs, presence of mild sensory symptoms or signs, involvement of cranial nerves VII (50%) more than IX, X, III, IV and VI, recovery within 2 to 3 weeks after progression stop, presence of autonomic dysfunction, and absent of fever at onset; 2.

      "title": "BURNOUT SYNDROME AS A MANIFESTATION OF TEACHER'S PROFESSIONAL DEFORMATION",
      "abstract": "Professional deformation is the destruction that occurs during work activity and negatively affects its performance. In addition, the destructions generate professionally undesirable qualities changing both professional and personal behaviour. Furthermore, professional deformation has the greatest impact on the personal characteristics of representatives of those professions whose work relates to people (teachers, psychologists, social and medical workers, officials, leaders, police officers, etc.). One of the significant signs related to professional deformation of teachers is the emotional burnout syndrome. Burnout syndrome is viewed as a process of gradual loss of emotional, cognitive and physical energy, which is characterized by the symptoms of emotional and mental exhaustion, as well as physical fatigue, personal isolation, depersonalization, and reduced satisfaction in performance. It is mainly regarded as the result of stress which has not been successfully dealt with at the workplace. Above all, there are three main symptoms of emotional burnout syndrome: extreme exhaustion, detachment from clients (patients, pupils, students) and from work, a sense of inefficiency and lack of achieving high-performance goals. Recent research suggests five key groups of symptoms regarding burnout syndrome. These include both physical, emotional, behavioural, social symptoms and intellectual state. As a result, scientists came to the conclusion that personal, role and organizational factors play an essential role in professional burnout. This paper gives an overview of diagnostic criteria and methods of prevention for burnout syndrome, which are of primary importance for representatives of all professions, especially those who are at risk.",

      "abstract": "Primary dysmenorrhea (PD) is a common, disregarded, underdiagnosed, and inadequately treated complaint of both young and adult females. It is characterized by painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which start shortly before or at the onset of menses and which could last for 3 days. In particular, PD negatively impacts the quality of life (QOL) of young females and is the main reason behind their absenteeism from school or work. It is suggested that increased intrauterine secretion of prostaglandins F2α and E2 are responsible for the pelvic pain associated with this disorder. Its associated symptoms are physical and/or psychological. Its physical symptoms include headache, lethargy, sleep disturbances, tender breasts, various body pains, disturbed appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea, and increased urination, whereas its psychological symptoms include mood disturbances, such as anxiety, depression, and irritability. While its diagnosis is based on patients' history, symptoms, and physical examination, its treatment aims to improve the QOL through the administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hormonal contraceptives, and/or the use of non-pharmacological aids (e.g., topical heat application and exercise). Patients must be monitored to measure their response to treatment, assess their adherence, observe potential side effects, and perform further investigations, if needed.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorders are cyclical mood disorders with clinical features including distinct sustained periods of mood elevation. Briefer (4 days or more), mild episodes of mood elevation define bipolar II disorder; lengthier (7 days or more), more severe episodes (or those requiring hospitalisation), with or without psychotic features, define bipolar I disorder. Depressive periods are more common and lengthier than manic or hypomanic states, and are the main cause of disability. Bipolar depression may respond poorly to antidepressants and these medications may destabilise the illness. The diagnosis of bipolar disorder should be considered when a patient with depression is treatment resistant. Irritability is a common symptom in bipolar disorder, particularly during mixed states (during which patients have features of mood elevation and depression concurrently) or when there is rapid cycling of mood (more than four episodes of mood disorder per year). Alcohol misuse and use of illicit drugs may simulate mood changes in bipolar disorder. Accurate diagnosis and assessment of bipolar disorder is essential for clinical decision making and determining prognosis and treatments.",

      "abstract": "The half-life of a drug is the time taken for the blood level of the drug to fall by half, provided that no more doses of the drug are administered in the intervening period. Many psychotropic drugs and their active metabolites, if any, have very long half-lives that extend for 2 days or longer. Examples are chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, fluoxetine, vortioxetine, aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, cariprazine, penfluridol, donepezil, and memantine. Other drugs with long half-lives that psychiatrists may prescribe include levothyroxine and zonisamide. Psychotropic drugs with long half-lives take long to reach steady state; this is seldom a problem. They also take long to wash out; this is an advantage because the risk of drug withdrawal or discontinuation syndromes is small, and a disadvantage if rapid washout is desired for any reason, including the experience of drug adverse effects or toxicity, or the discovery of an unplanned pregnancy. Other clinical issues related to drugs with long half-lives include the relevance of occasional missed doses, the possibility of once-weekly dosing, and the need for pregnancy planning.",

      "abstract": "Opioid misuse, including the use of heroin and the overprescribing, misuse, and diversion of opioid pain medications, has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in opioid use disorder and associated overdoses and deaths. Addiction is a chronic brain disease with a genetic component that affects motivation, inhibition, and cognition. Patient characteristics associated with successful buprenorphine maintenance treatment include stable or controlled medical or psychiatric comorbidities and a safe, substance-free environment. As a partial opioid agonist, buprenorphine has a ceiling effect that limits respiratory depression and adds to its safety in accidental or intentional overdose. Buprenorphine and combinations of buprenorphine and naloxone are generally well tolerated; adverse effects include anxiety, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, nausea, and sedation. Family physicians who meet specific requirements can obtain a Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 waiver by notifying the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration of their intent to begin dispensing and/or prescribing buprenorphine. Medication-assisted treatment with buprenorphine is as effective as methadone in terms of treatment retention and decreased opioid use when prescribed at fixed dosages of at least 7 mg per day; dosages of 16 mg per day are clearly superior to placebo. Sporadic opioid use is not uncommon in the first few months of medication-assisted treatment and should be addressed by increased visit frequency and more intensive engagement with behavioral therapies. Follow-up visits should include documentation of any relapses, reemergence of cravings or withdrawal, random urine drug testing, pill or wrapper counts, and checks of state prescription drug database records.",

      "title": "Codeine for Acute Extremity Pain [Internet]",
      "abstract": "Injuries to the upper and lower extremities can result from myriad causes such as sprains, fractures, crushes, and thermal or chemical injuries. A frequent outcome of such injuries is pain, which can be classified as acute (lasting for minutes to weeks) or chronic (lasting months to years).,The goals of therapy for acute extremity pain include the recognition that the patient is experiencing pain, the rapid reduction of pain intensity, and the general minimization of discomfort until the cause of the pain is treated., Therapeutic options for acute pain control include both non-pharmacological (e.g., ice, splint, sling) and pharmacological choices depending on the level of pain associated with the injury. Non-opioid analgesics, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), N-acetyl-para-aminophenol (APAP) (i.e., acetaminophen, paracetamol), and salicylates, may be sufficient for mild to moderate pain. Whereas opioids (e.g., morphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, oxycodone, codeine), alone or in combination with a non-opioid, are often the next step for recalcitrant pain or as a starting point for severe pain.,Opioid prescribing practices have come under scrutiny in recent years as Canada and other jurisdictions battle with an opioid epidemic. For this and other reasons, there has been a desire to optimize opioid prescribing in those cases in which it is possible. The appropriate role of codeine for pain management is being questioned and is the focus of this report.In Canada, several formulations of codeine are available for treatment of pain. Codeine is an agonist of primarily the mu receptor, in the central nervous system and in peripheral tissues such as the gastrointestinal tract. It is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2D6 to various metabolites, including morphine,, which accounts for some of its analgesic effect.,, The rate of metabolism by the CYP2D6 isoenzyme is known to vary in the general population,, which highlights the ranges of pain relief and side effects that can be observed when codeine is used., It is a relatively weak opioid, and may also be used in combination with APAP or NSAIDs to provide an additive analgesic effect.This report is part of a series questioning the appropriate use of codeine in pain management. A previous report summarized and critically appraised evidence available in November 2020 on codeine for pain related to osteoarthritis of the knee and hip. Two other summaries with critical appraisal are in progress at the time of writing for the use of codeine for acute dental pain and pain related to Caesarean section. Other related CADTH reports on codeine include 3 summaries with critical appraisals from 2019.– The first sought evidence on codeine for acute pain from urological or general surgery, the second sought evidence on codeine for pediatric patients with acute pain, and the third sought evidence on codeine for acute pain in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery.The objective of this report is to investigate the clinical effectiveness of codeine or codeine combination products for the management of acute extremity pain.",

No pain medications required.3) Pain is more noticeable and it comes and goes more frequently. Still able to perform usual tasks but it takes a bit of effort. Mild analgesic usually will help with this type of pain.4) The pain lasts for longer periods, it is much more noticeable and it is starting to bother and interfere with concentration and tasks requiring more effort and concentration. Mild analgesia should alleviate this type of pain, maybe more doses than one single dose may be required. A hot pack or ice pack may also help alleviate the pain.5) The Pain is now very noticeable, it is interfering with everyday tasks and a pain reliever is now required at 4 to 6 hourly intervals. Depending on the patient, someone with acute pain, may still respond well to mild analgesia probably at 4th hourly, maybe with added codeine (if the patient is able to take it) and even heat or ice may help with some relief of this level of pain.6) The Pain level is medium heading towards strong now and it is becoming more constant and it is not easily forgotten about.

      "abstract": "Much progress has taken place in knowledge of actions and use of opioids in pain in the last quarter century. There would be much less unnecessary pain and suffering if this knowledge would be applied properly in clinical practice. Why is it not? The major reasons appear to be ignorance, false prejudices (myths) and exaggerated limitations in availability of opioids for medical treatment of pain. Even the strongest opioid analgesics do not need to relieve pain in everybody. Their effect should be monitored and if inadequate, proper measures should be taken (e.g. adjusting a dose or changing an opioid). Weak opioids (codeine, tramadol) alone are mostly not stronger then non-opioid analgesics. However, combinations of opioid analgesics with paracetamol often show synergistic analgesic effect (without increased toxicity). Opioids actually represent very safe analgesics. Exaggerated opiophobia is a major myth causing much unnecessary pain and suffering in patients. Undue fear of drug abuse and/or political considerations have resulted in laws and regulations, that make it unnecessarily difficult to obtain opioids for medical use. An example of this might be a recent re-scheduling of buprenorphine in the Czech Republic and Slovakia among drugs with a very high abuse potential (e.g. morphine, fentanyl, amphetamine).",

      "title": "From OFF to ON—Treating OFF Episodes in Parkinson’s Disease",
      "abstract": "In Parkinson’s disease (PD), OFF episodes continue to present a serious burden for patients, and their effective management remains a substantial unmet clinical need. Understanding of the pathophysiology of OFF episodes has advanced in recent years, providing valuable insights for improved treatments. OFF episodes generally appear 3–5 years after starting levodopa treatment, but can begin much earlier. They are characterized by motor symptoms (including tremor, rigidity, slowness, incoordination, and weakness) and are almost always associated with some non-motor symptoms (including psychological symptoms, pain, urinary problems, swallowing difficulties, and shortness of breath). In PD, higher doses of levodopa are associated with increased risk of motor and non-motor complications, which are notable limitations for longterm therapy. Their occurrence is associated with intermittent levodopa delivery and consequent fluctuating plasma levels. These issues can be offset using lower levodopa doses where possible, incremental dose increases, and combinations of levodopa with other pharmacological agents. OFF episodes in PD can be caused by gastroparesis and/or by Helicobacter pylori infection, which delays delivery of levodopa. These issues can be addressed using new formulations for continuous intrajejunal administration. In addition, pen injector, intranasal, and inhaled dosing systems have been studied and may provide relief via non-intestinal routes. Other approaches include deep-brain stimulation, which is effective but is restricted by costs and potential adverse events. This report presents the highlights of a satellite symposium held at the 14th International Conference on Alzheimer’s &amp; Parkinson’s Diseases (AD/PD™ 2019), Lisbon, Portugal, which discussed the nature of OFF episodes in PD, associated risk factors and the potential of current and future treatments to effectively manage them and increase ON time.",

This case series describes 2 patients with prolonged (>2 weeks) recurrent complications during attempted tapering of benzodiazepine doses after long-term treatment. Excited catatonia developed in a 90-year-old woman, and prolonged delirium developed in a 69-year-old woman. Both patients showed improvement of symptoms after resumption of higher doses of benzodiazepine treatment and recurrence of symptoms when the dose was again lowered. Caution should be exercised regarding the long-term use of benzodiazepines in older adults (aged ≥65 years). Tapering of benzodiazepines in older patients after long-term treatment may require slow decreases in dose over long periods. Psychotherapeutic interventions, such as brief cognitive therapy with psychoeducation and motivational enhancement, and osteopathic manipulative treatment to decrease paravertebral muscle tension may be beneficial during the tapering process.",

In both predisposition existed, in so far that the one (Case I.) the woman was worn out with anxiety, want of rest, etc., from nursing the member of her family who died just before the first attack of the disease, she was hysterical and nervous; in the other (Case II.) he had been subjected for years to severe responsibilities, cares, and worries, which had impaired his general health. In Case I, complete recovery took place after a certain length of time, and she remained well, until experiencing another mental emotion and shock—from business reverses—a relapse occurred. From this time on, every relapse slight or great, every recrudescence of the cutaneous symptoms, subjective or objective, could be traced to some such slight or severe mental emotion or impression, or increased worry, or care, or anxiety and furthermore the grade of the relapse, whether transient or grave, varied according to the grade of the emotion, shock, or other disturbance received. It was also constantly seen how objective manifestations constantly followed immediately upon neuralgic pains, or a hemicrania or some other evidence of sensory innervation. Still more conclusive, perhaps, of the neurotic character of the disease was the observation that diminution in the severity of the subjective and objective manifestations occurred in proportion as the patient's morale improved, and the final cessation of the pathological symptoms and entire quiescence of the disease were only obtained when the changed circumstances of the patient's life protected her against the occurrence of mental emotions or shocks and precluded the experience of annoyances, worries, or cares.

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guidelines for Assessment and Management of Patients with Substance Intoxication Presenting to the Emergency Department",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, revision 10 (ICD-10) describes intoxication as \"a transient condition following the administration of alcohol or other psychoactive substance, resulting in disturbances in level of consciousness, cognition, perception, affect or behavior, or other psychophysiological functions and responses.\"[1] Intoxication is generally an acute phenomenon, the intensity and effects of which wear off with time and disappear completely in the absence of further use of the substance. While most episodes of intoxication do not need medical attention, intoxicated patients may sometimes present to the emergency department.[1] The reasons for seeking medical attention may either be due to the substance use itself (e.g., extreme agitation or violent behavior that may endanger the patient or others around them) or due to an adverse consequence of substance use (e.g., head injury in a road traffic accident that occurred due to driving while intoxicated). Common substances of intoxication encountered in the emergency setting in India are alcohol, cannabis, opioids, and benzodiazepines. Cases of intoxication from other substances like inhalants, stimulants, hallucinogens, and newer psychoactive substances including synthetic cannabinoids and club drugs may also present to the emergency unit. Often the substance of intoxication may be unknown or falsely reported due to fear of legal ramifications or there may be use of more than one intoxicating substance, thereby complicating the clinical picture. Patients may present with decreased levels of consciousness, vomiting, seizures, or other symptoms that may resemble other medical or surgical emergencies. It is, thus, imperative that psychiatrists attending to patients in the emergency department be well-versed with identification, assessment, and management of patients with substance intoxication.[2] Caring for intoxicated patients in the emergency department comes with various other issues that require a psychiatrist's time and effort. These patients may be brought into the emergency department against their wishes and refuse medical care. They may also be brought in for medical attention by law enforcement authorities with no available identification details and reliable history or even in association with an alleged crime or illegal activity, making it essential for the emergency care provider to be competent in dealing with the medicolegal aspects of intoxication and providing optimum medical services to the patient along with safeguarding the legal procedures. The present clinical practice guidelines deal with the assessment and management of patients with substance intoxication presenting to the emergency department. The guidelines present the general considerations while attending to a substance intoxicated patient, followed by general signs of intoxication. Thereafter, details of intoxication with specific substances are discussed, namely, alcohol, cannabis, opioids, benzodiazepines, and other substances. Features of intoxication, assessment, and management are discussed for each of these substances. Multiple substance intoxication is also discussed in the guidelines. Special populations are referred to in the guidelines, including children and adolescents, women, and the elderly population. The guidelines do not cover nicotine or caffeine intoxication (these are unlikely to be encountered in a clinical setting). Accidental ingestion of substances of use is not catered to in these guidelines. We also do not go into details of intoxication presenting with additional psychiatric and/or medical illnesses and each such case is likely to be unique with its own specific constraints and challenges in management. General considerations while attending to a substance intoxicated patient Patients with intoxication with a substance of abuse present several challenges during assessment and management [Figure 1]. One of the foremost concerns is the potential unreliability of history. Patients with substance intoxication may give inaccurate or unreliable history. This may be partly attributable to patients trying to minimize their substance use, not recollecting details adequately due to cognitive impact of the substance, concealment of the details of substance use from the family, or avoiding sharing details to prevent legal ramifications. Thus, multiple sources of information can be referred to obtain a more comprehensive account of the patient's condition. Friends, family, and previous treatment records can be useful sources of collateral information about the patient. In some circumstances, physical examination and mental status examination of an uncooperative patient can be helpful to get a clearer clinical picture of the patient (e.g., injection track marks can hint at opioid overdose in an otherwise comatose patient).Figure 1: Challenges in assessment and management of patients with substance intoxicationAnother challenge that comes across in patients with intoxication is the occurrence of agitation or violence. Some of the intoxications with substances like alcohol and stimulants like cocaine may be associated to aggression. Aggression may be due to disinhibition and impaired judgement associated with substance use. Furthermore, substance use disorder may be associated with other psychiatric or medical illnesses that may individually contribute to the state of agitation or aggression. Addressing aggression promptly is required to prevent harm to the self and others. Other relevant guidelines of the Indian Psychiatric Society may be referred to while addressing aggression and violence when patients with substance intoxication present to the emergency department. A related issue is the consumption of substances or presentation with substance intoxication when the patient intends to kill themself. This may be a presenting feature in patients with overdose of opioids or sedative-hypnotics. Sometimes, patients may also consume large amounts of alcohol when they have an intent to die. Thus, self-harm should be considered as a possibility when patients present with substance intoxication, and suitable assessment measures should ascertain risk to self and the presence of concurrent psychiatric disorder. If required, additional treatment should be instituted for the patient. A relevant aspect of consideration is to determine the line between simply the use of a substance or substance intoxication. Description in the ICD-11 mentions substance intoxication as occurrence of \"clinically significant disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behavior, or coordination that develop during or shortly after the consumption or administration.\"[3] Hence there is a leeway for the clinician to determine what is considered as \"clinically significant\". One way to simply operationalize is to consider any clinical encounter with a patient having a recent history of substance use which has resulted in the abovementioned mental or neuropsychiatric disturbances and are brought to the emergency/clinical setting as \"clinically significant\" (those situations where these disturbances are expected by the person and are found to be pleasurable would be considered simply as use). The disturbances are described as transient and reversible, and hence they are expected to abate with time. Patients with substance intoxication may have an issue related to their mental competence. Substance use may result in impairment of judgement or consciousness. This may result in impairment of competence, that is, the ability of the person to comprehend choices, decide a course of action, and communicate their choice back. This lack of competence has a bearing on treatment choices that should be instituted and promulgation of coerced treatment. It is generally accepted that when a person is not found to be competent, the nominated representative can be the proxy decisionmaker for the person. The treatment providers can also institute emergency treatment in the best interests of the patient. Furthermore, substance intoxication is a reversible process, so if emergency treatment is not required, then one can wait for the patient to re-attain competence as the substance intoxication wanes. A clinical consideration for patients with substance use disorders is the concurrent use of many substances together. This may lead to the clinical picture being altered or complicated by features of intoxication or withdrawal from different substances. For example, a patient with opioid dependence may experience sedation during intoxication. If benzodiazepines or alcohol are used concurrently with opioids, then the sedation may be accentuated. In such a patient, reversal using naloxone may offset the features of intoxication from opioids, but not reverse the effects of benzodiazepines. Similarly, intoxication from cocaine and other stimulants may lead to paranoia, which may be accentuated by the consumption of higher than usual amounts of cannabis. Thus, a clinician needs to be open to the idea of multiple substance consumption in a patient with substance intoxication. Another issue in the clinical management of patients with substance intoxication in the emergency setting is the potential lack of social support in the treatment process. Patients may be consuming substances alone, or it is possible that casual acquaintances do not intend to help or are not in a position to help (due to their own intoxication as well). Family and friends may be disinclined or burnt out due to the substance use disorder and hence may not be forthcoming in engaging with the care process. Thus, the ancillary supports available in the treatment process of patients with substance intoxication may be few. Sometimes, police or other bystanders may bring a patient with substance intoxication to the emergency unit and the identity of the patient may be unknown to them. Thus, clinicians may have to work with limited information on occasions. There may be legal concerns with the consumption of certain substances considered illegal under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. This may make patients hesitant to disclose use of some of the substances; for example, heroin. Treating psychiatrists might also be apprehensive about documentation. However, it should be reiterated that clinicians can help patients better if they are able to get a reliable history of the patient. Thus, it would be preferable to gather detailed information and document suitably while ensuring confidentiality of the treatment records and providing reassurance about this to the patient. It might also be prudent to perform urine or blood testing for substance abuse, ensuring a safe chain of custody of the sample. It is unlikely that such treatment records are referred to by the legal process, but a psychiatrist may need to present the relevant information to courts when requested through due processing. General signs of intoxication As specified in the ICD-11,[3] intoxication from one or more psychoactive substances may be suspected in cases where the following features are present: Transient, but clinically significant disturbances occur in consciousness, coordination, perception, cognition, affect, or behavior that develop during or shortly after the consumption/administration of the substance(s) The symptoms are in accordance with the known pharmacological effects of the substance. The intensity of the symptoms is closely related to the amount of substance consumed/administered. The symptoms are time-limited and subside as the substance is cleared away from the body. The symptoms cannot be better explained by another medical condition or another psychiatric disorder. Table 1 enumerates signs and symptoms of intoxication with different substances.Table 1: Features of intoxication with common psychoactive substancesGeneral management of intoxicated patients in the emergency setting As mentioned earlier, patients presenting with intoxication may prove challenging to manage. Intoxicated behavior may often be confused with other disease conditions and vice versa. A brief outline on general management of a patient presenting with intoxication is given in Figure 2.Figure 2: General management of intoxicated patients in an emergency settingALCOHOL INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Alcohol (primarily) is a widely used psychoactive substance globally and in India. In people aged 20–39 years, approximately 13.5% of global deaths are attributable to alcohol. More than 200 disease and injury conditions are related to alcohol use. Data from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program of United States, which included non-fatal emergency department visits from facilities in 49 states and Washington, DC, indicated that in 2020 1.8% of the total annual emergency visits were related to alcohol use. Of the many alcohol related disorders presenting to the emergency department in India, a vast majority presents with road traffic accidents due to driving under intoxication followed by acute alcohol poisoning, which is defined as ingestion of a large amount of alcohol in a short duration of time.[4] Clinical features of alcohol intoxication Alcohol is a global central nervous system (CNS) depressant. Acute ingestion generally results in elevation of mood, disinhibition, and increased confidence, leading to argumentative or combative behavior. In addition to those mentioned in Table 1, some features of alcohol intoxication seen with increasing blood alcohol concentration (BAC) are discussed in Table 2. In naïve drinkers, BAC of 150–250 mg per 100 ml result in clinically apparent intoxication; BAC of 350 mg per 100 ml cause stupor and coma; while levels more than 450 mg per 100 ml can be fatal. Regular users of alcohol often develop tolerance and are significantly less likely to manifest symptoms/signs of intoxication at the same BAC than non-regular drinkers.[5] Effects can last from 2 to 3 hours after a few drinks to up to 24 hours after heavy drinking.Table 2: Effects of increasing blood alcohol concentrationAssessment of alcohol intoxication An asssessment of a patient presenting with alcohol intoxication aims at identifying the immediate risks to the patient and attendants and uncovering maladaptive patterns of alcohol use that may require specialized management and care. Acute alcohol intoxication may result in several metabolic abnormalities, like hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. Thus, these may be required on an urgent basis. Alcohol can cause acute effects on the cardiovascular system, such as atrial and ventricular tachy-dysrhythmias. Hence, an urgent electrocardiogram (ECG) may be required. Further discussed are the assessment measures for alcohol intoxication: Clinical history Elicit details of current episode of alcohol use: amount, preparation, duration, mixing with other substances, etc. Ask for similar details about previous drinking episodes. Elicit, wherever possible, events of high-risk behavior under intoxication: driving, operating heavy machinery, self-harm, or violence toward others. Attempt should be made, wherever possible, to identify alcohol dependence or harmful use pattern. Physical Examination Assess levels of consciousness (the Glasgow Coma Scale may be used), cardiac and respiratory parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac rhythm, respiratory rate), and urine output, if possible, with hourly intervals until parameters begin to normalize. Unresponsive patients may suffer from an occult head injury that may be identified from increased intracranial pressure. It is thus advised to perform a direct ophthalmoscopy looking for papilledema, which is a clinical sign for increased intracranial pressure. Papilledema without increased intracranial pressure may also be seen in methyl alcohol poisoning. Thus, imaging (CT/MRI) may be required to determine definitive management. In responsive patients, rule out diplopia and assess eye movements in all cardinal positions, any muscle weakness, and sensory deficits. Observe for any abnormal or involuntary movements. Check for other physical injuries and bleeding from the ear, nose, or mouth. Mental status examination Assess for speech and behavioral abnormalities; pay special attention to aggressive behaviors, and ensure patient and staff safety. Assess thought and perceptual disturbances. Assess orientation to time and place: immediate, recent, and remote memory, insight, and reality testing. Rule out other causes of altered sensorium: Metabolic causes such as hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, hyperosmolar hypoglycemic state, diabetic ketoacidosis, and metabolic acidosis may be detected by laboratory investigations including blood glucose, renal function tests, and arterial blood gases. Cerebral trauma, cerebrovascular events, and meningitis may be identified by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Encephalopathies and toxicity from other substances (methanol, lithium, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and isoniazid) may be identified through laboratory investigations for serum ammonia, and levels of suspected agents in the blood. Higher serum levels than the therapeutic window indicates toxicity. The abovementioned assessments and investigations are based on individual case considerations and clinical suspicion. MANAGEMENT OF ALCOHOL INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Individuals with some symptoms of alcohol intoxication (mild and moderate cases, i.e., without impairment of consciousness or significant medical issues) can be managed in relatively simple surroundings without much medical intervention. Those who are severely intoxicated should be admitted and further managed in a setting where high-dependency or intensive care can be provided.[4,6] Treatment for acute alcohol toxicity is largely supportive. The first priority is airway protection and maintenance of breathing as respiratory depression due to alcohol intoxication may result in death. Alcohol acts as a diuretic; thus, patients with signs of dehydration (dry lips and mucosae and poor urine output) may be provided with intravenous fluids. Checking glucose is important, as many individuals with alcohol use disorder may have depleted glycogen stores. Hypoglycemia needs to be corrected with 5% dextrose intravenously. Routine use of vitamins is not necessary for all cases of alcohol intoxication. However, thiamine supplementation is needed for patients with alcohol dependence to prevent the occurrence of Wernicke encephalopathy. Thus, prophylactic thiamine may be administered to patients who appear at risk of developing thiamine deficiency (prolonged use of alcohol, poor nutritional status, confused mental state, gait abnormalities, and ophthalmoplegia).[7] Usual dose should be at least 250 mg of thiamine daily intramuscularly for 3–5 days, followed by oral thiamine 100 mg daily.[8] It is important to remember that in an emergency setting, thiamine is to be administered before glucose replenishment so that the glucose is utilized in ATP generation (which utilizes thiamine as a co-factor), preventing sequestration of the already limited thiamine which may precipitate Wernicke's encephalopathy. A brief schematic flowchart for management of alcohol intoxication in the emergency setting is presented in Figure 3.Figure 3: Management of alcohol intoxication in an emergency setting General management Maintain airway, breathing, and circulation. Provide intravenous fluids to counter dehydration and maintain urine output. Hypoglycemia should be corrected with oral glucose, if conscious level permits, or else with 5% or 10% intravenous (IV) dextrose. Maintain ambient room temperature, with quiet surroundings and minimal disturbance. At least one electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained for all heavily intoxicated patients and for those with known cardiovascular conditions. \"Holiday heart syndrome\" characterized by new-onset arrhythmias/atrial fibrillation can occur following alcohol ingestion. Serial ECG monitoring should be done if arrhythmia is detected. As intoxication abates, ECG changes should resolve, but if the changes persist an alternate cause should be considered. In the case of altered mental status, when a full history cannot be elucidated from the patient, a CT scan of the head can be considered for detecting intracranial pathology contributing to the patients' mental status (e.g., subdural hematoma). MRI can also be considered for select cases. If suicidality is expressed, then psychiatric evaluation should be considered. Laboratory investigations Blood glucose, plasma electrolytes, and blood gases should be measured as frequently as possible in patients with altered sensorium until recovery is assured. Urine toxicology may be performed, if needed, to check for presence of narcotics and sedatives, if suspected. Complete blood counts can be done to detect megaloblastic anemia. Liver function tests should be done when prolonged harmful pattern of alcohol use is suspected. Renal function tests should be done in cases of altered sensorium, poor urine output, or if behavioral features are out of proportion to the amount of alcohol consumed. Blood alcohol levels may be required in medicolegal cases when reliable history is not available or when behavioral features are out of proportion to the amount of alcohol consumed. Whole blood thiamine levels may be measured in patients at risk of or suspected to develop Wernicke's encephalopathy. Symptomatic management Control aggression by adopting a concerned and non-threatening demeanor. Sedatives should be used judiciously to avoid over-sedation. Metadoxine (given as a single IV/intramuscular [IM] injection of 300–600 mg) may be used to accelerate the elimination of alcohol in adults leading to faster recovery from intoxication. In cases of agitation or violence, antipsychotics (haloperidol 5 mg with promethazine 50 mg) should be considered. In-patient admission of a patient with alcohol intoxication can be considered when there is severe intoxication, medical complications such as Wernicke's encephalopathy, alcoholic hepatitis, dysrhythmias or convulsions, persistent disorientation, continued abnormality in cardiopulmonary parameters, known chronic systemic illnesses that require medical attention independently, prolonged aggressive behavior, or perceptual abnormalities. The specialty under which the patient needs to be admitted can be determined according to the indication for admission. CANNABIS INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Cannabis is the most common illicit substance of abuse in India. Cannabis intoxication sometimes presents to the emergency setting after consumption (either inhalational or oral) of high amounts of cannabis. It usually presents in those who have never tried cannabis before and experience severe psychiatric or medical manifestation of cannabis consumption. Sometimes, regular cannabis users may also experience symptoms and signs of cannabis intoxication when they are introduced to a cannabis product of higher potency. Cannabis intoxication manifests with several symptoms as mentioned in Table 3.[9] There can be several physical symptoms of cannabis intoxication. These include tachycardia, tachypnea, increased blood pressure, dry mouth, nystagmus, increased appetite, and, rarely, precipitation of arrhythmias, angina, or myocardial infarction. Rarely, deep inhalation or breath holding may lead to pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. Marked perceptual and mental status changes can be observed in cases of cannabis intoxication. These can include alteration in perception of time, with the perceived time being faster than clock time. Music is perceived as more engrossing and colors may appear brighter. There may be hallucinations, primarily auditory ones. There can be a sense of depersonalization. One may become more self-conscious, and may manifest paranoid thinking or delusions (persecutory, referential, or grandiose). Cannabis intoxication affects cognition and psychomotor performance as well. There may be motor incoordination and impaired attention and concentration. Judgment may be impaired due to cannabis intoxication.Table 3: Features of cannabis intoxicationThe cognitive and psychomotor features of intoxication may not be immediately apparent and may manifest up to three hours after consumption of the cannabis product. This may lead novice users to consume higher amounts and experience dysphoria, anxiety, perceptual alterations, and cognitive changes to a higher than anticipated extent. These features of intoxication may last even for 12 to 24 hours after the consumption of cannabis due to accumulation in the adipose tissue and gradual release afterwards. Assessment of patients with cannabis intoxication The assessment of cannabis intoxication is through elaboration of the history and conduct of the examination, supplemented with urine drug screening. Patients presenting to the emergency department with panic attacks or psychotic symptoms after cannabis usage can describe their psychopathology. Attempts should be made to assess the consumption of cannabis products prior to occurrence of such symptoms. Sometimes, friends and family members can provide corollary information. A physical examination that reveals bilateral conjunctival injection without itchiness or pain may indicate cannabis intoxication. A high degree of suspicion may be necessary as the patient may not be forthcoming with proper history, fearing legal or social repercussions. Urine enzyme-linked immunodorbet assay (ELISA) tests might provide objective information about consumption of cannabis, as cannabis remains in the body and is excreted in the urine for at least three days in infrequent consumers and for an even longer duration for regular users. One has to be cautious about urine false positives for cannabis due to efavirenz and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen and naproxen. Differential diagnosis of cannabis intoxication may include intoxication with other substances of use like cocaine, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), MDMA (ecstasy), amphetamines, and synthetic cannabinoids. When a patient presents with psychiatric symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, or panic attacks, one should evaluate for the exacerbation of a preexisting psychiatric illness like schizophrenia, acute and transient psychotic disorder, or panic disorder. Management of cannabis intoxication in the emergency setting Management of cannabis intoxication in the emergency setting can be initiated with placing the patient in a dimly lit space, reassuring them, and decreasing stimulation. In most cases, the intoxication would fade in a few hours. The patient may be given benzodiazepine orally if the patient is accepting the medication orally. Clonazepam 0.5 mg or lorazepam 1 mg can be given in such a situation. If the patient is agitated or violent, then appropriate measures should be taken for the management of agitation or violence. This may include use of antipsychotics (like haloperidol 5 mg with promethazine (Phenergan) 25 mg, given intravenously or intramuscularly), or cautious and limited use of restraints. In cases of chest pain, the patient should be evaluated for cardiac or pulmonary etiological causes. These may focus on myocardial infarction, angina, arrhythmia, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum, or evaluation of exacerbation of asthma. ECG or X-rays coupled with referral to cardiologists/pulmonologists or medicine specialists would be useful. Once the patient recovers from cannabis intoxication, they should be debriefed and offered counseling, providing information about harms associated with cannabis use. If a cannabis use disorder is identified (harmful use or dependence), then the patient should be suitably referred for further treatment of substance use disorder. OPIOID INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Opioids are highly dependence-producing substances. Opioids used commonly include both pharmaceutical ones (used generally in the form of medications such as methadone, buprenorphine, tramadol, and pentazocine), and non-pharmaceutical ones (generally used for recreational purposes like heroin and raw opium). Intoxication with opioids can be intentional (a patient may be taking increased amounts of opioids to experience a more intense high or as an attempt to harm oneself) or unintentional (a patient may be unable to know the potency of street heroin and hence may inject higher doses of it). There are several risk factors for opioid intoxication or overdose that have been reported in the literature.[10] These include escalating doses of opioids, combination of opioids and sedative drugs, use of opioids after a period of cessation, and presence of comorbid conditions like HIV, depression, and liver disease. Opioid intoxication is defined as a condition of transient and clinically significant disturbances in consciousness, perception, behavior, cognition, affect, or coordination that develop during or shortly after the consumption or administration of opioids. Presenting features include somnolence, stupor, psychomotor retardation, slurred speech, mood changes (euphoria followed by dysphoria), respiratory depression, and impaired memory and attention. Pupillary constriction is generally present. The intensity of these symptoms is related to the amount of opioids consumed, and in severe intoxication, coma may occur. These symptoms are not better accounted by the presence of another medical condition or presence of intoxication or withdrawal of another substance. Opioid intoxication can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe on the basis of the level of psychophysiologi",

The stories of King David and Tom are presented as examples of “sinful,” not pathological, behavior. Neither story provides enough details to permit a diagnosis of voyeurism for either man. Voyeurism as a diagnosis came later. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000), voyeurism requires more than isolated episodes of peeping. The DSM‐IV‐TR diagnosis of voyeurism has three criteria; (1) The patient must have recurrent sexual fantasies, urges, or acts of observing an unsuspecting person naked, in the process of undressing, or having sex; (2) The patient must have had these recurrent fantasies, urges, and acts for at least six months; and (3) Either the patient has engaged in peeping or, if not, is having personal or interpersonal difficulties as a result of voyeuristic interests.",

Mada / Madonmada is caused by various traumatic events or extreme stressors, and it is characterized by various features such as pradhyayati (immersed in thoughts/flashbacks/recurrent or persistent distressing thoughts), praswapati (excessive sleep), animittitam rodati (crying without any reason/pervasive negative emotions/depressed mood), akasmaat hasati (laughing inappropriately or without any reason/disorganized behavior), nidraalu (hypersomnia/excessive sleep), alpa vaak (diminished speech or poverty of speech/social withdrawal), nityam utsuka (hypervigilant/restlessness), trasta shareeri (tiredness/weakness), deenaaksha (depression/pervasive negative emotions), krodhana (angry outbursts/irritable behavior), nirapatrapa (self-destructive behavior/recklessness), purastaat avalokee (exaggerated startle response), na yathavritta eva (disorganized or abnormal behavior), parushatva of roma (roughness or dryness of skin and hair), and aavilam chakshusha (confused/teary eyes). Mada / Madonmada has shown similarity with various psychiatric conditions such as “acute stress disorder,” “posttraumatic stress disorder,” “brief psychotic disorder,” and “adjustment disorder.” The present study provides insights for clinical implementation of “ Mada / Madonmada ” in the diagnosis and management of “trauma- and stressor-related disorders” in terms of Ayurveda . It is astonishing that thousands of years before, “ Acharya Bhela ” has documented the conditions such as trauma- and stressor-related disorders in the form of Mada or Madonmada .",

      "abstract": "Cannabis use has been associated with several psychiatric comorbidities and there appears to be a dose-response relationship between the intensity and duration of its use and the risk of psychosis. More commonly, acute episodes of cannabis induced-psychosis manifest immediately following exposure, are precipitated after the use of large amounts of cannabis, resolve with abstinence, and are of shorter duration than those observed with primary psychotic disorders. Cannabis withdrawal symptoms usually manifest when heavy, prolonged consumption of this substance is interrupted or significantly reduced. The withdrawal syndrome may include sympathetic autonomic hyperactivity, irritability, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and reduced appetite. On the other hand, cases of psychosis induced by cannabis withdrawal are rare. In this case, we present a 32-year-old healthy woman without personal or family psychiatric history who showed a heavy and continued consumption of cannabis since she was 10 years old, without developing any psychiatric symptoms. However, recently she experienced two brief psychotic episodes with disorganized behavior and persecutory delusions, both episodes happening a week after discontinuing cannabis consumption.",

Drowsiness, tiredness, lethargy, fatigue and weakness have different meanings for different patients. Many people use some of these terms interchangeably. Fatigue is perceived by patients as more severe and persistent than tiredness. Patients describe a number of accompanying sensations: lack of energy, exhaustion, restlessness, boredom, lack of interest in activities, weakness, dyspnoea, pain, altered taste and itching. John and his family may feel there is no point in planning ahead, while professionals may assume the fatigue is due to the illness and cannot be changed. Lethargy is a feature of feeling low in mood and of a clinical depression. Drowsiness occurring in minutes, hours or days needs urgent review. Possible causes are drugs, severe infection, hypoglycaemia, hypercalcaemia, haemorrhage and hypoadrenalism.",

The diagnostic criteria for mania require the presence of distinct periods of abnormal mood characterized by euphoria, expansiveness, or irritability. The change in mood is accompanied by increased activity or energy as well as other symptoms such as grandiosity, decreased sleep, increased speech, flight of ideas, distractibility, agitation, and increased involvement in risky behaviors. The assessment of bipolar disorder should include a detailed psychiatric history ascertaining the presence of current or previous mood symptoms. Children and adolescents are more likely to present with either rapidly fluctuating or a mixed mood state. Bipolar disorder is associated with high relapse rates, even among those receiving treatment. The first-line medication class is second-generation antipsychotics. Additional psychosocial treatments such as psychoeducation, psychotherapy, and community engagement can also be helpful.",

      "title": "ATP1A3-Related Neurologic Disorders",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders represent a clinical continuum in which at least three distinct phenotypes have been delineated: rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP); alternating hemiplegia of childhood (ACH); and cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss (CAPOS). However, some affected individuals have intermediate phenotypes or only a few features that do not fit well into one of these major phenotypes. RDP has been characterized by: abrupt onset of dystonia over days to weeks with parkinsonism (primarily bradykinesia and postural instability); common bulbar involvement; and absence or minimal response to an adequate trial of L-dopa therapy, with few exceptions. Often fever, physiologic stress, or alcoholic binges trigger the onset of symptoms. After their initial appearance, symptoms often stabilize with little improvement; occasionally second episodes occur with abrupt worsening of symptoms. Rarely, affected individuals have reported a more gradual onset of symptoms over weeks to months. Anxiety, depression, and seizures have been reported. Age of onset ranges from four to 55 years, although a childhood variation of RDP with onset between ages nine and 14 months has been reported. AHC is a complex neurodevelopmental syndrome most frequently manifesting in infancy or early childhood with paroxysmal episodic neurologic dysfunction including alternating hemiparesis or dystonia, quadriparesis, seizure-like episodes, and oculomotor abnormalities. Episodes can last for minutes, hours, days, or even weeks. Remission of symptoms occurs with sleep and immediately after awakening. Over time, persistent neurologic deficits including oculomotor apraxia, ataxia, choreoathetosis, dystonia, parkinsonism, and cognitive and behavioral dysfunction develop in the majority of those affected; more than 50% develop epilepsy in addition to their episodic movement disorder phenotype. CAPOS (cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss) syndrome is characterized by episodes of ataxic encephalopathy and/or weakness during and after a febrile illness. Onset is between ages six months and four years. Some acute symptoms resolve; progression of sensory losses and severity vary. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis of an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder is established in an individual with the clinical features of RDP, AHC, or CAPOS syndrome and/or by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A3. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment of visual disturbance, hearing loss, seizure disorders, cardiac arrhythmia, and cardiomyopathy. Consideration of CPAP or BiPAP for those with sleep apnea. Those with severe dysphagia may require a gastrostomy tube. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy for motor dysfunction, ataxia, and dysarthria. Acute spasms may respond to chloral hydrate or other medication that induces sleep. Dystonia can be treated with benzodiazepines, dopamine agonists, or levo-dopa. Psychotherapy and standard pharmacotherapy for those with mood disorder or psychosis. Early referral for developmental support / special education. Prevention of primary manifestations: Prophylaxis for AHC episodes may include flunarizine, topiramate, a ketogenic diet, and sleep. A trial of high-dose benzodiazepines may be considered in individuals with RDP and AHC. Triggers that lead to acute attacks should be avoided. Prevention of secondary complications: When dystonia is present, physical therapy to prevent contractures in the hands and feet. Surveillance. Affected individuals should be monitored for the development of dysphagia (RDP and CAPOS syndrome), seizures (RDP and AHC), and psychiatric symptoms (RDP). Agents/circumstances to avoid: RDP. Triggers including alcohol, fever, psychological stress (e.g., childbirth), excessive exercise. AHC. Triggers including psychological stress / excitement; environmental stressors (e.g., bright light, excessive heat or cold, excessive sound, crowds); water exposure (e.g., bathing, swimming); certain foods or odors (e.g., chocolate, food dyes); missed meals; excessive or atypically strenuous exercise; illness; irregular sleep (missing a nap, delayed bedtime). CAPOS syndrome. Febrile illness, pregnancy. Pregnancy management: Affected pregnant women should be monitored for the development of symptoms of RDP. The number of pregnant women with RDP is small, but several reports of childbirth as a trigger have been noted. Exposure to anti-seizure medication may increase the risk to the fetus of adverse outcome; that risk, however, is often less than the risk to the fetus associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given anti-seizure medication during pregnancy should ideally take place before conception. Genetic counseling ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. ATP1A3 pathogenic variants may be inherited or occur de novo. In contrast to initial reports a familial history is not required for a diagnosis of RDP. In AHC, pathogenic variants are more commonly de novo than inherited; in both RDP and CAPOS syndrome both inherited and de novo pathogenic variants have been observed. Each child of an individual with an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant in the family is known. The variability of presentation within a family with a known ATP1A3 pathogenic variant further complicates genetic counseling. Lifelong asymptomatic individuals who harbor a heterozygous ATP1A3 pathogenic variant have been reported in families with RDP.",

Anxiety is manifest by the mood of fearfulness, behaviour marked by restlessness and avoidance of situations, increased arousal with insomnia, excessive preoccupation with thoughts on the theme of insecurity, and a wide range of somatic symptoms which are based on muscular tension, hyperventilation leading to paraesthesiae and faintness, and symptoms based on overactivity of the autonomic nervous system. Excessive anxiety and situational avoidance leads to diminution of performance and limitation of endeavour. In the context of physical illness, anxiety increases the distress of symptoms, may confuse diagnostic procedure, prolong recovery time from acute illness, cause failure to comply with effective treatment and promote destructive habits such as reliance on alcohol or excessive use of sedative drugs.",

      "abstract": "Panic disorder is one of the anxiety disorders, characterized by sudden and unexpected attacks of panic. Usually occurs with agoraphobia. \r\nTypical signs of a panic attack include: palpitations, sweating, trembling, breathlessness, feeling of suffocation, pain or discomfort in the chest, nausea , dizziness or light-headedness.Fear of losing control, fear going mad, fear of death, tingling in the body, overwhelming heat or cold, feeling that the environment has changed, feeling as if the person has been changed or is separated from oneself. A panic attack usually lasts a few minutes. It can also occur during sleep, so the person wakes up in terrible fear. When attacks occur in certain situations (eg. Ride the bus, elevator, stay in a larger group of people), it may happen that a person begins to avoid such situations, which leads to limited functioning and consequently lead to isolation. Fear of possible new attacks have been increased, there have been changes in the normal schedule and increasingly severed daily activities. Before the diagnosis of panic disorder, due to very unpleasant and many physical symptoms, such people usually undergo extensive and long-term physical treatment, and there are frequent visits to the emergency department related to the feeling of fear that is associated with such disorders. \r\nPanic disorder typically develops at an earlier age and is more common in women. The cause of the attack can be a specific event, a specific situation, activity (in the case of phobias), but attacks can occur quite unexpectedly, without a clear cause. As possible causes are important different life events (loss of a close person, divorce, job loss, etc..). \r\nAccording to cognitive-behavioral theories of anxiety, panic is a response to external stimuli, which are learned from closest people (usually a parent).\r\n According to psychodynamic theory, panic attack is unsuccessful defense against impulses that stimulate anxiety (in the background there is a need for separation and independence) or anxiety is the result of unconscious mental conflict between repressed desires that are usually transformed into some physical symptoms. Treatment of this disorder is individual and combined drug therapy with psychotherapy. The duration of treatment is different (a few weeks, and sometimes more than a year). Antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are the first choice in the treatment of panic disorder. anxiolytics and tricyclic antidepressants are also used. Sometimes just an explanation of the reasons for the occurrence of symptoms leads to improvements.\r\n Commonly prescribed is the combination of an antidepressant and / or anxiolytic compounds from the group of benzodiazepines. Psychotherapy can help change the way of thinking that leads to the emergence of panic attacks or disorder. \r\nIt's important to start treatment of this disorder in order to prevent further complications that impaire functioning of people and significantly affect quality of life.",

The depression did not recur. Such withdrawal symptoms are most prevalent after discontinuation of paroxetine but can occur after use of all selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The withdrawal syndrome includes both physical and psychiatric symptoms and needs to be distinguished from a relapse of the psychiatric disorder. Good information and gradual discontinuation of the antidepressant after long-term use are adequate measures to prevent severe withdrawal symptoms.",

What makes a dying patient uncomfortable or causes them suffering must be determined and appropriately treated.

      "title": "Mirtazapine in Primary Insomnia: Case report and Literature review",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Insomnia is a prevalent sleep disorder characterized by difficulty in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or achieving restorative sleep, despite adequate opportunities. This condition often results in significant daytime impairments, including fatigue, concentration difficulties, and irritability. Insomnia can be primary or comorbid with other disorders such as anxiety or depression. Case Presentation: A 27-year-old woman presented with severe and chronic insomnia, persisting for 14 years with recent exacerbation. Her symptoms included significant difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep, resulting in an average of only 3-4 hours of sleep per night and complete sleep deprivation for periods exceeding half an hour over the past 5 days. This sleep deficit led to pronounced emotional instability, physical discomfort, and reduced appetite, although suicidal ideation was absent. She had a past history of drug use for different psychiatric illnesses. She was started on mirtazipine 30mg and showed abrupt improvement in her symptoms. She was discharged afterwards. Discussion: The patient's chronic insomnia and its secondary effects necessitate a comprehensive treatment approach. Mirtazapine, an antidepressant with potent histamine receptor antagonism, has shown efficacy in improving sleep quality across diverse patient profiles. However, side effects like weight gain and sedation require careful monitoring. Combining mirtazapine with prolonged-release melatonin has demonstrated enhanced outcomes, particularly in perimenopausal women. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) remains the first-line treatment due to its efficacy and long-term benefits. Conclusion: Mirtazapine can be a valuable option in the therapeutic arsenal for primary insomnia, but ongoing research is needed to refine treatment strategies. Personalized treatment plans considering patient history and response are crucial for effectively managing primary insomnia and improving patient outcomes.",

      "title": "The “Good Enough” Mood Stabilizer: A Review of the Clinical Evidence",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT A growing family of medications is used for mood stabilization in bipolar disorder. These medications fall into two broad categories according to likely mechanisms of action. Within the categories, specific drugs may vary in their efficacy for different phases of the disorder. The first category, including lithium, anticonvulsants, and some novel treatments, appears to have mechanisms related to intracellular second messengers. These medications have more pronounced antimanic than antidepressant effects, except for lamotrigine, which has antidepressant effects without precipitating mania. The second group of mood stabilizers is the atypical antipsychotics, which act through dopamine and other monoamines. Olanzapine and in all likelihood other drugs in the class possess marked, acute antimanic properties and possible antidepressant properties, but require further study before they can be used as routine options in long-term care. It is clear that the advent of multiple mood stabilizer candidates has not yet led to a single ideal therapy for bipolar disorder, but rather to options that can be flexibly tailored to the lifetime needs of individual patients, in sequences or combinations, and perhaps in conjunction with other classes of psychotropics.",

      "abstract": "Article AbstractWithdrawal symptoms commonly occur during tapering and/or after discontinuation of antidepressant drugs, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Withdrawal symptomatology does not necessarily subside within a few weeks and may be associated with other manifestations of behavioral toxicity (loss of treatment efficacy, refractoriness, switch into mania/hypomania, or paradoxical reactions). The oppositional model of tolerance provides a pathophysiologic basis for understanding and managing withdrawal syndromes. Reintroducing the antidepressant that was initially used or switching from one antidepressant to another to suppress symptomatology, as suggested by current guidelines, may actually aggravate the state of behavioral toxicity and be detrimental in the long run. Alternative strategies that do not encompass continuation of antidepressant treatment are required, but there is currently lack of adequate research for guiding the clinical approach. Some tentative suggestions are provided.",

      "title": "Understanding The Weak Opioids",
      "abstract": "Abstract When pain is moderate and can’t be controlled by the non-opioid (nonnarcotic) drugs, the next step is to use a weak opioid, of which codeine is the most well known. Like the strong opioids, these drugs typically cause constipation, which can be prevented with laxatives (such as senna [Senokot-S], Metamucil, Milk of Magnesia, Dulcolax, or suppositories), stool softeners (such as Colace), or enemas as needed (see Chapter 10). Nausea and vomiting are also sometimes a side effect, although these side effects usually last only a few days with consistent use of these medications. Although physical dependence (which means withdrawal symptoms would occur if the drug were stopped suddenly) and tolerance (which means that, as the body adapts to the dose, more is needed to achieve the same painrelieving effect) sometimes occur, they are usually not important problems when the weak opioids are used for pain. These drugs are not really ‘‘weak’‘; they are just considered weaker than the ‘‘strong’‘opioids (such as morphine) because their dosage is limited by the other compounds with which they are formulated, such as Tylenol or aspirin. Because the dosing guidelines and side effects are so different for the so-called ‘‘strong’‘opioids, a fuller discussion of their use will be explored in the next chapter.",

For instance, chorea, tics, and stereotypies are hyperkinetic movements reported in people taking amphetamines. Symptoms usually manifest within the first hours of drug use, subsiding thereafter. In some patients, however, movement disorders can have a chronic course, persisting even after the end of amphetamine misuse.

      "title": "Overreaching/Overtraining",
      "abstract": "Are you struggling with your exercise/conditioning routine or feeling a bit washed out, stale, and drained? Perhaps your muscles are persistently feeling heavy, stiff, a bit sore, and your exercise program has ceased to be enjoyable. If so, you may be suffering from a condition referred to as \"overreaching\" or, in more severe cases, \"overtraining syndrome.\" Overreaching is broken into functional and nonfunctional states, both of which respond to extra rest. Nonfunctional overreaching leads to a more extended period of decreased performance than functional overreaching and is accompanied by neuroendocrine and/or psychological symptoms. Overtraining is considered severe nonfunctional overreaching that results in a prolonged performance decrement (>2 months) and more severe symptoms. Effective conditioning requires a balance between intense training sessions and periods of rest/recovery. Too much overload and/or not enough recovery can result in both physiological and psychological symptoms that limit performance and may cause one to cease participation in a previously enjoyable activity. In many noncompetitive exercisers, the condition is often the result of inadequate rest/recovery because of busy work lives, family, work and health stressors, meal skipping, and poor sleep. Exercise can become addictive because of the effects of endorphins, dopamine, and other exercise-generated factors on the brain. This addiction can easily result in frequent intense training sessions that are not interspersed with adequate recovery periods. This phenomenon, especially when combined with the increasing popularity of intense multievent endurance competitions and intense group training programs, places individuals at increased risk for developing a nonfunctional state and, in more severe cases, overtraining syndrome. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS More than 125 signs and symptoms have been identified in published literature, making a definitive diagnosis challenging. The most common symptoms include: • Persistent heavy, stiff, and sore muscles • Persistent fatigue, washed-out feeling • Decreased performance and ability to maintain the training regimen • Increased susceptibility to infections, colds, headaches • Nagging and somewhat chronic injuries • Sleep disturbances • Decreased mental concentration and restlessness • Increased irritability • Depression • Tachycardia and, in some cases, bradycardia • Loss of appetite and weight loss • Bowel movement changes • Absence of menstruation TREATMENT AND PREVENTION The primary treatment is rest and, with more severe cases, an extended break from training. Improved quality of sleep, appropriate nutrition and hydration, and addressing nonexercise stressors are essential for full recovery. In some cases, your physician may choose to rule out other potential organic causes related to a variety of illnesses and health conditions. Prevention of nonfunctional overreaching and overtraining is critical to continued enjoyment of and benefit from your exercise training program. Following are a few key tips: • Listen to your body and take extra recovery time as indicated. • Follow the 10% rule; don't increase training volume and/or intensity by more than 10% at a time. • Follow a periodization format; intersperse periods of intense/high-volume training with extended periods of rest/recovery and/or cross-training. • Recovery/rest between intense workouts is critical because this is when muscle tissue repair and growth occur; usually 24 to 72 hours depending on the intensity and volume of the session. • You shouldn't feel wiped out following a hard workout; you should feel like you could do more; if not, you are doing too much. • Proper nutrition and hydration are important; consulting a sports dietician may be helpful. • Quality sleep is essential. • Variety in your training is healthy; don't do the same thing all the time. Maintaining a training log can be helpful in identifying periods of overreaching and the need for extra recovery. Include variables such as your resting heart rate, sleep, weight (for weight loss), mood, workout intensity/duration, and how muscles and joints respond. With appropriate recovery and using a periodization plan for your long-term training, you will be able to minimize the risk of overtraining and keep your exercise and competitions fun and enjoyable.",

      "title": "New Clinical Implications of Opiate Maintenance Treatments",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor\r\n\r\nOpiate addiction is a chronic mental illness with severe repercussion in personal and public health. Various medicaments have been subjected to research in order to find a proper treatment, methadone is the most and wide used drug, buprenorphine/naloxone is the most recent ones, but other choices have been proposed such as prescribing heroin (1). The mentioned treatments, are considered as maintenance ones, because, the chronic illnesses need a longtime approach. Other possibilities have been studied, for example the detoxification (conventional or ultra-rapid) as well as the use of opiate antagonist as naltrexone. On the other hand, a long period of dis habituation or relapse prevention is required after detoxification of all sorts of addictions, including opiate dependency.\r\n\r\nOn this second phase, psychological therapies are very important, as well as social and family support. Most patients need during dis habituation (of heroin addiction) a preliminary period of opiate maintenance with methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone (2).\r\n\r\nSide effects, as well as notwell-known effects, of drug and treatments are a very interesting goal of research. The hypogonadotrophic effect of opioids can be observed even after the administration of a single opioid dose, both in laboratory animals and in humans (3). Other studies have reported that methadone and buprenorphine are opioids with effects on spermatogenesis (4) and secondary sex organs. It seems probable that these drugs could affect testes volume.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, those effects have quantitative differences depending on the opiate as showed in the paper titled “A quantitative and qualitative study of rat testis following administration of methadone and buprenorphine” (5).\r\n\r\nHeidari et al. observed Buprenorphine treatment is more appropriate for treating opiate addiction in male rats since it does not affect normal testicular structure and function (5). Those results should be considered by all the professionals involved in addictions and their co-morbidities (dual pathology) research projects and treatment, not only because of the consequences of this side effect on sexuality or reproduction, but also how the testosterone deficiency is related to the not well-known effects of opioid maintenance treatments, as its antipsychotic properties or its influence on personality dimensions as reward dependence on opiate dependents type II or antisocial (6).",

The websites of psychiatry organizations describe the symptoms of post-traumatic stress as ranging from sleeplessness, nightmares to grief and depression – with accompanying physical signs such as headaches and irregular heartbeats.

Addison’s disease usually presents with non-specific symptoms like fatigue, nausea, vomiting, hyperpigmentation and generalized weakness. These symptoms are most often ignored or misinterpreted with other more common diseases. This is the major reason that this disease is under-diagnosed. Therefore, to establish a diagnosis high index of suspicion is needed.We are reporting a case of 10 years old boy who presented with recurrent episode of severe vomiting and generalized weakness. This kind of presentation of Addison’s disease is rather unusual and mainstay of diagnosis is clinical based.TAJ 2016; 29(2): 66-69",

Some types of bipolar depression may be considered as atypical if accompanied by reversed vegetative change. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are more effective than placebo in treating atypical depression, but their reported superiority to tricyclic antidepressants awaits confirmation, for which the development of appropriate operational criteria would be helpful.

In fact, forensic pathologists have often divided these drug-related custody deaths into four different categories: (a) death during arrest and transport or soon thereafter; (b) death within 12 hours of arrest: (c) death after 12 hours, but within a few days to weeks; and (d) death after days to weeks of incarceration (2). Death within 12 hours of arrest is commonly associated with massive drug overdose, such as can occur with smugglers who conceal drugs within body cavities, an act that is known as \"body packing.\" Deaths that occur days to weeks or longer after incarceration can be associated with drug withdrawal or other natural causes related to drug use (2).",

Although research studies sometimes require a speciﬁc quantitative deﬁnition, a patient’s subjective judgment that sleep is insufﬁcient, inadequate, or nonrestorative is the most important factor in clinical practice. Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint. Transient insomnia lasts less than one week, and short-term insomnia one to four weeks. Chronic insomnia, insomnia lasting more than one month, affects between 10% and 35% of the population in the western world (3,4). The number of chronic insomniacs rises with age, and women of all ages complain of insomnia more often thanmen (3,5). Insomnia is frequently associatedwith othermedical complaints and psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety, worry, and depression. Stressful life events (difﬁculties in interpersonal relationships, family discord, problems at work, and ﬁnancial troubles) may also generate a nonrestorative sleep complaint. Insomnia is not a speciﬁc illness or disease, but rather a symptom or consequence of other primary disorders. “Poor quality of sleep” is a common complaint in the family members of chronic insomniacs. However, it is difﬁcult to gauge the extent to which the emotional problems favouring the onset of a sleep disorder in adulthood are due to a genetic predisposition or the result of having lived in a family burdened by affective problems and/or interpersonal conﬂicts.",

Denial seems to be for them an adequate defense against anxiety. (2) Others are disoriented and manifest neurologic disturbance immediately after awakening, without a lucid interval. The sensorium begins to clear five days after surgery. (3) Some patients go into delirium after being lucid for as long as a week and have hallucinations, illusions, and motor excitation for a few days-or over several weeks. Pathologic brain changes that are apparently anatomical correlates of neurologic deficits in delirium include anoxic lesions of the hippocampus, and infarcted foci. Physiologic factors that contribute to this reaction include: long periods of extracorporeal circulation, arterial hypotension during surgery, emboli, and low postoperative cardiac output. Age, and the type and severity of heart impairment are also factors. Psychologic factors to be taken into account include preexisting psychopathology and the failure of denial under the stress of physical symptoms or hospitalization. Delirium is fostered by sensory overload (or deprivation) in the recovery room and intensive care unit, and by staff tension. Modification of the intensive care unit environment, the administration of antipsychotic drugs, and metabolic correctives are recommended. Preoperative psychologic evaluation, with therapy as needed, preliminary familiarization with perioperative procedures, as well as collaboration between psychiatrist and surgeon, can do much to prevent post-cardiotomy delirium.",

Compared with other atypical antipsychotics, it has a favorable side effect profile, but overdose experience is limited. Case Report A 3-year-old drug-naive patient accidentally ingested 200 mg of aripiprazole. This ingestion resulted in immediate lethargy with brief improvement 16 hours after ingestion and subsequent decline 2 hours later. Patient returned to baseline 72 hours after ingestion. Discussion Unlike previous case reports, this patient displayed a biphasic course of somnolence. Previous reports have described delayed onset and prolonged sedation in response to an aripiprazole overdose. Current recommendations regarding monitoring after ingestion do not account for possible worsening of symptoms after improvement. Conclusion It is important to recognize the need for a longer observation period after a significant aripiprazole overdose as a variable course of somnolence may be witnessed.",

      "title": "The patient burden of opioidinduced bowel dysfunction",
      "abstract": "Orally formulated opioids are commonly prescribed analgesics to treat severe pain. Among severe adverse effects are respiratory depression, sedation and opioid-addiction; less dangerous, however still burdensome for the many treated patients, are symptoms such as nausea, cognitive impairment and bowel dysfunction. It has e.g. been shown that the patient experienced burdens of opioid induced bowel dysfunction (OIBD) and opioid induced constipation (OIC) negatively impact the quality of life of these patients. Consequently, patients often take less medication than prescribed to dampen these adverse effects. This review focuses a thorough description of the underlying mechanistic causes of OIBD, originating from binding of exogenous opioids to the peripheral opioid receptors in the enteric nervous system of the gut. Consequently, the bowel becomes dysfunctional function changes caused by alterations in i) motility, ii) secretion and absorption and iii)sphincter functions. Such alterations lead to a variety of symptoms including gastro-esophageal reflux, abdominal pain, prolongation of transit times and dry hardened stool. Thus, the experienced psychological burden of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction is a net-result of its physical occurrence as well as its negative impact on health-related quality of life. Unfortunately, gastrointestinal dysfunction is considered a taboo and people may refrain to describe and discuss the experienced burdens. This review targets health care professionals, who to a higher degree are encouraged to discuss openly if presence of OIBD/OIC impacts the daily life and social activities of the patients. Finally, different mechanistic treatment approaches are reviewed in order to provide clinicians with different pharmacological options and strategies, which include traditional laxatives, prokinetics and co-administration of opioid antagonists. Even though the opioid-antagonists have proved to be superior to placebo in the relief of OIBD/OIC, further clinical studies are needed in order to optimize treatments for the benefit of future patients.",

During the phase of facilitation, the patient has a feeling of increased well-being and shows greater spontaneity, less resistance, and enhanced insight, often expressing previously repressed ideational content and affects. 6. The period of sedation lasts for several hours and is not associated with drowsiness or confusion. Sleep is usually improved the following night and other sedation is often unnecessary. 7. In states of acute manic excitement, repeated daily administration of nitrous oxide has controlled and terminated the attack in some cases. 8. Nitrous oxide hypoxia produces some of the features of the \"shock treatments\" as well as of narcoanalysis, but it is safe, convenient, and simple in administration and may be used in ambulatory patients without interruption of their ordinary activities. 9. The theories on the pharmacological action of nitrous oxide and the reason for its choice are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol withdrawal syndrome develops in individuals with alcohol dependence who discontinue or reduce alcohol intake after long-term or binge drinking. Withdrawal symptoms usually occur 6–8 hours after the last alcohol consumption and peak between 24–72 hours. Typical manifestations include tremor, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, agitation, and excess sweating. Complicated withdrawal syndrome may manifest with seizures (including cluster seizures), status epilepticus, acute psychosis and delirium, when hallucinations are accompanied by disorientation in time, place and situation. About 10–15% of patients develop complicated withdrawal syndrome. The seizures in alcohol withdrawal syndrome are triggered in the brain stem and have a mechanism other than that of classic epileptic seizures. Benzodiazepines, which are more effective than other classes of anticonvulsants (they primarily reduce the frequency of convulsions in the first two days after alcohol discontinuation and significantly reduce the risk of death), are the gold standard for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The Clinical Institute of Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale (CIWA-Ar) is a helpful tool for making decisions on treatment initiation or discontinuation. It should be noted that chronic use of benzodiazepines in the secondary prevention of alcohol withdrawal seizures is not recommended due to the addictive potential of these agents and a more severe course of alcohol withdrawal seizures with benzodiazepine co-dependence.",

      "title": "Agenda for specialty section in addiction medicine",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Addictive behavior is any activity or behavior that has become the major focus of a person's life to the exclusion of other activities, or that has begun to harm the individual or others physically, mentally, or socially. Addictive behavior increases the risk of disease and/or associated personal and social problems. They are often experienced subjectively as \"loss of control\", that is, the behavior continues to occur despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use. Addiction implies psychological dependence, physical dependence, and a set of withdrawal symptoms if the substance is unavailable.[1] There are many common characteristics among the various addictive behaviors. First, the individual becomes obsessed (constantly thinks) of the object, activity, or substance and will seek it out, often to the detriment of work or interpersonal relationships. The person will compulsively engage in the activity even if he does not want to. Upon cessation of the activity, withdrawal symptoms of irritability, craving, and restlessness will often occur. The person does not appear to have control as to when, how long, or how much he will continue the behavior. He often denies problems resulting from his engagement in the behavior even though others can see the negative effects of it. Further, individuals with addictive behaviors will usually have low self esteem.[2] BURDEN OF PROBLEM Substance-related disorders have become matters of global concern because of impact on individual health, familial and social consequences, criminal and legal problems, and the effects on national productivity and economy. All the problems from use to dependence and from the most innocuous substance like tea/coffee to the most hard substances, contribute to the cost that the human society or a particular nation has to bear. In India, although alcohol use in ancient times and cannabis/affim (opium) in more recent times have been known and reported for some time, substance use problems have been recognized to have a significant importance as a public health problem only very recently. They are of particular concern among slum dwellers, transport workers, and youth.[3] Tobacco is the substance most easily accessible worldwide as well as in India. About one-fifth of the Indian population abuse tobacco, about 70% of this in the smoking form.[4] Passive smoking is a significant health hazard. There are 700,000 deaths per year due to smoking and 800,000–900,000 deaths per year due to all forms of tobacco use in India. Many of the deaths (>50%) are occurring below 70 years.[5] An estimated 34–42% of adult Indian population reports having used alcohol in their lifetime; 5–7% has been estimated to be abuser of alcohol; and 10–20 million persons have been estimated to be in need of treatment for dependence. A survey in India revealed that medical professionals had a higher rate of use and heavy use than general population.[5] Nearly 20–30% of admissions and consultations are due to alcohol-related problems in different healthcare settings but are under-recognized by primary care physicians.[6] With respect to heroin, India has now changed from being a transit country to a user country. General population surveys in India show opioid abuse rate as high as 24.8%. Another great concern especially with injectable opioids is spread of AIDS. Further, cannabis abuse in general population in India is 33% and abuse of tranquilizers is as high as 54%.[3] Remediation at central level: 'The Drug Deaddiction Program' was started in 1987–88 with the establishment of five deaddiction centers in central institutions, viz. AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi; Lady Harding Medical College and Hospital; New Delhi; JIPMER, Pondicherry; and PGI, Chandigarh. The center at NIMHANS, Bangalore was established later as the sixth center. More recently, in 1999, a separate deaddiction center with inpatient setup was started in Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is mainly involved in providing treatment services to the addicts, whereas the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with other aspects of the problem like awareness creation, counseling, and rehabilitation. From 1992–93, the scope of the scheme was enlarged to include assistance to State Governments/Union Territories for developing deaddiction centers in identified medical colleges/district-level hospitals. WHAT WORKS IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS? Treatment of substance-use disorders typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Techniques for medically assisted detoxification are widespread and effective. The following are the different strategies that are found useful in management of substance dependence.[7] i) Home versus inpatient detoxification Published reports have consistently failed to find any difference in outcome between long and short inpatient detoxification programs. Clients can usually complete home detoxification in 5–9 days. In ideal circumstances they are visited twice daily for the first three days and medication is supervised by a relative. Clients are breathalyzed and medication withheld if they have consumed significant amounts of alcohol. ii) Brief interventions Brief interventions are short, focused discussions (often of less than 15 minutes) that can reduce alcohol consumption in some individuals with hazardous drinking. They are designed to promote awareness of the negative effects of drinking and to motivate change. Brief interventions were shown to be moderately effective in the nontreatment-seeking groups, especially for those with less-severe alcohol problems. iii) Abstinence versus controlled use This is a great debate. The goal of controlled (moderate or nonproblem) drinking usually includes some limit on alcohol consumption (e.g., 4 units/day) provided that drinking does not lead to signs of dependence, intoxication, or social, legal and health problems. This runs contrary to the abstinence-based philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous. Controlled drinking may be an option for young, socially stable drinkers with short, less-severe drinking histories. An individual's belief that controlled drinking is an achievable goal is also a good prognostic factor. Most authors agree that controlled drinking should not be recommended for people with heavy dependence. Controlled drinking is an attractive option for public health strategies aimed at nondependent problem drinking. This principle can also be tried for other substances. iv) Alcoholic Anonymous Based on Minnesota model, they involve the recognition that alcoholism is a relapsing illness that requires complete abstinence. Clients acknowledge the problems due to their alcoholism and are encouraged to attend 90 meetings in 90 days. Participants may engage the support of a sponsor who is an AA member who has been sober for at least one year. Similarly, there is narcotic anonymous for opioid addicts and nicotine anonymous for nicotine dependents. The evidence suggests that this twelve-step approach is at least as effective as most structured psychotherapies but not superior to any alternative treatments. v) Psychological therapies Motivational enhancement therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy Social skills training Community reinforcement approach Social behavior and network therapy Contingency management Cue exposure vi) Therapeutic community It requires prolonged residence (often 12–18 months) and it is extremely expensive. Most studies of therapeutic communities are conducted without control groups and the lack of randomization probably leads to selection bias in favor of more motivated patients. vii) Drug treatments Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. Other drugs which have been used for the same are topiramate, citrated calcium carbimide, SSRIs, tiapiride, nalmefene, metronidazole, and ondansetron. The oldest among these is disulfiram, being used from 1950s. Naltrexone was launched in India in 1998 and acamprosate in 2002. However, none has been proved to be significantly better than the other agents. In other words, all are equally effective.[5] Bupropion has been said to be the first line drug for nicotine craving. Another first line agent is nicotine itself, in the form of gum, inhaler, lozenge, patch, and nasal spray. Clonidine and nortriptyline are said to be the second line drugs. But the success rate with each of these drugs is marginal.[8] Sustained release bupropion is also considered to be effective as anticraving agent in cannabis dependence. Nefazodone also significantly reduces cannabis withdrawal related anxiety and muscle pain, while having no effect on dysphoria. The embryonic work on CB1 selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists such as SR141716 (rimonabant) has demonstrated that it successfully blocks the acute psychological and physiological effects of smoked cannabis in experienced human consumers and is well tolerated. There has been even less work on the use of cannabis agonists. However, this is a promising area for future research as a number of oral and inhaled THC preparations are being developed for medical cannabis trials.[9] Maintenance treatment is increasingly emphasized as the main therapy of opioid dependency. Abstinence-oriented therapy is nevertheless an important alternative, mainly psychological, and has considerable advantages for those benefitting from this strategy. Methadone or buprenorphine in tapering doses are used for detoxification along with α2 adrenergic agonists like clonidine or lofexidine. Time-limited agonist therapy is a specific approach using agonist stabilization as the basis for therapeutic interventions preceding tapering off of the maintenance therapy. The preventive effect of naltrexone and other antagonists is well known but the attrition rate is very high. It is also feasible for addicts to be introduced to naltrexone by detoxification under anesthesia or sedation.[10] ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY As elaborated above, substance use is affecting a disproportionately large section of people of India. The prevalence is more than that of all severe mental disorders combined. When it comes to health problems, it should not be gauged merely by its prevalence, but by the health burden and social cost that it wreaks on the society. Psychiatric comorbidities like mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders are also very commonly associated with substance dependence. Thus drug addiction is a titanic problem that needs special clinical attention. Today we are equipped with an arena of treatment strategies, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. What we need is just an improvisation in its implementation. Treatment can be better systematized when addiction medicine is upgraded as a specialty. The specialty section on addiction medicine needs to fulfill the following aims and objectives.[6] Promote and advance the bio-psycho-social contributions to the science and practice of addiction medicine in all its different manifestations. Promote the improvement of the health of persons directly or indirectly impacted by substance-related problems. Promote prevention, control, treatment, and relief of all substance-related problems, as well as conditions which constitute high risk for potential drug-related problems. This involves encouraging and enabling the members of the society to explore and pursue 'evidence based' treatment strategies and prevention methods. This includes liaison with other stake holders, including but not limited to government agencies overseeing health, social justice and welfare, and finance and human development; nongovernmental agencies involved in direct care of persons with substance abuse. Promote other medical specialties and primary healthcare providers. This also requires sharing the expertise of members of the society and other professionals involved in diverse fields such as school mental health, community based rehabilitation, epidemiology, drug trials, maintaining disease registries, to mention a few. Actively engage in advocacy in order to influence policy making and legislation, keeping in mind that substance-use disorders and their consequences constitute a grave public health disorder which imposes an unacceptably severe burden on the health and well being of the people of India. Formulate and recommend standards of treatment and rehabilitation of persons or populations affected directly or indirectly by substance-use disorders. In addition, it will be necessary to obtain recommendations for syllabi and commission resources for the education and training of medical and nonmedical personnel involved in the field. Safeguard the interest of psychiatrists and fellow professionals engaged in the practice of addiction medicine in India. Promote research in the field of addiction science with a focus on translating the benefits of research to the bedside and propagate the use of evidence-based interventions in the daily delivery of mental healthcare. FUNCTIONING OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY SECTION The following are some of the activities that are being suggested as functions of specialty section of addiction medicine:[6] A web portal, linked to the web page of the Indian Psychiatric Society, which will initially host information of relevance to the practice of addiction medicine in India, with direct and indirect links to published or unpublished scientific papers, databases, treatment protocols, available treatment agencies, online resources, etc; and later e-learning sites for online education and training. Coordinating Continuing Medical Education (CME) pertaining to the aspect of the science and practice of addiction medicine, with special emphasis on underserved areas like the northeastern states, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc. Enabling and commissioning position papers on the impact of substance abuse in India, with a view to influence public policy. Engaging with relevant organizations to promote demand-reduction strategies, such as the police to prevent drinking and driving, primary health providers, and emergency rooms for early detection and brief intervention Pursuing the aim of working to safeguard vulnerable populations, for example, inoculating children and adolescents through skills training and sensitizing physicians and pharmacists to prevent over the counter drug abuse. Examining the possibility of creating a national registry, using standardized data-entry protocols. CONCLUSION Substance-use disorders form more than 20% of the case load of psychiatric practitioners. However, practitioners have an attitude of therapeutic nihilism toward the addicted patient. This may be due to various reasons like lack of education about alcohol and substance abuse, attitude of hostility or aversion toward alcoholics, inability or discomfort to deal with the associated psychosocial issues, and learned pessimism about treatment – especially based on experience treating late stage alcoholics. However for effective outcome, early identification and treatment should be the goal. This is possible with more sophistication in the science of addiction medicine. Thus, evolving of a specialty section of addiction medicine is the need of the day.",

Agents with shorter half-lives such as venlafaxine, fluvoxamine, and paroxetine should be tapered gradually. Discontinuation symptoms, which frequently emerge after abrupt discontinuation or intermittent non-compliance and, less frequently, during dose reduction, are generally mild, short-lived, and self-limiting but can be distressing and may lead to missed work days and decreased productivity. The symptoms may be somatic (e.g., dizziness and light-headedness; nausea and vomiting; fatigue, lethargy, myalgia, chills, and other flu-like symptoms; sensory and sleep disturbances) or psychological (anxiety and/or agitation, crying spells, irritability). Mild symptoms can often be treated by simply reassuring the patient that they are usually transient, but for more severe symptoms, it may be necessary to reinstitute the dosage of the original antidepressant and slow the rate of taper. Symptoms of discontinuation may be mistaken for physical illness or relapse into depression; misdiagnosing the symptoms may lead to unnecessary, costly tests and treatment. Thus, health care professionals need to be educated about the potential adverse effects of SRI discontinuation.",

      "abstract": "Pain is an unpleasant feeling and experience that is caused by a potential or practical injury and its control is so important that the American Pain Society has introduced pain as the 5 th vital sign for emphasizing the importance of pain and controlling it. Almost all humans have experienced moderate to severe pain and most of the time the experience has happened following surgical procedures, medical conditions or trauma. When pain manifests in a clinical condition, health care staff are responsible for following it and relieving it as a goal and responsibility. Pain affects all individuals regardless of age, sex, race, and socioeconomic status and untreated pain can negatively affect various systems of the body and lead to many consequences. Increase in serum level of cortisol, nor epinephrine, and renin angiotension, hyperglycemia, decrease in insulin, manifestation of anxiety, cardiac effects such as ischemia, dysrhythmia, increase in pulse, increase in cardiac load, increased oxygen uptake, increased blood coagulation potential, hypertension especially in patients with head injuries, decreased blood oxygen level, increased body fluid volume, drop in blood potassium, fatigue, muscle cramps, decreased immune system function, decreased ability for wound healing and etc. are among the undesirable side effects of pain. In addition, not treating acute pains also leads to bearing unnecessary pain, elongated duration of hospitalization, increased medical costs and probability of acute pain progressing and developing into chronic pain. The financial burden of not treating pain in America has been estimated to be about 100 billion dollars per year. Pain is a common complaint and makes up a considerable portion of reasons that patients call pre-hospital emergency services and is usually present in the injured and trauma patients. Study results showed that 20% to 31% of the patients presenting via ambulances had moderate and severe pain. Additionally, with 52% to 86% prevalence in emergencies, pain is a key topic in health care of various countries. Pre-hospital emergency staff members are the first in line among health care staff that face patients at times of disaster and accident and are more exposed to the patients’ pain. Despite the quantitative growth of pre-hospital emergency bases to 1900 bases throughout Iran, observations of researchers and evidence and instructions of emergency medical services (EMS) of Iran are indicative of not using enough analgesic drugs, especially opioid analgesic drugs, as a means to relieve patients’ pain in EMS ambulances. Some studies have mentioned that about one third of the pre-hospital patients and more than 80% of patients with bone fractures report moderate to severe pain and on the other hand the positive effect of using pain killers in the regions that used them have been shown to be obvious in most patients. It seems that using analgesics in EMS is a very important topic and researchers express that proper pain management is an important principle in pre-hospital care and opioid analgesics such as morphine and fentanyl have a special place in the instructions of EMS as treatments for acute trauma and non-trauma pains, especially cardiac chest pains, in some advanced countries regarding emergency care. Considering the afore-mentioned points concerning the importance of pain and its treatment, especially the importance of treating pain in traumatic and ischemic cardiac diseases, high prevalence of pain in pre-hospital missions, severity and type of pre-hospital missions, which are mostly associated with pain, high costs of not treating pain and the obvious need for using pain killers in trauma and ischemic cardiac diseases, isn’t it time to introduce a more effective and scientific approach in EMS? Isn’t it better to add a few types of analgesics and opioid drugs to the equipment provided at patients’ bedside, at least for ischemic cardiac diseases and severe trauma? Although the result of a study carried out in Khuzestan province showed that EMS staff members were weak regarding drug information and calculations and other studies have also expressed that drug dosage and use of opioid drugs might not be done correctly or opioid drugs might be abused in some cases, none are convincing reasons for not using these drugs. These problems could be solved by more and better training for EMS staff, creating offline and online protocols and useful programs for preventing abuse of analgesic drugs and these drugs could be effectively used in EMS. Therefore, we again note that this treatment priority should not be overlooked for any reason.",

      "title": "Porphyria: Reexamination of Psychiatric Implications",
      "abstract": "Acute intermittent porphyria mimics a variety of commonly occurring disorders and thus poses a diagnostic quagmire. Psychiatric manifestations include hysteria, anxiety, depression, phobias, psychosis, organic disorders, agitation, delirium, and altered consciousness ranging from somnolence to coma. Some patients develop psychosis similar to schizophrenia. Psychiatric hospitals have a disproportionate number of patients with this disorder as only difficult and resistant patients accumulate there. Presence of photosensitive porphyrins in the urine is diagnostic. When porphyrins are absent, excess of alpha aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen are present in the urine. The definitive test is to measure monopyrrole porphobilinogen deaminase in RBCs. This diagnosis should be entertained in the following situations: (a) unexplained leukocytosis; (b) unexplained neuropathy; (c) etiologically obscure neurosis or psychosis; (d) 'idiopathic' seizure disorder; (e) unexplained abdominal pain; (f) conversion hysteria, and (g) susceptibility to stress. Porphyria is important in psychiatry as it may present with only psychiatric symptoms; it may masquerade as a psychosis and the patient may be treated as a schizophrenic person for years; the only manifestation may be histrionic personality disorder which may not receive much attention. Diagnosis is based on a high index of suspicion and appropriate investigation. Various psychotropic drugs exacerbate acute attacks. While it is important not to use the unsafe drugs in porphyric patients, it is also imperative to look for this diagnosis in cases where these drugs produce unprecedented drug reactions.",

Opioid medications are classified as depressants and induce serious depression and anxiety, particularly with chronic and persistent use. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM5) provides diagnoses for these opioid-induced conditions. Substance-induced disorders, particularly for depression and anxiety, include intoxication and withdrawal, substance/medication-induced depressive disorder and substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder. Importantly, DSM-5 criteria indicate that diagnoses for major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder cannot be made if there is a substance, such as opioid medications, responsible for the condition. Often the way to distinguish between a substanceinduced disorder and an independent major depressive or anxiety disorder is to discontinue the opioid medications. Given that opioids are not efficacious for long-term prescribing, discontinuation of the medication is the treatment of choice.",

      "abstract": "Cytokines whose primary function is that of acting as signaling molecules of the immune system, have been implicated in the provocation or exacerbation of mood disorders such as depression. This position has been supported by several lines of evidence; (1) proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α) and bacterial endotoxins elicit sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, soporific effects) and symptoms of anxiety/depression that may be attenuated by chronic antidepressant treatment. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) induces less profound sickness, but elicits anhedonia, a key symptom of depression; (2) neuroendocrine and central neurotransmitter changes, reminiscent of those implicated in depression, may be elicited by some of these cytokines, and these effects are exacerbated by stressors; (3) severe depressive illness is accompanied by elevations of cytokine production or levels, although these effects are not necessarily attenuated with antidepressant medication; and (4) immunotherapy, using IL-2 or IFN-α, promote depressive symptoms that are attenuated by antidepressant treatment. It is proposed that chronic cytokine elevations engender neuroendocrine and brain neurotransmitter changes that are interpreted by the brain as being stressors, and contribute to the development of depression. Further, the effects of the cytokine treatments may act synergistically with stressors, and cytokines may provoke a sensitization effect so that the effects of later stressor experiences are exacerbated.

The diagnosis, usually easy, may be beset with several traps: alcoholism may be unrecognized, or a diagnosis other than withdrawal syndrome may be wrongly made, or again a complication may be either overlooked or erroneously suspected. An acute withdrawal syndrome normally regresses in less than one week, but a subacute withdrawal syndrome, which presents as signs of residual hyperexcitability of the central nervous system, must be recognized, as it may persist for several months. Beside delirium tremens, with its mandatory and well-established treatment, prevention of alcohol withdrawal syndrome and treatment of its initial stages raise no problems, as it consists above all of psychotherapy combined by such tranquillizers as febarbamate or a benzodiazepine taken in well-specified dosage.",

      "abstract": "Compliance is generally defined as the extent to which a patient adheres to a treatment regimen and, specifically, takes medication as prescribed. While little research is available about the number of patients who consistently skip antidepressant doses, the literature indicates that about 30% of patients discontinue treatment suddenly within the first month. Both missed doses and abrupt stoppage of treatment place a patient at risk for experiencing discontinuation symptoms. A variety of reasons ranging from forgetfulness to lack of knowledge about the importance of taking every dose may lead to nonadherence to an antidepressant regimen. By spending time on patient education, providing reasons why patients should take every antidepressant dose, discussing alternative treatments, and conveying empathy, support for, and understanding of the patient, physicians may be able to minimize noncompliance and consequently decrease the likelihood that a patient may experience discontinuation symptoms. Discontinuation of an antidepressant can cause a patient to be irritable, experience severe dizziness, or act emotionally absent, which may have a sustained adverse impact both on job performance and on family and social relationships.",

      "title": "The Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Abstract The opioid withdrawal syndrome is a collection of self-reported symptoms and observable physiological signs that an individual who is physically dependent on opioids is undergoing after an episode of acute or protracted abstinence from opioids. The acute syndrome onsets generally within a few hours of the last dose and a full resolution of the acute syndrome may take up to 14 days. The protracted syndrome follows the acute syndrome and can take several months to fully remit. Opioid withdrawal is extremely aversive, and its avoidance is often cited by patients as a primary reason for continuing to use opioids. The opioid treatment infrastructure is largely organized around the management of opioid withdrawal, through provision of medications meant to lessen or suppress its severity. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of opioid withdrawal, including its historical understanding and characterization, the presentation of individual symptoms, and the scales on which it is measured. It also discusses individual variation in its presentation and time course, and the importance of withdrawal in the context of treatment. Finally, special contributors to withdrawal severity, including non-opioid brain systems, context-specific cues, peripheral mechanisms, and demographic level factors associated with withdrawal severity, are presented. The reader will understand the experience of withdrawal, how it can be assessed, and its contribution to opioid use disorder treatment.",

To avoid missing a serious underlying condition, look for red flags, such as unexplained weight loss or acute bladder or bowel function changes in a patient with low back pain. Nonopioid medications can be more effective than opioids for certain types of pain (for example, antidepressants or anticonvulsants for neuropathic pain). When NSAIDs are indicated, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors are better choices for patients who are at risk for GI problems or who are receiving anticoagulants. However, if nonspecific NSAIDs are not contraindicated, consider using these far less expensive agents. The tricyclic antidepressants are more effective as analgesics than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. When opioids are indicated, start with less potent agents (tramadol, codeine, oxycodone, hydrocodone) and then progress to stronger ones (hydromorphone, fentanyl, methadone, morphine) if needed.",

It is usually noticed within days or weeks of either starting or stopping antipsychotic treatment or changing dosage. Its clinical presentation may resemble other conditions such as anxiety and psychomotor agitation. The management of akathisia involves three steps: prevention, antipsychotic drug adjustment, and symptomatic strategies. Risks and benefits of antipsychotics should always be weighed-in to avoid akathisia. Even though second-generation antipsychotics were considered to have reduced risk for akathisia, recent data suggest that using second generation antipsychotics with high risk of akathisia would be as harmful as using any first-generation antipsychotics. Combinations, rapid upward or downward titrations, and sudden discontinuation of antipsychotics should be avoided. Beta blockers, anticholinergics, serotonergic medications, and benzodiazepines can help control the symptoms of akathisia.",

      "title": "Movement Disorders",
      "abstract": "Patients with mental disorders exhibit a range of abnormal movements. The severely depressed are given to hand wringing, pacing, and restlessness. Others lie in bed, stare into space, and posture for hours or days. At times, this behavior is so extreme as to be a stupor. Psychotic patients exhibit tremors or peculiar facial and body movements described as parkinsonism, dystonia, or dyskinesia. Manic patients are in constant motion. Children and adolescents bang their heads and pick at their skin, injuring themselves. Little attention is paid to such behavior unless it overwhelms the patient’s life, but it does distress the patient, the family, and the community. These motor symptoms often bring psychiatric patients to medical care. Catatonia is the motor syndrome characterized by muscular rigidity, unusual posturing, negativism (refusal to obey simple commands), mutism (persistent silence), echolalia (repetition of what has been said), echopraxia (imitation of movements), and repeated stereotyped mannerisms. It appears suddenly and quickly immobilizes the patient or it appears insidiously. When it dominates behavior and threatens the patient’s life by the failure to eat or drink, treatment becomes compulsory. Forced feeding, bedsores resulting from immobility, muscular atrophy, bladder catheterization and consequent infection, and blood clots in immobilized limbs all take a terrible toll. If the clots move to the lungs or brain, stroke or death may ensue. Catatonia was first described as a consequence of intense emotional anguish and tension. Although the movements frequently respond to sedative drugs, ECT is a more complete and effective treatment. The condition is frequently seen in patients with affective illnesses— both depression and mania—in patients with systemic disorders, and in those with toxic brain states caused by hallucinogenic drugs. For decades, the prevailing belief in psychiatry was that each instance of catatonia represented a type of schizophrenia. The major classification systems in psychiatry—the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association and the International Classification of Diseases—assigned to all patients with catatonia the diagnosis of schizophrenia, catatonic type. As a consequence, few patients were treated with anticonvulsant sedatives or with ECT, because those treatments were not recognized as effective in schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Objective Investigation of mental disorders in 377 patients who met ICD-10 criteria for opioid dependence. Methods Clinical observation and psychological examination. Results It was shown that mental disorders of opioid addicts consist of three types of psychopathological categories: pro-addictive phenomena (personality features and co-morbid disorders predisposing to drug abuse), meta-addictive disorders (psychopathological states gained due to drug abuse) and addictive disorders proper (craving and drug-seeking behavior). Anxiety and other neurotic symptoms are predominant types of mental disorders in opioid addicts. The core disorder of neurosis spectrum disturbances is fear of abstinence or withdrawal phobia. Withdrawal phobia determines largely negative reinforcement of drug. This phenomenon results in anticipating intake of drug and augmentation of daily drug dose. Opioid abuse leads to addictive personality deformation which including such features as constant and hypertrophied demand for positive emotional states, intolerance to frustration and other discomfort, low threshold of stress susceptibility and increased stress vulnerability, permanent urge to modulate the psychic and physical condition by dint of drug use, marked egocentricity and motivational collapse. Distorted motivational hierarchy can be illustrated by phenomenon of attractive taxis: opioid addicts show preference for the activities which lead to afford pleasure only. “Illegal exploitation” of reward system by means of drug abuse results in crucial extinction of non-rewarding routine activities (such as work or studies). Conclusion It appears that a stability of neurotic spectrum disorders and addictive personality deformation is the principal reason of low efficiency of opioid dependence treatment.",

In 11% of the patients the \"on-off\" effect was studied (brisk alteranting Parkinsonic and improved states). Clinical observation during 14 hours a day was repeated with different dosages and different regimes of the drug; these modified the daily variations but did not eliminate the syndrome.

When the \"long-term syndrome\" is severe, at times it is necessary to stop the drug; the secondary effects are thus decreased and, when the medication is given again, the therapeutic effectiveness is temporarily restored. When the drug is stopped the patients should be watched, since a \"withdrawal syndrome\" may appear.",

The subject was a twenty-two year old unemployed male who had left school without formal qualifications and had been brought up by his grandparents since his parents' separation. He had been a bodybuilder for four years and misused combinations of oral and parenteral anabolic steroids in increasing doses for two years. His depressive symptoms included lowered mood, loss of energy, anhedonia, suicidal preoccupations, disturbed sleep, poor appetite and impaired concentration. It is proposed that unusually prolonged exposure to steroids followed by withdrawal was the most likely cause of the depression in this case and that biological vulnerability to affective disorder may explain the severity of the episode. Misuse of steroids needs to be considered in young physically active people presenting with depression.",

Objetivos: Revisar as características e pontos principais da migrânea. Materiais e Métodos: revisão narrativa realizada em bases de dados digitais, livros e informações de organizações de referência mundial. Resultados: A migrânea é um tipo de cefaleia primária de alta prevalência, sendo mais comum em mulheres. Pode ser com ou sem aura – sintomas neurológicos focais que precedem a dor – ou crônica. Caracteriza-se por cefaleia pulsátil, unilateral, de intensidade de moderada a grave, associada a náusea, vomito, foto ou fonofobia e que se agrava com atividades físicas rotineiras. Deve ser diferenciada de outras cefaleias primarias e, quando na presença de sinais de alarme, também das secundárias, em especial se na terceira idade. Fatores como odores e luzes fortes, consumo de bebida alcoólica, certos alimentos, jejum prolongado, distúrbios do sono e ciclo menstrual podem desencadear uma crise. Seu tratamento pode ser farmacológico ou não, além de envolver medidas gerais; e pode ser sintomático ou profilático – mais indicado em casos mais graves ou refratários. Dentre os medicamentos utilizados durante as crises há os específicos (triptanos e derivados da ergotamina) e não específicos (analgésicos e anti-inflamatórios não esteroidais). Conclusão: Conclui-se que a migrânea deve ser reconhecida e diagnosticada correta e precocemente, objetivando uma terapêutica adequada e individualizada para que se alcance uma melhora na qualidade de vida do paciente.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY The aim of this survey was to define the criteria for eliminating medication. In the first place the patient should not have had a seizure for 10 years. So long a period may seem excessive to some, but we believe that this study demonstrates that it is not too long; even after 10 years without seizures, several patients experienced them again when medication was stopped. As to absences, it is doubtlessly unnecessary to continue anti‐petit mal medication in many patients, but in all cases it is necessary to continue treatment to prevent possible generalized seizures. We propose the following considerations in each case: the clinical‐EEG form of the epilepsy; the number of seizures suffered by the patient, absence of repeated seizures or status and early initiation of medication; absence of permanent neurological or mental deficit; negative family history of seizures; absence of other antecedents, especially in the partial epilepsies (traumatic antecedent of epilepsy, however, is generally of good prognosis); absence of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities or prompt normalization of the EEG with medication (persistent focal activity does not however contraindicate eliminating medication when there have been no seizures). Abrupt elimination of medication is contra‐indicated; medication should be reduced slowly, generally over a period of more than 1 year. An increase in EEG abnormalities on reduction of medication makes a return to previous doses obligatory. Using these criteria, we have been able to eliminate medication in nearly half our patients. It is of course possible that some of them may have new seizures; according to Juul‐Jensen (1968), seizures may reappear as long as 5 years after medication has been stopped.",

Approximately 1% of Americans have used illicit stimulants in the past month, and nearly 25,000 deaths were attributed to stimulant overdose in 2017. Acute effects include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and euphoria. High doses of stimulants may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, severe hypertension, agitation, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, stroke, hyperthermia, or rhabdomyolysis. Abstinence after regular use of stimulants may lead to dysphoria, fatigue, insomnia, and agitation. People who use stimulants may present with acute effects or medical complications. Cocaine metabolites and amphetamines can be detected in urine for a few days after use. The most serious complications of acute use are cardiovascular (especially myocardial infarction and stroke) and psychiatric (agitation and delirium); the risk of hyperthermia is also increased. A number of psychosocial modalities appear to reduce stimulant use among selected individuals, including individual and group counseling, cognitive–behavioral therapy, contingency management, and community reinforcement. No medication has been consistently shown to reduce complications and use of stimulants, although prescription stimulants and topiramate show some promise for treating cocaine use disorder. Syringe exchange programs and safe consumption sites are associated with decreased stimulant use-related complications. Caffeine has mild stimulant effects and may lead to a mild dependence syndrome.",

Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is an epileptic condition, lasting more than 30 min, characterized by con tinuous or recurrent epileptic activity on EEG, which is responsible for various clinical symptoms (especially in mental status or behavior) in the absence of manifest seizure activity. It includes different clinical forms, from minor confusion to complex behavioral disorders, psychosis, or coma. These psychotic symptoms can be very complex and their differential diagnosis can be difficult. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient without previous personal or family recorded history of epilepsy and/or schizophrenic disorder, without identifiable stressors, showing a subacute episode of anxiety with aggression. Initially, he was discharged without treatment. Seven days later he went to the emergency services accompanied by his family members reporting delusions of injury. He presented a disorganized behavior with self-harm, anxiety, dysesthesia, cenestopathy and in ternal field hallucinations (auditory and visual). The initial EEG study revealed a nonconvulsive status with an active tempo ral focus. In this patient, the psychotic symptoms and EEG abnormalities consistent with NCSE appeared simultaneously. Once the EEG returned to normal, the symptoms only persisted residually and were compatible with intraictal psychosis.",

      "abstract": "Chronic pain, which can potentially develop from acute pain, subacute pain, or breakthrough pain, is generally defined as pain persisting for greater than three months with minimal relief. Chronic pain can be associated with a myriad of medical conditions. It is also one of the most common causes of disability, physical suffering, depression, and reduced quality of life. Treatment can vary depending on the underlying pathophysiology and can involve physical therapy, non-pharmaceutical approaches, pharmaceutical drugs, and invasive procedures. Currently available pharmaceutical agents have been effective for short-term management of chronic pain conditions, but few options address chronic pain with long-term efficacy. First-line pharmaceutical agents can potentially include over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription-strength non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which have been linked to numerous side effects. If chronic pain persists, steroids are frequently used to provide longer relief. For more progressive or resistant chronic pain and/or in conjunction with invasive procedures, opioids have been utilized for acute treatment and for long-term maintenance. While these agents have proven to be effective for both acute and long-term use due to their modulation at various peripheral and central opioid receptors, they can be associated with numerous side effects and tied to the risk of addiction. As such, an unmet need exists to identify treatment modalities that provide opioid-like pain relief without opioid-induced adverse effects and the potential for addiction. This narrative review will provide an overview of the currently available treatment modalities for chronic pain and their adverse event profiles, as well as a review of therapies that are currently in development and/or preclinical trials for the management and treatment of chronic pain.",

      "abstract": "Mental health disorders characterized by emotional lability, difficulty in concentrating, hopelessness, low energy level, irritability, food intake disorder, and changes in sleep patterns are called depression.To be diagnosed with depression according to the DSM-5, the following five or more symptoms must be present for at least 2 weeks, and at least one of the symptoms must be depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure.Others include weight loss without dieting, decreased physical activity, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness, decreased ability to think or concentrate, and recurrent thoughts of death.The detection of antenatal depression may have many clinical implications because; it was associated with poor obstetric, neonatal outcomes, postpartum depression, preterm birth and low birth weight, small for gestational age, suicidal attempts, higher incidence of cesarean section, prolonged labor, more painful labor, operative delivery and it was also associated with a low APGAR score.While Covid 19 treatment is certain for pregnant women, we think it is useful to remember the treatment of anxiety and depression, which is more important and has increased prevalence during Covid 19 pandemics.The treatment options are Psychotherapy, Acupuncture, Bright light therapy, Exercise/yoga, Massage therapy, Family/couples therapy, Folic acid, Omega-3 fatty acids, S-adenosyl methionine, and medical Antidepressant treatment.In this review, current treatment methods used in the treatment of pregnant depression are summarized in detail.",

      "title": "[Pregnant opioid addicted patients and additional drug intake. Part II: Comorbidity and their therapy].",
      "abstract": "The majority of opioid dependent patients suffer from various psychiatric and somatic comorbid diseases like mood and anxiety disorders, psychotic diseases, personality disorders, HIV infection, Hepatitis B and C. If medical treatment is needed, grouping active substances to FDA Pregnancy Categories (A, B, C, D or X) may be helpful. The majority of substances reported here only fulfill the FDA-categories C or D, which means that they could have teratogenic effects, but with probably different rank order. First of all, referring to mood, personality and anxiety disorders, the focus should be laid on non-pharmacological treatment by offering psychotherapeutic and supporting psychosocial interventions to the patients. However, opioid dependent pregnant patients who suffer from severe diseases such as psychosis, bipolar affective disorder or severe depression, may need psychoactive medication like antipsychotics, antidepressants or mood stabilizers to prevent them from harm caused by psychotic ideas and actions and/or suicidality. However these medications may comprise fetal risks, especially when taken together, and therefore should only be used when benefit and risks are considered together with patients and their relatives. It is important to avoid acute or renewed psychiatric decompensation. We present the current differentiated knowledge for therapy of opioid dependent patients with antipsychotics, antidepressants (e.g. higher fetal risk in case of treatment with fluoxetine and paroxetine) or mood stabilizers. All of them should only be used after considering benefit and risks. During pregnancy, there should not be switched between different antidepressant drugs. Referring mood stabilizers, the intake of valproic acid should be avoided in pregnancy or at least, dosage should be kept as low as possible since severe teratogenetic effects are known. In addition the specific drug treatment of HIV and hepatitis B during pregnancy is described. During childbirth HIV-infected patients should receive zidovudine intravenously to prevent vertical transmission. Co-infection with hepatitis C cannot be treated during pregnancy, since interferons are associated with a severe risk of fetal malformations and ribavirin has teratogenic effects; for this reason interferon therapy should be started after delivery.",

A simplified interpretation of this definition is presented in Figure 91.1. Alcohol abuse is defined as a pattern of pathological use for at least month that causes impairment in social and occupational functioning.Few definitions in medicine have incited as much discussion as that of alcoholism, mainly because excessive drinking may manifest as medical problem (e.g., withdrawal seizures), psychiatric problem (e.g., depression), or social problem (e.g., involvement in an automobile accident). On the other hand, person with single episode of an alcohol-related problem is not necessarily an alcoholic; in such case, the condition may be better termed alcohol abuse.",

      "title": "Modern Treatment of Status Epilepticus in Adults",
      "abstract": "Status epilepticus is a serious epileptic condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It can be divided into four stages: developing (seizures leading up to status epilepticus), established (>5 minutes convulsive status epilepticus, nonconvulsive/focal status epilepticus >10 min), refractory (failure of two adequately dosed antiseizure medications in different drug classes), and super-refractory (persisting despite >24 hours of anesthesia). All seizure types can develop to status epilepticus. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus has the largest potential for brain damage. The drug treatment algorithms for status epilepticus generally go through three stages, starting with benzodiazepines: lorazepam, midazolam, or diazepam as first line drugs, moving to levetiracetam, valproate or fos-phenytoin as second-line drugs, ending, if necessary, with anesthetics like propofol or midazolam. Lacosamide, topiramate, phenobarbital, brivaracetam, and perampanel are potential alternatives, and pentobarbital is commonly used when long-term anesthesia is needed. Super refractory status epilepticus is the form that usually causes the most concern. Treatment guidelines for newer treatment alternatives are often based only on case reports and small patient series. Such alternatives include ketamine, immunotherapy, ketogenic diet, inhalation anesthetics and hypothermia, and several surgical neurostimulation procedures. This chapter provides an overview of current treatment alternatives, with particular focus on refractory status epilepticus and super-refractory status epilepticus.",

      "title": "Migraine: An Underestimated Neurological Condition Affecting Billions",
      "abstract": "The second most prevalent cause of years of disability worldwide is migraine, a neurological condition that causes a persistent headache that is lifelong. This condition affects more than a billion people globally. Its widespread prevalence and concomitant impairment have several adverse effects. Migraines are brought on by numerous behavioural, ecological, and genetic factors. There are various types of migraines, of which migraine without aura is the most common. The objective of this article is to determine the causes of migraine headaches, review the appropriate diagnosis of migraine, and describe the migraine headache management alternatives that are available. Various treatments for migraine are available on the market. Among the many types of headaches, migraines are neurological in nature and are inherited in some people. It has four phases: prodromal phase, aura, attack phase, and postdrome phase. Stress, anxiety, changes in the female endocrine system, bright lights, loud noises, foul odour, excessive or insufficient sleep, changes in the environment or the climate, flashes of light or intense lighting, overexertion, missing meals, drinking alcohol and smoking, quitting caffeine, and taking too many migraine drugs are some of the triggering factors for migraine. Diagnosis of migraine mainly relies on a good history. Appropriate prevention can be done for specific indications. Treatment mainly revolves around medications like analgesics, triptans, ergot derivatives, and newly derived biologics. Lifestyle modifications are also essential as many daily life factors contribute to migraine. Migraine can be well-managed if sufficient attention and care are given along with proper medications and guidance. The patient should not ignore symptoms and report to the physician at the earliest so that correct management can be done.",

      "abstract": "Traumata, by definition, refer to exterior events that expose a person to experiences of overwhelming threat and catastrophe and elicit feelings of death anxiety, panic, horror, helplessness, loss of personal control, and intractability. Most affected persons respond with at least some distressing symptoms of trauma-related memory intrusions, autonomic hyperarousal, dissociation, and depression in the acute aftermath. Fortunately, the majority of traumatized individuals succeed in coping with this major stress quite well during the following weeks and months unless the process of recovery is hampered by additional adverse psychosocial circumstances, psychological disposition or biological vulnerability. In a subgroup of persons a transition to acute and posttraumatic stress disorder or other major psychiatric disorders, e.g. depressive, anxiety, substance-related disorders may be observed. Posttraumatic stress disorders very often run a chronic course of illness enduring for many years or even life-long. The typical course of illness in PTSD is characterized not only by major psychiatric comorbidities contributing to a dramatically reduced health-related quality of life, to many deficits of psychosocial adaptation and a heightened suicide risk. It is also associated with a lot of major somatic health problems both in acute and long-term stages. The main focus here is on this special dimension of physical comorbidities in posttraumatic disorders. Empirical evidence underscores that trauma exposure, and in particular PTSD is significantly associated with major physical health problems in addition to well-known PTSD-related psychological, behavioural, and psychosocial impairments. Both self-report-based and objective assessments emphasized significantly increased rates of somatoform/functional syndromes and physical comorbidities, premature all-cause and specific mortality rates, heightened medical utilization behaviours, major socioeconomic costs, and reduced health-related quality of life in the aftermath of trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorders, thus defining a major challenge to any medical care system. Complex psycho-behavioural-somatic and somato-psycho-behavioural models are needed to better understand both acute and long-term effects of a perpetuating stress system on physical health.",

      "title": "Let's Focus on Frailty",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Frailty may be a clinical condition during which a person's vulnerability to acquiring dependency and/or mortality increases after they are subjected to a stressor.[1] Frailty is most regularly characterized as an aging-related disorder of physiological decline, characterized by marked vulnerability to unfavorable health outcomes, such as comorbidities, polypharmacy, the loss of independence, increasing hospitalizations, and mortality, improving the care for the most vulnerable subset of patients by frailty awareness and associated risks for adverse health outcomes. The physical frailty is \"A medical syndrome with multiple causes and contributors that are characterized by diminished strength, endurance, and reduced physiologic function that increases an individual's vulnerability for developing increased dependency and/or death.\"[2] Frail people usually have three or more than five symptoms such as unintentional weight loss (10 or more pounds within the past year), muscle loss and weakness, fatigue, reduced walking speed, and reduced levels of physical activity. WHAT ARE CONSEQUENCES OF FRAILTY? Frailty is viewed as a geriatric disorder with various causes and contributors portrayed by reduced strength, perseverance and diminished physiologic capacity, and increasing a person's weakness for developing disability.[1] As one of the fundamental causes of functional decrease in the elderly, sarcopenia has a high clinical effect, influencing the status and recuperation of an individual's mobility, independence, and quality of life conveys an increased danger for chronic frailty which results in falls, disability, hospitalization, and mortality.[3] WHAT ARE the RISK FACTORS FOR FRAILTY? The elements related with frailty, especially sociodemographic factors such as age, gender, and educational level, just as actual factors, for example, body weight and activities of daily living.[4] Malnutrition, inactivity, and comorbidities have a high antagonistic effect in older people and are risk factors for sarcopenia and physical frailty. The loss of muscle mass, strength, and function, called sarcopenia, is a key factor in the development of physical frailty. WHAT IS ORAL FRAILTY? Oral frailty is characterized as a progression of phenomena and cycles that lead to changes in different oral conditions (number of teeth, oral cleanliness, oral capacities, and so forth) related with aging, and accompanied by diminished interest in oral health, decreased physical and mental reserve capacity, and an expansion in oral frailty prompting to eating dysfunction; the general impact is of deteriorating physical and mental capacity.[5] HOW TO ASSESS THE ORAL FRAILTY? Oral assessments comprised of 16 measures including five dental status, eight oral functions, and three subjective difficulties. The 16 measures were as follows: dental status – number of natural teeth and functioning teeth, community periodontal index, tongue thickness as a marker of oral nutrient status, and turbidity of mouth-rinsed water as a marker of oral hygiene. Oral functions – maximum occlusal force, chewing ability as a marker of general masticatory performance, maximum tongue pressure, repetitive saliva-swallowing test (RSST), articulatory oral motor skill for \"pa, ta, ka\" and experience of dry mouth measured-oral wettability. Subjective assessments – difficulties in eating and swallowing, and using the questionnaire chewing ability, RSST, xerostomia. Oral frailty – the accumulation of a slightly poor status of oral conditions and function, strongly predicts physical frailty, dysphagia, malnutrition, need for long-term care, and mortality. IS ORAL FRAILTY LINKED TO PHYSICAL FRAILTY? A hypothesis for the connection between poor oral health and frailty is that poor diet intervenes the impact of poor oral health (like loss of teeth, dental agony, or potentially biting issues), prompting to frailty.[6] Poor eating routine and nutritional risk have for some time been involved in the etiology and progression of frailty by affecting useful functional reserves and strength and leading to loss of energy, functional decline, morbidity, and subsequent frailty. Oral frailty was essentially connected with physical frailty by 66.6% and sarcopenia by 72.7%. Poor oral condition in hospitalized patients can be attributed to factors such as age, physical dependency, psychological decline, malnutrition, low skeletal muscle mass and strength, and multimorbidity.[7] WHAT ARE the POLICY IMPLICATIONS? The proof from frailty studies has not yet been completely converted into clinical practice and medical care strategy making. As of now, in any case, there is no viable treatment for frailty and the best intervention is not yet known. In view of presently available proof, the multicomponent exercise, which incorporates resistance training, appears to be promising.[8] The current challenges in frailty research incorporate the absence of a worldwide standard meaning of frailty, further comprehension of interventions to reverse frailty, the best planning for intervention, and education/training of health-care professionals. Population-based evaluation for frailty could be costly and resource intensive, and as of now, there is no obvious proof for expected advantage, cost-adequacy, or improved results. Research and development efforts aimed toward building up and spreading best practice in frailty should not lack strategic consideration regarding older people with early (pre-) frailty that passes up on a chance to address a few requests on health and social care services. Another significant space of delicacy research is schooling and preparing The medical services experts including doctors, attendants, and other medical workers need to comprehend essential standards of care for frail older adults and to have the option to distinguish frailty and give therapy/interventions. There is an increasing interest in frailty in other medical fields than the geriatrics One model is that frailty has recently been pursued as a potential risk assessment measure for older surgical patients and has demonstrated to be promising in anticipating postoperative intricacies, for example, mortality or length of emergency clinic stay. Finally, frailty research may have evolved without considering the patient perspective Frailty can be considered as a profoundly adverse term and being marked as frail may influence contrarily the weakest people differently. The individuals who were marked as \"old and fragile\" by others were bound to be related with a loss of interest in friendly and proactive tasks, poor physical health, and increased disparagement. The future innovative work endeavors need to recognize the risks of naming older individuals in defaming ways and stay away from turning into the new cloak of ageism and an instrument for segregation.[8] Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "abstract": "Side effects play a significant role in the selection of drugs to be used in panic disorder/agoraphobia whose polyphobic symptomatology often includes a suspiciousness about taking drugs and a fear of undesired side effects which may lead to the refusal of treatment. The safety, side effects and patients' acceptance of alprazolam and imipramine versus placebo were evaluated in 1168 subjects with panic disorder/agoraphobia who had been enrolled in the second phase of the Upjohn World Wide Panic Study. Side effects that worsened over baseline to a greater extent with alprazolam than with imipramine and placebo were sedation, fatigue/weakness, memory problems, ataxia and slurred speech. In the imipramine group blurred vision, tachycardia/palpitations, insomnia, sleep disturbance, excitement/nervousness, malaise, dizziness/faintness, headache, nausea/vomiting and decrease in appetite were worse than in the other groups. In the placebo group the anxious symptoms were most prominent. The highest level of compliance was shown in the alprazolam-treated group and the lowest in the placebo-treated group. Strong predictors of side effects were not observed. If a side effect profile is known, it will be easier for a clinician to choose the right drug and the appropriate management by taking into account compliance, safety and efficacy in each patient under treatment. Further information about side effects in long-term maintenance treatment would be of great clinical pertinence in ensuring safety and enhancing patients' quality of life.",

      "title": "Opioid dependence.",
      "abstract": "Dependence on opioids is a multifactorial condition involving genetic and psychosocial factors. There are three stages to treating opioid dependence. Stabilisation is usually by opioid substitution treatments, and aims to ensure that the drug use becomes independent of mental state (such as craving and mood) and independent of circumstances (such as finance and physical location). The next stage is to withdraw (detox) from opioids. The final stage is relapse prevention. This treatment process contributes to recovery of the individual, which also includes improved overall health and wellbeing, as well as engagement in society.",

      "title": "Medications and Their Effects on Sleep",
      "abstract": "Abstract Many medications affect the central nervous system (CNS) and can alter the patterns of sleep and wakefulness. Others can induce sleep disorders (eg, nightmares, periodic limb movements of sleep or restless legs syndrome) or exacerbate them (eg, obstructive sleep apnea). Some agents can cause both insomnia and excessive sleepiness in different individuals, or in the same individual under different circumstances. These can be a primary therapeutic effect of the drug, a withdrawal effect, or an adverse reaction. Each medication possesses class and agent-specific effects on sleep. Alcohol’s effect on arousal and sleep is biphasic. Alcohol has both stimulatory effects (at low doses and on the rising phase of alcohol levels) and sedative effects (at high doses and on the falling phase of alcohol levels). Metabolism of alcohol occurs at a constant rate of 10 to 20 mg/dl per hour. Alcohol’s sedating effect can be additive with other agents such as benzodiazepines. Acute ingestion decreases sleep latency, increases non–rapid eye movement (NREM) stages 3 and 4 sleep, and reduces rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the first half of the sleep period (Table 16–1). It is metabolized quickly, and alcohol causes a rebound increase in the frequency of arousals and awakenings and an increase in REM sleep during the second part of the night. Nightmares and vivid dreams can occur. In addition, alcohol ingestion can cause worsening of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea by increasing upper airway resistance due to a decrease in pharyngeal dilator muscle tone.",

      "title": "Cognitive Effects and Sedation",
      "abstract": "Cognitive effects and sedation (CES) are prevalent in chronic nonmalignant pain populations receiving long-term opioid therapy and are among the most common reasons patients discontinue opioid use. In this narrative review, we describe the phenomenology, epidemiology, mechanisms, assessment, and management of opioid-related CES. We reviewed the empirical and theoretical literature on CES in opioid-treated populations with chronic pain. Data on long-term opioid therapy (≥3 months in duration) in chronic nonmalignant pain patients were sought. The phenomenology of CES includes: inattention, concentration difficulties, memory deficits, psychomotor dysfunction, perceptual distortions, and executive dysfunction and somnolence, sleep disorders, and lethargy. Deficits may be caused by unrelieved pain or opioid therapy alone, or from a combination of these and other factors. Mechanisms include central nervous system effects, for example, direct toxic effects on neurons resulting in decreased consciousness; direct effects on processing and reaction resulting in cognitive or psychomotor impairment, and inhibitory effects on cholinergic activity. Pharmacological management approaches may include opioid dose reduction and rotation or psychostimulant use. Nonpharmacological approaches may include cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, acupuncture, exercise, and yoga. The most prevalent CES include: memory deficits (73–81%), sleep disturbance (35–57%), and fatigue (10%). At its most severe, extreme cognitive dysfunction can result in frank delirium and decreased alertness can result in coma. Emotional distress, sleep disorders, and other comorbidities and treatments can worsen CES, particularly among the elderly. Conclusions about the neuropsychological domains affected by opioids are limited due to the heterogeneity of studies and methodological issues.",

Some of the earliest physical signs—any one of which associated with a particular form of insanity will almost infallibly indicate the first stage of this special disorder—are the intermittent pulse, the irregular or contracted pupil, the quivering lip or embarrassed articulation. The second stage is marked by loss of power in the upper extremities, by a gait more or less unsteady, by diminished sensation in the cutaneous nerves, or by the loss of some of the special senses. In the third period the disease approaches its climax, in an entire want of motory power, and by an impairment of all the nervous functions so universal, that although organic life may, under careful treatment, be prolonged for a considerable time, the patient may be said to exist rather than to live. Epileptiform attacks may precede or accompany any one of these stages. They sometimes very distinctly mark out their boundaries, or the disorder may run its course without any recognised convulsive seizures.",

Various methods are used and each has its disadvantages. Residual symptoms of abstinence from opiates are present in all methods and there is a prolonged period of convalescence which seems to be one of the causes of relapses to addiction. Vitamin E however- has given remarkable results in aiding recovery from the withdrawal symptoms. With vitamin E the period of treatment is shortened, abstinence symptoms are bearable and the convalescent period is eliminated. Patients treated with vitamin E solely are in good health and spirits and appear contented. This treatment also seems to reduce 1he number of relapses. The administration of vitamin E after a complete withdrawal from opium probably compensates Some of the opium's effects on the nervous system, and remedies the hypoxia of the tissues, thus restoring the patient to a normal physiological state.",

      "title": "Soundings: Three puzzling cases",
      "abstract": "The clinicopathological conference is a time honoured exercise in which a participant is given a clinical protocol and tries to make a diagnosis. It has been variously lauded as an instructive teaching exercise or derided as an unreal situation.\r\n\r\nThe cases are often puzzling. What, for example, is one to make of a wasted man, deathly pale, with web-like thin hair, exaggerated sensitivity to noise, odours, light, or touch, where the course of the disease fluctuates with intermittent agitation or depression?\r\n\r\nOr what sudden epidemic illness would cause high fever, profuse generalised bleeding, and death within half an hour?\r\n\r\nAnd what about a dishevelled 39 year old man with a history of alcohol and possibly opiate use, presenting with lethargy and confusion but remaining afebrile, becoming delirious and combative, and dying within four days.\r\n\r\nThe first two cases, products of Edgar Allan Poe's lugubrious imagination, defy diagnosis. The symptoms of the cadaverous looking man in The Fall of the House of Usher have been attributed, perhaps not too convincingly, to acute intermittent porphyria (JAMA 1989;261: 863-4 [PubMed]). One can only speculate what might have caused the hideous pestilence with “sharp pains, sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores with dissolution... the incidents of half an hour” (The Mask of the Red Death).\r\n\r\nFor the third case, a Dr Michael Benitez at one time suggested rabies. It is a case unsolved since 1849, when the patient boarded a train in Richmond, disappeared for five days, was found confused in a Baltimore tavern, dishevelled, in someone else's clothes, then taken to a city hospital, where he died delirious after several days. Delirium tremens, encephalitis, and malaria have been considered, but some think he was robbed and mugged. Others postulated that this being during an election, Poe (for it was the author himself) was drugged by a “repeater” gang and taken to vote at different polling booths, then abandoned.\r\n\r\nThere are further mysteries: firstly, the body was exhumed in 1875 and relocated, but there is speculation that the gravediggers dug up the wrong body; and secondly, for several years after 1949 an anonymous visitor would come on Poe's birthday and place a half bottle of Martel cognac on his grave.",

Different pathophysiological mechanisms lead to constipation. Its assessment and diagnosis should refer to the Rome-III criteria, taking into account a stool free interval of more than 72 hours, the assessment of the subjective „feeling of being constipated”, and the consistence of the stool. The use of laxatives should adapt to these pathophysiological causes according to a step scheme, both for prophylaxis and therapy.

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Background: Several mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, anxiety, insomnia, hallucination and depression, appear when people heavily consume alcoholic beverages for weeks, months, or years. This behaviour appears in up to 80% of patients who are alcohol dependent and is called alcohol withdrawal. It can appear in patients hospitalized between 8hrs and 3 weeks, depending on the stage of their alcohol dependence. More than 90% of alcohol withdrawal signs and symptoms occur within 48 hours after the patient stops drinking. Every year,500,000 episodes of withdrawal symptoms are estimated for1.2 milion patients hospitalized. It is very important to know that over 50% of patients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome are middle-class, highly functional individuals.The withdrawal period can mean additional stress for the pacient who presents injury and needs to undergo surgical procedures. Poor healing increases the risk for infections, complications and prolonged hospitalization. Stress and other behavioral factors can also affect wound healing. Consequently, it is very important to speak about the dangers to which other patients are exposed, such as bites that can transmit hepatitis, syphilis, HIV, and the physical aggressions on health professionals. For patients who are heavy alcohol drinkers, the risk is the same because anxiety can the slowing of respiration and increases pulmonary risks. Also, the decreased activity increases the risk of thrombosis and of bowel upset.&lt;br /&gt; Conclusion. This type of patients should be treated like normal patients, but it is necessary for them to stay as isolated as possible in order not to put the lives of others in danger.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "title": "Potensi Ketamin Dosis Rendah untuk Penderita Depresi Berat",
      "abstract": "Depresi berat merupakan salah satu gangguan jiwa yang sering ditemui yang ditandai dengan 3 gejala utama yaitu afek depresif, kehilangan minat dan kegembiraan, berkurangnya energi hingga mudah lelah. Serta gejala lainnya berupa merasa pesimis atau putus asa, merasa bersalah, gagal, dan sendirian, berbicara atau bergerak dengan lamban, sulit berkonsentrasi, mengingat, maupun mengambil keputusan, tidur yang lebih sedikit atau lebih banyak daripada biasanya, nafsu makan dan perubahan berat badan yang meningkat atau menurun dari biasanya, adanya pikiran atau percobaan bunuh diri minimal dalam waktu 2 minggu. Terapi yang diberikan dapat berupa obat-obatan, psikoterapi, maupun keduanya. Jika terapi tersebut tidak dapat mengurangi gejala maka dapat diberikan electroconvulsive theraphy (ECT). ECT menyebabkan berbagai efek samping seperti pusing, disorientasi, kehilangan memori. Biasanya efek samping tersebut dalam jangka pendek, namun kehilangan memori berlangsung berkepanjangan. Namun selain ECT belum ada terapi lain yang mendapat hasil secara cepat untuk terapi depresi berat dan menjadi tantangan untuk pasien yang tidak responsif terhadap ECT. Sehingga diperlukan terapi lain untuk penderita depresi berat. Ketamin merupakan obat bius non- competitive NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) yang digunakan untuk merawat tentara saat di medan perang. Proses pelepasan metabolit spesifik ketamin akan merangsang terjadinya peningkatan pelepasan sinaps glutamat yang menyebabkan efek antidepresan. Hal tersebut menunjukkan bahwa ketamin dapat menjadi harapan baru untuk pasien dan peneliti dalam kasus depresi berat.\r\n \r\nKata Kunci: Antidepresan, Depresi Berat, Glutamat, Ketamin",

      "title": "JS01-04 - Rational optimization of bipolar disorders’ treatment",
      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder is difficult to treat. There are several options to treat acute mania, but combination of two or more drugs is the rule rather than the exception, indicating the limitations of currently available therapies. The evidence base for the treatment of bipolar depression is much weaker, and again combination is the rule. Although patients with bipolar disorder may experience resolution of symptoms with acute treatment, many will continue to experience impaired functioning due to the episodic, chronic, and progressive nature of the illness. Maintenance therapy is needed for a variety of reasons, including prevention of relapse, reduction of subthreshold symptoms, decreasing the risk of suicide, and reducing the frequency of rapid cycling and mood instability. Although long-term therapy is usually required to maintain or improve functioning and quality of life, it has been a significant challenge to identify clinically effective treatments for long-term management. There are few currently-available, well-tolerated treatment options that are effective in all phases of bipolar disorder and which prevent recurrence of manic and/or depressive episodes. Questions concerning when to discontinue one of the drugs when two or more are used, or how to switch from one mood stabilizer to another, have not been addressed in clinical trials. Electroconvulsive therapy may be effective in treatment resistant cases and can be used as maintenance when pharmacotherapy is not enough. Psychoeducation may help to enhance treatment adherence and healthy lifestyle. A rational combination of the above mentioned strategies may help to optimize the outcome of this challenging condition.",

      "title": "Catatonia After Benzodiazepine Withdrawal",
      "abstract": "The use of benzodiazepine medication is associated with a variety of acute and well-recognized withdrawal syndromes including anxiety, agitation, insomnia, and confusion. Catatonia has not previously been described. We report five patients who became catatonic after withdrawal of benzodiazepines. All five were older individuals (53-88 years) who had acutely become immobile, mute, and rigid with refusal or inability to eat or drink. Each of the five showed pronounced and rapid improvement after administration of low-dose lorazepam, which has previously been reported to be effective in the treatment of catatonia. Careful review of the records showed that each of the patients had been taking benzodiazepine medication for anywhere from 6 months to 15 years and that it had been rapidly tapered or abruptly discontinued 2 to 7 days before the onset of catatonia. These cases illustrate that severe and potentially life-threatening catatonia can develop in the wake of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Older individuals may be particularly vulnerable to this side effect. (J Clin Psychopharmacol 1996;16:315-319).",

      "abstract": "To study the long-term clinical course and outcomes of atypical psychosis, 8 patients diagnosed with atypical psychosis were observed for more than 12 years (mean, 20 years). Retrospective examination was performed, particularly with respect to clinical features at each episode. The overall course of each case was classified as one of the following three types: Type I--\"Recurrent confused state\" type. Patients frequently repeated acute transient confused or dream-like states in a similar way, sometimes and/or for part of the episode accompanied by a floating paranoid-hallucinatory state. Duration of psychotic episode was short, persisting for a few days to about one month. Type II--\"Manic-depressive illness similar\" type. After a long course of disease, the predominantly early middle-aged patients (30- to 40 years-old) demonstrated fewer original characteristic features of acute confused or dream-like states. Instead, manic or depressive episodes tended to predominate. Duration of psychotic episodes exceeded the duration of type I episodes, to a maximum of about 3 months. Type III--\"Appearance of residual state\" type. After several episodes characterized by transient confused state during middle age, residual states consisting of a slight depressive state, reduced spontaneity and flattening of emotions appear. These states become durable and the periodicity of the disease disappeared. We conclude that the core group of atypical psychosis patients presents with confused symptoms as a clinical feature of episodes, and with the recurrent confused state type representing the long-term clinical course. \"Shift to manic-depressive illness similar\" and \"appearance of residual state\" types were considered to be derived from the core group, according to the interplay of personality structure and viable dynamics.",

PTSD is characterized by three symptom clusters: (1) reexperiencing of the traumatic event; (2) avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event and emotional numbing; and (3) hyperarousal symptoms (1). PTSD results in significant distress and morbidity. For example, following an assault a person may experience intrusive thoughts of the assault, suffer from nightmares of threat or assault, or experience flashbacks of all or some portions of the assault. Avoidance of reminders is common and may include, for example, avoidance of the site of the assault or similar places, avoidance of people who are similar to the perpetrator, or avoidance of conversations about community or domestic violence. Following a traumatic event, emotional numbing such as a sense of being unable to have loving feelings, feeling detached from others, or having decreased interest may occur. Difficulty falling asleep, being easily startled, irritability, and hypervigilance are common hyperarousal symptoms (see DSM-IV for criteria) (1).",

      "title": "Overtraining Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Definitions Functional overreaching (FOR): intensified training results in a temporary decline in performance. When appropriate periods of recovery are provided, a positive \"supercompensation\" effect occurs, with the athlete exhibiting enhanced performance. Nonfunctional overreaching (NFOR): an accumulation of training and/or nontraining stress resulting in short-term decrement in performance capacity with or without related physiological and psychological signs and symptoms of maladaptation in which restoration of performance capacity may take from several days to several weeks. Overtraining syndrome (OTS): same as NFOR, except decrement is long-term and restoration takes several weeks or months. Key point: the difference between NFOR and OTS is the amount of time needed for performance restoration; therefore, the diagnosis of OTS can often only be made retrospectively (3). Pathophysiology Unknown, biochemical/hormonal hypotheses include the following: glycogen depletion, central fatigue/branched chain fatty acid depletion, glutamine depletion/immune dysfunction, autonomic imbalance, oxidative stress, hypothalamic dysregulation, and cytokine release/inflammation (1,2). The mechanism triggering these changes often involves a training error that results in imbalance between energy expenditure load and recovery. This typically occurs in combination with a complex set of psychological factors and environmental stressors (e.g., monotony of training, excessive competitions, sleep disturbances, interpersonal difficulties, academic/occupational stressors, illness, altitude exposure, heat or cold injury, etc.). Epidemiology Most commonly seen in endurance events such as swimming, cycling, or running Prevalence and incidence data for true OTS are lacking; the lifetime prevalence of NFOR/OTS is estimated to be approximately 30% for nonelite endurance athletes and 60% for elite athletes (2,3). Important Differential Diagnoses NFOR/OTS is a diagnosis of exclusion (1). Common: caffeine withdrawal, environmental allergies, exercise-induced bronchospasm, infectious mononucleosis, insufficient sleep, anemia, performance anxiety, inadequate carbohydrate or protein intake, mood disorder, psychosocial stress, upper respiratory infection. Less common: dehydration, diabetes mellitus, eating disorder, hepatitis, hypothyroidism, lower respiratory infection, medication side effect (antidepressant, anxiolytic, antihistamine, β-blocker), post-concussive syndrome, pregnancy, substance abuse. Rare but important: adrenocortical insufficiency or excess, congenital or acquired heart disease, arrhythmia, bacterial endocarditis, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, human immunodeficiency virus, malabsorption syndrome, chronic lung disease, Lyme disease, malaria, malignancy, neuromuscular disorder, chronic renal disease, syphilis. Evaluation Thorough history including chief complaint, training program, diet, medications, nutrition, illness, review of systems, and assessment of training goals. Hallmark feature in history: athletes with NFOR/OTS are usually able to start a normal training sequence or a race at their normal pace but are not able to complete the training load they are given or race as usual (3). Initial laboratory examinations: complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate/C-reactive protein, thyroid-stimulating hormone, iron studies, creatine kinase, urinalysis, and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin. Consider monospot, hepatitis panel, Lyme titer, toxicology screen, and chest x-ray. Prescribe absolute rest for 2 wk. ○ If mood is adversely affected with full rest, consider relative rest with well-defined expectations. If improved at follow-up, focus on adjustments to training and prevention (as follows). If no improvement, consider NFOR/OTS: ○ Will require prolonged training rest and further workup ○ Consider consulting with a sports psychologist and nutritionist. ○ Sequence of advancing activity should focus on frequency, then duration, then intensity (1,2). Monitoring Monitor performance in time trials and standard exercise challenges. There are currently no good practical biomarkers for NFOR/OTS (2). Psychiatric indicators may be most useful. Examples include the Profile of Mood States and Recovery-Stress Questionnaire for Athletes (1). A two-bout maximal exercise protocol has shown differences in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal response for athletes with FOR, NFOR, and OTS and may have prognostic value (2). Prevention Considerations for coaches, athletic trainers, and health care providers (2,3): Maintain accurate records of performance and encourage athletes to keep a diary of training load. Emphasize adequate rest and \"time out\" periods when performance declines, when an athlete complains of fatigue, or after illness or injury. Individualize and supervise training program. Avoid monotony of training. Encourage and reinforce optimal nutrition, hydration, and sleep. Be aware of life stressors, and communicate with athletes about physical, mental, and emotional concerns. Consider regular psychological questionnaires. Schedule regular health checks with a multidisciplinary team.",

Over 100,000 American veterans of Desert Storm/Shield (approximately 15% of deployed U. S.

Many of the features appearing in the last days of a terminal illness, especially cancer, can be attributed to organic brain disease consequent to metabolic disorder associated with multi-organ failure. An awareness of the nature of the problems that may arise in the last 48 hours of life makes it possible to keep the patient comfortable to the end.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is the most frequent adverse event encountered in cancer patients and often underestimated by oncologists. This fatigue results in a deterioration of the quality of life physically, psychologically and socio-professionally. We have to distinguish various degrees of fatigue and identify fatigue from chronic fatigue. The acute fatigue appears normal after a physical or psychological effort and requires less than a week of rest to recover; the impact on quality of life is thus minimal. Chronic fatigue is more insidious; the causes are multiple. The patient feels that this fatigue is abnormal and disproportionate. It last several weeks and has a severe impact on the quality of life. Somatic mechanisms of fatigue related to the tumour and/or treatment are: vitaminic or proteic deficiencies due to malnutrition, accumulation of toxic metabolites, infections and septicemia, the abuse of sleeping tablets or antalgics, insomnias, immobilisation, organic insufficiencies or ionic disturbances. Anemia--observed in more than 50% of the cancerous patients--deserves a particular attention. The causes of this anemia are also multiple. It is obvious that anemia interferes with quality of life of the patient, decreases his physical performances and leads to a lack of motivation or energy. Patients with an hemoglobin level higher than 12 g/dl describe significantly less complaints and a higher physical and functional well being. To better assess the treatment of fatigue, it is important to first evaluate if the cause is organic, psychologic or mixed. Among the somatic causes, nutritious deficiencies, pain and anemia, ... all these complications can be treated with appropriate medications. This fatigue is often recognized by the patient as a progression of the tumour or as a treatment failure. Therefore, it is important to inform the patients of the possibility of that adverse event so that it does not generate additional stress and anxiety during the treatment.",

The combined treatment led to a better result than would have been expected from drug therapy alone. Some of the sleep deprivation treatments effected an accelerated remission without the efficacy of treatment subsiding. In individual cases recovery occurred after one or a few partial sleep deprivation sessions. Whether in other respects sleep deprivation shortens the course of depressive phases is still unproven.",

      "title": "Symptomkontrolle am Lebensende",
      "abstract": "Symptom Control at the End of Life Abstract. Patients with advanced disease suffer from multiple physical and psychological symptoms. These include pain, weakness, lack of energy, weight loss, breathlessness, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and depression. In the dying phase, death rattle, delirium and terminal agitation may be additional problems. Palliative care focusses on alleviating these symptoms, taking into account the physical, psychological, social and spiritual dimension. Main principles of symptom control in palliative care are 1) considering differential diagnoses of the causes of the symptom to be able to treat potentially reversible causes, 2) using preventive measures and 3) symptomatic treatment - on its own or in combination with causal therapy. The following should be noted regarding pharmacological treatment: In case of permanent symptoms, the drugs have to be given at fixed times, in accordance with their duration of action, to achieve a constant blood level. In addition to this regular drug administration, prn medication should be prescribed, e. g., for pain, breathlessness, and nausea. If oral administration is not possible, drugs can be administered intravenously, subcutaneously or transdermally via patches. Non-pharmacological measures can be used additionally or primarily for symptom control. This paper presents important aspects of symptom control for pain, breathlessness, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and depression as well as for symptoms in the dying phase. It concludes by adding a few words on sedation in palliative care as a measure of last resort.Zusammenfassung. Patient_innen in fortgeschrittenen Krankheitsstadien leiden unter vielfältigen physischen und psychischen Beschwerden. Dazu gehören Schmerzen, Schwäche, Energielosigkeit, Gewichtsverlust, Atemnot, Übelkeit, Erbrechen, Verstopfung und Depression. In der Sterbephase können Rasselatmung, Delir und / oder terminale Unruhe hinzukommen. Der Fokus palliativmedizinischer Behandlung liegt auf der Linderung dieser belastenden Symptome unter Berücksichtigung der körperlichen, psychischen, sozialen und spirituellen Dimension. Zu den Grundsätzen der palliativmedizinischen Symptomkontrolle gehören 1) eine angemessene differentialdiagnostische Ursachenklärung des Symptoms zur Behandlung potenziell reversibler Ursachen, 2) der Einsatz von präventiven Massnahmen und 3) die Durchführung einer symptomatischen Therapie – allein oder parallel zu einer ursächlichen Therapie. Bezüglich der medikamentösen Therapiemassnahmen ist Folgendes zu beachten: Bei dauerhaft vorhandenen Symptomen müssen die Medikamente entsprechend ihrer Wirkdauer nach einem festen Zeitschema gegeben werden, um einen möglichst konstanten Wirkspiegel zu erreichen. Zusätzlich zu einer solchen Dauermedikation ist zum Beispiel für Schmerzen, Atemnot und Übelkeit Bedarfsmedikation zu verschreiben. Wenn die orale Gabe nicht möglich ist, können Medikamente intravenös, subkutan oder transdermal mittels Pflaster verabreicht werden. Nichtmedikamentöse Massnahmen können ergänzend oder auch primär zur Symptomlinderung eingesetzt werden. Dieser Beitrag stellt wichtige Aspekte der Symptomkontrolle bei Schmerzen, Atemnot, Übelkeit und Erbrechen, Obstipation, Depression sowie bei Symptomen in der Sterbephase vor und schliesst mit wenigen Worten zum Thema «Sedierung in der Palliativversorgung» als Ultima-Ratio-Massnahme.",

      "title": "Drugs Highly Associated with Infusion Reactions Reported using Two Different Data-mining Methodologies",
      "abstract": "BackgroundInfusion reactions may mimic drug hypersensitivity, with a spectrum of variability and heterogeneity for both individual and drug; symptoms may include anxiety, diaphoresis, rigors/chills, fever, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, headache, nausea, emesis, diarrhea, chest pain, dyspnea, wheezing/bronchospasm, hypoxia, respiratory failure, hypotension, and death [1][2][3][4].Symptoms usually occur shortly after the infusion begins but can have delayed onset [1][2][3][4].Symptoms may decrease when the infusion rate is discontinued or slowed; at other times, the symptoms persist [1][2][3][4].To add to the complexity surrounding infusion reactions, multiple nomenclatures are used, including drugmediated hypersensitivity, infusion-related toxicity, cytokine storm, cytokine-release syndrome, anaphylactoid reaction, and serum sickness-like illness [2,[4][5][6][7][8].The spectrum of symptoms, variable onset, and the multiple names implicate the immune system.Recognizing the molecular and ontologic mayhem surrounding infusion reactions, we used software technology to investigate drugs highly associated with infusion reactions.Advances in information technology allow data integration at many levels; molecular pathways can be visualized through dependency graphs and statistical modeling [9].MASE (Molecular Analysis of Side Effects) was developed by Molecular Health to connect biomolecules, pathways, targets and diseases in a drug-centric manner.Drugs highly associated with infusion reactions are reported by MASE using Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRRs).PRRs are calculated by the ratio of the observed to the expected number of drug-event pairs.The Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean (EBGM) value is the PRR adjusted AbstractObjective: Infusion reactions can be serious life threatening adverse events and have been associated with many drugs and biologic agents.Our objective was to report drugs associated with infusion reactions using two different data-mining methodologies. Methods:The Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) was data-mined for drugs highly associated with infusion reactions.Drugs were included if there were >10 reported adverse events and if the Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean (EBGM) score ≥ 2. Molecular Health's MASE (Molecular Analysis of Side Effects) reports Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRR) for drugs highly associated with infusion reactions and was cross-referenced to improve detection sensitivity.Results: Using FAERS, the highest EBGM scores by class were reported as: pegloticase and α-1antitrypsyn (enzymes), iron dextran and ferric gluconate (electrolytes and nutrients), infliximab and gemtuzumab (immunomodulators), and paclitaxel and oxaliplatin (antimetabolites).Using MASE, the highest PRR scores were reported as: idursulfase and galsulfase (enzymes), iron dextran and phytonadione (electolytes and nutrients), gemtuzumab and infliximab (immunomodulators), mercaptopurine and azathioprine (antimetabolites).Amphotericin and vancomycin had the highest scores for the antimicrobial class for both FAERS and MASE. Conclusions:Using the two statistical methods EBGM and PRR, both specificity and sensitivity were preserved.However, neither system detected several drugs with established relationships to infusion reactions, including protamine and nitroglycerine.Reactions caused by these drugs were possibly underreported because the effects have been well established or due to evolution of administration with slower administration.We hope this analysis encourages further research into overlapping mechanisms for infusion reactions.",

      "title": "Chronic dizziness and instability as adverse effects explained by drug-induced vestibulotoxicity.",
      "abstract": "Background Dizziness and imbalance are common symptoms which can cause an important impairment of the ability of the patients affected to perform their daily activities. Diseases affecting posterior labyrinth can explain these symptoms. Ototoxicity is a quite common etiology of simultaneous damage of both labyrinths. The aim of this study is to present and analyze a series of patients with chronic dizziness and imbalance induced by vestibulotoxic pharmaceuticals administration. Methods A prospective study in patients diagnosed by chronic imbalance due to drug-induced vestibulotoxicity was performed, along 12 years. The inclusion criteria were: a) vertigo or balance disorders absent before drug administration; b) appearance of dizziness or imbalance during or just after drug administration; c) persistent symptoms for at least three months; d) dysequilibrium confirmed by abnormal dynamic posturography, and/or e) labyrinthine lesion demonstrated by spontaneous or postheadshake nystagmus, saccades as response to Halmagyi test or hypofunction observed by nystagmographic recording of caloric tests. Results Eight patients were included. In all cases, toxic effect was observed only on posterior labyrinth while cochlear symptoms were absent. All patients complained of feeling of dizziness and unsteadiness. Drugs involved were antibiotics in 4 patients, anti-tuberculosis medicinal products in 2 patients, chemotherapeutic agents in 1 and tamoxifen in the last one. All patients had abnormal dynamic posturography, while caloric tests were normal in 2 and abnormal in 6 patients. A remarkable improvement of clinical status was achieved in 7 patients, while one subject, despite improving her symptoms, continued to have a serious imbalance at the end of follow-up period. Conclusions Dizziness and imbalance as vestibulotoxic effects induced by some drugs are symptoms, likely underdiagnosed, that limit the physical activity and cause a decrease in quality of life of the affected patients. Early detection of these symptoms might allow, in some cases, to replace the vestibulotoxic medication by less toxic or non-ototoxic drug. In those cases with serious diseases, it is not possible to avoid the use of certain drugs but physician might prescribe other compounds to prevent or reduce their ototoxic effect.

      "abstract": "In spite of the large increase in the number of anticonvulsant drugs in the three decades since the introduction of phenobarbitone, new remedies are constantly being sought. The present state of therapy of the epilepsies remains rather unsatisfactory. Drug therapy, which is still the most widely used form of treatment, is at best a maintenance treatment, i.e. the patient has to continue with it at least for many years to control the attacks. Even then a large number of sufferers continue to have seizures, often as frequently as once a month, which elude treatment. Surgery, which has found a wider application recently, is not radical either in many cases, and has to be followed up by medication over many years. The situation is further complicated by the fact that many anticonvulsant drugs, even when effective, produce unpleasant or dangerous side effects and have to be abandoned. One has also to consider the enormous psychological effects of the disease on the patient. The social stigma which epilepsy confers and the continual threat of an impending fit are often far more disabling than the actual seizures. Lately three favourable clinical reports have appeared in American journals on a new anticonvulsant drug called “Hibicon” (Gotton et al. , 1951; Kaplan et al. , 1952; Hawkes, 1952). Lederle Laboratories Division, American Cyanamid Company have kindly put a quantity of Hibicon at our disposal for a therapeutic trial in this country. We are reporting our experiences with this drug on a group of forty patients suffering from various types of epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "Neuropati Optik Toksik (NOT) adalah kelainan pada fungsi penglihatan akibat kerusakan saraf optik yang disebabkan oleh zat beracun salah satunya adalah etambutol. Kejadian NOT terkait etambutol ini sangat bervariasi dari beberapa studi berkisar antara 0,5 - 35% penderita. Neuropati optik toksik dapat memberikan gejala berupa penurunan penglihatan yang berlangsung progresif, semakin memberat hingga dapat terjadi kebutaan. Meskipun hilangnya penglihatan ini bersifat reversibel saat etambutol diturunkan dosisnya atau dihentikan, beberapa pasien mengalami gangguan penglihatan permanen bahkan dengan dosis obat yang standar. Beberapa kasus progresifitas tetap berjalan meskipun obat telah dihentikan. Seringkali dijumpai perbaikan yang tidak sempurna. Bahkan ada pula yang mengalami kebutaan permanen. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah Melaporkan kasus Neuropati Optik Toksik akibat terapi Etambutol pada penderita TB. Seorang wanita usia 28 tahun, dengan keluhan pandangan kabur sejak satu minggu yang lalu dan dirasakan semakin memberat. Tidak didapatkan keluhan mata merah, nerocoh, maupun nyeri pada mata. Pasien juga mengeluhkan nyeri kepala terasa berat pada seluruh kepala disertai mual. Keluhan lain seperti kejang, penurunan kesadaran, kelemahan separo tubuh, kesemutan, merot, maupun pelo tidak didapatkan. Tidak ada riwayat diabetes maupun hipertensi. Pasien terdiagnosis TB paru satu bulan yang lalu, kemudian mulai menjalani pengobatan TB regimen HRZE dengan dosis standar sejak dua minggu ini. Pemeriksaan Fisik dan neurologis hanya didapatkan penurunan visus VOD 6/20, VOS 6/40, scotoma central, funduskopi macular reflex OS menurun, pemeriksaan lain dalam batas normal.  Pada pasien ini, keluhan pandangan kabur mulai dirasakan setelah satu minggu mengkonsumsi etambutol, durasi ini cukup cepat mengingat pada literatur disebutkan onset munculnya gejala mulai dua bulan hingga enam bulanan. Dosis etambutol yang dikonsumsi oleh pasien ini adalah dosis standar, yaitu 15 mg/kgBB. Pada pemeriksaan fisik& neurologis semua pemeriksaan normal kecuali status oftalmologis. Didapatkan VOD 6/20 VOS 6/20, scotoma central, funduskopi macular reflex menurun. Pemeriksaan laboratorium juga telah dilengkapi dan tidak didapatkan abnormalitas. Pada awalnya pasien juga mengeluh nyeri kepala disertai muntah. Sehingga neurologis juga memikirkan diferential diagnosis suatu proses intrakranial. Namun hal ini telah disingkirkan dengan hasil CT Scan kepala yang menunjukkan gambaran normal. Selama perawatan terapi yang diberikan adalah berupa anti inflamasi, neurotropik, obat simtomatis untuk keluhan nyeri kepala mual muntahnya, dan melanjutkan terapi TBnya tanpa etambutol. Evaluasi visus dilakukan setiap hari saat opname, dilanjutkan tiap minggu saat rawat jalan. Perbaikan mulai dirasakan oleh pasien setidaknya tiga hari setelah dilakukan penghentian regimen etambutol. Perubahan yang signifikan tampak setelah dua minggu penghentian. Kemudian tiga minggu setelah keluhan, di klinik rawat jalan pasien mengatakan bahwa penglihatannya sudah kembali normal, demikian pula hasil pemeriksaannya, VODS 6/6, scotoma central-, funduskopi dbn. Neuropati optic akibat etambutol dapat reversibel. Penghentian obat harus segera dilakukan bila didapatkan keluhan terkait penglihatan pada pasien, yaitu berupa penurunan visus, gangguan lapang pandang, maupun abnormalitas funduskopi. Dari evaluasi visus selama perawatan, pasien mengalami perbaikan visus sempurna dalam waktu tiga minggu setelah obat dihentikan.",

      "title": "THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSIVE STATES WITH G 22355 (IMIPRAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE)",
      "abstract": "Over a three-year period, more than 500 psychiatric patients of various diagnostic categories were treated with imipramine hydrochloride. It was demonstrated that the compound has potent antidepressant action. Best responses were obtained in cases of endogenous depression showing the typical symptoms of mental and motor retardation, fatigue, feeling of heaviness, hopelessness, guilt, and despair. The condition is furthermore characterized by the aggravation of symptoms in the morning with a tendency to improvement during the day. Treatment with imipramine hydrochloride resulted in full or social recovery in a high percentage of the patients. As a rule, the initial response was evident within 2 to 3 days, while in some cases 1 to 4 weeks of therapy were required. In view of the symptomatic nature of the action of imipramine hydrochloride, therapy must be maintained as long as the illness lasts. The side effects noted were relatively slight, and with the exception of one case of severe allergic exanthema necessitating discontinuance of treatment, no serious complications were encountered. In some cases of depression, particularly those associated with organic brain damage or schizophrenic psychosis, transitory states of agitation or exacerbation of the psychotic features were noted. These observations suggest the importance of a proper selection of the patients as to type and etiology of depression. While in a number of instances, neurotic, schizophrenic or other depressions were also benefited by the drug, particularly when used in combination with chlorpromazine, electroshock or psychotherapy, it is concluded that imipramine hydrochloride is primarily indicated and effective in the treatment of endogenous depression.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety is an unpleasant emotional state characterised by fearfulness and unwanted and distressing physical symptoms.It is a normal and appropriate response to stress but becomes pathological when it is disproportionate to the severity of the stress, continues after the stressor has gone, or occurs in the absence of any external stressor.Neurotic disorders with anxiety as a prominent symptom are common: a recent British survey found that 16% of the population suffered from some form of pathological anxiety.Anxiety disorders should be differentiated from stress reactions, in which anxiety may be a prominent feature.These include acute stress reactions-a rapid response (in minutes or hours) to sudden stressful life events, leading to anxiety with autonomic arousal and some disorientation-and adjustment reactions-slower responses to life events (such as loss of job, moving house, or divorce) that occur days or weeks later as symptoms of anxiety, irritability, and depression (without biological symptoms).These are generally self limiting and are helped by reassurance, ventilation, and problem solving.A more profound stress reaction, post-traumatic stress disorder, is described below.Until recently, the commonest response to a presentation of anxiety has been to prescribe a benzodiazepine.This has been much criticised and alternatives have been evaluated, including almost all the available antidepressants and psychological treatments, especially cognitive behaviour therapy.For most general practitioners, constraints on resources are likely to mean that drugs remain the mainstay of treatment.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Some people with epilepsy also have other medical disorders. These other disorders may be completely unrelated to their epilepsy. On the other hand, epilepsy can be the cause of an additional disorder or the consequence of another health problem. Sometimes, epileptic seizures are the first sign of another condition or disease. This chapter will first focus on health problems that can be caused by epilepsy. The second part of the chapter describes other disorders or conditions that can cause epileptic seizures and epilepsy. When a medical disorder causes epileptic seizures, doctors do not always make a diagnosis of epilepsy. If people have seizures that were clearly provoked by another disorder (for instance, a low sodium level caused by diuretic medication—water tablets), treatment should involve the removal of the underlying cause of the seizures and not antiepileptic drugs. However, other medical conditions associated with epilepsy may not always be cured as easily, and people’s quality of life may then be affected by two chronic disorders.",

      "title": "SELECTIVE SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITOR DISCONTINUATION SYNDROME: THREE CASES PRESENTING TO A NEUROLOGIC PRACTICE",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Discontinuation syndromes have been noted for various classes of psychotropic medication and have now been observed for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other new serotonergic antidepressants. REVIEW SUMMARY SSRIs and other new antidepressants are increasingly being used for neurologic disorders as well as for depression and anxiety, which frequently coexist with these illnesses. Recently, a discontinuation syndrome was identified after abrupt and even tapered withdrawal from these agents. The syndrome presents with somatic symptoms of disequilibrium, gastrointestinal symptoms, flu-like symptoms, disrupted sleep, and sensory disturbances as well as psychological symptoms of irritability, crying spells, and anxiety or agitation. These symptoms, which usually appear within 1 to 3 days after the last dose, are usually mild and transient but can be more severely distressing and debilitating and lead to disruption of social or occupational activities. When intervention is required, the primary strategy entails reinstituting the SSRI and, if appropriate, commencing a slow and gradual tapering schedule. We review the cases of three patients with SSRI discontinuation syndrome who presented to the clinic with neurologic complaints. CONCLUSION The primary prevention strategy for discontinuation syndrome is to avoid abrupt discontinuation of antidepressant medication, particularly for agents demonstrating a pharmacologic profile of a short half-life and no active metabolites. Awareness of SSRI discontinuation syndrome facilitates rapid identification and effective intervention as well as improved prevention through patient education. (THE NEUROLOGIST 6:348-352, 2000)",

      "abstract": "The limited psychiatric bedspace due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of access to an up-to-date medication regimen delayed the recognition of the diagnosis and treatment for a 40-year-old man with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, who traveled from his home city and abruptly discontinued his prescription of clozapine. He developed a cholinergic rebound syndrome including delirium and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). The delay included time spent in two different medical hospitals: one awaiting psychiatric bedspace, and secondly, when the patient's cholinergic rebound syndrome was misdiagnosed as acute alcohol withdrawal. Once the etiology was recognized, he was promptly treated with anticholinergic medication (benztropine) and retitrated to his outpatient dose of clozapine leading to the resolution of symptoms including delirium and EPS. This case will discuss the challenges of continuity of care in delirious, psychotic, or otherwise confused patients, including contributions from the COVID-19 pandemic. A medication card or other improvements in medication databases that may reduce delays in treatment are discussed.",

      "title": "Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine Position Paper on Patient Sleep During Hospitalization",
      "abstract": "This article addresses the issue of patient sleep during hospitalization, which the Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine believes merits wider consideration by health authorities than it has received to date. Adequate sleep is fundamental to health and well-being, and insufficiencies in its duration, quality, or timing have adverse effects that are acutely evident. These include cardiovascular dysfunction, impaired ventilatory function, cognitive impairment, increased pain perception, psychomotor disturbance (including increased fall risk), psychological disturbance (including anxiety and depression), metabolic dysfunction (including increased insulin resistance and catabolic propensity), and immune dysfunction and proinflammatory effects (increasing infection risk and pain generation). All these changes negatively impact health status and are counterproductive to recovery from illness and operation. Hospitalization challenges sleep in a variety of ways. These challenges include environmental factors such as noise, bright light, and overnight awakenings for observations, interventions, and transfers; physiological factors such as pain, dyspnea, bowel or urinary dysfunction, or discomfort from therapeutic devices; psychological factors such as stress and anxiety; care-related factors including medications or medication withdrawal; and preexisting sleep disorders that may not be recognized or adequately managed. Many of these challenges appear readily addressable. The key to doing so is to give sleep greater priority, with attention directed at ensuring that patients' sleep needs are recognized and met, both within the hospital and beyond. Requirements include staff education, creation of protocols to enhance the prospect of sleep needs being addressed, and improvement in hospital design to mitigate environmental disturbances. Hospitals and health care providers have a duty to provide, to the greatest extent possible, appropriate preconditions for healing. Accumulating evidence suggests that these preconditions include adequate patient sleep duration and quality. The Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine calls for systematic changes in the approach of hospital leadership and staff to this issue. Measures required include incorporation of optimization of patient sleep into the objectives of perioperative and general patient care guidelines. These steps should be complemented by further research into the impact of hospitalization on sleep, the effects of poor sleep on health outcomes after hospitalization, and assessment of interventions to improve it.",

      "title": "Vulnerabilidad cognitiva a la hipocondría: intrusiones, valoraciones y creencias disfuncionales/ cognitive vulnerability to hypochondriasis: intrusions, appraisals and dysfunctional beliefs",
      "abstract": "Hypochondriasis is a disorder characterized by the fear or belief of suffering from a serious illness based on the negative interpretation of bodily signs and symptoms. After a thorough evaluation, confirmation by a physician that the patient does not have a medical condition does not result in safe and lasting reassurance. Generally, people with hypochondriasis may experience a reduction in anxiety after a visit to the doctor, but this reduction lasts only hours or days. When another symptom occurs, anxiety reappears, and the cycle of hypochondriacal worry resumes. In addition, hypochondriasis can manifest itself in different ways. Some patients have numerous intrusive thoughts and sensations during the day that lead them to consult family, friends, the Internet, or different medical specialists to make sure they are not seriously ill or to identify the course of the disease. Other patients, on the other hand, avoid health care providers and any reference to the disease in their daily lives, so that the anxiety they seek to suppress does not increase. Hypochondriasis has also been conceptualized in cognitive models as an extreme form of health anxiety. Cognitive-behavioral proposals of hypochondriasis and health anxiety and recent research on this disorder have suggested different cognitive variables as possible risk factors for the development and maintenance of the problem. They include intrusive thoughts about possible health hazards (illness-ITs), the dysfunctional appraisals/interpretations and beliefs associated with these thoughts, and dysfunctional assumptions or beliefs about health/illness. Although these variables have been pointed out in the literature as vulnerability factors for hypochondriasis and health anxiety, there are hardly any studies analyzing their role in the genesis and development of the disorder, and the results obtained are not entirely conclusive either. The purpose of this thesis is to clarify the role played by these variables in hypochondriasis and health anxiety. The preliminary study provided a reliable and valid instrument to evaluate health anxiety in Spanish-speaking adults, the Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI). Study 1 explored the presence and characteristics of illness-ITs in the general population, and through this study, a new self-report instrument has been provided, the Illness Intrusive Thoughts Inventory (INPIE), to evaluate illness-ITs. Study 2 examined differences between patients with hypochondriasis and community participants in the recurrence of illness-ITs and the consequences of experiencing them. Studies 2 and 3 also evaluated the role of dysfunctional appraisals and beliefs about illness-ITs. Study 4 analyzed the importance of the family context in the adoption of dysfunctional beliefs about health/illness and thoughts. The results show that (1) the SHAI is an appropriate self-report instrument to measure health anxiety in the Spanish-speaking adult population; (2) the INPIE is an adequate self-report questionnaire to assess the frequency of illness-ITs, as well as the appraisals and control strategies associated with these thoughts; (3) illness-ITs are a universal and dimensional phenomenon; (4) dysfunctional appraisals/interpretations and beliefs about illness-ITs play a significant role in the escalation from normal intrusive cognitions and their associated consequences to clinical health anxiety-related symptoms; and (5) dysfunctional assumptions or beliefs about health/illness and thoughts can be acquired within the family. These results have substantial clinical implications because understanding the functioning and characteristics of some of the key elements in the genesis and development of hypochondriasis and health anxiety may improve and update the treatment protocols for these patients. La hipocondria es un trastorno caracterizado por el miedo o la creencia de padecer una enfermedad grave a partir de la interpretacion negativa de los signos y sintomas corporales. La confirmacion por parte de un medico, despues de una evaluacion exhaustiva, de que el paciente no padece una enfermedad medica, no tiene como resultado una tranquilizacion segura y duradera. Por lo general, las personas que presentan hipocondria pueden experimentar una reduccion de la ansiedad despues de visitar al medico, pero esta reduccion dura solo horas o dias. Cuando se presenta otro sintoma, la ansiedad reaparece y el ciclo de preocupacion hipocondriaca se reanuda. Ademas, la hipocondria se puede manifestar de diferentes maneras. Algunos pacientes tienen numerosos pensamientos intrusos y sensaciones durante el dia que los llevan a consultar con la familia, amigos, internet o diferentes especialistas medicos para asegurarse de que no estan gravemente enfermos o para identificar el curso de la enfermedad. Y, otros pacientes, por el contrario, evitan a los proveedores de servicios de salud y cualquier referencia a la enfermedad en su vida diaria, para que no aumente la ansiedad que buscan reprimir. La hipocondria se ha conceptualizado tambien, desde los modelos cognitivos, como la forma mas extrema de ansiedad por la salud. Las propuestas cognitivo-conductuales de la hipocondria y las investigaciones recientes en torno a este trastorno han sugerido diferentes variables cognitivas como posibles factores de riesgo para el desarrollo y mantenimiento del problema. Entre ellos, destacan: los pensamientos intrusos sobre los posibles peligros para la salud (PIEs), las valoraciones/interpretaciones y creencias disfuncionales asociadas a estos pensamientos, y los supuestos o creencias disfuncionales sobre la salud/enfermedad. Aunque todas estas variables se han senalado, en la literatura cientifica, como factores de vulnerabilidad hacia la hipocondria, no existen apenas estudios en los que se analice su papel en la genesis y evolucion del trastorno, y los resultados obtenidos tampoco son del todo concluyentes. Por todo ello, la presente Tesis tiene como finalidad clarificar el rol que juegan los pensamientos intrusos, las valoraciones/interpretaciones y las creencias disfuncionales (sobre los pensamientos y sobre la salud/enfermedad) en la hipocondria y la ansiedad por la salud. El estudio preliminar proporciono un instrumento fiable y valido para evaluar la ansiedad por la salud en adultos de habla hispana, el Inventario Breve de Ansiedad por la Salud (SHAI). El Estudio 1 exploro la presencia y caracteristicas de los PIEs en la poblacion general, y a traves de este estudio se ha proporcionado un nuevo instrumento de autoinforme, el Inventario de Pensamientos Intrusos sobre la Enfermedad (INPIE), para evaluar los PIEs. El estudio 2 examino las diferencias entre los pacientes con hipocondria y los participantes de la comunidad en la recurrencia con la que se experimentaban PIEs y las consecuencias derivadas de su experimentacion. Los estudios 2 y 3 tambien evaluaron el papel de las valoraciones y creencias disfuncionales asociadas a los PIEs. El estudio 4 analizo la importancia del contexto familiar en la adopcion de supuestos o creencias disfuncionales sobre la salud/enfermedad y los pensamientos. Los resultados muestran que (1) el SHAI es un instrumento de autoinforme apropiado para medir la ansiedad por la salud en la poblacion adulta de habla hispana; (2) el INPIE es un cuestionario de autoinforme adecuado para evaluar la frecuencia de los PIEs, asi como las valoraciones y estrategias de control asociadas a estos pensamientos; (3) los PIEs son un fenomeno universal y dimensional; (4) las valoraciones/interpretaciones y creencias disfuncionales asociadas a los PIEs juegan un papel significativo en la escalada de los pensamientos intrusos normales y sus consecuencias funcionales a los sintomas clinicos relacionados con la ansiedad por la salud, y (5) los supuestos o creencias disfuncionales sobre la salud/enfermedad y los pensamientos pueden adquirirse en el seno familiar. Estos resultados tienen implicaciones clinicas sustanciales, ya que la comprension del funcionamiento y las caracteristicas de algunos de los elementos clave para la genesis y el desarrollo de la hipocondria y la ansiedad para la salud puede mejorar y actualizar los protocolos de tratamiento para estos pacientes.",

      "title": "Nicotine withdrawal versus other drug withdrawal syndromes: similarities and dissimilarities",
      "abstract": "Abstract Many of the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal are similar to those of other drug withdrawal syndromes: anxiety, awakening during sleep, depression, difficulty concentrating, impatience, irritability/anger and restlessness. Slowing of the heart rate and weight gain are distinguishing features of tobacco withdrawal. Although nicotine withdrawal may not produce medical consequences, it lasts for several weeks and can be severe in some smokers. Like most other drug withdrawals, nicotine withdrawal is time‐limited, occurs in non‐humans, is influenced by instructions/expectancy and abates with replacement therapy and gradual reduction. Unlike some other drug withdrawal syndromes, protracted, neonatal or precipitated withdrawal does not occur. Whether nicotine withdrawal is associated with tolerance, acute physical dependence, greater duration and intensity of use, rapid reinstatement, symptom stages, cross‐dependence with other nicotine ligands, reduction by non‐pharmacological interventions and genetic influences is unclear. Whether nicotine withdrawal plays a major role in relapse to smoking has not been established but this is also true for other drug withdrawal syndromes.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury can produce various neuropsychiatric impairments and a high susceptibility to adverse effects of psychotropic medications. A 6-year-old boy developed symptoms of ADHD after head trauma at age 30 months. Three different psychostimulants, three tricyclic antidepressants, clonidine, bupropion, fluoxetine, and propranolol were either ineffective or produced adverse effects. Side effects mainly consisted of organic mood syndrome (despite the lack of apparent genetic or organic mood disorder), sympathomimetic intoxication, and sympathomimetic hallucinosis. Buspirone (10 mg q.i.d.) produced significant improvement in impulsivity and hyperactivity, but not in attention deficits. Methamphetamine (5 mg every morning), added to the buspirone, was effective in treating the remaining attentional symptoms. These treatments were readily tolerated, and the child has remained stable for 2 years on buspirone and methamphetamine. The symptoms of mood disorder were present only during stimulant or antidepressant treatment, and therefore the diagnosis of organic mood disorder did not apply. Apart from medication side effects, the child appeared to have an \"organically-based pharmacological vulnerability to mood disorder\" and postinjury ADHD (although comorbid neuropsychiatric conditions might have contributed to the complex clinical picture). This single case study was uncontrolled, did not involve drug withdrawal design, and used clinical observations rather than standardized measures. Further study is needed before buspirone can be viewed as safe or effective for treating TBI, but buspirone may be an attractive alternative for managing certain behavioral problems following brain injury, especially in patients sensitive to adverse effects of psychotropic medications.",

      "abstract": "Background: Overactive bladder syndrome is a urinary disorder that occurs more frequently in women andolder people and is characterized by feeling an urge to urinate (sudden urge to urinate, with the feeling thatyou cannot get to the bathroom in time), doing it many times throughout the day (more than six) or havingepisodes of urinary incontinence (involuntary loss of urine) and nocturia (waking up several times duringthe night to urinate). In addition, other secondary symptoms may also occur, such as headache, dry mouth orblurred vision, among others. It is a problem that has a clear impact on the quality of life of those who sufferit and that can lead them to significantly reduce their social activity and negatively condition their work.Overactive bladder (OAB) is defined as urinary urgency with or without urgency urinary incontinence,nocturia, and/or frequency in the absence of UTI or other obvious pathology. Sacral neuromodulation is anewer surgical therapy for refractory OAB.Aim of Study: Is to assess the sacral neuromodulation (SN) safety and efficacy in refractory overactivebladder patients.Patients and Methods: In the period from November 2015 to May 2017. the unit of neurogenic bladderand neuromodulation in (Gazi Al_Harriry) surgical specialty hospital, medical city complex 27 patient agedfrom (17—55) year old were complaining from refractory overactive bladder. All the 27 patients underwentstage1 &amp; stage2 SNS devices implantation.Results: Patients of urgency incontinence (group1) demonstrated that the number of leak was significantlyreduced (p=0.01) after implantation of SN, (11.6_2.7) leak/day pre&amp; post SN, numbers of pads (6.9 _ 0.8)pad/day pre&amp;post SN. Patients with urgency frequency (group 2), numbers of voids/day pre &amp; post SNimplantation decreased significantly (p=0.01) (14.7 _ 6) voids /day. The voided volume increased significantly(p=0.02) from (136.4 _ 371.8) ml/void. The urgency episodes were decreased significantly (p=0.01) from(6.4 _ 2.1) episode/day. The complications occurred in 5 patients (18.5%). Two patients (7.4%) developedpain after trauma to the back, lead migration, lack of efficacy of device, treated by reprogramming thedevice, one patient (3.7%) get infection at the site of device implantation, SN was removed , there was onefemale patient (3.7%) got pregnancy and devise was deactivated. One patient (3.7%) complaining from painand discomfort at the device site was treated conservatively.Conclusion: Sacral neuromodulation is FDA approved as option for treatment of refractory OAB. There isexpanding of utilizing of SN in the past two decades. According to multiple studies in addition to our studyresults. The sacral neuromodulation is safe and efficacious treatment option for refractory OAB.",

      "abstract": "The aim of the regional administration of opioids is to provide an efficient and prolonged analgesia. Then, opiates can be useful for postoperative analgesia and for the treatment of chronic pain of malignant origin. Analgesia is correlated with several adverse effects of which the most frequent are nausea and itching and the most severe is respiratory depression. Beside the adverse effects, other properties of opiates could be responsible of favourable effects which can be taken in advantage in specific indications. In the postoperative period, epidurally administered opioid can attenuate the neuroendocrine and metabolic responses to surgery and pain. This effect is responsible of a reduction of the resistance to insulin and of a better nutritional balance, especially after major abdominal surgical procedures. Opioids also act by a reduction of the motor functions of the bowel, which perhaps could reduce the incidence of anastomotic breakdowns. Finally, other effects have been reported, as anecdotes, such as the treatment of spasm after bilateral replantation of the ureters, neurologic bladder dysfunctions and enuresis. Spinal administration of opioids has also been used as a treatment of premature ejaculation.",

MHs are characterized by perception of melodies, music, or songs. AHs/MHs can be associated with hypoacusis, psychiatric or neurological diseases, intoxication and adverse reactions of different medications (e.g., propranolol, amantadine, voriconazole).The authors present a case of a 77-year-old male with advanced heart failure, recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillations and moderate hypoacusis, who mistakenly overdosed oral amiodarone (6 pills 200 mg each daily within 3 days). After administration of 12 pills during 2 days, he started hearing music and songs not heard by others. One day later, when the number of ingested pills increased to 18, he decided to discontinue amiodarone and consulted a cardiologist; no signs of physical, ECG or laboratory deterioration were observed. MHs disappeared next day and returned only as a single episode when he tried to restart amiodarone at a dose of 1 pill daily 2 weeks later. Finally, following complete removal of the medication, he experienced no MHs whatsoever. Amiodarone is known to seldom cause neurological or mental complications; however, MHs after the drug have never been reported so far.",

Thus, someone could remain symptomatic from concussion more than two weeks following the injury. At that point, however, the discerning clinician must differentiate prolonged concussion symptoms from the evolution of persistent symptoms from comorbid neurologic conditions or emerging mental health symptoms or disorders. Too often, prolonged or persistent symptoms are not considered in the context of initial concussion injury and symptoms, proper return to activity, or emerging comorbid conditions that can also lead to persistent symptoms.",

It does not (a) have any anticonvulsant activity, (b) interact with the benzodiazepines or alcohol, or (c) have a demonstrated abuse potential. 1 In many ways, it is ideally suited for the treatment of mild to moderate anxiety. However, since buspirone does not interact with the benzodiazepines, it does not protect against benzodiazepine withdrawal. Such withdrawal can present as either a minor or a major abstinence syndrome, with the former being more frequent and preceding the latter. The minor abstinence syndrome consists of anxiety, restlessness, anorexia, dysphoria, and insomnia. In the major abstinence syndrome, withdrawal phenomena include grand mal seizures, delirium, and psychosis. 2,3 Withdrawal phenomena are documented for benzodiazepines with a long (eg, diazepam) or short (eg, lorazepam) half-life.

      "abstract": "Substance abuse complicates pain management. The comorbidity of substance abuse and pain is particularly problematic in the United States and Canada, substantially more than in most countries with advanced health care systems. Treatment of pain with long-term opioids, particularly in high doses, is known to be associated with substantial medical comorbidity, unintentional overdoses, and death. Treatment of opioid dependence in the chronic pain patient is necessary for effective pain management, whether or not the patient uses drugs illicitly. Opioids, particularly in high doses, produce central nervous system neuroadaptations that reduce or eliminate analgesic effectiveness and enhance sensitivity to pain in general. The neuroadaptations often result in opioid dependency and, in the long-term, craving. Weaning patients from chronic opioids can be exquisitely difficult if simple dose reduction is attempted. The process can be quite successful and gratifying, however, if certain principles are followed. These include education, comfortable detoxification using long-acting opioids, usually methadone or buprenorphine, nonopioid pain management, psychological support, and coordinated care.",

The true incidence of this discontinuation syndrome is unknown because it may be underreported as a consequence of underrecognition or misattribution. This article examines the possible etiology, nosology, mechanisms, and other aspects of the syndrome. Data Sources and Study Selection: A PubMed search was conducted in May 2003 and repeated in January 2004 using the search terms antidepressant and mania. Relevant articles containing adequate descriptions for presentation were retrieved, and their reference lists were hand-searched for further pertinent material. Hand-searches of the indexes of leading psychiatry journals were also performed for the years 1998-2003. Twenty-three articles were identified for review. Conclusions: Antidepressant-withdrawal hypomania or mania may occur rarely with almost any antidepressant drug after sudden withdrawal, tapered discontinuation, or even merely a decrease in dose. The syndrome may be self-limiting, may abate with the reinstitution of the antidepressant drug, or may require specific antimanic treatments; mood stabilizers do not necessarily protect against the syndrome. The true incidence of the syndrome is unknown. Narrow and broad diagnostic criteria are proposed for the syndrome, and a synthesis of literature is provided.",

They can, however, markedly diminish withdrawal symptoms and craving, and block opioid effects due to lapses.The most effective withdrawal method is substituting and tapering methadone or buprenorphine, α-2 Adrenergic agents can ameliorate untreated symptoms or substitute for agonists if not available. Shortening withdrawal by precipitating it with narcotic antagonists has been studied, but the methods are plagued by safety issues or persisting symptoms. Neither the withdrawal agents nor the methods are associated with better long-term outcome, which appears mostly related to post-detoxification treatment.Excluding those with short-term habits, the best outcome occurs with long-term maintenance on methadone or buprenorphine accompanied by appropriate psychosocial interventions. Those with strong external motivation may do well on the antagonist naltrexone. Currently, optimum duration of maintenance on either is unclear.

It is additionally recognized as an agent with antidepressant potential. For depression, it is most commonly administered as a slow intravenous infusion in subanesthetic doses (usually 0.5 mg/kg). As an antidepressant, is strikingly different from conventional antidepressant drugs in that it brings about rapid and marked attenuation of depressive symptoms even in patients with refractory depression. The benefits are observed within hours of administration, peak after about a day, and are lost 3-12 days later. Patients who do not benefit after the initial dose may benefit with serial dosing or at higher doses. Benefits can be maintained for weeks to months by the continuation of ketamine sessions at 2- to 4-day intervals. Adverse effects include dissociative and psychotomimetic changes that are almost always mild and transient, if present; transient elevation of heart rate and blood pressure often occur. These changes are usually well tolerated and are very seldom responsible for treatment discontinuation. Whereas ketamine is an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, and whereas much is known about its different biological effects, its actions that mediate the antidepressant response are presently not known for certain. Although big data on ketamine are presently unavailable, the drug holds promise in the treatment of depression, especially refractory depression.",

      "abstract": "Sleeping disturbance constitutes a major problem occurring in 25% of people aged over 65. Among the most frequent reasons of insomnia one can mention the overuse of coffee, alcohol, smoking, using some drugs, stress, depression, neurosis, dementia, chronic diseases. Idiopathic insomnia constitutes less than 5% of cases. Before the treatment of insomnia is started, its cause should be found and it should be determined if it is transient or chronic. The treatment of insomnia can be based on pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacotherapy methods. Behavioural therapy is mentioned among non-pharmacotherapeutic methods. It aims at changing the sleep-related habits. Pharmacotherapeutic treatment (still mostly based on benzodiazepines) should not last longer than 2-3 weeks and drugs of short elimination T 1/2 (below 6 hours) should be used. Side-effects of this group of drugs should always be taken into consideration. It should be remembered that sleep disturbances can be symptoms of other diseases and their treatment cannot consist in prescribing hypnotics only.",

      "title": "Peripheral opioid antagonism",
      "abstract": "Opioid induced bowel dysfunction may be associated with constipation, incomplete evacuation, bloating sensation and increased reflux of stomach contents. It may be unpredictable in onset, develop immediately after the first dose, persist throughout the analgesic period and, unlike the analgesia, exhibit lack of tolerance. This may follow both acute or chronic opioid intake. Acutely, it usually manifests as a part of a postoperative ileus that itself may be attributed to surgical stress, or to alterations in fluid and electrolyte balance [1]. In patients with chronic usage of opioids, the bowel dysfunction may manifest as a range of symptoms with more than half of patients experiencing constipation. While analgesia is predominantly attributed to centrally mediated opioid actions, these unwanted gastrointestinal side effects may be more peripherally related and have been associated with the enteric μ receptors [2]. This has led to the development of peripherally antagonist opioid drugs, two of which (methylnaltrexone and alvimopan) have been recently approved by the FDA (although not available in the UK yet) and release of a fixed-dose opioid agonist-antagonist combination (oxycodone and naloxone) in the UK and Europe. Methylnaltrexone (Fig. 1) is a charged, quarternary amine, a N-methyl derivative of the opioid antagonist naltrexone. Addition of the methyl group confers polarity to the molecule and reduces the lipid solubility, hence reducing its passage across the blood-brain barrier [3]. Methylnaltrexone has a high affinity to the μ receptor (IC50 = 70 nmol.l−1) with some affinity to the κ receptor (IC50 = 575 nmol.l−1) and virtually no affinity to the δ receptor [3]. Methylnaltrexone is approved by the European Medicines Agency for clinical use and is administered subcutaneously in a dose of 0.15 mg.kg−1 (12 mg.0.6 ml−1 solution in a single vial) for treatment of opioid induced constipation in patients with advanced illness when response to laxative therapy has not been sufficient. Methylnaltrexone. Clinically it has demonstrated a reduction in gastrointestinal time (93–110 min vs 140–163 min for placebo; 95% CI −73 to −32 min) [4]. It might be particularly beneficial for inpatients (both in postoperative and medical wards), many of whom are on long-term opioid therapy. These patients usually experience a good analgesic effect and response to opioids but have a poor compliance due to opioid induced bowel dysfunction. Methylnaltrexone has been used safely in patients on long-term methadone programmes administered both intravenously [5] and orally [6]. While it decreased oral-caecal transit time, no opioid withdrawal symptoms were reported in any of the groups. The side effects are predominantly associated with gut overactivity and may manifest as abdominal cramps and flatulence, although dose limiting orthostatic hypotension at high plasma concentrations (> 1400 ng.ml-1) has also been reported [4]. Alvimopan (Fig. 2) is a synthetic high molecular weight quarternary zwitterion (a molecule with both positive and negative regions of charge) that is a highly potent competitive antagonist at the human μ receptor. In contrast to methylnaltrexone, alvimopan has a higher affinity to the μ receptor and owes its action to its kinetics with a relatively slow dissociation from the receptors. Its oral bioavailability is only 6%, restricting its activity predominantly to the gut where it gets metabolised [7]. Although the molecule has been investigated for its efficacy in both opioid induced constipation and acute postoperative ileus, the focus in development has been primarily towards the latter. In patients who developed postoperative ileus after undergoing bowel resection and hysterectomy (Cochrane data, n = 2225) [4], alvimopan administration reduced the time to first bowel movement or flatus, or total time to pass flatus when compared with placebo [8–12]. Patients in the alvimopan group also showed a reduced requirement for postoperative X-ray and nasogastric tube insertion compared with placebo [4]. However, its use is currently limited to acute administration since, although alvimopan has demonstrated a reduction in time to first bowel movement and changes in spontaneous bowel movement frequency in patients on methadone programmes with opioid induced constipation, long-term efficacy studies have found an association between treatment with alvimopman and an increased risk of cardiovascular events (n = 7 (1.3%) vs n = 0) [13]. As these events were reported within the first 12 weeks of treatment, they may not be ultimately related to long-term duration of the dose, but there remains a need for concrete evidence with regards to the safety of the drug for its long-term usage. Alvimopan is licensed to prevent postoperative ileus in patients with a partial large or small bowel resection with primary anastomosis, and only approved for short-term use of no more than 15 doses. It is available as gelatin capsule, administered orally as 12 mg, 30 min to 5 h pre-operatively and 12 mg twice daily for 7 days postoperatively. Alvimopan. In contrast to the newer drugs, methylnaltrexone and alvimopan, naloxone (Fig. 3) is a non-specific opioid antagonist that has been commonly used intravenously to reverse opioid related effects for years. Structurally a tertiary amine, it is the N-alkyl derivative of oxymorphine with substitution of the allyl group for the methyl group conferring its antagonist properties. It has a high affinity for the μ receptor and a lesser affinity for κ and δ receptors. It can cross the blood-brain barrier and is well absorbed following oral administration, where it undergoes hepatic metabolism with a low oral bioavailability of < 2% [14] This poor oral bioavailability limits any beneficial effects when administered orally in standard preparation and dosages. In theory, orally administered high doses of naloxone should be devoid of ‘central’ CNS-type effects while exerting an inhibitor effect on the ‘peripheral’ gastrointestinal system at the myenteric plexus in the gut, where μ receptors are primarily located. Oral naloxone has been studied for some time with regards to its CNS sparing action for some time and the results have been equivocal. Liu et al., [15] successfully demonstrated that naloxone administration improved bowel frequency in patients on long-term morphine and oxycodone for malignant and non-malignant pain, with patients in the naloxone group also needing more analgesia. The study was, however, inadequately powered (n = 9) to draw firm conclusions. In contrast, in a placebo controlled study of patients undergoing subtotal gastrectomy (n = 43), naloxone administered epidurally alongside morphine improved constipation (p < 0.001) while there were no reported differences in pain scores between the two groups [16]. In patients who have received mechanical ventilation in the ICU on sedation/analgesia, naloxone administration via the nasogastric tube reduced both gastric reflux and pneumonia without reversing analgesia or triggering any increase in opioid requirement [17, 18]. A Cochrane review investigating the efficacy of naloxone on its own for opioid induced constipation failed to draw any positive conclusions due the variability of data and poor design of some of the studies [4]. One of the reasons may be that it is immediate release oral naloxone that has been primarily investigated in these studies; this might not outlast the longer acting opioid when used chronically. Naloxone. A new development has been the preparation of a fixed-dose of the oral prolonged-release opioid agonist, oxycodone, and prolonged-release naloxone, focussing mainly on opioid induced constipation. A placebo controlled, double-blind study, investigating the efficacy of oral prolonged-release naloxone in patients with mainly non-malignant chronic pain (n = 202) on stable prolonged-release oxycodone, reported an improvement in bowel function [19]. No loss of analgesic efficacy with naloxone was observed. In another phase-III, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy study in patients with chronic non-malignant back pain (n = 463), a fixed-dose combination of prolonged-release oxycodone and prolonged-release naloxone demonstrated a superior analgesic efficacy over placebo (p < 0.001) [20]. In this study, a subset analysis of 59 patients with a higher bowel function index, (a patient-reported quantitative measure of constipation) reported a decrease in scores (improving constipation) over a period of 12 weeks. A comparative study of oral prolonged-release oxycodone vs a combination of oral prolonged-release oxycodone and naloxone, in patients with moderate to severe non-malignant pain, reported a similar improvement in bowel function without reducing analgesic efficacy [21]. Available for use in Europe since 2006 and now available in UK in a fixed-dose preparation of prolonged-release oxycodone hydrochloride/naloxone combination (10 mg/5 mg and 20 mg/10 mg), it is currently licensed for treatment of severe pain that can only be managed with opioid analgesics. Managing opioid induced gastrointestinal side effects has always been a challenge. Development of the two new, exciting, peripherally acting μ receptor antagonists, methylnaltrexone and alvimopan, holds promise–especially in the acute peri-operative situation, while the unique fixed-dose combination of prolonged-release oxycodone and prolonged-release naloxone might confer therapeutic advantage in patients on chronic opioid therapy, where constipation remains the most common side effect of long-term opioid administration.",

Psychotic symptoms have not been prominent in the relatively few withdrawal reactions to benzodiazepines reported in the medical literature since our first experimental study (<i>Psychopharmacologia</i>2:63-68, 1961). These reactions are modified in severity and attenuated over time because of the long persistence of the drug and its active metabolites in the body. Withdrawal reactions are dependent on high dosage of drug sustained rather constantly over time, with rapid rate of disappearance of the drug when it is discontinued.

      "abstract": "Mr. X is a Swiss patient with Bainbridge-Ropers syndrome clinically and genetically diagnosed at the age of 28. He is also known to have severe intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy since the age of 18. At the age of 30, he was admitted for the first time to a psychiatric crisis unit dedicated to mental disabilities for challenging behavior such as self-aggression (forceful vomiting, scratching himself, pulling out his toe and fingernails or banging his head against the wall), agitation, screaming, dropping to the ground, damaging electronic items, or even displaying hetero-aggressive gestures (trying to bite or pull hair, scratching, kicking, or punching) associated with a drop in mood, withdrawal from usual activities, a drop in social interaction and a tendency to doze off during the day. The introduction of Pregabalin leads to rapid stabilization of the clinical state, almost complete improvement in challenging behavior and gradual withdrawal of other treatments (class 2 analgesics, neuroleptics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines). At the neurological check-up 9 months after discharge from hospital, clinical stability was confirmed by the surrounding team and the medical observation, with almost complete disappearance of auto-aggressive gestures.",

In addition, 91% experienced “cravings'and 87% felt “restless and irritable'when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. Contrary to expectations, none of the symptoms correlated with gender, type of gambling, extent of alcohol or drug use while gambling, or self‐described alcoholism or drug addiction. Symptoms did correlate with number of hours spent gambling, severity of the problem as measured by proposed DSM‐IV criteria, and presence of dissociation.",

Se presenta frecuentemente asociado a pacientes con diagnósticos de patologías orgánicas que son causa de dolor crónico. Estos pacientes frecuentemente presentan una escalada de tratamiento analgésico con inicio de tratamientos con opioides por refractariedad a los tratamientos previos. Algunos de estos pacientes desarrollan un Trastorno por Uso de Opioides, con características como fenómenos de tolerancia, dependencia y abstinencia similares a las adicciones a otras sustancias. En ocasiones, a pesar del aumento de dosis no se consiga un alivio del dolor, secundario a otros fenómenos de hiperalgesia y sensibilización central. Existe entonces un predominio de las conductas asociadas a la adicción. Se han identificado diferentes factores tanto personales como del entorno relacionados con el desarrollo del Trastorno por Uso de Opioides en pacientes con tratamiento con opioides y dolor crónico. Entre estos factores también se encuentra la comorbilidad psiquiátrica con trastorno mental grave y trastorno por uso de múltiples sustancias. En la Unidad de Adicciones de Barakaldo se realiza seguimiento de 9 pacientes con este diagnóstico tras realizar un tratamiento analgésico para manejo del dolor crónico refractario a otras intervenciones. Exponemos de forma descriptiva los datos recopilados durante su seguimiento y planteamos una revisión de la literatura con el objetivo de contextualizar un programa de intervención en Unidades de Adicciones debido a la complejidad y necesidad de un abordaje global de estos pacientes.",

The risk of ototoxicity increases with higher aspirin doses and prolonged treatment course. We report a case of sudden sensorineural hearing loss and dizziness and tinnitus after six hours with ordinary therapeutic dose of aspirin. The patient complained of bilateral tinnitus, ear fullness, and continuous dizziness for several hours with nausea and vomiting. In this case, the patient stopped taking the aspirin and there was a hearing improvement after three days.

      "abstract": "Chronic diseases often require long-lasting pharmacotherapy. Administration of some medicines on a daily routine may cause troublesome adverse effects thus discouraging the patient from further treatment. An abrupt withdrawal of formerly continuous pharmacotherapy not proceeded by the professional medical consultation may endanger the patient either due to the relapse of the disease or the onset of withdrawal symptoms that, despite some opinions, are not limited only to potentially addictive medications. These symptoms may be mistaken for a clinical manifestation of a yet another medical condition of the ill leading to a vicious cycle of repeated diagnostics – additional pharmacotherapy – discontinuation of treatment due to drug intolerance – novel symptoms – repeated diagnostics etc., especially in the elderly. Unfortunately, even some medical doctors tend to forget that administration of specific drugs should not be stopped suddenly because certain withdrawal symptoms are more harmful than mild drug-induced adverse reactions. On the other hand, this is the clinician’s individual decision whether to stop or to continue the treatment in the presence of drug intolerance reported by the patient as many “practical” guidelines either do not give any recommendations or the statements are too general to be helpful in every-day practice. Therefore, the authors review the data on the causative factors and clinical implications of a sudden drug withdrawal, including mainly stricte non-addictive medicines in use for diseases of high incidence in general population.",

El diagnóstico de Trastorno de Evitación y Restricción de la Ingesta de Alimentos, (ARFID, de sus siglas en inglés) fue incluido en el Manual Diagnóstico y Estadístico de Trastornos Mentales, 5ta Edición (DSM-5) el año 2013, como un nuevo diagnóstico dentro de los Trastornos Alimentarios y de Ingesta (TAI) para describir un grupo de pacientes que tienen conductas alimentarias evitativas o restrictivas que no están motivadas por una alteración de la imagen corporal o un deseo de adelgazar. Este trastorno puede manifestarse en una pérdida de peso significativa y/o deficiencia nutricional y/o una marcada interferencia en el funcionamiento psicosocial. Se describen tres formas de presentación que pueden ocurrir en conjunto o de manera independiente: (i) Niños con aversiones sensoriales (selectivos), que rechazan algunas comidas por sus sabores, texturas, olores o formas; (ii) otros que presentan inapetencia, baja ingesta o poco interés en alimentarse (ingesta limitada); (iii) y los que rechazan algunos alimentos o dejan de comer después de un evento traumático asociado (aversivos). Debido a la incorporación reciente del diagnóstico al DSM-5, existe aún escasa evidencia respecto a su enfrentamiento.

According to this hypothesis, 1 drug abuse begins as a partially successful attempt to assuage painful feelings. This does not mean seeking pleasure from the use of drugs. Rather, individuals predisposed by biological or psychological vulnerabilities find that drug effects corresponding to their particular problems are powerfully reinforcing. For example, clinical observations suggest that persons who have difficulty regulating mood may be particularly vulnerable to abuse of cocaine or other stimulant drugs, persons who have difficulty controlling anger to abuse of heroin and other opioids, and persons who have high anxiety levels to abuse of alcohol and other sedatives. Many drug abusers report that their drug helped them to feel normal, even before they developed physiological dependence with continued drug use necessary to prevent withdrawal symptoms. 1 Such clinical observations are supported by the recent",

      "abstract": "The occurrence of a single seizure does not always require initiation of antiepileptic drugs. Risk of recurrent seizures should guide their use. In adults, key risk factors for recurrence are two unprovoked seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart, epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalography, abnormal brain imaging, nocturnal seizures, or an epileptic syndrome associated with seizures. In children, key risk factors are abnormal electroencephalography results, an epileptic syndrome associated with seizures, severe head trauma, and cerebral palsy. The risk of adverse effects from antiepileptic drugs is considerable and includes potential cognitive and behavioral effects. In the absence of risk factors, and because many patients do not experience recurrence of a seizure, physicians should consider delaying use of antiepileptic drugs until a second seizure occurs. Delaying therapy until a second seizure does not affect one- to two-year remission rates. Treatment should begin with monotherapy. The appropriate choice of medication varies depending on seizure type. Routine monitoring of drug levels is not correlated with reduction in adverse effects or improvement in effectiveness and is not recommended. When patients have been seizure free for two to five years, discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs may be considered. For patients with seizures that are not controlled with these agents, alternative treatments include surgical resection of the seizure focus, ketogenic diets, vagus nerve stimulators, and implantable brain neurostimulators. Patients who have had a recent seizure within the past three months or whose seizures are poorly controlled should refrain from driving and certain high-risk physical activities. Patients planning for pregnancy should know that antiepileptic drugs are possibly teratogenic.",

The most serious sort of subdural hematoma is this one. Following a head injury, the symptoms are severe and appear quickly, which can take anywhere from minutes to hours. The pressure on the brain quickly rises as blood accumulates. If you are not diagnosed and treated as soon as possible, you will die., you may lose consciousness, become paralysed, or even die. A subdural haematoma is potentially fatal. A serious head injury that causes blood vessels to burst is a common cause. As Blood can pool as a result, putting pressure on the brain. The effects of age and blood thinning medications, and other factors all raise the risk. as well as alcohol consumption Symptoms such as After a brain injury, symptoms such as headache, confusion, vomiting, slurred speech, or coma may emerge immediately or weeks later. Symptoms of a subdural haematoma may or may not occur. Main symptoms and Important clinical findings: Because the lower-pressure veins involved bleed more slowly than arteries, the main symptoms of a subdural hematoma appear later than those of an epidural haemorrhage. Acute hematoma signs and symptoms can occur in minutes, if not seconds, but they can also take up to two weeks to appear. Chronic subdural hematomas normally take four to seven weeks to manifest symptoms. The main diagnose, therapeutic intervention and outcomes: A subdural hematoma (SDH) is a common neurosurgical condition that frequently necessitates surgery. It's a sort of intracranial haemorrhage that happens behind the dura (basically, an accumulation of the presence of blood on the brain's surface) and can be linked to other brain traumas. Conclusion: The complication of ruptured, large intracavernous aneurysms is acute SDH. The postulated mechanism for the development of SDH is cavernous sinus wall erosion caused by acute aneurysm expansion after thrombosis.",

      "title": "Familial Dysautonomia",
      "abstract": "Familial dysautonomia or the Riley-Day syndrome was first described in 1949 with a report of five cases (14). Dysautonomia refers to the characteristic dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system upon which are superimposed both motor and sensory abnormalities; familial refers to the genetic nature of the abnormality, which is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait occurring almost exclusively in Jewish families of East European extraction (12). The clinical features may be grouped into major categories resulting from apparent dysfunction of the dominantly involved systems: (a) episodic hypertension and postural hypotension, transient (erythematous) blotching of the skin, cool extremities, excessive perspiration, hypolacrimation, episodic unexplained fever, episodic vomiting; (b) disordered swallowing, dysarthria, motor inco-ordination; (c) marked diminution in sensory modalities (notably pain and taste), decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes, corneal hypesthesia (leading to corneal scarring). Additional, almost constant features are emotional lability, recurrent pulmonic infection, kyphoscoliosis, and other bony changes. The occasional occurrence of convulsions is noted, but mental retardation is not thought to be an important primary feature of this syndrome. Recent communications have emphasized the probably pathognomonic absence of the fungiform papillae of the tongue with the presumed absence of the associated taste buds; frequently there is concomitant absence of the circumvallate papillae (4, 15). Pharmacologic investigations have revealed hypersensitivity to both norepinephrine and methacholine, absence of normal responses to intradermal histamine, and restoration of many of the abnormal sensory and parasympathetic findings with infused methacholine (4, 16). Despite the wide array of symptomatology and despite the fact that the radiologist is frequently involved with the initial diagnosis of this disease because of the chronic and recurrent pneumonic episodes that often mimic cystic fibrosis, there is a dearth of radiographic literature available concerning this syndrome. Kirkpatrick and Riley in 1957 discussed the general radiographic findings (10). They found that chronic bronchopneumonia was the most common and important radiographic feature. They also reported the skeletal changes of abnormal and retarded growth, of kyphoscoliosis, and of traumatic sequelae in a large percentage of their cases. Of their 7 patients who underwent examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract, none showed any major abnormality, although one patient had nonpersistent pylorospasm. Linde and Westover in 1962 discussed the esophageal and gastric changes seen in their 6 patients (11). Difficulty in swallowing was present in 2.",

Second, they consistently demonstrate relapse to the agent of abuse; that is, they attempt to stop using the drug for varying periods of time but return to it despite a specific intent to avoid it. This treatment approach is not necessary for those abusers who can, in fact, learn to set limits on their use of alcohol or drugs; their use may be treated as a behavioral symptom in a more traditional psychotherapeutic fashion. Nor is it directed at those patients for whom the addictive pattern is most unmanageable (e.g., addicted people with unusual destabilizing circumstances such as homelessness, severe character pathology, or psychosis). These patients may need special supportive care (e.g., inpatient detoxification or long-term residential treatment).",

      "abstract": "![][1]</img> This article is part of a new initiative in Evidence-based Mental Health, namely the serialisation of chapters of Clinical Evidence (a summary of the best available evidence on common clinical interventions updated regularly by the BMJ Publishing Group). This article is based on material presented in: Kumar S, Oakley-Browne M. Panic disorder. Clinical Evidence 2002; 8: 1003–9. For this review, Clinical Evidence searched and appraised material published until May 2002. Studies with follow up periods of less than 6 months were excluded. A panic attack is a period in which there is sudden onset of intense apprehension, fearfulness or terror, often associated with feelings of impending doom. Panic disorder occurs when there are recurrent, unpredictable attacks followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern about having another panic attack; worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attacks, or a significant behavioural change related to the attacks.1 The term “panic disorder” excludes panic attacks attributable to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition, substance or another mental disorder. Panic disorder is sometimes categorised as “with” or “without agoraphobia.”1 Alternative categorisations focus on phobic anxiety disorders and specify agoraphobia with or without panic disorder.2 Panic disorder often starts around 20 years of age (between late adolescence and the mid-30s).3 Lifetime prevalence is 1–3%, and panic disorder is more common in women than in men.4 An Australian community study found 1 month prevalence rates for panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) of 0.4% using International Classification of … [1]: /embed/graphic-1.gif",

      "abstract": "Secondary insomnia is less common than primary insomnia. Secondary causes of insomnia include:lULglLIg depression and anxietyl/LIglLIg conditions causing nocturnal pain or breathlessnessl/LIglLIg side-effects of medications and substance abusel/LIglLIg less common but usually obvious medical conditions, such as hyperthyroidisml/LIglLIg frank sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnoea and restless legs syndrome (RLS). The main symptom of insomnia is insufficient sleep to carry out the full range of daily functions. The patient who sleeps for only 5 hours a night, but is not sleepy during the day, is a 'short sleeper' and not an insomniac. Primary insomniacs have a good response to hypnotics, but feel out of control if they use them continuously. Two components are involved in maintaining the insomnia - a psychological anxiety and a physiological response to this anxiety, including raised muscle tone and respiratory rate. A behavioural regimen based on a cognitive-behavioural approach designed to improve sleep quality gradually over a period of 4 - 6 weeks is often helpful. A hypnotic can be prescribed for use every third night during this regimen - zolpidem and zopiclone are preferred. Referral to a sleep specialist may be necessary if this approach does not work.",

      "abstract": "Medication overuse headache is an important and challenging problem for clinicians and researchers. The new International Headache Society classification now gives specific limits for medication use based on the number of days of treatment per month. Medication overuse headache is increasingly recognized in children. Triptan overusers have a more migrainous phenotype than overusers of other medications, as well as a shorter period of induction and a milder and more ultimately successful medication withdrawal course. Treatment may involve weaning the overused medications or abrupt discontinuation using a transitional medication for 1 or 2 weeks. Detoxification may be performed in an inpatient or outpatient setting. Repetitive intravenous valproate, prochlorperazine, or lidocaine may be reasonable alternatives to the traditional treatment of metoclopramide and dihydroergotamine. Biofeedback‐assisted relaxation training improves outcomes after detoxification at 3 years. Even aggressive treatment is unsuccessful in a significant number of cases.",

      "abstract": "To the Editor: High-dose olanzapine has gained momentum as an effective pharmacotherapy in individuals diagnosed with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, yet there is little evidence regarding its safety.1–4 Olanzapine is also indicated for the treatment of bipolar disorder; however, few guidelines are available regarding dosing of olanzapine for individuals with treatment-resistant bipolar disorder. The following case report highlights the need for increased guidance in the management of treatment-resistant bipolar disorder.\r\n\r\nCase report. Mr A is a white man with a long history of psychiatric disorders, specifically bipolar I disorder (DSM-IV-TR criteria). He also has a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder and a history of alcohol dependence and cannabis use (DSM-IV-TR criteria); however, he is reported to have not used cannabis for over 2 years. Mr A complained of severe mood swings including daily anxiety and panic attacks several times weekly and paranoia. After failing treatment with several other mood stabilizers and antipsychotic medications and declining treatment with clozapine, olanzapine was prescribed by his primary care provider. Olanzapine was increased over the course of 4 weeks to 80 mg/d (40 mg oral twice a day) to control his symptoms. Mr A reported that the anxiety and panic attacks did not occur as frequently; however, he was now experiencing erectile dysfunction, which was believed to be due to high-dose olanzapine. Despite the erectile dysfunction, Mr A asked to maintain high-dose olanzapine, as he felt the benefits outweighed the risks. Over the following 2 weeks, his depressive symptoms fluctuated, and Mr A reported that he was still struggling with posttraumatic stress disorder but managing better with other symptoms.\r\n\r\nAt the time of his presentation to the inpatient psychiatry ward, 5 weeks after the prescription of high-dose olanzapine, Mr A reported increasing anxiety, depression, paranoid delusions, guilt, and suicidal ideation. He also described symptoms similar to hyperreligiosity. Mr A denied use of any illicit drugs or alcohol prior to arriving at the hospital. The olanzapine dose was reduced to 40 mg/d (20 mg oral twice a day). Following this reduction, he showed immediate improvement in symptoms and felt significantly better. Mr A was provided with education regarding the benefits and risks of high-dose olanzapine and reported that this was “new information,” and he had not been adequately told of the dangers. At discharge, Mr A was stable on 40 mg/d of olanzapine.\r\n\r\nAlthough some studies have indicated the benefits of high-dose olanzapine, the dose is typically in the range of 20–60 mg/d rather than 80-mg/d, as was prescribed to Mr A.1,2 Greater guidance is needed to clarify procedures involved in dose escalation of olanzapine and monitoring of side effects. Further clinical trials highlighting the benefits and risks of high-dose olanzapine with a foundation on understanding mechanisms of treatment resistance should be a priority.",

Physical examination and laboratory tests generally have limited added value.

We report eight patients with severe pain, three of whom suffered from new onset oncologic metastatic bone pain, others had previous pain syndromes and presented with exacerbation of pain. Pain was associated with hyperalgesia and allodynia phenomena in two patients and with phantom pain in a third one. Tolerance to opioids had developed, and high IV doses of morphine, meperidine or fentanyl, and patient-controlled intravenous and epidural analgesia were insufficient. Several patients became dependent on opioids and could not be weaned from assisted ventilation.Pain was controlled with decreasing adjunct doses of ketamine. Within 5-10 days of ketamine and opioid protocols, pain was controlled and after an additional 5-7 days, ketamine could be stopped and pain controlled on oral regimens compatible with outpatient care.Ketamine is an efficient adjuvant analgesic for intractable severe pain, caused by metastasis, trauma, chronic ischemia, or central neuropathic pain. It is effective even when mega doses of IV, epidural, or oral opioids prove ineffective and when signs of tolerance have developed.",

      "abstract": "Participation in endurance activities is popular and growing. Proper hydration is important for performance and to avoid medical complications. Overconsumption of fluids, in combination with inadequate secretion of the hormone arginine vasopressin can lead to exercise associated hyponatremia (EAH). These two factors are the main underlying mechanism for the development of EAH, leading to water retention and a dilutional hyponatremia. EAH is defined biochemically by serum \nsodium concentrations < 135 mol/L during or up to 24 hours after exercise. Athletes may be asymptomatic, or symptomatic, with mild cases presenting with non-specific symptoms and signs, such as nausea, vomiting or weight gain. Severe cases or cases of exercise associated hyponatremic encephalopathy (EAHE) may present with headaches, altered mental state, seizures or coma and represent a medical emergency. Treatment is warranted with intravenous hypertonic saline solution and can be lifesaving. Other risk factors include exercise duration over 4 hours, exercising in the heat or humid conditions, event inexperience, inadequate training, slow running pace, high or low body mass index (BMI) and free availability of fluids at races. Prevention can generally be achieved by adhering to appropriate hydration strategies, such as drinking to thirst. \nEducation of athletes, coaches and medical personnel about EAH is important and may help reducing the incidence of EAH and prevent further fatalities.",

[10][11][12][13][14][15] Legal problems are especially likely in persons with criminal records and high impulsivity. 13The risk of adverse outcomes decreases markedly with abstinence from opioids. 9,16",

      "title": "Refining cause of death attribution among opioid, opioid‐stimulant and stimulant acute toxicity deaths",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background and aims Deaths attributed to a combination of opioids and stimulants have risen dramatically in recent years, largely attributed to fentanyl, yet little is understood about which drug class is primarily responsible. Attributing death to acute substance toxicity is complex and lacks clear standards. We aimed to determine whether additional causes of death and other significant conditions among deaths attributed to fentanyl were similar regardless of stimulant involvement, and distinct from deaths involving stimulants without opioids. Design Cross‐sectional analysis using records from the California Electronic Death Registration System. Setting and cases Unintentional acute toxicity deaths involving fentanyl or stimulants (methamphetamine or cocaine) occurring in San Francisco, USA, during 2013–2023. Measurements We compared demographic characteristics and causes of death or other significant conditions (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, other medical cause, or no other additional cause) among five mutually exclusive groups of deaths: stimulants without opioids (stimulant‐only), fentanyl with stimulants (fentanyl‐stimulant), fentanyl without stimulants (fentanyl‐only), other opioids (e.g., heroin, oxycodone) with stimulants (“other opioid‐stimulant”), and other opioids without stimulants (“other opioids‐only”). We conducted separate unadjusted and adjusted multivariable logistic regression models for each outcome (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, other medical, or no additional cause). The primary analysis included results for the fentanyl groups. Findings Of 4475 deaths attributed to acute opioid and/or stimulant toxicity, 24% involved stimulants‐only, 45% fentanyl‐stimulants, and 12% fentanyl‐only; the remaining 20% involved other opioids. Stimulant‐only decedents were the oldest (mean age 54 years), followed by fentanyl‐stimulant (47 years) and fentanyl‐only (44 years; p &lt; 0.001 for all). The adjusted odds of having cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or other medical causes of death (adjusted odds ratios [aORs] from 0.03 to 0.52, with 95% confidence intervals [CIs] from 0.01 to 0.68) were lower and the odds of no additional cause of death (aORs from 2.53 to 3.31, with 95% CIs from 2.00 to 3.40) were higher for both groups of deaths involving fentanyl compared with deaths attributed to stimulants‐only. There were no statistically significant differences in causes of death when comparing fentanyl‐only with fentanyl‐stimulant deaths. Findings were similar for other opioid deaths. Conclusion In San Francisco, USA, causes of death and other significant condition characteristics among deaths attributed to fentanyl appear to be similar regardless of the involvement of stimulants, but are markedly different from deaths involving stimulants without opioids. When reporting on drug‐related mortality and developing interventions, deaths attributed to a combination of fentanyl and stimulants may be appropriately considered in the context of opioid overdose prevention, while deaths attributed to stimulants without opioids may require a response focused on preventing and treating underlying chronic medical conditions.",

      "title": "Experience with Drugs and Driving in Queensland, Australia",
      "abstract": "The effect of any one psychoactive drug on an individual is a function of its interaction with that individual; for this reason, the effect upon one person may not be the same as on another person. When two or more drugs are given at the same time, their effect may be one of antagonism, synergism or potentiation. The effects of a psychotropic drug (ataxia, incoordination, altered level of consciousness or awareness, disturbances of vision and increased reaction time) must surely impair the skills required for safe driving. Many prescribed drugs acting principally on the central nervous system are capable of impairing driving performance: analgesics, anti-depressants, anti-convulsants, sedatives, hypnotics, narcotics and tranquillizers. Other prescribed drugs: anti-histamines, hypotensive agents, hypoglycaemic substances may produce undesirable side effects which impair driving performance. In Queensland if breath analysis indicated a BAC too low to account for a driver's behaviour, a doctor is called to examine the driver, and samples of blood and urine are forwarded to a central laboratory. If the blood concentration of a drug equals or exceeds the accepted therapeutic level of the particular substance, the driver is considered to be under the influence of the drug. The most dangerous period is during the initial stage of taking a prescribed drug. Psychotropic drugs taken in prescribed dosage may initially produce drowsiness, ataxia, impaired judgement and increased reaction time. After a period of time, tolerance to the drug develops, with marked reduction in unwanted side effects. The most common drugs include morphine, pethidine, methadone, methaqualone, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates. The common purpose for such abuse is to get high -a stage of unreality characterized by euphoria and/or hallucinations, either visual or auditory or both. Intoxication by any of these drugs produces severe impairment of driving skills. An exaggerated pharmacological effect commonly occurs when alcohol is taken at the same time as another psychoactive drug. Benzodiazepines are the prescribed drug most commonly involved in instances of driving impairment, both alone and in combination with alcohol. Some drugs commonly associated with impaired driving performance are: mandrax, methadone and diazepam. The extent of the contribution of drivers impaired by drugs and drug-alcohol interaction to traffic accidents has not yet been defined. It will not be defined until all countries enact effective legislation to enable such drivers to be identified. The use of alcohol and psychotropic drugs in Australia has been increasing steadily over the past few years, and continues to increase. It is impossible to obtain accurate figures on the consumption of psychotropic drugs in Australia. (Shortened Author Abstract/TRRL)",

      "abstract": "<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> Post-stroke apathy is a disturbance of motivation evidenced by low initiative, difficulties in starting, sustaining or finishing any goal-directed activity, low self-activation or self-initiated behavior and emotional indifference. Apathy is a common behavioral disturbance in stroke survivors. We aimed to analyze the relationship between post-stroke apathy at 1 year after stroke and (1) apathy in acute phase; (2) demographic, pre-stroke predisposing conditions (previous mild cognitive impairment, alcohol abuse, mood/anxiety disorder) and clinical features (stroke type and location, neurological symptoms); (3) post-stroke depression and post-stroke cognitive impairment, and (4) post-stroke functional outcome, quality of life and the perception of health. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Consecutive stroke (infarct/intracerebral hemorrhage) patients without aphasia or consciousness disturbances were included in the acute phase of stroke and assessed at 1 year after stroke. We assessed apathy with the clinically rated version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale. We also assessed post-stroke depression (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and post-stroke cognitive impairment (attention, mental flexibility, verbal, motor and graphomotor initiative, and non-verbal and verbal abstract reasoning, and Mini-Mental State Examination), functional outcome (Barthel Index), quality of life and perception of health (EuroQol). Data were analyzed using bivariate associations (χ<sup>2</sup> and t test) and stepwise multivariate analysis. <b><i>Results:</i></b> We included 76 stroke patients [32.9% women, mean age 62.9 years (SD = 10.9) and a mean of 6.9 (SD = 4.3) years of education]. Apathy was present in 17 patients in the acute phase and in 18 (23.7%) patients at 1 year after stroke. At 1 year after stroke, 41% of the acute apathetic patients remained apathetic. Sixty-one percent of new cases of post-stroke apathy were detected. Post-stroke apathy was associated only with previous cognitive impairment, apathy in acute stroke, post-stroke cognitive impairment, verbal abstract reasoning and with worse Barthel Index scale scores. In the multivariate logistic regression model, verbal abstract reasoning (odds ratio, OR = 7.03) and apathy in acute stroke (OR = 3.8) were identified as independent factors for post-stroke apathy at 1 year. Apathetic patients did not report worse quality of life or health. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Apathy in acute stroke phase was a reliable indicator of post-stroke apathy. Apathy should be assessed in both phases. Verbal abstract reasoning impairment was also an independent factor for post-stroke apathy impairing patients' ability to reason about goal-directed activity. Even though apathetic patients had worse post-stroke functional outcome, they did not report losing quality of life or having worse health.",

      "title": "Lithium for Bipolar Disorder: A Re Emerging Treatment for Mood Instability: Low Dosage, Slow Titration Might Mitigate Side Effects",
      "abstract": "Lithiwn is among the most effective therapies for bipolar disorder (BD), and enthusiasm for this simple molecule is waxing. The history of lithium is fascinating, (1) and recent considerations include that this element, the third on the periodic table, has few, if any, industry champions. The recent renaissance is caused by a groundswell of appreciation for the clinical efficacy of lithium and an increasing number of providers who are willing to manage patients with lithium. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Target: Bipolar disorder The target illness for lithium is BD, a spectrum of mood disorders with characteristic features of unstable mood and affect. Shifts in mood include recurrent episodes of mania, which are pathologically energized states with misguided volition and behavior with intoxicating euphoria (or irritability).(2) Psychomotor activity is elevated and out of character; speech and body movements are revved up, with a diminished need for sleep. The social, personal, and vocational consequences often are disastrous. The most common mood state of BD is depression. Depressive episodes consist of pathologically compromised energy and volition with a slowing of bodily functions, most prominently cognition and concentration; a pervasive depressed or sad mood is common but not always present. Presence of mixed states, when features of depression and mania are present simultaneously, is one of the many challenges of treating BD; an elevated volitional or energized state may occur with a depressed, dysphoric mood. Evidence for lithium Efficacy studies of lithium have focused on managing mood disorders, treating mania and depression, and prevention or maintenance care. (3) Most were performed during the 1970s and 1980s, (3) but recent studies have been comparing lithium with other mood stabilizers (4-7) and searching for a genetic basis for lithium response.(8-10) Other researchers have examined the use of lithium to prevent suicide. (11) Some have suggested a neuroprotective effect of lithium, which may have profound implications for neuropsychiatry if valid. (12-14) Results of additional studies, which are at different stages of completion, will clarify lithium use, (15), (16) and characterize the genetic makeup of individuals who respond to lithium. (17) The primary evidence for lithium, however, is for maintenance treatment of BD and for preventing manic and depressive episodes. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Biochemistry and physiology of lithium. rhe biochemical and physiological effects pf lithium are complex, wide-ranging, ind likely to affect hundreds, if not thou-;ands, of genes and gene products. The mechanisms of action remain a focus of aca-lemic pursuit (for a review of hypotheses 7elated to these mechanisms see Goodwin and Jamison(2) and Can et al (18)) Lithium is involved in cell signaling pathways that involve complex molecular mechanisms of inter- and intracellular communication; (19) some neural receptors are down-regulatee (20) and others show inhibition (21) which is thought to be a mechanism of lithium. The hypothesized neuroprotective effect of lithium (22) may be mediated through an increased level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in brain tissue. (14) Recently, investigators using induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons have shown that patterns of calcium-related cell signaling in bipolar neurons are affected specifically by lithium in the culture media. (23) There likely are many mechanisms through which lithium's effects are mediated, including a series of dynamic pathways that vary over time and in reaction to the internal and external environments of the cell and person. The lithium renaissance In the past decade, there has been an increase in interest and use of lithium because clinicians recognize its efficacy and advantages and can monitor serum levels and gauge the patient's response and side effects24 against the lithium level. …",

      "abstract": "Chronic diseases often require long-lasting pharmacotherapy. Administration of some medicines on a daily routine may cause troublesome adverse effects thus discouraging the patient from further treatment. An abrupt withdrawal of formerly continuous pharmacotherapy not proceeded by the professional medical consultation may endanger the patient either due to the relapse of the disease or the onset of withdrawal symptoms that, despite some opinions, are not limited only to potentially addictive medications. These symptoms may be mistaken for a clinical manifestation of a yet another medical condition of the ill leading to a vicious cycle of repeated diagnostics – additional pharmacotherapy – discontinuation of treatment due to drug intolerance – novel symptoms – repeated diagnostics etc., especially in the elderly. Unfortunately, even some medical doctors tend to forget that administration of specific drugs should not be stopped suddenly because certain withdrawal symptoms are more harmful than mild drug-induced adverse reactions. On the other hand, this is the clinician’s individual decision whether to stop or to continue the treatment in the presence of drug intolerance reported by the patient as many “practical” guidelines either do not give any recommendations or the statements are too general to be helpful in every-day practice. Therefore, the authors review the data on the causative factors and clinical implications of a sudden drug withdrawal, including mainly stricte non-addictive medicines in use for diseases of high incidence in general population. Gastric acid blockers, benzodiazepines, some antidepressants and opioid analgetics have been described in the review.",

      "abstract": "Internet technologies have made rapid progress, bringing convenience to our daily life. On the other hand, Internet overuse (IOU) and Internet addiction (IA) have reportedly become serious health and social problems across the globe. Recently Internet gaming disorder criteria have been proposed in the section of Conditions for Further Study of DSM5. Many surveys have reported that many IOU & IA patients have contracted other mental disorders and exhibit some psychiatric and physical symptoms (e.g., weight loss, reduced ability to exercise, nutrition disorder). Attention Deficit Hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), sleeping disorders, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, and phobic anxiety disorder are extremely common comorbid mental disorders (CMD) with IUD & IA. Because CMD breaks the usual rhythm of the activities of daily living of IOU & IA patients (e.g., eating meals and sleeping), and prevents the affected patients from participating in social activities (e.g., going to schools or work, participating in sports or other hobbies), CMD causes exacerbation of all IOU & IA symptoms. It has been reported that effecting a cure of some aspects of CMD often leads to the relief of IOU & IA. The diagnosis and the treatment of CMD are therefore very important.",

Psychosis is known to increase the risk of other health conditions and may have serious adverse outcomes. This is a case report of a 26-year-old woman with no previous psychiatric history who presented with symptoms and signs suggestive of acute psychosis shortly after starting a postprocedural combination of antimicrobials. The patient's family decided to stop the antimicrobials as they observed an escalation of the psychotic symptoms with the ongoing use of antibiotics. The patient was subsequently brought to the emergency service (EMS) department, and she was admitted to the behavioral health unit. The treatment team managed to stabilize the patient with several interventions, including the administration of antianxiety and antipsychotic medications along with psychosocial intervention. The symptoms of psychosis resolved within 3-4 days, and she was discharged home. Even though transient psychotic episodes have been reported previously with antibiotics, this case emphasizes the increased need for vigilance and reporting in patients receiving antimicrobials.",

      "title": "Sedation with Antipsychotics: Manage, Don't Accept Adverse 'Calming' Effect",
      "abstract": "Sedation is a frequent side effect of antipsychotics, especially at relatively high doses. Antipsychotics' sedative effects can reduce agitation in acute psychosis and promote sleep in insomnia, but long-term sedation may: [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] * interfere with schizophrenia patients' efforts to go to work or school or engage in normal socialization * prevent improvement from psychosocial training, psychiatric rehabilitation, and other treatments. This article discusses how to manage acute psychosis without oversedation and ways to address persistent sedation and chronic insomnia with less-sedating antipsychotics or adjunctive medications. Neurobiology or psychopharmacology? Many patients experience only mild, transient somnolence at the beginning of antipsychotic treatment, and most develop some tolerance to the sedating effects with continued administration. Others may have persistent daytime sedation that interferes with normal functioning. Sedation is especially common in elderly patients receiving antipsychotics. Compared with younger patients, older patients receiving the same doses of the same medications become more heavily sedated for longer periods of time. The resulting sedation can impair arousal levels during the day and increase the risk of falls. Sedation can occur with first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), but it is seen more commonly and tends to be more severe with low-potency FGAs than with SGAs. Clinical challenges come with: * distinguishing between sedation and negative symptoms of schizophrenia such as avolition, amotivation, withdrawal, and anhedonia * determining whether an individual's cognitive impairment is related to the antipsychotic's sedative properties. Because the treatments are different, it is important to try to distinguish negative symptoms and/or cognitive impairment related to schizophrenia's neurobiology from sedation related to the antipsychotic. Ask patients if they nap during the day or just lie around, and if they want to do things but can't: * If they want to do things but feel too tired, this likely is sedation caused by the antipsychotic. Treatment might be a dose reduction. * If they are not interested in doing things, the likely cause is negative symptoms. Treatment might be a medication such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. * If they want to do things but cannot organize themselves to be able to do them, this likely is cognitive impairment. Treatment might be cognitive training or remediation. Efficacy and sedation Antipsychotics are thought to exert their effect by antagonism of postsynaptic dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT2A receptors and possibly other receptors in the brain. Four SGAs--risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and ziprasidone--act as dopamine D2 and 5HT2A antagonists. Aripiprazole is a dopamine D2 partial agonist, serotonin 5HT1A partial agonist, and serotonin 5HT2A antagonist. (1) Efficacy data comparing SGAs with each other and with FGAs vary, but all 5 of these SGAs have been shown to be effective antipsychotics. (2-4) They also generally cause less sedation than FGAs. Patients with acute exacerbation of psychosis often have insomnia and frequently report paranoia that something will happen to them while they sleep. When treating agitated patients, many clinicians consider calming effects and true antipsychotic effects to be one in the same, which is not correct. All available antipsychotics are, on average, equally effective in treating acute psychotic symptoms but vary considerably in the amount of sedation they produce. Studies of short-acting injectable SGAs, such as ziprasidone and aripiprazole, have shown that agitation and acute symptoms can be controlled without significant sedation. (5,6) Antipsychotic effects are not immediate and historically were thought to occur over several weeks. …",

Of note, two key changes in DSM-5 pertinent to older adults are elimination of minor depression from the appendix and elimination of the bereavement exclusion criterion for major depression. In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss. Depressive symptoms are likewise present in other DSM-5 disorders, such as adjustment disorder with depressed mood and mood disorder due to a general medical condition (see Table 5–1 ).

A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

Several experimental data may help explain the course of this challenging clinical condition. In escalating opioid doses rapidly, a risk of opioid‐induced hyperalgesia should be recognized, as higher doses of opioids may stimulate rather than inhibit the central nervous system by different mechanisms. Alternative procedures should be taken into consideration to break this cycle, should it occur.

      "title": "How Long to Wait for an Antidepressant to 'Work'",
      "abstract": "Prevailing wisdom says it takes 3 to 4 weeks for an antidepressant to show effect. Historically, patients who improve in the first 2 weeks have been labeled (1) Several recent studies, however, demonstrate a real, drug-based in many patients as early as the first week of treatment, depending on the medication (Table). (2-5) In practical terms, these studies raise the question of how long you should wait for an antidepressant to work. Early indications. Here are some tips for gauging antidepressant response, depending on what you see in the first 2 to 4 weeks: * Obtain a pretreatment score on the Beck Depression Inventory or other depression rating scale, and repeat the assessment at least once between days 7 and 10 of treatment. If there is little or no improvement, consider a modest dosage increase. * Don't assume that a patient who responds to an antidepressant during the first 2 weeks is experiencing a placebo effect. It may be a drug-mediated response. Some patients will retain and build on this early response, whereas others' may wane over subsequent weeks. * No to an antidepressant during weeks 1 through 4 does not bode well for most patients, (5,6) although the data do not support giving up on an antidepressant after 1 to 2 weeks of nonresponse. Responses will accumulate during weeks 3 to 5 of treatment. (7) * Patients who show little during the first 2 weeks of treatment but experience some improvement during weeks 3 and 4 may be late responders. However, if the patient shows no improvement by week 3 or 4, consider switching to a different antidepressant, perhaps one from a different chemical class. (8) * Different neurovegetative signs and symptoms of depression may improve at different rates, with some requiring >8 weeks of treatment. Insight, for example, may not improve until the second month of treatment. (9) * Individualize treatment. Many treatment-refractory depressed patients--who failed to respond to 1 or more adequate drug trials--may require longer and more intensive treatment (>3 months) before showing a robust response. (10) * Onset of response does not equal clinical recovery, nor is an improved Hamilton Depression Scale score a proxy for high quality of life. Patients may need [greater than or equal to]2 months for clinically significant improvement in interpersonal, social, and vocational function. (11) References 1.

Toxicity is characterized by slurred speech, impaired judgment, and unsteady gait; overdose results in stupor, coma, respiratory depression, vasomotor collapse, and even death. Withdrawal symptoms include agitation, restlessness, insomnia, anxiety, and seizures. Sedative use should be suspected in individuals with clinical signs of toxicity. Benzodiazepines and barbiturates can be detected in standard urine drug tests. Cognitive impairment and increased risk of accidental injury and falls are the most serious medical complications.

      "abstract": "The co-occurrence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and epilepsy is a complex neurological condition that presents significant challenges for both patients and clinicians. ASD is a group of complex developmental disorders characterized by the following: (1) Social communication difficulties: challenges in understanding and responding to social cues, initiating and maintaining conversations, and developing and maintaining relationships. (2) Repetitive behaviors: engaging in repetitive actions, such as hand-flapping, rocking, or lining up objects. (3) Restricted interests: focusing intensely on specific topics or activities, often to the exclusion of other interests. (4) Sensory sensitivities: over- or under-sensitivity to sensory input, such as sounds, touch, tastes, smells, or sights. These challenges can significantly impact individuals' daily lives and require specialized support and interventions. Early diagnosis and intervention can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with ASD and their families. Epilepsy is a chronic brain disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked (≥2) seizures that occur >24 h apart. Single seizures are not considered epileptic seizures. Epilepsy is often idiopathic, but various brain disorders, such as malformations, strokes, and tumors, can cause symptomatic epilepsy. While these two conditions were once considered distinct, growing evidence suggests a substantial overlap in their underlying neurobiology. The prevalence of epilepsy in individuals with ASD is significantly higher than in the general population. This review will explore the epidemiology of this comorbidity, delve into the potential mechanisms linking ASD and epilepsy, and discuss the implications for diagnosis, treatment, and management.",

      "title": "Bipolar Depression: <i>Best Practices for the Hospitalized Patient</i>",
      "abstract": "One of the most challenging clinical topics in psychiatry is the diagnosis and treatment of bipolar depression. The term mood stabilizer is frequently employed in the treatment of the hospitalized bipolar patient, although clinicians do not universally agree on a consensus definition of this term. Most clinicians would agree that a mood stabilizer refers to a medication that is effective for the acute treatment of manic, mixed, hypomanic, or depressive episodes. Many experts agree that such treatment should offer efficacy against mania, should not worsen depression, and preferably should treat depression as well. In addition, the acute effectiveness in stabilization should not be at the expense of inducing alternate mood symptoms or switching the patient into the alternate phase of illness. From a maintenance standpoint, a mood stabilizer should also prevent against future relapse or recurrence of manic, mixed, hypomanic, or depressive symptoms or episodes (Slide 1). In addition to use of mood stabilizers, there are other issues surrounding treatment of the hospitalized patient with bipolar depression, including the commonly comorbid issue of substance abuse. Hazardous drinking may more commonly occur in bipolar depression or depressive phase of illness, representing a more complex clinical picture. To facilitate understanding of this complex disorder and its appropriate treatment, this discussion centers around the case of a major depressive episode in a patient with a past history of of mania (ie, bipolar I depression or bipolar depression).",

      "abstract": "Drug-induced dystonia (DID) is a rarely diagnosed adverse reaction to a sufficiently large number of drugs. Acute DID (ADID) occurs soon after starting to take a drug or raising its dose, and switching from one antipsychotic medication to another, especially to its injectable dosage form. Tardive DID (TDID) develops a few months or years after starting drug intake or 3 months after stopping therapy. The diagnosis of TDID is based on the persistence of dystonic hyperkinesis for more than 1 month, the use of a dopamine receptor blocking agent, and the absence of other causes of its development. The risk factors for DID are male sex; young age (less than 30 years of age); a history of dystonic reactions; hypocalcemia, alcohol use while taking the drug. DID is most commonly related to therapy with antipsychotics, metoclopramide, antidepressants, and antiepileptic drugs. The short-term use of anticholinergic drugs (benzotropin, diphenhydramine) is effective in treating ADID. Anticholinergic drugs and atypical antipsychotics (clozapine, quetiapine), benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants (baclofen), and dopamine reuptake inhibitors (tetrabenazine) are used to treat TDID. To prevent DID, it is very important that a physician should be aware of that this unwanted adverse reaction may occur and that a drug with the lowest risk for DID should be chosen.",

Until recently, however, there were no licensing authority approved treatments for FMS. The alfa 2 delta modulator pregabalin has anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and antinociceptive properties which has prompted its investigation in FMS. In a series of short-term randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of 8-14 weeks duration, pregabalin proved effective in reducing the pain and accompanying symptoms of FMS and improved quality of life domains. A 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated the durability of its effects on pain and a variety of secondary measures such as fatigue and sleep disturbance. Overall, pregabalin was well tolerated with no new adverse events emerging that have not been reported with its use in other indications.",

Although most patients use the benzodiazepines appropriately, some patients experience benzodiazepine abuse, addiction, or physical dependence, each one of which is a distinct syndrome. Benzodiazepine dependence, which relates to the development of tolerance and an abstinence syndrome, can be produced by three disparate benzodiazepine use patterns. These distinct benzodiazepine use patterns can in turn create distinct withdrawal syndromes. High-dose benzodiazepine use between 1 and 6 months can produce an acute sedative-hypnotic withdrawal syndrome. In contrast, low-dose therapeutic range benzodiazepine use longer than 6 months can produce a prolonged, subacute low-dose benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Daily, high-dose benzodiazepine use for more than 6 months can cause a combination of an acute high-dose benzodiazepine withdrawal and a prolonged, subacute low-dose withdrawal syndrome. In addition, patients may experience syndrome reemergence.A literature search was conducted using the medical subject headings benzodiazepines, substance abuse, substance dependence, substance withdrawal syndrome, and benzodiazepines adverse effects. The years 1970 to the present were reviewed.Medical management for acute benzodiazepine withdrawal includes the graded reduction of the current benzodiazepine dosage, substitution of a long-acting benzodiazepine, and phenobarbital substitution. However, the medical management of benzodiazepine dependence does not constitute treatment of benzodiazepine addiction. Primary care physicians can accept complete, moderate, or limited medical responsibility regarding patients with substance use disorders. However, all physicians should provide diagnostic and referral services.",

This step is often necessary because caregivers cannot tolerate, among other stressors, their loved ones' sexual aberrations and irrational accusations (which can be caused by paranoid ideation). Other salient features of parkinsonian psychosis comprise vivid nightmares, which often herald its onset; hallucinations, which are principally visual and stereotypical in content; agitation; aggression; delirium; and confusion that exceeds the typical erosion in mentation. Hallucinosis and paranoid ideation may in turn precipitate weight loss; food may be deemed inedible because of imagined contaminants, for instance, either worm infestations or a delusional fear of poisoning by the caregiver. Parkinsonian psychosis exhibits an age predilection; correlates with the duration of disease and levodopa therapy; and may be associated with increases in the dosage of this agent or other drugs given, either as monotherapy or with levodopa. Levodopa or dopamine agonist toxicity can lead to psychosis because of dopaminergic hypersensitivity. Unfortunately, attempts to diminish this untoward effect (eg, reducing the levodopa dosage, introducing neuroleptics) may curb the psychosis but also erode control of parkinsonian features. To avert this \"dopamine dilemma,\" we have tested a selective serotonin antagonist (ondansetron), which essentially attenuated visual hallucinosis, improved delusional ideation and confusion, and was well tolerated. Other agents that can be tried for parkinsonian psychosis include the atypical neuroleptics olanzapine and clozapine.",

In the treatment of serially occurring seizures, diazepam gel administered rectally is effective in controlling seizures. For established status epilepticus, midazolam, lorazepam, phenytoin, valproate, and levetiracetam are effective agents in controlling seizures, but evidence base lacks the required degree of precision. There is a need to conduct more research on other drugs routinely used for this condition.",

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder defined by symptoms reflecting disturbances in cognitive, behavioral, and physiological functioning that develop in the wake of exposure to a psychologically traumatic event. According to the DSM‐IV‐TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), the diagnosis applies to individuals who develop a requisite number of symptoms after experiencing, witnessing, or being confronted with an event that involved perceived or threatened loss of life, serious injury, or loss of physical integrity and that evoked fear, helplessness, or horror (e.g., military combat, sexual or physical assault, serious accidents, and major disasters). DSM‐IV‐TR organizes the symptoms of PTSD under three clusters: (1) reexperiencing (e.g., intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, and psychophysiological reactivity to reminders of the trauma), (2) avoidance and emotional numbing (e.g., avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma and inability to experience a full range of emotions), and (3) hyperarousal (e.g., hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and sleep disruption). By definition, these symptoms must persist for more than 1 month after the trauma and produce clinically significant distress and/or impairment.",

Psychological factors are decisive, and they usually include a major anxiety generated by intrapsychic conflicts, which are converted by unconscious defense mechanism into symptoms. The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness. The secondary gain is external and includes attention and care from caregivers or others.",

Treatment was well tolerated and the side effects, consisting mainly of nausea or symptoms related with the nervous system, such as anxiety, depression, confusion or drowsiness, were mild or moderate in most cases and rarely led to the patient's giving up the treatment. The drug has a favourable pharmacokinetic profile, with little potential to interact with other pharmaceuticals. It seems to have a synergic effect with modafinil, boosting its effects in the treatment of excessive sleepiness. Although it is a substance that has been used as a recreational drug, no cases of addiction or drug abuse have been observed in narcoleptic patients treated in a controlled manner.Sodium oxybate can be considered to be a first-choice drug in the treatment of narcolepsy-cataplexy.",

      "title": "Psychological aspects of depression in cancer patients: an update",
      "abstract": "Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention.Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J. Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2004; 32: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar]. Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others.Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others.Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable.Ideally, all cancer patients be screened for depression in the clinic upon their first visit and on a regular basis thereafter by their oncologist, especially when changes occur in their disease status (remission, recurrence, progression of disease etc.). The distress thermometer is a valid and reliable screening tool. Patients are asked about the nature and source of their distress (whether it be physical, social, psychological or spiritual). In addition to detecting distress, the thermometer facilitates referral to the appropriate professional working in the oncology team (mental health, social work, pastoral counselor, etc.) [2.Holland J. Bultz B. The NCCN guideline for distress management: a case for making distress the sixth vital sign.J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2007; 5: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar].Diagnosis of depression in physically healthy individuals relies heavily on the presence of somatic symptoms (anorexia, insomnia and weight loss). However, these are of little value in cancer patients since they are common to both cancer and depression. Four different approaches have been described in the assessment of depression in the medically ill [3.Cohen-Cole Sa Brown F.N. McDaniel J.S. Stoudmire A. Fogel B. Diagnostic assessment of depression in the medically ill.Psychiatric Care of the Medical Patient. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 53-70Google Scholar, 4.Endicott J. Measurement of depression in patients with cancer.Cancer. 1984; 53: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar]:•Inclusive approach: counts all symptoms of depression, whether or not they may be secondary to the physical illness. This approach offers high sensitivity but low specificity and does not focus on etiology.•Etiologic approach: This approach counts a depressive symptom only if it is presumed not secondary to physical illness.•Exclusive approach: Eliminates symptoms such as anorexia and fatigue, which can be secondary to cancer, and employs other depression criteria. This approach increases specificity and lowers sensitivity which may result in lower prevalence and underdiagnosis.•Substitutive approach: Replaces indeterminate symptoms such as fatigue (frequently secondary to physical illness) with cognitive symptoms such as indecisiveness, brooding and hopelessness.Criteria for the diagnosis of a major depressive disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [5.american Psychiatric association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.4th edition, text revision. american Psychiatric association, arlington, Va2000Google Scholar] include:Five or more of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning, with at least one of the symptoms being either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure:1.Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report or observations by others2.Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities, most of the day, nearly every day3.Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day4.Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day5.Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day6.Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day7.Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day8.Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day, and9.Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.In addition, the symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode; they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning; they are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance; they are not better accounted for by bereavement; they persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms or psychomotor retardation.The diagnosis of depression in the oncology setting should depend on psychological not somatic symptoms, in cancer patients [6.Massie M.J. Holland J. Holland J. Rowland J. Overview of normal reactions and prevalence of psychiatric disorders.Handbook of Psycho-Oncology: Psychological Care of the Patient with Cancer. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 273-282Google Scholar]:•Dysphoric mood•Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness•Loss of self-esteem•Feelings of worthlessness or guilt•anhedonia•Thoughts of death or wishing for death or suicideDifferential diagnosis should include normal reactions to illness and loss; adjustment disorders with depressed and/or anxious mood, and should determine whether organic factors underlie the depressive syndrome. When physiologic effects of cancer directly cause depressive syndromes, a diagnosis of mood disorder due to a general medical condition should be made.Demoralization syndrome, described by Kissane et al. [7.Kissane D.W. Clarke D.M. Street Af Demoralization syndrome: a relevant psychiatric diagnosis for palliative care.J Palliat Care. 2001; 17: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar], should be distinguished from depression and includes affective symptoms of existential distress (hopelessness or loss of meaning in life); pessimism, helplessness, a sense of being trapped, personal failure or lacking a worthwhile future; absence of motivation to cope differently, and associated features of social alienation or isolation and lack of support. Demoralization syndrome is said to occur in at least 20% of patients who do not meet DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder [8.Grassi L. Holland J. Johansen C. Psychiatric concomitants of cancer screening procedures, and training of health care professionals in oncology: the paradigms of psycho-oncology in the psychiatry field.adv Psychiatr. 2005; 2: 59-66Google Scholar].Boredom in people with cancer has received little attention despite clinical observation, suggesting that it has the potential to affect patient's quality of life significantly. Passik et al. [9.Passik S. Inman A. Kirsch K. Initial validation of a scale to measure purposelessness, understimulation and boredom in cancer patients.Palliat Support Care. 2003; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar] developed a Purposelessness, Understimulation and Boredom Scale to identify boredom and found this construct to be different from depression in the oncology setting.Multiple psychological measurement instruments have been described as useful in the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients. However, a single-item question: 'Have you been depressed, most of the day, nearly every day, for the past two weeks or more?' seems to be able to identify all cancer patients diagnosed as depressed using Research Diagnostic Criteria [10.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. are you depressed?' Screening for depression in the terminally ill.aM J Psychiatry. 1997; 154: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar].Suicide is associated with emotional suffering and, at times, with physical disease. Suicide has been reported to be 1.5–2 times higher in cancer patients than in the general population [11.Hem E. Loge J.H. Haldorsen T. et al.Suicide risk in cancer patients from 1960 to 1999.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. among terminally ill patients with cancer, the request for euthanasia is about four times higher in patients with depression than in those without depression [12.Van der Lee M.L. van der Bom J.G. et al.Euthanasia and depression: a prospective cohort study among terminally ill cancer patients.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar]. In addition, desire for death in terminally ill cancer patients is frequent. It has been shown to be associated with depression and is transitory [13.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. et al.Desire for death in the terminally ill.am J Psychiatry. 1995; 152: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar]. Suicide risk protocols should include an evaluation of thoughts about death, dying and suicide, as well as an evaluation of the presence of a plan to commit suicide, the patient's intention to carry out such plan and its viability.an association between depression and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) has been described. Cancer itself and its treatment (medications and surgery) in general can be responsible, together with the individual stress response, for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar].Depression and depressive symptoms should always be treated in the cancer setting. Because sadness and depressive symptoms are considered to be 'normal' reactions to the disease and its treatment, quite frequently they remain undertreated. They tend to be a manifestation or consequence of emotional suffering. Not treating them will trivialize the patient's suffering associated with the disease and death.adequate treatment of depression in the oncology setting should combine the control or elimination of potential organic causes of depression when possible; pharmacotherapy; psychotherapy and psychological intervention with the patients' families and staff members. Efficient communication skills between doctor and patient are needed as well.The choice of the best psychotropic drug for the pharmacological treatment of depression in cancer will depend on various factors [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar]:•Which is the safest drug or which has the fewest side-effects for the cancer patient•What the characteristics of the depressive episode are, and•Which is the best way of administration for a particular patient (pills versus liquid versus parenteral).General guidelines for the use of antidepressants in the cancer setting have been described [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar] and include:•Starting the dose according to patients' condition (usually half dose for a few days, then titrate)•Waiting for the effects of the drugs (latency: usually 4 weeks)•Providing continued treatment for 6–9 months (more if depression or depressive episode are recurrent)•Discontinuing antidepressant treatment gradually by tapering the dose and providing adequate follow-up•Monitoring symptoms on a continued basis to watch for potential drug interactions that may occur between antidepressants and certain chemotherapeutic agentsPsychotherapy may be an excellent alternative for those who refuse taking antidepressants. In addition, it has no side effects! as with antidepressants, it is necessary to adjust the psychotherapeutic modality to patient's needs and disease stage. Psycho-educational interventions such as clarifying information, among others, are effective usually throughout the disease continuum, although may be more needed at diagnosis, when passing from one stage of the illness to another, for example, initiation and end of treatment; upon starting palliative care, etc. Couple and Family Therapies may be appropriate when conflicting relationships within the couple or the family contribute substantially or are the main cause of the patients' depressive symptoms. Cognitive techniques may be useful in correcting misconceptions and exacerbated fears. Interventions directed to enhance the spiritual aspects in advanced disease and dying are of utmost importance at this stage of the illness, when patients are confronted with life-death issues that generally imply deep existential questioning [15.Breitbart W. Spirituality and meaning in supportive care: spirituality and meaning-centered group psychotherapy interventions in advanced cancer.Support Care Cancer. 2002; 10: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar]. Helping patients discover the meaning they assign to their symptoms, to their disease, to life and death, to suffering, etc., and helping them accept suffering as an integral part of life, is of utmost importance. Finding meaning in the context of advanced or serious illness is quite a challenge that not everyone is capable of achieving. In addition, interventions designed to maintain patients' dignity have been described as well and are very helpful in improving patients' mood [16.Chochinov H.M. Hack T. Hassard T. et al.Dignity therapy: a novel psychotherapeutic intervention for patients near the end of life.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 5520-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar]. Multidimensional structured and semi-structured group psychotherapies have proven to be effective in reducing patients' depressive symptomatology and improving their quality of life [17.Spiegel D. Spira J. Supportive Expressive Group Therapy: a Treatment Manual of Psychosocial Intervention for Woman with Recurrent Breast Cancer..

Staff should be trained to provide basic emotional support effectively as well as to communicate efficiently with the patient and his/her family. Some simple interventions staff may easily implement are related to increasing the patient's perception of control. Cancer influences the patient in such a way that it substantially reduces the perception of control that the patient has over his own life. In order to help patients regain their sense of control staff members may:•provide options to patient. For example, giving him the possibility of choosing whether he wants to have his medication with water, milk or juice helps the patient believe he still has the power to decide over what is happening to him, especially at times when the patient is hospitalized and his hospital days revolve around medication intake, doctor and nurses' visits, medical tests, etc.•anticipate patients' needs. This will help him feel more in control of what may happen to him and will reduce fear and distress upon the development of new symptoms or changes in the patient's body, functions, etc.•facilitate adaptive coping mechanisms, for example, by identifying with the patient effective ways in which he/she has confronted and resolved difficulties encountered in the past•respect defense mechanisms as long as they do not interfere with treatment administration•normalize patient's feelings•help maintain realistic hope: Even in the context of palliative care can hope be maintained. For example, a non-depressed dying patient may hope to die without suffering, or after having solved certain issues, or he may hope that his family will not suffer in excess after his death.•remain available to listen to patient's worries and fears•explain to patient and family that depressive symptoms can be treated•provide continuity in patient care•monitor patient's sense of wellbeing and needs in a continued manner along the disease continuum, since they change over time•work with the family: provide basic caretaking guidelines and support for family members. Facilitate their understanding of what depression is and why the patient may be depressed. It may be difficult for family members to comprehend, for example, why the patient develops depressive symptomatology upon finishing his treatment.•explore one's own attitudes towards illness, suffering, death and dying•inform adequately: staff members should have efficient training in communication skills as to be able to handle difficult interactions with patients at complex moments of the disease process. adequate doctor–patient communication will:•reduce patient's fears and anxiety,•help patient understand and elaborate relevant medical information,•increase patient's perception of control,•allow the patient to discuss relevant worries that may interfere with treatment administration, with the oncologist,•enhance treatment adherence,•facilitate patient's global psychological adjustment.A six-step protocol to deliver bad news and improve doctor–patient communication (SPIKES) has been described [20.Baile W.F. Buckman R. Lenzi R. et al.SIKES—a six-step protocol for delivering bad news: application to the patient with cancer.Oncologist. 2000; 5: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar] and includes the following:•S Setting: prepare an adequate environment. This may be achieved by providing privacy, involving significant others, establishing rapport with patient, etc.•P Perception: ask yourself 'How does the patient perceive his medical situation?'. and, 'Before you tell, ask' (for example, 'What do you suspect your symptoms are due to?').•I Invitation: obtain patient's invitation to deliver medical information. 'How would you like me to give you your test results?' could be a good way to start.•K Knowledge: deliver the medical information: 'I am sorry to tell you that your test results have revealed …'.•E Empathizing and Exploring: assess the patients emotions using empathetic responses, for example 'I understand this must be very difficult for you at this time of your life'.•S Strategy and Summary: Describe strategy/follow-up and summarize the interview making sure that the patient has understood the information provided.This educational workshop will focus on the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders in cancer patients. Diagnostic criteria for depression and for suicide risk as well as psychotherapeutic guidelines to treat depression effectively will be provided. Theoretical aspects of the different topics covered will be illustrated with case vignettes and brief video sketches.In summary, depression is frequent in the cancer setting and should receive adequate attention from professionals. as with other illnesses, its correct although sometimes difficult diagnosis in oncology will allow the design of interventions tailored to address patient needs, intensity of symptoms and others. Treatment of depression should not be targeted to the patient only but should include family and oncology staff members as well.disclosureThe author has declared no conflicts of interest. Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention. Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J. Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2004; 32: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar]. Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others. Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others. Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable.

However, these are of little value in cancer patients since they are common to both cancer and depression.

Measurement of depression in patients with cancer.Cancer. 1984; 53: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar]:•Inclusive approach: counts all symptoms of depression, whether or not they may be secondary to the physical illness. This approach offers high sensitivity but low specificity and does not focus on etiology.•Etiologic approach: This approach counts a depressive symptom only if it is presumed not secondary to physical illness.•Exclusive approach: Eliminates symptoms such as anorexia and fatigue, which can be secondary to cancer, and employs other depression criteria. This approach increases specificity and lowers sensitivity which may result in lower prevalence and underdiagnosis.•Substitutive approach: Replaces indeterminate symptoms such as fatigue (frequently secondary to physical illness) with cognitive symptoms such as indecisiveness, brooding and hopelessness. Criteria for the diagnosis of a major depressive disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [5.american Psychiatric association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.4th edition, text revision. american Psychiatric association, arlington, Va2000Google Scholar] include:Five or more of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning, with at least one of the symptoms being either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure:1.Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report or observations by others2.Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities, most of the day, nearly every day3.Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day4.Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day5.Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day6.Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day7.Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day8.Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day, and9.Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. In addition, the symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode; they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning; they are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance; they are not better accounted for by bereavement; they persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms or psychomotor retardation. The diagnosis of depression in the oncology setting should depend on psychological not somatic symptoms, in cancer patients [6.Massie M.J. Holland J. Holland J. Rowland J. Overview of normal reactions and prevalence of psychiatric disorders.Handbook of Psycho-Oncology: Psychological Care of the Patient with Cancer. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 273-282Google Scholar]:•Dysphoric mood•Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness•Loss of self-esteem•Feelings of worthlessness or guilt•anhedonia•Thoughts of death or wishing for death or suicide Differential diagnosis should include normal reactions to illness and loss; adjustment disorders with depressed and/or anxious mood, and should determine whether organic factors underlie the depressive syndrome. When physiologic effects of cancer directly cause depressive syndromes, a diagnosis of mood disorder due to a general medical condition should be made. Demoralization syndrome, described by Kissane et al. [7.Kissane D.W. Clarke D.M. Street Af Demoralization syndrome: a relevant psychiatric diagnosis for palliative care.J Palliat Care. 2001; 17: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar], should be distinguished from depression and includes affective symptoms of existential distress (hopelessness or loss of meaning in life); pessimism, helplessness, a sense of being trapped, personal failure or lacking a worthwhile future; absence of motivation to cope differently, and associated features of social alienation or isolation and lack of support. Demoralization syndrome is said to occur in at least 20% of patients who do not meet DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder [8.Grassi L. Holland J. Johansen C. Psychiatric concomitants of cancer screening procedures, and training of health care professionals in oncology: the paradigms of psycho-oncology in the psychiatry field.adv Psychiatr. 2005; 2: 59-66Google Scholar]. Boredom in people with cancer has received little attention despite clinical observation, suggesting that it has the potential to affect patient's quality of life significantly. Passik et al. [9.Passik S. Inman A. Kirsch K. Initial validation of a scale to measure purposelessness, understimulation and boredom in cancer patients.Palliat Support Care. 2003; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar] developed a Purposelessness, Understimulation and Boredom Scale to identify boredom and found this construct to be different from depression in the oncology setting. Multiple psychological measurement instruments have been described as useful in the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients. However, a single-item question: 'Have you been depressed, most of the day, nearly every day, for the past two weeks or more?' seems to be able to identify all cancer patients diagnosed as depressed using Research Diagnostic Criteria [10.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. are you depressed?' Screening for depression in the terminally ill.aM J Psychiatry. 1997; 154: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar]. Suicide is associated with emotional suffering and, at times, with physical disease. Suicide has been reported to be 1.5–2 times higher in cancer patients than in the general population [11.Hem E. Loge J.H. Haldorsen T. et al.Suicide risk in cancer patients from 1960 to 1999.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. among terminally ill patients with cancer, the request for euthanasia is about four times higher in patients with depression than in those without depression [12.Van der Lee M.L. van der Bom J.G. et al.Euthanasia and depression: a prospective cohort study among terminally ill cancer patients.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar]. In addition, desire for death in terminally ill cancer patients is frequent. It has been shown to be associated with depression and is transitory [13.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. et al.Desire for death in the terminally ill.am J Psychiatry. 1995; 152: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar]. Suicide risk protocols should include an evaluation of thoughts about death, dying and suicide, as well as an evaluation of the presence of a plan to commit suicide, the patient's intention to carry out such plan and its viability. an association between depression and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) has been described. Cancer itself and its treatment (medications and surgery) in general can be responsible, together with the individual stress response, for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar]. Depression and depressive symptoms should always be treated in the cancer setting. Because sadness and depressive symptoms are considered to be 'normal' reactions to the disease and its treatment, quite frequently they remain undertreated. They tend to be a manifestation or consequence of emotional suffering. Not treating them will trivialize the patient's suffering associated with the disease and death. adequate treatment of depression in the oncology setting should combine the control or elimination of potential organic causes of depression when possible; pharmacotherapy; psychotherapy and psychological intervention with the patients' families and staff members. Efficient communication skills between doctor and patient are needed as well. The choice of the best psychotropic drug for the pharmacological treatment of depression in cancer will depend on various factors [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar]:•Which is the safest drug or which has the fewest side-effects for the cancer patient•What the characteristics of the depressive episode are, and•Which is the best way of administration for a particular patient (pills versus liquid versus parenteral). General guidelines for the use of antidepressants in the cancer setting have been described [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar] and include:•Starting the dose according to patients' condition (usually half dose for a few days, then titrate)•Waiting for the effects of the drugs (latency: usually 4 weeks)•Providing continued treatment for 6–9 months (more if depression or depressive episode are recurrent)•Discontinuing antidepressant treatment gradually by tapering the dose and providing adequate follow-up•Monitoring symptoms on a continued basis to watch for potential drug interactions that may occur between antidepressants and certain chemotherapeutic agents Psychotherapy may be an excellent alternative for those who refuse taking antidepressants. In addition, it has no side effects! as with antidepressants, it is necessary to adjust the psychotherapeutic modality to patient's needs and disease stage. Psycho-educational interventions such as clarifying information, among others, are effective usually throughout the disease continuum, although may be more needed at diagnosis, when passing from one stage of the illness to another, for example, initiation and end of treatment; upon starting palliative care, etc. Couple and Family Therapies may be appropriate when conflicting relationships within the couple or the family contribute substantially or are the main cause of the patients' depressive symptoms. Cognitive techniques may be useful in correcting misconceptions and exacerbated fears. Interventions directed to enhance the spiritual aspects in advanced disease and dying are of utmost importance at this stage of the illness, when patients are confronted with life-death issues that generally imply deep existential questioning [15.Breitbart W. Spirituality and meaning in supportive care: spirituality and meaning-centered group psychotherapy interventions in advanced cancer.Support Care Cancer. 2002; 10: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar]. Helping patients discover the meaning they assign to their symptoms, to their disease, to life and death, to suffering, etc., and helping them accept suffering as an integral part of life, is of utmost importance. Finding meaning in the context of advanced or serious illness is quite a challenge that not everyone is capable of achieving. In addition, interventions designed to maintain patients' dignity have been described as well and are very helpful in improving patients' mood [16.Chochinov H.M. Hack T. Hassard T. et al.Dignity therapy: a novel psychotherapeutic intervention for patients near the end of life.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 5520-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar]. Multidimensional structured and semi-structured group psychotherapies have proven to be effective in reducing patients' depressive symptomatology and improving their quality of life [17.Spiegel D. Spira J. Supportive Expressive Group Therapy: a Treatment Manual of Psychosocial Intervention for Woman with Recurrent Breast Cancer.. Psychosocial Treatment Laboratory, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo alto, Ca1991Google Scholar, 18.Kissane D.W. Love A. Hatton A. et al.The effect of cognitive-existential group psychotherapy on survival in early stage breast cancer.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4255-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 19.Fawzy F.I. Fawzy N. Hyun C.S. et al.Malignant melanoma: effects of an early structured psychiatric intervention, coping and affective state on recurrence and survival 6 years later.arch General Psychiatr. 1993; 50: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar]. Staff play an important role in the improvement of depressive symptoms in the cancer patient. Staff should be trained to provide basic emotional support effectively as well as to communicate efficiently with the patient and his/her family. Some simple interventions staff may easily implement are related to increasing the patient's perception of control. Cancer influences the patient in such a way that it substantially reduces the perception of control that the patient has over his own life. In order to help patients regain their sense of control staff members may:•provide options to patient. For example, giving him the possibility of choosing whether he wants to have his medication with water, milk or juice helps the patient believe he still has the power to decide over what is happening to him, especially at times when the patient is hospitalized and his hospital days revolve around medication intake, doctor and nurses' visits, medical tests, etc.•anticipate patients' needs. This will help him feel more in control of what may happen to him and will reduce fear and distress upon the development of new symptoms or changes in the patient's body, functions, etc.•facilitate adaptive coping mechanisms, for example, by identifying with the patient effective ways in which he/she has confronted and resolved difficulties encountered in the past•respect defense mechanisms as long as they do not interfere with treatment administration•normalize patient's feelings•help maintain realistic hope: Even in the context of palliative care can hope be maintained. For example, a non-depressed dying patient may hope to die without suffering, or after having solved certain issues, or he may hope that his family will not suffer in excess after his death.•remain available to listen to patient's worries and fears•explain to patient and family that depressive symptoms can be treated•provide continuity in patient care•monitor patient's sense of wellbeing and needs in a continued manner along the disease continuum, since they change over time•work with the family: provide basic caretaking guidelines and support for family members. Facilitate their understanding of what depression is and why the patient may be depressed. It may be difficult for family members to comprehend, for example, why the patient develops depressive symptomatology upon finishing his treatment.•explore one's own attitudes towards illness, suffering, death and dying•inform adequately: staff members should have efficient training in communication skills as to be able to handle difficult interactions with patients at complex moments of the disease process. adequate doctor–patient communication will:•reduce patient's fears and anxiety,•help patient understand and elaborate relevant medical information,•increase patient's perception of control,•allow the patient to discuss relevant worries that may interfere with treatment administration, with the oncologist,•enhance treatment adherence,•facilitate patient's global psychological adjustment. A six-step protocol to deliver bad news and improve doctor–patient communication (SPIKES) has been described [20.Baile W.F. Buckman R. Lenzi R. et al.SIKES—a six-step protocol for delivering bad news: application to the patient with cancer.Oncologist. 2000; 5: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar] and includes the following:•S Setting: prepare an adequate environment. This may be achieved by providing privacy, involving significant others, establishing rapport with patient, etc.•P Perception: ask yourself 'How does the patient perceive his medical situation?'. and, 'Before you tell, ask' (for example, 'What do you suspect your symptoms are due to?').•I Invitation: obtain patient's invitation to deliver medical information. 'How would you like me to give you your test results?' could be a good way to start.•K Knowledge: deliver the medical information: 'I am sorry to tell you that your test results have revealed …'.•E Empathizing and Exploring: assess the patients emotions using empathetic responses, for example 'I understand this must be very difficult for you at this time of your life'.•S Strategy and Summary: Describe strategy/follow-up and summarize the interview making sure that the patient has understood the information provided. This educational workshop will focus on the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders in cancer patients. Diagnostic criteria for depression and for suicide risk as well as psychotherapeutic guidelines to treat depression effectively will be provided. Theoretical aspects of the different topics covered will be illustrated with case vignettes and brief video sketches. In summary, depression is frequent in the cancer setting and should receive adequate attention from professionals. as with other illnesses, its correct although sometimes difficult diagnosis in oncology will allow the design of interventions tailored to address patient needs, intensity of symptoms and others. Treatment of depression should not be targeted to the patient only but should include family and oncology staff members as well. disclosureThe author has declared no conflicts of interest.

It is usual to associate a benzodiazepin with an opioid, more often Midazolam and Morphine or Fentanyl; other drugs as Propofol, Clonidine and Ketamine have specific indications, brief painful procedures and weaning from long periods of sedation to avoid withdrawal. Sometimes it can be useful to add a neuromuscular blocking agent to help mechanical ventilation. Adverse sedation events are relatively frequent, associated with drug overdoses and drug interactions, particularly when 3 or more drugs are used: all class of medications and all routes of administration are involved.",

Sleep apnea syndromes are classified as obstructive, central or mixed: obstructive when the respiratory muscles continue to contract but airflow is not obtained, central when respiratory effort is not present, and mixed when elements of both obstructive and central apnea are present. Approximately 4 percent of adult men and 2 percent of adult women are believed to have these conditions. In addition to having symptoms such as snoring, headaches, depression, decreased libido and fatigue, patients with sleep apnea are at risk for a range of severe complications secondary to recurrent hypoxia and hypercapnia during sleep. Diagnosis may require an overnight polysomnogram in addition to the history, a physical examination and a laboratory assessment. Less cumbersome diagnostic modalities are being developed. Treatment options include weight reduction, change in sleeping position, avoidance of sedatives, use of continuous positive airway pressure and surgical treatment.",

      "abstract": "Patients suffering from frequent migraine attacks or chronic tension-type headache are at risk of developing drug-induced headache (now called 'medication overuse headache' [MOH]) as described by the new classification of the International Headache Society. This headache entity is caused by frequent use of antiheadache compounds (non-opioid analgesics, ergot alkaloids, 5-HT agonists, combined preparations with caffeine or codeine) for more than 15 days/month. Most patients, however, use the medication daily. The standard therapy of MOH is withdrawal therapy (mostly under in-patient conditions) followed by prophylactic treatment of the primary headache. The relapse rate reaches up to 40% within 1 year after a previously successful withdrawal therapy. The pathophysiology of MOH remains to be determined and, consequently, therapy has been driven by experience rather than by scientific hypotheses. The identification of predictors for both medication overuse and relapse after successful withdrawal should improve prevention and therapy in the future. Several medical (e.g., class of overused drugs) and psychological (e.g., standard of performance) predictors were recently identified. Medication overuse in headache patients is based on multiple factors with physical, social and psychological impact. In view of the high prevalence and relapse rate, it is necessary to establish a structured post-treatment programme for patients after the acute withdrawal phase, which considers the predictors for relapse.",

CDH is a disease that causes significant impact on patients, employers and the health system.The treatment of CDH is based on the implementation of three therapies. The first is to establish a pharmacological treatment, with medication such as antidepressants, antiepileptic agents, muscle relaxants, and antihypertensive and antiserotoninergic drugs, either in mono or in polytherapy. The second measure is to stop the analgesic overuse. This is achieved by suddenly withdrawing the drugs or, in a combined manner, by stopping the analgesic intake and establishing bridge therapy (steroids or triptans), which, in addition to reducing the severity and frequency of seizures and the consumption of drugs, also help to lower the occurrence and duration of withdrawal symptoms. Hospital treatment is needed in cases of patients who are refractory to multiple therapies, with frequent visits to the emergency department, in presence of associated symptoms or comorbidities, and low tolerance to medication. The third measure is to implement non-pharmacological therapies, which are used to modify inappropriate behaviour as regards pain treatment, to promote proper medication consumption and to allow the patient comprehend the prognosis of the disease with and without treatment.Implementing these three therapies makes possible to reduce the severity, frequency and socioeconomic impact caused by headache and thereby improve patients' quality of life and capabilities.",

      "title": "Non‐ulcer dyspepsia: myths and realities",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Dyspepsia can be defined as the presence of upper abdominal pain or discomfort; other symptoms referable to the proximal gastrointestinal tract, such as nausea, early satiety, and bloating, may also be present. Symptoms may or may not be meal related. To be termed chronic, dyspepsia should have been present for three months or longer. Over half the patients who present with chronic dyspepsia have no evidence of peptic ulceration, other focal lesions, or systemic disease and are diagnosed as having non‐ulcer (or functional) dyspepsia. Non‐ulcer dyspepsia is a heterogeneous syndrome. It has been proposed that this entity can be subdivided into a number of symptomatic clusters or groupings that suggest possible underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. These groupings include ulcer‐like dyspepsia (typical symptoms of peptic ulcer are present), dysmotility (stasis)‐like dyspepsia (symptoms include nausea, early satiety, bloating, and belching that suggest gastric stasis or small intestinal dysmotility), and reflux‐like dyspepsia (heartburn or acid regurgitation accompanies upper abdominal pain or discomfort). The aetiology of non‐ulcer dyspepsia is not established, although it is likely a multifactorial disorder. Motility abnormalities may be important in a subset of dyspepsia patients but probably do not explain the symptoms in the majority. Epidemiological studies have not convincingly demonstrated an association between Helicobacter pylori and non‐ulcer dyspepsia. Other potential aetiological mechanisms, such as increased gastric acid secretion, psychological factors, life‐event stress, and dietary factors, have not been established as causes of non‐ulcer dyspepsia. Management of non‐ulcer dyspepsia is difficult because its pathogenesis is poorly understood and is confounded because of a high placebo response rate. Until more data are available, it seems reasonable that treatment regimens target the clinical groupings described above. Antacids are no more effective than placebo in non‐ulcer dyspepsia, although a subgroup of non‐ulcer dyspepsia patients with reflux‐like or ulcer‐like symptoms may respond to H 2 ‐receptor antagonists. However, there is no significant benefit of these agents over placebo in many cases. Bismuth has been shown to be superior to placebo in patients with H. pylori in a number of studies, but these trials had several shortcomings and others have reported conflicting findings. Sucralfate was demonstrated in one study to be superior to placebo, but this finding was not confirmed by another group of investigators. Prokinetic drugs appear to be efficacious, and may be most useful in patients with dysmotility‐like and reflux‐like dyspepsia.",

      "title": "A survey of peripheral nerve stimulator (PNS) use",
      "abstract": "EDITOR: Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants retain a vital place in anaesthetic practice. The number of available muscle relaxants has increased in recent years. All of these drugs vary in speed of onset, duration of action and in speed of offset. The manufacturers produce guidance for the use of these drugs in the form of data sheets. These may give recommendations for initial dose, speed of onset and duration of action. Clinical practice is however, likely to vary considerably with the manufacturer's guidance for the following reasons: 1. Variable individual response to muscle relaxants. Marked variation has been shown between healthy individuals for the same dose of muscle relaxant [1] 2. Renal function. Impaired renal function may prolong the duration of action. 3. Liver disease or reduced hepatic blood flow. These may prolong the duration of action. 4. Electrolyte disturbances. These may prolong the duration of action. 5. Other drugs. Aminoglycosides prolong the duration of action, other drugs may also affect the duration of action. 6. Obesity. Dose requirements are affected with variation between the different muscle relaxants. Knowledge about the state of neuromuscular blockade is important from induction through to recovery. Inadequate neuromuscular blockade during the procedure may make surgery difficult, and has the potential to be extremely dangerous to the patient. At the end of the procedure there is the potential for an awake patient with residual paralysis or for recurarization during the recovery period. Residual neuromuscular blockade may increase the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications [2]. The peripheral nerve stimulator is not the perfect monitor; it measures neuromuscular function in the periphery, which is more sensitive to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants than is diaphragmatic muscle [3]. It may give an inaccurate test due to poor electrical contact or incorrect placement. At present, it is the most common monitor of neuromuscular function. This is due to its simplicity, ease of use, portability and cost. We have undertaken a survey to establish current practice in respect of PNS usage at five hospitals. We aimed to assess use and availability of the PNS. We also wanted to identify the factors which influence PNS usage, such as duration of anaesthesia and the muscle relaxant used. A questionnaire was sent to all grades of anaesthetist at five hospitals. Three teaching hospitals and two district general hospitals. The questionnaire asked a number of questions about PNS usage. One hundred questionnaires were returned with a response rate of 57%, of these, replies were from consultants (48%), from training grades (48%) and from other grades (4%). Question 1: Is there a place for using a peripheral nerve stimulator while using a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant in your practice? Yes 89% No 11% Question 2: If a PNS is available in the theatre, how often do you use it? Never 8% Sometimes 74% Always 17% Question 3: Will you use a peripheral nerve stimulator if the duration of operation is less than 20 min, 20-40 min, 40-60 min and over 60 min? (Table 1)Table 1: Use of PNS with duration of operation Question 4: How often is a peripheral nerve stimulator available? (Table 2)Table 2: Availability of PNS in theatre (%) Question 5: How often do you use a peripheral nerve stimulator with different muscle relaxants? (Table 3)Table 3: Use of PNS with particular relaxants as percentage The response rate of 57% was disappointing but did show some marked differences. The large majority of anaesthetists (89%) in our survey have a need for a peripheral nerve stimulator in their practice. Most use it for selected cases, with a small group using it for all cases in whom a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant is used (17%). This survey found that a factor affecting usage was the duration of anaesthesia with the number of anaesthetists always using a PNS rising from 11% for operations of 20-40 min duration to 21% always using a PNS for operations of 40-60 min. This may reflect the fact that an induction dose of muscle relaxant will often last between 20 and 40 min, but repeat doses are likely if the duration exceeds 40 min. There appeared to be a relation between the choice of muscle relaxant and the duration of drug action, with the least use for the short-acting mivacurium and most use for the long-acting pancuronium. It was interesting to find no increase in PNS use for the newer agents. This may reflect their predictability, although there are reports of recurarization with rocuronium [4]. It is of concern that in some hospitals there are insufficient nerve stimulators. The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland recommends that a means of assessing neuromuscular block should be available whenever neuromuscular blocking drugs are used [5]. In the case of one teaching hospital, 40% of respondents reported that peripheral nerve stimulators were 'rarely available' or 'never available'. While their use is not mandatory they should be readily available in every theatre complex. The results of this survey were presented to this hospital and have resulted in the provision of four extra peripheral nerve stimulators for the theatre complex. The use of the PNS helps with anaesthetic training and with the introduction of new or modified muscle relaxants but above all it may improve anaesthetic standards by preventing over- or under-curarization.

      "title": "A survey of peripheral nerve stimulator (PNS) use",
      "abstract": "EDITOR: Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants retain a vital place in anaesthetic practice. The number of available muscle relaxants has increased in recent years. All of these drugs vary in speed of onset, duration of action and in speed of offset. The manufacturers produce guidance for the use of these drugs in the form of data sheets. These may give recommendations for initial dose, speed of onset and duration of action. Clinical practice is however, likely to vary considerably with the manufacturer's guidance for the following reasons: 1. Variable individual response to muscle relaxants. Marked variation has been shown between healthy individuals for the same dose of muscle relaxant [1] 2. Renal function. Impaired renal function may prolong the duration of action. 3. Liver disease or reduced hepatic blood flow. These may prolong the duration of action. 4. Electrolyte disturbances. These may prolong the duration of action. 5. Other drugs. Aminoglycosides prolong the duration of action, other drugs may also affect the duration of action. 6. Obesity. Dose requirements are affected with variation between the different muscle relaxants. Knowledge about the state of neuromuscular blockade is important from induction through to recovery. Inadequate neuromuscular blockade during the procedure may make surgery difficult, and has the potential to be extremely dangerous to the patient. At the end of the procedure there is the potential for an awake patient with residual paralysis or for recurarization during the recovery period. Residual neuromuscular blockade may increase the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications [2]. The peripheral nerve stimulator is not the perfect monitor; it measures neuromuscular function in the periphery, which is more sensitive to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants than is diaphragmatic muscle [3]. It may give an inaccurate test due to poor electrical contact or incorrect placement. At present, it is the most common monitor of neuromuscular function. This is due to its simplicity, ease of use, portability and cost. We have undertaken a survey to establish current practice in respect of PNS usage at five hospitals. We aimed to assess use and availability of the PNS. We also wanted to identify the factors which influence PNS usage, such as duration of anaesthesia and the muscle relaxant used. A questionnaire was sent to all grades of anaesthetist at five hospitals. Three teaching hospitals and two district general hospitals. The questionnaire asked a number of questions about PNS usage. One hundred questionnaires were returned with a response rate of 57%, of these, replies were from consultants (48%), from training grades (48%) and from other grades (4%). Question 1: Is there a place for using a peripheral nerve stimulator while using a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant in your practice? Yes 89% No 11% Question 2: If a PNS is available in the theatre, how often do you use it? Never 8% Sometimes 74% Always 17% Question 3: Will you use a peripheral nerve stimulator if the duration of operation is less than 20 min, 20-40 min, 40-60 min and over 60 min? (Table 1)Table 1: Use of PNS with duration of operation Question 4: How often is a peripheral nerve stimulator available? (Table 2)Table 2: Availability of PNS in theatre (%) Question 5: How often do you use a peripheral nerve stimulator with different muscle relaxants? (Table 3)Table 3: Use of PNS with particular relaxants as percentage The response rate of 57% was disappointing but did show some marked differences. The large majority of anaesthetists (89%) in our survey have a need for a peripheral nerve stimulator in their practice. Most use it for selected cases, with a small group using it for all cases in whom a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant is used (17%). This survey found that a factor affecting usage was the duration of anaesthesia with the number of anaesthetists always using a PNS rising from 11% for operations of 20-40 min duration to 21% always using a PNS for operations of 40-60 min.

      "abstract": "The following are key factors to consider in assessing a patient for long-term neuroleptics: 1. Who--accurate diagnosis of schizophrenia is of primary concern. There are no good prognostic indicators other than a history of repeated relapses and positive responses to neuroleptics. 2. When and for how long--should always be considered for the patient who has had more than two acute episodes. The first year post-acute episode back in the community is extremely critical. Consider maintaining patient on tapering dosage of medication for at least four to five years. 3. What benefits--symptoms of acute psychosis respond, those of chronic defect state do not. Medication also can act as buffer against stress. 4. Dosages--standard range is the equivalent of 300-800 mg. of Thorazine for most patients. Dose range for depot administration of Prolixin decanoate is 25-62.5 mg. 2-4 week intervals. Differences within this range may not be important. Data about very low doses (one-tenth standard dose) and megadoses (4-5 times standard dose) are inconsistent. 5. Risks--extrapyramidal symptoms, tardive dyskinesia, and akinetic depression are the most prevalent risks. Extrapyramidal symptoms can often be controlled effectively with dosage reduction. However, anticholinergic drugs are the treatment of choice during acute phases, and for the first 3-5 months post-acute phase. Tardive dyskinesia rarely occurs after a few weeks or months, but occurs most commonly beginning after two years of drug treatment. The usual form is persistent, but transient forms also occur. The earliest signs are reversible in some patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

This symptom may be broadly subdivided into primary (so-called 'idiopathic' or 'functional') constipation and secondary constipation; the latter is associated with endocrine, metabolic and neurological disorders (e.g., hyperparathyroidism, diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease), luminal obstruction (e.g., colon neoplasms) and use of drugs (e.g., anticholinergics and opioids) [1]. Here, we will focus on some known etiologic factors underlying primary constipation. The definition of constipation varies greatly according to the descriptor (layman, patient, physician, researcher), and several definitions are available in the literature; definitions not always overlapping. However, the two main aspects on which there is ample agreement is that constipation is characterized by a reduction (up to absence) of bowel movements and/or frequent (conventionally defined as at least a quarter of the occasions) difficult expulsion of stools (straining at stools) [1]. It is worth noting that these two aspects also broadly define the two main subtypes of chronic constipation, represented by slow-transit constipation (STC) and obstructed defecation (OD) [1].",

      "title": "SP0073 Opioid prescribing: what’s the problem?",
      "abstract": "<h3></h3> Opioids have been used for at least 7,000 years in the treatment of acute pain, to aid sleep and to promote euphoria. Their short-term benefits are well-recognised, but longer-term benefits are less well understood and associated harms well-known. For pain lasting beyond the acute period, the prescribed use of strong opioids was, until recently, mainly restricted to cancer and palliative care, when life expectancy is limited. More recently, however, we have seen rapidly increasing use of both strong and weak opioids for chronic non-malignant pain. This has particularly been in North America where an “opioid epidemic” is apparent, but similar patterns are emerging across the world, including Europe. The commonest problems with long-term use of opioids include constipation, nausea and sedation. Other, perhaps more serious problems include hyperalgesia, endocrine and immune dysfunction, mood disorders, tolerance, addiction and death. Our systematic review estimated an incidence of iatrogenic misuse or addiction of ~4% among all people prescribed an opioid. The other problem is with the lack of high quality evidence to support their effectiveness in the long-term relief of pain, as we will hear later. These concerns have prompted the International Association for the Study of Pain to issue a recent carefully-worded statement on the use of opioids in chronic pain, advising caution and close monitoring. This presentation will summarise these issues, and present evidence of the increasing use of opioids in recent years, focusing on Europe and particularly Scotland, where prescribing rates rose 65% in a 10 year period. I will present evidence of both good and potentially harmful prescribing, evidence that most prescribing is “appropriate” in that it is associated with severe chronic pain, and, despite this, that a very large proportion of people with chronic pain are not prescribed any opioid. Opioids may still have a role in chronic non-malignant pain, but the goals of their use need to be increased function and improved quality of life, and we need careful selection of patients and evaluation of outcomes. <h3>Disclosure of Interest</h3> B.

The use of a single daily dosage depends on the drug having a relatively long (over 36 hours) half-life in the body and being tolerated in a single large dose. Many tricyclic anti-depressives fulfil these requirements provided that the single dose is given before the patient goes to bed. Unwanted effects such as dry mouth and blurred vision, which are troublesome during the day, are not a problem during sleep. The sedative actions of many of these drugs can help the insomniac depressed patient who might otherwise need a separate hypnotic.",

      "abstract": "Summary Interruption of ongoing treatment with benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antipsychotics and mood stabilisers including lithium can be followed by clinically significant withdrawal reactions within hours or days, as well as later increases in relapses or recurrences of the illness being treated. Such observations support the view that stopping treatment is not equivalent to being untreated. With lithium, antipsychotics and antidepressants, there is consistent evidence that abrupt or rapid discontinuation is followed by earlier clinical worsening than with more gradual removal of treatment. Moreover, treatment discontinuation can complicate interpretation of responses to changes in treatment, including in clinical practice and in experimental treatment trials. Notably, terminating preceding treatments can lead to both discontinuation and carry-over effects that can have an impact on the interpretation of observed outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Addiction is a disease that alters the behaving and thinking of the brain of a person. When a person starts using drugs, it starts getting addicted to them and gradually it can’t help but act on the impulse to use them regardless of the damage caused to the body of addicted person. Drug isn’t about just illegal drugs. A person can get addicted to alcohol, painkillers, nicotine and other legal substances. Drug addiction is a deathly disease found in almost every year of age. The disease is mostly carried by people who are mentally frustrated, physically or mentally abused, facing financial problem or family problems and is desperate to get some sort of relief that comes with the high of drugs even if it proves to be grim for their health in the long run. Addiction starts with the continuous use of dosage of any drug, until the point that an individual starts feeling anxious without the availability of them. Slowly and painfully, these drugs starts making a person totally relied on them and it is basically impossible for the individual to survive without them. There can be many reasons as to why an individual decides to go on this path of addiction. Economic problems, state of utter sadness in case of the death of a loved one or a closed one, societal stress, isolation, aggression, bad or wrong company, in state of depression and anxiety are the most likely situations in which a person starts taking drugs. Along with many other factors, families often play a vital role in pushing an individual towards seeking comfort and relief from the drugs. Developing countries like Pakistan and many others are facing the problem as there are not many effective and active rehabilitation centers. In this research article, the role of families contributing in an individual’s drug addiction is elaborated. This research article is done with the help of many researches, as well as some interviews were conducted regarding certain factors and the answers were given according to the observation and views of responders. The conclusion is drawn with the help of articles and personal opinions and observations regarding how a person leans toward substance or drug usage because of certain family issues and problems.",

      "abstract": "Opioid use disorder is the chronic use of opioids that causes clinically significant distress or impairment. Opioid use disorders affect over 16 million people worldwide, over 2.1 million in the United States, and there are over 120,000 deaths worldwide annually attributed to opioids. There are as many patients using opioids regularly as there are patients diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder, psoriatic arthritis, and epilepsy in the United States. Opioid use disorder diagnosis is based on the American Psychiatric Association DSM-5 and includes a desire to obtain and take opioids despite social and professional consequences. Examples of opioids include heroin, morphine, codeine, fentanyl, and synthetic opioids such as oxycodone. Opioid use disorder consists of an overpowering desire to use opioids, increased opioid tolerance, and withdrawal syndrome when discontinued. Opioid use disorder includes dependence and addiction with addiction representing the most severe form of the disorder. The disease is treated with opioid replacement therapy using buprenorphine or methadone, which reduces the risk of morbidity and mortality. Naltrexone may be useful to prevent relapse. Naloxone is used to treat opioid overdose. Nonpharmacologic behavioral therapy is also beneficial. Patients with opioid use disorder often benefit from twelve-step programs, peer support, and mental health professionals, individual and group therapy. The significant prevalence of opioid use disorder stresses the importance of clinicians to understand more about opioids and be able to refer patients to available treatment centers for substance use disorders, as well as be weaned from prescription opioids due to their addictive potential and significant side effect profile. The opioid-use disorder typically involves periods of exacerbation and remission, but the vulnerability to relapse never disappears. The pattern is similar to other chronic relapsing conditions; signs and symptoms can be severe, and long-term adherence to treatment is often intermittent. Patients with opioid problems may have extended periods of abstinence and usually do well. However, there is a chronic risk of accidental overdose, trauma, suicide, and infectious diseases. The risk decreases with abstinence from opioids.",

      "title": "Is the Preoperative Use of Antidepressants and Benzodiazepines Associated with Opioid and Other Analgesic Use After Hip and Knee Arthroplasty?",
      "abstract": "Mental health disorders can occur in patients with pain conditions, and there have been reports of an increased risk of persistent pain after THA and TKA among patients who have psychological distress. Persistent pain may result in the prolonged consumption of opioids and other analgesics, which may expose patients to adverse drug events and narcotic habituation or addiction. However, the degree to which preoperative use of antidepressants or benzodiazepines is associated with prolonged analgesic use after surgery is not well quantified.(1) Is the preoperative use of antidepressants or benzodiazepine medications associated with a greater postoperative use of opioids, NSAIDs, or acetaminophen? (2) Is the proportion of patients still using opioid analgesics 1 year after arthroplasty higher among patients who were taking antidepressants or benzodiazepine medications before surgery, after controlling for relevant confounding variables? (3) Does analgesic drug use decrease after surgery in patients with a history of antidepressant or benzodiazepine use? (4) Does the proportion of patients using antidepressants or benzodiazepines change after joint arthroplasty compared with before?Of the 10,138 patients who underwent hip arthroplasty and the 9930 patients who underwent knee arthroplasty at Coxa Hospital for Joint Replacement, Tampere, Finland, between 2002 and 2013, those who had primary joint arthroplasty for primary osteoarthritis (64% [6502 of 10,138] of patients with hip surgery and 82% [8099 of 9930] who had knee surgery) were considered potentially eligible. After exclusion of another 8% (845 of 10,138) and 13% (1308 of 9930) of patients because they had revision or another joint arthroplasty within 2 years of the index surgery, 56% (5657 of 10,138) of patients with hip arthroplasty and 68% (6791 of 9930) of patients with knee arthroplasty were included in this retrospective registry study. Patients who filled prescriptions for antidepressants or benzodiazepines were identified from a nationwide drug prescription register, and information on the filled prescriptions for opioids (mild and strong), NSAIDs, and acetaminophen were extracted from the same database. For the analyses, subgroups were created according to the status of benzodiazepine and antidepressant use during the 6 months before surgery. First, the proportions of patients who used opioids and any analgesics (that is, opioids, NSAIDs, or acetaminophen) were calculated. Then, multivariable logistic regression adjusted with age, gender, joint, Charlson Comorbidity Index, BMI, laterality (unilateral/same-day bilateral), and preoperative analgesic use was performed to calculate odds ratios for any analgesic use and opioid use 1 year postoperatively. Additionally, the proportion of patients who used antidepressants and benzodiazepines was calculated for 2 years before and 2 years after surgery.At 1 year postoperatively, patients with a history of antidepressant or benzodiazepine use were more likely to fill prescriptions for any analgesics than were patients without a history of antidepressant or benzodiazepine use (adjusted odds ratios 1.9 [95% confidence interval 1.6 to 2.2]; p < 0.001 and 1.8 [95% CI 1.6 to 2.0]; p < 0.001, respectively). Similarly, patients with a history of antidepressant or benzodiazepine use were more likely to fill prescriptions for opioids than patients without a history of antidepressant or benzodiazepine use (adjusted ORs 2.1 [95% CI 1.7 to 2.7]; p < 0.001 and 2.0 [95% CI 1.6 to 2.4]; p < 0.001, respectively). Nevertheless, the proportion of patients who filled any analgesic prescription was smaller 1 year after surgery than preoperatively in patients with a history of antidepressant (42% [439 of 1038] versus 55% [568 of 1038]; p < 0.001) and/or benzodiazepine use (40% [801 of 2008] versus 55% [1098 of 2008]; p < 0.001). The proportion of patients who used antidepressants and/or benzodiazepines was essentially stable during the observation period.Surgeons should be aware of the increased risk of prolonged opioid and other analgesic use after surgery among patients who were on preoperative antidepressant and/or benzodiazepine therapy, and they should have candid discussions with patients referred for elective joint arthroplasty about this possibility. Further studies are needed to identify the most effective methods to reduce prolonged postoperative opioid use among these patients.Level III, therapeutic study.",

      "title": "Opioids",
      "abstract": "Abstract Opioids have been used for millennia for analgesic and pleasurable effects. Over 7 million Americans have an opioid use disorder (OUD). Illicitly manufactured fentanyl and analogues are the most common opioids implicated in overdose deaths. Acute effects include analgesia, respiratory depression, miosis, and euphoria. Overdose is a serious complication of opioid use, characterized by depressed level of consciousness and respiratory depression. It can be treated with naloxone. Withdrawal symptoms include dysphoria, yawning, tearing, diarrhea, cramps, nausea, and piloerection. Opioids can be detected with urine drug tests; however, some synthetic opioids (such as fentanyl, methadone, and buprenorphine) are not detected by tests for opiates (opioids derived from poppy such as heroin and morphine). Constipation is the most common complication. Long-term complications from chronic use may include central sleep apnea, hypogonadism, adrenal insufficiency, and lower bone mineral density. Many of the medical complications associated with illicit opioid use are due to use of needles. Buprenorphine, methadone, clonidine, lofexidine, or other opioids can be used to ameliorate the symptoms of withdrawal, but supervised withdrawal alone is not an effective treatment for OUD. Pharmacotherapy with an opioid agonist (methadone or buprenorphine) is the most effective treatment. Long-acting injectable naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, is also effective but is harder to initiate. There are a number of psychosocial treatments, including self-help groups, outpatient therapy, and residential treatment; data on their effectiveness are limited.",

      "title": "Akathisia: Is Restlessness a Primary Condition or an Adverse Drug Effect? Keep a Discerning Eye out for This Adverse Effect of Antipsychotics and Other Drugs",
      "abstract": "Akathisia--from the Greek for inability to sit--is a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by subjective and objective psychomotor restlessness. Patients typically experience feelings of unease, inner restlessness mainly involving the legs, and a compulsion to move. Most engage in repetitive movement. They might swing or cross and uncross their legs, shift from one foot to the other, continuously pace, or persistently fidget. In clinical settings, akathisia usually is a side effect of medication. Antipsychotics, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and buspirone are common triggers, but akathisia also has been associated with some antiemetics, preoperative sedatives, calcium channel blockers, and antivertigo agents. It also can be caused by withdrawal from an antipsychotic or related to a substance use disorder, especially cocaine. Akathisia can be acute or chronic, occurring in a tardive form with symptoms that last >6 months. (1,3) Much isn't known about drug-induced akathisia Our understanding of the pathophysiology of akathisia is incomplete. Some have suggested that it results from an imbalance between the dopaminergic/cholinergic and dopaminergic/ serotonergic systems (4); others, that the cause is a mismatch between the core and the shell of the nucleus accumbens, due in part to overstimulation of the locus ceruleus. (5) More recently, researchers established a positive association between higher scores on the Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side Effects Rating Scale and D2/D3 receptor occupancy in the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle). (6) The D2/D3 receptor occupancy model might explain withdrawal symptoms associated with cocaine/ as well as relative worsening of symptoms after tapering or discontinuing stimulants in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Elements of a clinical evaluation When akathisia is suspected, evaluation by a clinician familiar with its phenomenology is crucial. A validated tool, such as the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (at out cometracker.org/library/BAS.pdf) can aid in the detection and assessment of severity. (8) In evaluating patients, keep in mind that the inner restlessness that characterizes akathisia can affect the trunk, hands, and arms, as well as the legs, and can cause dysphoria and anxiety. Akathisia has been linked to an increased likelihood of developing suicidal ideation and behavior. (9) Less common subjective symptoms include rage, fear, nausea, and worsening of psychotic symptoms. Because of its association with aggression and agitation, drug-induced akathisia has been cited--with little success--as the basis for an insanity defense by people who have committed a violent act. (10) Or is akathisia another psychiatric disorder? Akathisia might go undetected for several reasons. One key factor: Its symptoms resemble and often overlap with those of other psychiatric disorders, such as mania, psychosis, agitated depression, and ADHD. In addition, akathisia often occurs concurrently with, and is masked by, akinesia, a common extrapyramidal side effect of many antipsychotics. Such patients might have the inner feeling of restlessness and urge to move but do not exhibit characteristic limb movements. In some cases, cognitive or intellectual limitations prevent patients from communicating the inner turmoil they feel. (11) Medication nonadherence further complicates the picture, sometimes prompting a clinician to increase the dosage of the drug that is causing akathisia (Box 1 (12)). Box 1 Think twice before increasing the dosage Patients who develop symptoms of akathisia sometimes stop taking their medication; this often results in psychiatric relapse. (12) In addition, symptoms of akathisia often mimic psychiatric symptoms and can be mistaken for worsening anxiety or psychosis; in such cases, a practitioner might increase the dosage of the agent that is causing akathisia, potentially leading to further deterioration of the clinical picture. …",

It is characterized by signs of hyperexcitability of the central nervous system (irritability, hyperactivity, hypertonia, tremor, acute crying, skin lesions scratching, convulsions), vegetative (sweating, yawning, mucous hypersecretion, hyperthermia, fleeting rashes), digestive (regurgitation and vomiting, voracious appetite or rejection of food, diarrhea difficult to treat) and respiratory (sneezing, nasal congestion, tachypnea with or without distress). Its treatment consists of support measures and pharmacological treatment.",

They are generally associated to multiple conditions that are frequent in elderly age, such as pain, somatic disease or cognitive deterioration and to psychosocial factors (loneliness, impoverishment, discapacity or mourning). Depression in the elderly has an important impact on the quality of life and general health in this age and noticeably casts a shadow over the functional prognosis or survival related with the concomitant medical diseases. It also contributes, in a large degree, to the stress of the caregiver. In the daily clinical practice, depression in the elderly is underdetected and undertreated in spite of the effectiveness of the treatments available. In the antidepressive drug treatment in the elderly, it is important to achieve its effectiveness without jeopardizing safety. The experience in the use of bupropion as an antidepressant in elderly patients is presented.",

First, adolescence is regarded as a risk factor for the development of dependence, whereas the involvement of gender difference (female) in this respect is controversial. Secondly, many smokers feel difficulties in quitting smoking in spite of the weak potential of nicotine, which is known as the nicotine paradox. Several working hypotheses have been presented to explain this phenomenon. For example, has relatively strong conditioning effects and/or liability compared with other drugs of abuse.

      "title": "Adjuncts to opioid therapy.",
      "abstract": "Administration of opioids to alleviate moderate to severe acute pain and chronic cancer pain is an established management process. However, advancements in clinical pharmacologic research have shown that opioids are also effective in chronic noncancerous pain. Many patients properly treated for prolonged periods with opioids develop tolerance and subsequently, physical dependence. This process is not necessarily harmful to the patient and will not cause the patient to develop an addiction (properly defined as psychologic dependence). For many patients who have been on opioid therapy for months or years, analgesic effectiveness tragically becomes less. In addition, opioid-induced constipation can be severe and cause pain; patients do not develop tolerance to this adverse reaction. Therefore, such issues become a management problem and require additional intervention. Currently, many different classes of drugs can serve as effective adjuncts to opioids for treatment of pain. Adding adjunctive medication to opioid therapy improves pain management primarily by nonopioid mechanisms of action. Clinical outcomes of such combinations include greater analgesia and attenuation of opioid-induced adverse reactions such as nausea and vomiting, constipation, sedation, and respiratory depression. Adjuncts include acetaminophen, antiarrhythmics, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antipsychotics, baclofen, benzodiazepines, capsaicin, calcium channel blockers, clonidine hydrochloride, central nervous system stimulants, corticosteroids, local anesthetics, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, pentoxifylline, and scopolamine. Some adjuncts (eg, acetaminophen) are routinely used today, whereas others (eg, nifedipine [calcium channel blocker]) are used on a limited basis but have great potential for more widespread application. All professionals (eg, nurses, pharmacists, physicians, physicians' assistants, social workers, members of the clergy) involved in treating patients with unresolved pain recognize this to be an extraordinary and delicate time. It is when patients are likely to request physicians to provide some method to accelerate their death. Thus, inadequate analgesia can become a suicidogen, ie, any factor that causes a patient to want to commit suicide. Incorporation of adjuncts to opioid therapy can serve to lessen pain and improve quality of life for a suffering patient.",

      "abstract": "Neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia (TD) that persists for 1 year or more following withdrawal of neuroleptics is usually said to be permanent. Early spontaneous remissions have been well described but most such remissions occurred within the first few months following neuroleptic withdrawal, and no published studies have followed patients for more than 2 years to evaluate permanence of remission. Over the last 12 years, we studied six patients with TD who, on prolonged follow-up, were found to have complete remission of their abnormal movements after a neuroleptic-free period of more than 2 years (2-5 years). All six patients were 61 years old or younger when their TD was diagnosed and their neuroleptics withdrawn. In five of the patients, remission occurred while the patients were not taking medication for the movements, while one patient had been on long-term, high-dose (2 mg/day) reserpine therapy for more than 3 years. The incidence of late remission of TD is not known and cannot be estimated from these selected patients, but these cases demonstrate that persistence of abnormal movements of TD for 2 or more years following neuroleptic withdrawal does not imply permanence in all patients. We suggest that TD be considered a persistent rather than an invariably permanent disorder.",

      "title": "Is Paradoxical Pain Induced by Sustained Opioid Exposure an Underlying Mechanism of Opioid Antinociceptive Tolerance?",
      "abstract": "Opiates are the primary treatment for pain management in cancer patients reporting moderate to severe pain, and are being increasingly used for non-cancer chronic pain. However, prolonged administration of opiates is associated with significant problems including the development of antinociceptive tolerance, wherein higher doses of the drug are required over time to elicit the same amount of analgesia. High doses of opiates result in serious side effects such as constipation, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, somnolence, and impairment of mental alertness. In addition, sustained exposure to morphine has been shown to result in paradoxical pain in regions unaffected by the initial pain complaint, and which may also result in dose escalation, i.e. 'analgesic tolerance'. A concept that has been gaining considerable experimental validation is that prolonged use of opioids elicits paradoxical, abnormal pain. This enhanced pain state requires additional opioids to maintain a constant level of antinociception, and consequently may be interpreted as antinociceptive tolerance. Many substances have been shown to block or reverse antinociceptive tolerance. A non-inclusive list of examples of substances reported to block or reverse opioid antinociceptive tolerance include: substance P receptor (NK-1) antagonists, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists, nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, protein kinase C inhibitors, competitive and non-competitive antagonists of the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor, AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4 isoxazolepropionic acid) antagonists, anti-dynorphin antiserum, and cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonists. Without exception, these substances are also antagonists of pain-enhancing agents. Prolonged opiate administration indeed induces upregulation of substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) within sensory fibers in vivo, and this is accompanied by an enhanced release of excitatory neurotransmitters and neuropeptides from primary afferent fibers upon stimulation. The enhanced evoked release of neuropeptides is correlated with the onset of abnormal pain states and opioid antinociceptive tolerance. Importantly, the descending pain modulatory pathway from the brainstem rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) via the dorsolateral funiculus (DLF) is critical for maintaining the changes observed in the spinal cord, abnormal pain states and antinociceptive tolerance, because animals with lesion of the DLF did not show enhanced evoked neuropeptide release, or develop abnormal pain or antinociceptive tolerance upon sustained exposure to opiates. Microinjection of either lidocaine or a CCK antagonist into the RVM blocked both thermal and touch hypersensitivity as well as antinociceptive tolerance. Thus, prolonged opioid exposure enhances a descending pain facilitatory pathway from the RVM that is mediated at least in part by CCK activity and is essential for the maintenance of antinociceptive tolerance.",

Phobics, but not obsessive-compulsives, have an unusually high dropout rate from treatment when drugs or placebo are given. When antidepressants are stopped, even after 6–8 months, relapse is likely. The drugs do not reduce the liability of many phobics and obsessive-compulsives to have dysphoric episodes over the years. Exposure treatments are more lastingly effective for phobias and for rituals, but do not reduce the liability to later dysphoric episodes.",

      "abstract": "Agitation is a nonspecific constellation of symptoms seen in a variety of psychiatric disorders, ranging from psychotic exacerbations in patients with schizophrenia to behavioral disturbances associated with organic factors. Its treatment must be individualized and based on the etiology of the psychomotor disturbance. Certain categories of drugs are broadly effective. Sedation and control of disruptive and dangerous behavior are the initial goals in stabilizing acutely agitated patients. Sedation is necessary during the lag period before antipsychotic and mood‐stabilizing drugs take effect. Barbiturates and chlorpromazine, initially given to control agitated behavior, are largely supplanted by higher‐potency antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and, recently, a combination of these two agents. Agitation is generally controlled within hours to days, whereas remission of affective or psychotic symptoms often requires weeks to months. Once remission is obtained, sedation is no longer desired and may be a barrier to optimal patient function and compliance. Thus, for long‐term treatment, strategies are used to minimize sedation, such as reducing dosages, changing administration to bedtime, or adding antidepressants or stimulants where appropriate.",

      "title": "Discontinuation or acute unplanned cessation of oral dopaminergic medications in persons with Parkinson's disease: A practice review",
      "abstract": "Planned discontinuation or acute unplanned cessation of oral dopaminergic medications might result in a severe relapse of Parkinson's symptoms or, sporadically, in life-limiting withdrawal syndromes. Unplanned cessation may occur due to dysphagia or decreased alertness, amongst other reasons. Planned acute discontinuation occurs during surgery or a medical necessity for a ‘nil per os’ policy (such as hospitalizations for gastrointestinal diseases). Non-oral alternatives are available, such as transdermal rotigotine, subcutaneous apomorphine, and levodopa delivered subcutaneously or via an enteral tube. Selecting the best treatment can be difficult and should be based upon clinical considerations, patient preference and be tailored to the care setting. These considerations will differ during the course of disease. For example, more invasive treatment options can be considered in hospitalized persons with early to moderate-stage disease, whereas symptomatic palliative treatments are more appropriate towards the end of life. Here, we discuss several practical considerations for three, partially overlapping, but conceptually distinct moments at which acute discontinuation or cessation events occur: during hospitalization (including surgery), late-stage disease and end of life. We stress the need for prevention and early advance care planning and present a stepwise pharmacological approach to address unplanned acute cessation or planned discontinuation.",

      "abstract": "El manejo terapeutico de las psicosis agudas comprende la intervencion farmacologica de urgencia y la evaluacion diagnostica y de laboratorio, para descartar los factores organicos contribuyentes a la psicosis (por ejemplo: drogas, anormalidades del sistema pulmonar, cardiovascular o metabolico, etc). El estado mental podria ser dificil de valorar durante la agitacion extrema, en cuyo caso el aislamiento y la obtencion de informacion de fuentes apropiadas pordria ser crucial para iniciar un tratamiento racional y adecuado. Para prevenir danos al paciente y a otras personas, la intervencion farmacologica debe ser inmediata, concordante y autoevaluatoria. Se recomienda una combinacion de 5 a 10 mgs de haloperidol mas 4 mgs de lorazepam por via intramuscular cada 30 minutos. El registro del grado de agitacion en una escala de 100 puntos, proporciona la retroalimentacion necesaria para proseguir, revalorar, o concluir el tratamiento, dependiendo de los resultados obtenidos. Si el grado de agitacion es superior a los treinta puntos en la escala de agitacion, no se recomienda mantener al paciente sin el beneficio del tratamiento farmacologico. De ser posible, debe evitarse la sedacion. La combinacion de haloperidol-lorazepam es la mejor porque no tiene efectos extrapiramidales y requiere 50% menos de haloperidol. Si no se logra la sedacion en menos de seis horas, despues de una dosis total de 60 mgs de haloperidol y 8 mgs de lorazepam, administrados por via intramuscular, entonces se recomienda aplicar la combinacion por via endovenosa.",

      "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral infection which can cause a variety of respiratory, gastrointestinal, and vascular symptoms. The acute illness phase generally lasts no more than 2-3 weeks. However, there is increasing evidence that a proportion of COVID-19 patients experience a prolonged convalescence and continue to have symptoms lasting several months after the initial infection. A variety of chronic symptoms have been reported including fatigue, dyspnea, myalgia, exercise intolerance, sleep disturbances, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, fever, headache, malaise, and vertigo. These symptoms are similar to those seen in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), a chronic multi-system illness characterized by profound fatigue, sleep disturbances, neurocognitive changes, orthostatic intolerance, and post-exertional malaise. ME/CFS symptoms are exacerbated by exercise or stress and occur in the absence of any significant clinical or laboratory findings. The pathology of ME/CFS is not known: it is thought to be multifactorial, resulting from the dysregulation of multiple systems in response to a particular trigger. Although not exclusively considered a post-infectious entity, ME/CFS has been associated with several infectious agents including Epstein-Barr Virus, Q fever, influenza, and other coronaviruses. There are important similarities between post-acute COVID-19 symptoms and ME/CFS. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to establish COVID-19 as an infectious trigger for ME/CFS. Further research is required to determine the natural history of this condition, as well as to define risk factors, prevalence, and possible interventional strategies.",

Two clinical questions were identified: 1) Which clinical features and diagnostic modalities distinguish PD from other parkinsonian syndromes? 2) Which clinical features predict rate of disease progression? <b>Methods: </b> Systematic review of the literature was completed. Articles were classified according to a four-tiered level of evidence scheme. Recommendations were based on the evidence. <b>Results and Conclusions: </b> 1. Early falls, poor response to levodopa, symmetry of motor manifestations, lack of tremor, and early autonomic dysfunction are probably useful in distinguishing other parkinsonian syndromes from Parkinson disease (PD). 2. Levodopa or apomorphine challenge and olfactory testing are probably useful in distinguishing PD from other parkinsonian syndromes. 3. Predictive factors for more rapid motor progression, nursing home placement, and shorter survival time include older age at onset of PD, associated comorbidities, presentation with rigidity and bradykinesia, and decreased dopamine responsiveness. Future research into methods for earlier and more accurate diagnosis of the disease and identification and clarification of predictive factors of rapid disease progression is warranted.",

      "title": "Post-COVID syndrome or persistent COVID and depression",
      "abstract": "Introduction Since the start of the COVID19 pandemic, numerous patients have exhibited symptoms related to the viral infection once the acute phase has resolved. The most frequent are fatigue or weakness, cognitive difficulties, insomnia, and anxiety or depression. It has been observed that the persistence of these symptoms is more common in cases of severe infections. Objectives We expose a case that exemplifies it; A 60-year-old man suffering from severe COVID19 infection during 2021, with bilateral pneumonia and secondary pneumothorax. Three months after the acute episode, he continues to present related symptoms, such as dyspnea, asthenia, arthromyalgia, nausea, hyporexia, memory lapses, anxiety and depressive mood with apathy, anhedonia and suicidal ideas. Methods The patient starts follow-up in Mental Health and antidepressant treatment with Vortioxetine 10mg. In the following months he presented significant improvement consisting in decrease of the asthenia, dyspnea, arthromyalgia and especially in anxious symptoms and depressive mood, disappearing the apathy, anhedonia and suicidal ideation. However, the persistence of memory failures draws attention, which remain in a similar degree or with slight subjective improvement. The exploration and complementary test were the following: - Chest CT: Hydropneumothorax, parenchymal infiltrates, alveolar consolidations, left lamellar pneumothorax. - Head CT, complete analysis, microbiological and cytological studies without relevant resolution. - Assessment by the Rehabilitation and Neurology service. Results This case exposes the existence of a post-COVID syndrome, where the symptoms related to the infection persist, including anxious-depressive symptoms of moderate-severe intensity. The different diagnoses that were considered were the following: Post-COVID syndrome, Adjustment disorder with mixed anxious-depressive symptomatology, Depressive episode. Conclusions We consider that in this case and in others that are similar, which are increasingly common in routine clinical practice, the etiopathogenesis of the syndrome is of interest. We found that it is difficult to discern the origin of the symptoms, not being able to differentiate an adaptive difficulty to the infection situation (added to the COVID pandemic context), versus a more organic affectation that improves when receiving pharmacological treatment, as in this case with antidepressants.

A well-described discontinuation syndrome occurs with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, common symptoms including dizziness, headache, nausea and lethargy. Rare antidepressant discontinuation syndromes include extrapyramidal syndromes and mania/hypomania. All these syndromes, even isolated discontinuation symptoms, share three common features that facilitate diagnosis; abrupt onset within days of stopping the antidepressant, a short duration when untreated and rapid resolution when the antidepressant is reinstated. Clinicians need to be familiar with strategies for the prevention and management of such symptoms. Preventive strategies include warning patients about the possibility of discontinuation symptoms, encouraging good antidepressant adherence and tapering antidepressants at the end of treatment. Most symptoms are mild and short-lived. Consequently symptoms that follow planned termination of an antidepressant can often be managed by providing an explanation and reassurance. More severe symptoms should be treated symptomatically or the antidepressant restarted, in which case symptoms usually resolve within 24 h. More cautious tapering can then follow.",

The following are the principal conclusions of this guideline: • The initial assessment of patients with acute low back problems focuses on the detection of “red flags” (indicators of potentially serious spinal pathology or other nonspinal pathology). • In the absence of red flags, imaging studies and further testing of patients are not usually helpful during the first 4 weeks of low back symptoms. • Relief of discomfort can be accomplished most safely with nonprescription medication and/or spinal manipulation. • While some activity modification may be necessary during the acute phase, bed rest &gt;4 days is not helpful and may further debilitate the patient. • Low-stress aerobic activities can be safely started in the first 2 weeks of symptoms to help avoid debilitation: exercises to condition trunk muscles are commonly delayed at least 2 weeks. • Patients recovering from acute low back problems are encouraged to return to work or their normal daily activities as soon as possible. • If low back symptoms persist, further evaluation may be indicated. • Patients with sciatica may recover more slowly, but further evaluation can also be safely delayed. • Within the first 3 months of low back symptoms, only patients with evidence of serious spinal pathology or severe, debilitating symptoms of sciatica, and physiologic evidence of specific nerve root compromise corroborated on imaging studies can be expected to benefit from surgery. • With or without surgery, 80 percent of patients with sciatica recover eventually. • Nonphysical factors (such as psychological or socio-economic problems) may be addressed in the context of discussing reasonable expectations for recovery.",

Pain that persists longer than 3 to 6 months is considered chronic pain. Chronic pain affects a large amount of the world population and it is an extensive public health problem. Pathogenesis of chronic pain is still not completely clarified. It is considered to be the result of different neuroplastic processes, especially central senzitation, a phenomenon of hyperexcitation of central neurons caused by a repetitive stimulus from afferent neurons. Chronic pain occurs in various conditions, and can be of malignan or non malignan etiology. Drugs are largely used for chronic pain treatment. The treatment is usually planned according to the WHO’s three step ladder. In the first stage nonopioid analgesics are indicated (paracetamol, NSAID, acetylsalicylic acid) but if the pain persists the therapy proceeds to the second stage involving weak opioids (codeine, tramadol, pentazocine...) in combination with or without non opioid analgesics. The last, third stage, involves usage of strong opioids (morphine, fentanyl, buprenorphine...) in combination with non opioid analgesics. Through the whole therapy scheme adjuvant drugs may be used, such as anticonvulsants, antidepressants, local anesthetics and corticosteroids.",

      "abstract": "Stress--that is, any type of stimulus that challenges the organism's normal internal balance--induces a physiologic response involving a variety of hormones and other signaling molecules that act on, among other organs, the brain. This stress response also can influence the progression of alcohol and other drug (AOD) addiction through various stages. For example, AODs can directly activate the stress response. In turn, certain stress hormones (i.e., glucocorticoids and corticotrophin-releasing factor) also act on the brain system that mediates the rewarding experiences associated with AOD use (i.e., the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system). Moreover, elevated glucocorticoid levels and stress increase AOD self-administration in certain animal models. During a later stage of the addiction process, in contrast, excessive and/or prolonged stress may impair the reward system, inducing heavier AOD use to maintain the rewarding experience. During the final stage of addiction, when the addicted person experiences withdrawal symptoms if no drug is consumed, chronic AOD use results in gross impairment of the normal stress response and other signaling mechanisms in the brain, resulting in a state of anxiety and internal stress. At this stage, people continue to use AODs mainly to relieve this negative-affect state.",

      "title": "Psychedelic Therapy: A Primer for Primary Care Clinicians—Ibogaine",
      "abstract": "Background: Ibogaine is a plant-derived alkaloid that has been used for thousands of years in rites of passage and spiritual ceremonies in West-Central Africa. In the West, it has primarily been used and studied for its anti-addictive properties and more recently for other neuropsychiatric indications, including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, and traumatic brain injury. Areas of Uncertainty: Ibogaine requires careful patient screening and monitoring because of significant safety issues. There is potential for cardiotoxicity (prolonged QT interval); without rigorous screening, fatal arrhythmias may occur. However, preliminary research suggests that co-administration of ibogaine with magnesium may mitigate cardiotoxicity. Additionally, ibogaine may have dangerous interactions with opiates, so patients who receive ibogaine treatment for opioid use disorder must withdraw from long-acting opioids. Other potential concerning effects of ibogaine include rare incidences of mania or psychosis. Anticipated transient effects during ibogaine treatment can include ataxia, tremors, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Therapeutic Advances: Robust effects after a single treatment with ibogaine have been reported. In open-label and randomized controlled trials (RCTs), ibogaine reduces heroin and opioid cravings by upwards of 50%, up to 24 weeks after the treatment. An observational study of 30 Special Operations Forces veterans with mild traumatic brain injury reported that 86% were in remission from post-traumatic stress disorder, 83% from depression, and 83% from anxiety, one month after a single-dose ibogaine treatment. Limitations: Although there are several observational and open-label studies, there is only a single double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT on ibogaine. More RCTs with large sample sizes must be conducted to support ibogaine's safety and efficacy. Conclusions: Given the promising preliminary findings, ibogaine could potentially fill a much-needed gap in treatments for challenging conditions, including opioid dependence. Ibogaine's remarkable effects in traditionally treatment-resistant, combat-exposed individuals hints at its potential in broader populations with physical and psychological trauma.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Stimulants are sympathomimetic substances that include cocaine, amphetamines, and cathinones. Approximately 1.5% of Americans have used illicit stimulants in the past month, and approximately 61,500 deaths involved stimulant use in 2022. Acute effects include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and euphoria. High doses of stimulants may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, severe hypertension, agitation, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, stroke, hyperthermia, or rhabdomyolysis. Abstinence after regular use of stimulants may lead to dysphoria, fatigue, insomnia, and agitation. People who use stimulants may present with acute effects or medical complications. Cocaine metabolites and amphetamines can be detected in urine for a few days after use. The most serious complications of acute use are cardiovascular (especially myocardial infarction, stroke) and psychiatric (agitation, delirium); the risk of hyperthermia is also increased. Contingency management has been shown to be effective for stimulant use disorder. Other psychosocial modalities may reduce stimulant use among selected individuals; these include individual and group counseling, cognitive–behavioral therapy, and community reinforcement. Medications may provide modest benefits, including bupropion with or without naltrexone, topiramate, mirtazapine, and prescription stimulants. Harm reduction interventions such as syringe exchange programs and safe consumption sites are associated with decreased complications related to stimulant use. Caffeine has mild stimulant effects and may lead to a mild dependence syndrome.",

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an intense and disabling response to a traumatic event. Acute PTSD occurs 1 to <3 months following the event, whereas chronic PTSD persists for 3 months or longer. The symptoms fall primarily into three clusters. The first includes reexperiencing the event. This reaction manifests clinically as distressing memories, nightmares, or the more extreme \"flashbacks\" to the event itself. During reexposure (either from internal cues such as reexperiencing in the mind, or external, such as visiting the scene of the accident), the person suffers from intense anxiety and distress. The second cluster can, to some extent, be seen as a reaction to the first. This response is characterized by avoidance of reexposure to the trauma and numbing to the psychological responses the exposure creates, including a more generalized emotional numbing. The third symptom cluster involves a constant hyperalert state. The person may have difficulty falling or staying asleep, may have an increased startle response, may have more trouble concentrating, and may be more generally irritable or angry.Approximately 70% of children have had exposure to a traumatic event before age 16 years; however, despite the large amount of exposure, the 6-month prevalence of PTSD in these patients is ∼3.7% for boys and 6.3% for girls. Protective factors against PTSD include, in descending order of importance, connections to positive caretakers, feelings of self-worth, feelings of hope, importance to others, talents valued by others, religious faith, and socioeconomic advantage.Specific risk factors for developing PTSD also exist. These factors primarily fall into four categories, the first of which includes lack of resilience or negative prior life experiences, which would include a history of other traumatic exposures, preexisting psychological problems, and substance abuse. The second main risk factor is the type of traumatic event. Nearly 100% of children who see a parent being killed or sexually assaulted acquire PTSD. This observation is important because it appears that in children, threat to a parent is equivalent to threat to self. Additionally, PTSD develops in 90% of sexually abused children, 77% of children who see a school shooting, and 35% who witness violence around their home.The effects of exposure to trauma through media are less clear. Many researchers have found that children resonate with media via reexposure if they were personally affected by the original trauma, but not if the trauma was more distant.A third area of risk concerns the child's reaction to the trauma. Dissociation, a psychological mechanism whereby a person attempts to protect him- or herself by separating from reality, was found to be strongly predictive of posttraumatic symptoms. Finally, the resources available to a child after a traumatic exposure can be critical. The most important of these is an attentive parent or guardian; thus, attending to parents' mental health can actually be the most effective intervention in aiding the child's recovery.Screening for and identifying PTSD can be difficult. Standardized assessments, such as the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory (see Suggested Reading) can be useful to evaluate exposure. Even after exposure is assessed, diagnosing PTSD itself can be complex, and may best be left to a child mental health provider. If a referral seems difficult, scheduling frequent appointments (monthly) to address any continued disability from the reaction to a trauma can be helpful.Treatment for PTSD is complicated and multifactorial. Regarding medications, there is some evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have some utility. In adults, these agents have been shown to reduce symptoms in all three of the symptom clusters described previously, but in children, only two small studies (24 and 26 children, respectively) support their effectiveness. Additionally, SSRIs can lead to activation (irritability, poor attention, and sleep disturbance), which can mimic the hyperarousal cluster of PTSD symptoms.In two child-specific studies, clonidine was found to decrease basal heart rate, anxiety, impulsivity, and PTSD hyperarousal. Propranolol also was found to decrease reexperiencing and hyperarousal. Opiates may be beneficial, but should be used with caution. Even controlling for subjective pain, one study found that there was a significant linear association between morphine dosage and 6-month reduction in PTSD symptoms. Neuroleptic agents, such as risperidone, have shown mixed results. Benzodiazepines have not been found to be beneficial in treating PTSD-specific symptoms, and may worsen some symptoms characterized primarily by disinhibition (aggression, acting out).In children, the strongest empiricalevidence to date supports Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT). In fact, a study comparing TF-CBT and placebo to TF-CBT and an SSRI showed no significant differences in response rates. TF-CBT begins with the child directly discussing the traumatic event, and then proceeds to anxiety-management techniques, such as relaxation and correction of distorted trauma-related thoughts. Through this procedure, the children learn that they do not have to be afraid of their memories. CBT often is accompanied by psychological education and parental involvement. Research shows that the better parents cope with the trauma and the more they support their children, the better their children will function. Therefore, it is important for parents to seek treatment for themselves so as to develop the necessary coping skills that will help their children.Comments: After September 11th and, more recently, the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, there has been more focused national and international attention on PTSD in children and adolescents. These experiences provide important examples of how communitywide interventions are essential and needed; however, Dr Kelly's In Brief reminded me of how important this topic is to patients whom I serve. I have worked most of my career with low-income patients who live in an urban area and I have been continually inspired by the resilience of these families. This In Brief reminded me of the heightened risk of these children and adolescents to PTSD because of their chance of witnessing or being involved with traumatic events, such as homicide, domestic violence, child abuse, house fires, or even dog attacks. I worry that parents may minimize some of these experiences because, unfortunately, they occur more frequently in urban communities. It is important that parents know that we as pediatric health-care providers have an interest in these experiences and to ensure that diagnosis and treatment is initiated.",

      "title": "Recommendation for a definition of acute symptomatic seizure",
      "abstract": "Summary Purpose: To consider the definition of acute symptomatic seizures for epidemiological studies, and to refine the criteria used to distinguish these seizures from unprovoked seizures for specific etiologies. Methods: Systematic review of the literature and of epidemiologic studies. Results: An acute symptomatic seizure is defined as a clinical seizure occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Suggestions are made to define acute symptomatic seizures as those events occurring within 1 week of stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, or intracranial surgery; at first identification of subdural hematoma; at the presence of an active central nervous system (CNS) infection; or during an active phase of multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune diseases. In addition, a diagnosis of acute symptomatic seizure should be made in the presence of severe metabolic derangements (documented within 24 h by specific biochemical or hematologic abnormalities), drug or alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, or exposure to well‐defined epileptogenic drugs. Discussion: Acute symptomatic seizures must be distinguished from unprovoked seizures and separately categorized for epidemiologic purposes. These recommendations are based upon the best available data at the time of this report. Systematic studies should be undertaken to better define the associations in question, with special reference to metabolic and toxic insults, for which the time window for the occurrence of an acute symptomatic seizure and the absolute values for toxic and metabolic dysfunction still require a clear identification.",

      "title": "Las suprarrenales en la hipoxia o anoxia",
      "abstract": "La disminución de tensión de oxígeno (hipoxia) es una situación de emergencia que somete el organismo a un esfuerzo (stress), el cual provoca múltiples modificaciones, algunas específicas o sea debidas a la disminución de oxígeno y otras generales, como ser el síndrome de adaptación. Si el animal sobrevive se observa una evolución de los fenómenos en tres fases: a) aguda o reacción de alarma; b) de adaptación o aclimatación; c ) de desadaptación o desaclimatación o descompensación. El sistema nervioso, estimulado inicialmente por la hipoxia, modifica la función de la corteza y la médula suprarrenal. La acción sobre la corteza se debe a que la acción nerviosa central provoca un aumento de la secreción de adrenocorticotrofina por la pars distalis de la hipófisis. La acción sobre la médula suprarrenal consiste en un estímulo sobre los centros simpáticos superiores (hipotálamo, etc.), que siguiendo la médula espinal y los nervios esplácnicos mayores y menores produce una fuerte descarga de adrenalina. Si la hipoxia es intensa o se provoca la asfixia, la descarga de adrenalina es una de las más intensas que pueden observarse y dura varios minutos. La reacción inicial sobre la corteza se produce al través de la hipófisis y por lo tanto falta en animales hipofisoprivos. La descarga de adrenocorticotrofina produce: a) disminución del ácido ascórbico, colesterol y lípidos de la corteza; b) el aumento de secreción de hormonas corticoadrenales produce disminución del timo y tejido linfático (acción linfolítica); c ) en la sangre, linfopenia y eosinofilopenia; d) aumento de los hidratos de carbono del organismo, en especial el glucógeno hepático, en animales en ayuno expuestos a la hipoxia; e) aumento de excreción de nitrógeno durante dicho ayuno; f) aumento de excreción de los 17-cetoesteroides urinarios. Durante la fase de adaptación o aclimatación vuelven a aumentar las grasas y el colesterol y sube el peso de la suprarrenal. Durante esta adaptación o aclimatación, la hipoxia es mejor soportada y produce menor disminución del ácido ascórbico suprarrenal. El peso corporal que había disminuido vuelve a recuperarse. Varios autores han comprobado que las hormonas activas sobre el metabolismo de los hidratos de carbono producen aumento de resistencia a la hipoxia. No se produjo con el extracto que empleamos y en las condiciones que experimentamos. La suprarrenal parece desempeñar un papel en la resistencia a la hipoxia. Si ésta es permanente o se repite todos los días, se ha encontrado que las ratas suprarrenoprivas no la soportan. No comprobamos esto en la anoxia aguda de 2 horas, ya sea por el corto tiempo de nuestros experimentos o por la raza de ratas empleadas. Es fácil comprender que se adicionen los síntomas de shock producidos por la hipoxia con los que produce la insuficiencia suprarrenal. Es posible producir un aumento de resistencia de las ratas normales o aún suprarrenoprivas, sometiéndolas paulatinamente una vez por día, durante períodos cortos (2 horas) a depresiones cada día mayores. En la hipoxia intensa permanente y prolongada o bien repetida diariamente durante períodos largos, se ha podido comprobar a la larga una pérdida de la adaptación. Se ha observado que reaparecen: la depleción de lípidos en la corteza, la disminución de resistencia a la hipoxia, la hipoglucemia, una tendencia a la temperatura subnormal. etc. En resumen: la hipoxia produce un aumento de actividad del sistema hipofiso-corticosuprarrenal y también, si es intensa, provoca una descarga de adrenalina de la médula suprarrenal por intermedio del mecanismo simpático-méduloadrenal. La presencia de la función suprarrenal favorece la resistencia del organismo durante la hipoxia, como sucede en todos los casos de emergencia. El aumento de las funciones cortical y medular puede cooperar con los demás mecanismos de resistencia del organismo, en una proporción que es difícil de precisar cuantitativamente.",

      "abstract": "The taking of a careful history in patients with exophthalmic goiter commonly yields three important facts: (1) Information to the effect that one or more blood relatives is or had been suffering with \"nervousness,\" exophthalmic goiter, or diabetes mellitus; (2) the patient has been of more or less \"nervous\" temperament, characterized by irritability, impatience, fractiousness, and emotionalism, usually since childhood; (3) the onset of the symptoms of the disease followed soon after the occurrence of a psychic trauma. From the frequency with which such histories are elicited,it appears that there is a strong congenital predisposition to the disease. Indeed, in quite a series of the cases herein reported, two, three, and even four members of a family have been afflicted with exophthalmic goiter. In the absence of an exciting cause, such a predisposition may not be recognizable nor tangibly mar the individual's physical and mental well-being throughout a normal span of existence. There are doubtless many thousands of individuals possessing a strong susceptibility to exophthalmic goiter who are going through life in an apparently normal manner, oblivious to possibilities which would likely follow the incidence of a psychic trauma.",

      "abstract": "A complaint of bloating or swelling of sufficient severity to lead to medical consultation is the lead symptom of a syndrome (the fluid retention syndrome) which includes affective, somatic and autonomic symptoms. These appear to have a primary origin in a neuroendocrine disturbance of limbic and hypothalamic function and form a substantial part of the work-load of a menopause clinic. The fluid retention syndrome, in turn, is one component of a spectrum of affective-somatic-autonomic disorders which comprise a significant part of the general practitioner's work load. Major risk factors for the fluid retention syndrome comprise a strong family history of swelling symptoms and/or diabetes mellitus, affective illness, including major life events, weight gain and obesity. Short term exacerbations of swelling are precipitated by emotional stress, high carbohydrate meals, alcohol, prolonged standing and exercise, high ambient temperatures and rebound oedema following the withdrawal of diuretic therapy. Management involves recognition of the syndrome, a clear explanation of its nature to the patient, the control of weight-related fluid retention by reduction to a pre-morbid target weight and the avoidance of inappropriate drug therapy. In particular, diuretics should not be prescribed for fluid-retaining symptoms. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) should be prescribed for patients with the fluid retention syndrome if there is biochemical evidence of ovarian failure. The role of HRT in inducing rapid bloating independently of weight gain requires evaluation by a randomised controlled clinical trial. More effective management of the syndrome awaits further understanding of the neuroendocrine substrate for the disorder.",

Drugs causing intoxications can in general be divided into three groups: depressants, stimulants, and hallucinogens. Opioids act through a mu receptor present in the central nervous system. Drugs like dilaudid, morphine, methadone, and heroin all belong to the opioid family. Cocaine blocks reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin from the synaptic cleft, therefore prolonging their activity on the postsynaptic membrane. Withdrawal from marijuana presents with mild symptoms or irritability, depression, insomnia, nausea, and anorexia. Alcohol is the most commonly abused substance. Intoxication presentation may vary and include talkative, flirtatious, aggressive, moody, or disinhibited behaviors. Intoxicated patients may not be competent enough to make reasonable decisions in terms of their medical care as well as pose a potential danger to self and others.",

      "title": "Safety Challenges of Using High Dose Baclofen for Alcohol Use Disorder: A Focused Review",
      "abstract": "Since the early 2000s, the gamma-aminobutyric acid type B (GABA-B) receptor agonist baclofen has been extensively used for treating alcohol use disorder (AUD). In some countries, like France, Australia, or Germany, baclofen has been used at patient-tailored dose regimens, which can reach 300 mgpd or even more in some patients. The GABA-B-related pharmacology of baclofen expose patients to a specific profile of neuropsychiatric adverse drug reactions (ADRs), primarily some frequent sedative symptoms whose risk of occurrence and severity are both related to the absolute baclofen dosing and the kinetics of dose variations. Other frequent neuropsychiatric ADRs can occur, i.e., tinnitus, insomnia, or dizziness. More rarely, other serious ADRs have been reported, like seizures, manic symptoms, or sleep apnea. However, real-life AUD patients are also exposed to other sedative drugs, like alcohol of course, but also benzodiazepines, other drugs of abuse, or other sedative medications. Consequently, the occurrence of neuropsychiatric safety issues in these patients is essentially the result of a complex multifactorial exposure, in which baclofen causality is rarely obvious by itself. As a result, the decision of initiating baclofen, as well as the daily dose management should be patient-tailored, according the medical history but also the immediate clinical situation of the patient. The overall safety profile of baclofen, as well as the clinical context in which baclofen is used, have many similarities with the use of opiate substitution medications for opiate use disorder. This empirical statement has many implications on how baclofen should be managed and dosing should be adjusted. Moreover, this constant patient-tailored adjustment can be difficult to adapt in the design of clinical trials, which may explain inconsistent findings in baclofen-related literature on AUD.",

      "title": "Anticonvulsants: aspects of their mechanisms of action",
      "abstract": "An ideal anticonvulsant drag would prevent or inhibit excessive pathological neuronal discharge without interfering with physiological neuronal activity and without producing untoward effects. Such an ideal compound is not yet available. However, during the last few years several new anticonvulsants have appeared (e.g. vigabatrine, gabapentin, topiramate, lamotrigine, tiagabine, felbamate and oxcarbazepine) which may challenge the older, more established substances (i.e. phenytoin, benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, valproate, carbamazepine and ethosuximide). Interestingly, several of the old and new anticonvulsants are beneficial in the treatment of various psychiatric conditions (most notably mood disorders) as well as neuropathic pain. The reason these various drags are effective in the treatment of such disparate clinical conditions is unknown. The answer may be that the neuronal dysfunctions underlying these conditions are similar in a mechanistic sense, but are manifested in different neurons/locations of the nervous system, or that the drags possess several mechanisms of action that contribute in different ways to the favourable effect depending on the condition studied. Even though all these drags inhibit excessive neuronal activity, this acute effect appears to be produced by several mechanisms, which fall into three major categories: (1) blockade of voltage‐gated sodium channels; (2) indirect or direct enhancement of inhibitory γ‐aminobutyric acid [GABAergic] neurotransmission; or (3) inhibition of excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission. Moreover, several of these drags fall into more than one category, and it is often unclear which category is responsible for a given effect of a drag. It is plausible that some of the beneficial effects observed in the clinic can be explained by the secondary neural depressant mechanisms of action of these substances, whereas other benefits may be due to long‐term neuro‐plastic effects, which may either be common or different across the various conditions treated. © 2002 European Federation of Chapters of the International Association for the Study of Pain",

No major changes in the neurological status of these children were observed. However, the three children with ADHD showed an exacerbation of symptoms on fluoxetine. Discontinuation (n = 5) or halving the dosage (n = 7) resulted in complete resolution of these unwanted symptoms within 1 to 2 weeks. In all 7 children whose doses were reduced, improvement of the depressive or obsessive compulsive symptoms was maintained on the lower dosage. Clinicians treating children with fluoxetine are cautioned to be aware of behavioral side effects which may be alleviated by dosage reduction or possibly by starting with lower doses. These side effects may be difficult to differentiate from common psychopathological symptoms such as hyperactivity, restlessness, and impulsivity.",

But it must also be recognized that many disturbances of function, such as massive collapse of the lung, attributed to operation, illness, anesthesia or medication have become evident only because the patient was forced to spend hours or days in the dorsal recumbent position. In any discussion of the effects of complete bed rest it is to be borne in mind that the disorders noted may have been aggravated, or even initiated, by a depression",

      "abstract": "The stability of sleep was examined in two kinds of induced insomnia, namely after caffeine administration and after hypnotic drug withdrawal. The duration of each episode of any one sleep stage or any episode of intervening wakefulness plus drowsiness was determined. After caffeine there was an increase in longer episodes of intervening wakefulness plus drowsiness, but no significant change in the episode duration of any of the sleep stages. In the case of drug withdrawal there was no change in the episode duration of intervening wakefulness plus drowsiness, but there was a significant shortening of episode duration in sleep stages 2 and 3+4, with a similar trend for REM sleep episodes. Caffeine 'insomnia' thus seems characterized by increased stability of wakefulness, and hypnotic withdrawal 'insomnia' by decreased stability fo sleep. The type of analysis undertaken in this study could increase understanding of other types of insomnia.",

In the initial stages of our research we found that informational stress can result in fatigue, anxiety, sleeplessness, and excitability. Later we found further symptoms, such as tachycardia, palpitations, chest pain, abdominal pain, increase or decrease of appetite, diarrhoea or constipation, muscle cramps, back pain, headache, tremor, dizziness, diaphoresis, tics, and so on. Some of these symptoms might be the result of cathecholamine increased secretion, others of a decrease of endogenous opioids. Because in the initial stage of stress analgesia may occur, we studied the clinical and experimental evolution of the pain threshold and its clinical manifestations. We found that after the initial analgesia, there follows a stage of hyperalgesia; the symptoms of this stage very much resemble those of the opioid abstinence syndrome. The evolution of this syndrome is enhanced by naloxone, an opioid antagonist, and it is attenuated by clonidine and propranolol, used in the treatment of opioid abstinence syndrome. Thus we demonstrated that in the latter stage of stress, there is diminished secretion of endogenous opioids and an acute tolerance to them.",

In the past decade, however, they have generated considerable controversy. Although much of the ongoing debate about benzodiazepines tends to centre on issues related to their dependency and abuse potential, problems also may occur with their therapeutic use.Despite a lack of study evidence demonstrating that benzodiazepines have continuing therapeutic efficacy beyond 6 months for anxiety and 4 weeks for insomnia, an unknown number of patients have taken benzodiazepines for extended periods, in some cases for up to 25 years or more. Other than increased risk of withdrawal reactions, little is known about the effects of protracted benzodiazepine use on health and cognitive function. A number of investigators, however, have reported considerable ill health, both mental and physical, in long-term users.Short-term therapeutic use of benzodiazepines is often considered relatively risk-free. Problems, however, also may occur with brief administration of some benzodiazepines, particularly alprazolam and triazolam.Although no new class of drugs has emerged as a clear replacement of benzodiazepines, several compounds are under investigation. In the meantime, physicians must use benzodiazepines judiciously and become adept at selecting from a range of available pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic alternatives.",

      "abstract": "Saher (Insomnia) or sleeplessness is a sleep disorder in which there is an inability to fall asleep or to stay asleep or both, as long as desire. According to current researches, it has been noted that many people all over the world are suffering from one or more symptoms of insomnia. Depending on duration of problem, it may be classified as transient insomnia, short term insomnia and chronic insomnia. Insomnia is described as saher in ancient classical Unani literature. The causes of insomnia are stress, depression, anxiety, medical conditions, drugs, irregular schedule, caffeine, etc. According to Unani system of medicine, health is attributed to the equilibrium of Akhlat (Humors), beside this, there is Asbab sitta zarooriya (Six essential factors) there are air, food and drinks, bodily movement and repose (Harkat sukoon badni), mental activity and repose, (Harkat wa sukoon nafsani), sleep and wakefulness (Naumwayaqza) and retention and excretion (Ahtabas wa Istefrag); any imbalance any of the above factors is likely to cause the disease. Normal sleep is thought to be because of rutubat wa broodat i.e., wetness and cold in our body, and if there is derailment of balance in sleep and wakefulness, it implies the predominance of yaboosat wa hararat i.e. dryness and hotness extensive in the brain. Dalak (Massage) is a systematic manipulation of body tissues with the hand. Several varieties of dalak have been recommended in Unani system of medicine, e.g., Dalak e sulb (hard) Dalak e layyan (soft), etc. Keywords: Dalak, sahar, insomnia, regimental therapy Cite this Article Moteseem Ahemad, Patel Mohd.

Caso clínico: Se presenta el caso de un varón de 42 años con antecedentes personales de trastorno por consumo de sustancias (Heroína, cocaína, alcohol, nicotina y cannabis), con abandono del seguimiento en la unidad de conductas adictivas y múltiples ingresos y asistencias en urgencias por clínica ansioso depresiva y rasgos desadaptativos de personalidad B. Como comorbilidad presenta diabetes mellitus tipo II y EPOC de alto riesgo. En los últimos meses el paciente ha sido atendido múltiples veces en el servicio de urgencias con ajustes varios de tratamiento y con prescripciones de diferentes benzodiazepinas, con patrón de abuso de las mismas, junto con consumo de alcohol, y posterior necesidad de nueva asistencia en el servicio de urgencias por intoxicación o para solicitar medicación de nuevo. Por todo lo anterior se decide ingreso para desintoxicación de benzodiazepinas y alcohol. Conclusiones: Las benzodiazepinas son fármacos muy utilizados en todo el mundo, para diversos trastornos como la ansiedad y el insomnio, con un incremento en su uso en la ultima década. En España, se ha demostrado que hasta en un 82,5 % de los casos se excede la duración del tratamiento, siendo muy frecuente la automedicación y la dependencia. En nuestra práctica clínica, observamos con frecuencia esta problemática en los pacientes hiperfrecuentadores de los servicios de urgencias, en los que se acumulan diferentes tratamientos sin seguimiento adecuado de los mismos, lo que podría fomentar el mal uso de estos fármacos.",

It is characterized by a persistent and repetitive pattern of aggressive, noncompliant, intrusive, and poorly self-controlled behaviors that violate either the rights of others or age-appropriate societal norms.1 These behaviors have a significant impact on the daily functioning of the child or adolescent and on the ability of parents and other adults to manage them. The specific behavioral criteria for the diagnosis of conduct disorder can be conceptualized as either aggressive or nonaggressive in type (Table 1). Examples of aggressive behaviors are physical fighting and bullying, assault, vandalism, purse snatching, physical cruelty to persons or animals, breaking and entering, and arson. More serious aggressive behaviors are armed robbery, rape, and extortion. Nonaggressive behaviors of conduct disorder include substance abuse, persistent truancy, running away from home overnight, frequent lying in a variety of social settings, theft not involving a confrontation with a victim, and chronic violation of rules or the basic rights of others. Three subtypes of conduct disorder are identified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, revised 3rd edition.1 These are descriptions of the functional contexts in which the particular behavior problems occur. The group type involves problematic behaviors that occur as part of an activity with peers.",

After drug administration, mostly amnesia and symptoms such as confussion, loss of memory, lack of muscle control, dizziness occur. The main drugs in sexual assaults are benzodiazepines such as γ-hydroxy butyrate and its analogs, clonazepam, alprazolam, flunitrazepam, oxazepam, ketamine, barbiturates, antidepressants, cocaine and stimulants. Most of these drugs are colorless, odorless and highly soluble in alcohol or other beverages quickly. They are rapidly absorbed and eliminated after oral administration. A victim may complain to police or other legal forces after several days due to emotional trauma as shame, fear, doubt and disbelief. For this reason, It is important to know what time the sample is taken from the victim to confirm the presence of the drug.

      "title": "Perioperative opioids: Are they indispensable?",
      "abstract": "Perioperative pain is the most common cause of fear in patients undergoing surgical procedures under general anesthesia.[1] For ensuring a good patient experience with enhanced functional recovery, perioperative pain must be addressed satisfactorily. For many decades, opioids have been an integral component of balanced anesthesia care for their high analgesic efficacy. However, because of the several problems like opioid dependence, addiction, and drug abuse, (reported mainly from the western world, possibly because of the over prescription of opioids with limited oversight) and other side effects (respiratory depression, constipation, and nausea), has led to debate, and the introduction of new strategies like 'opioid-sparing anesthesia' and 'opioid-free anesthesia' techniques. The enhanced recovery after surgery program also recommends procedure-specific pain management strategies with particular attention to opioid-sparing.[2] 'Opioid free anesthesia' includes the administration of several non-opioid analgesics (acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, neuraxial or regional analgesic techniques, and nonpharmacologic methods) plus some of the analgesic adjuncts (gabapentinoids, steroids, and infusion of intravenous lidocaine, ketamine, dexmedetomidine, magnesium, and β-blocker).[34] The limitations of these techniques include ceiling effect with a small therapeutic index of safety for most of the drugs, inability to titrate the fixed-dose infusion to an effect, non-availability of objective monitoring for nociception in a patient under general anesthesia, and optimal combination of these agents or their dosing remaining unclear.[56] Above all, none of the drug combinations or techniques have been found to be superior to opioid-based analgesia. Till now, no new drugs or techniques have replaced opioids for the management of perioperative pain because of the strategic location of μ receptors (distributed throughout the pain pathway) and the role of the endogenous opioid system in regulating pain sensitivity.[7] Considering this, and the fact that poorly controlled perioperative pain is the most important independent predictor of transition from acute pain to chronic pain, the 'opioid-free anesthesia' technique seems difficult to practice. 'Opioid sparing techniques' (the multimodal analgesia wherein traditional opioid doses are reduced) is a feasible step to adequately control the postoperative pain and minimize adverse effects from individual agents. Initially, advocated to control the postoperative pain, the use of the multimodal analgesia technique has been extended to the entire perioperative period with the objective to reduce the opioid requirement.[89] The theoretical advantage of decreasing intraoperative opioid include a reduction in the dose-related perioperative adverse opioid effects as well as opioid-induced hyperalgesia.[1011] Although the multimodal analgesia technique seems feasible, its impact on the incidence of persistent opioid use after surgery and improvement in important anesthetic outcomes are still unknown. We are not aware of the magnitude of the problem of opioid dependence after perioperative prescriptions in India. Postoperative analgesia in most Indian hospitals is left to surgeons, who generally avoid the use of morphine/fentanyl. The lack of awareness on the magnitude of the problem in India could be due to insufficient follow-up of the patients postoperatively and under-reporting. The 'not so easily' available opioids, leading to widespread use of NSAIDs with weak or synthetic opioids in India suggests that the opioid-related problems could be much less severe compared to the western world. Even so, there is on-going research work, and publications addressing the issue. A systemic review on 'opioid-free onco-anesthesia' was published in the JOACP some time back[12] but the authors primarily focused on the opioid-induced immune suppression only. In the current issue of JAOCP, a narrative review on 'opioid-sparing strategies' other than regional anesthesia is published.[13] It is important to have awareness of these issues; however, the collection of quality data is an important prerequisite for research, and for arriving at appropriate country-centric strategies for perioperative pain management.",

      "abstract": "Heavy drinkers who suddenly decrease their alcohol consumption or abstain completely may experience alcohol withdrawal (AW). Signs and symptoms of AW can include, among others, mild to moderate tremors, irritability, anxiety, or agitation. The most severe manifestations of withdrawal include delirium tremens, hallucinations, and seizures. These manifestations result from alcohol-induced imbalances in the brain chemistry that cause excessive neuronal activity if the alcohol is withheld. Management of AW includes thorough assessment of the severity of the patient's symptoms and of any complicating conditions as well as treatment of the withdrawal symptoms with pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches. Treatment can occur in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Recognition and treatment of withdrawal can represent a first step in the patient's recovery process.",

      "abstract": "Shabú o Shaboo, es el nombre que se da a la metanfetamina cristalina en Filipinas, también conocida como “la droga de los pobres”. Esta droga se consumía en muchas ocasiones para afrontar las largas jornadas de trabajo debido a que te permite estar despierto durante días sin reducir el rendimiento laboral. El Shabú es una metanfetamina fumada y una vez llega al cerebro produce una liberación de dopamina, adrenalina y serotonina. Las consecuencias de esta peligrosa droga de síntesis son notorias entre quienes la consumen produciendo insomnio, alto grado de excitación y palpitaciones. Esta droga altamente adictiva produce efectos tanto a nivel orgánico, como psiquiátrico: Psicosis(23%), depresión, ansiedad... Se expone el caso de un varón de 45 años de nacionalidad Filipina residente en España que acude al servicio de urgencias psiquiátricas tras conducta suicida (trepanación abdominal) en el contexto de un episodio depresivo con síntomas psicóticos secundaria al consumo de shabú. El paciente sin antecedentes personales ni familiares previos en salud mental, inicia consumo de shabú desde hacía seis meses con la finalidad de aguantar jornadas maratonianas en el trabajo. En consecuencia comienza con ánimo hipotímico, apatoabulía y perdida de capacidad hedónica con importante repercusión funcional. Posteriormente comienza con clínica autorreferencial y alucinaciones auditivas de carácter imperativo que le llevan a realizar dicho acto suicida, trepanándose con un taladro a nivel abdominal. Tras la valoración del caso se procede a un internamiento involuntario en unidad de hospitalización iniciando tratamiento con Sertralina a dosis progresivas hasta 200mg/24 h y Olanzapina 20 mg/24 h con adecuada respuesta tras varias semanas de ingreso. En conclusión, el shabú es una metanfetamina muy peligrosa y adictiva con efectos notorios no solo a nivel orgánico si no también psiquiátricos sobre la cual debemos de extremar las precauciones.",

They are often accompanied by neuropsychological symptoms, including alterations in mood, irritability, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, simple or complex visual and auditory hallucinations, distorted body perceptions, an altered sense of reality, or delusions. Migraine headaches occur periodically, are pulsating, vary in severity but are usually moderately severe, and last from hours to 3 days. Symptoms that can be part of an aura preceding a migraine headache generally include: irritability, depression, loss of appetite, diminished alertness, or elation and exhilaration. This chapter presents the possible mental signs and symptoms, physical signs and symptoms, variants or migraine equivalents, clinical presentation and the course and procedure. It discusses the Lilliputian hallucinations that a patient began to experience as part of her migraine aura when she was about 30 years old.

Evidence of toxicity was signaled by few of the variables monitored. Mental effects included enhanced interest, improved memory, transitory sleeplessness and nervousness. Nausea and vomiting were largely circumvented by slowing of the increases of the daily dose. A peripheral dopadecarboxylase inhibitor diminished the therapeutic dose of L-dopa required and eliminated anorexia and nausea in one case.

Both tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors cause similar syndromes, most commonly characterized by gastrointestinal or somatic distress, sleep disturbances, mood fluctuations and movement disorders. Most symptoms related to tricyclic antidepressant withdrawal are believed to be caused by rebound excess of cholinergic activity after prolonged anticholinergic effect on cholinergic receptors. (This situation is analogous to the adrenergic rebound that occurs after beta-blocker withdrawal.) Treatment involves restarting the antidepressant and tapering it more slowly. Alternatively, tricyclic antidepressant withdrawal symptoms often respond to anticholinergics, such as atropine or benztropine mesylate. Three case reports of antidepressant withdrawal are presented, including one featuring akathisia (motor restlessness) related to withdrawal of venlafaxine.",

      "abstract": "To the Editor: Despite wide-ranging clinical use of antidepressants to treat depression alone as well as depression associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), there have been no reports to date on the use of serotonin reuptake inhibition with a successful outcome of both major depressive disorder (MDD) and PCOS symptomatology, such as oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea and hirsutism.\r\n\r\nCase report. Ms A, a 40-year-old married woman, had a 20-year history of recurrent MDD (DSM-IV). Her first episode began when she was 20 years old. Seven years ago, her depressive symptoms began to appear slowly, characterized by depressed mood, irritability, diminished interest in her usual activities, loss of appetite, weight loss, lack of energy, poor concentration, insomnia, and recurrent thoughts of death, such as “It would be nice not being alive.” These symptoms led to impaired work and social functioning. Her mother had a history of chronic depressive mood disorder.\r\n\r\nMs A also had a 26-year history of PCOS, characterized by oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, hirsutism, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries, confirmed by several laboratory tests and ultrasound, meeting the 2003 Rotterdam, or European Society for Human Reproduction/American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ESHRE/ASRM), criteria.1 Twenty years ago, her gynecologist suggested lifestyle changes such as exercises, nutritional guidance, low doses of oral contraceptive pills, cosmetic therapy, and laser therapy for hirsutism. With the use of oral contraceptive pills, Ms A experienced an improvement in her menstrual cycles, although she continued to have mood swings, irritability, and severe headaches, which were extremely distressing. She was switched to several oral contraceptive pills, but all showed severe side effects. She discontinued all oral contraceptive pills after a few months of use.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Ms A presented for treatment of MDD. Escitalopram—a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, not an oral contraceptive pill—was administered at 5 mg/d, with the dosage reaching 20 mg/d in 3 weeks. After 4 weeks of treatment, Ms A experienced clinically significant depressive symptomatic relief. Remission was achieved in 8 weeks. Over the next 18 months, she continued to receive escitalopram and experienced a return of regular menstrual cycles and improvement in hirsutism. She reported transient mild nausea at the beginning of treatment; no other side effects were reported.\r\n\r\nRemarkably, 2 months after antidepressant discontinuation, she started experiencing menstrual irregularity and hair growth. Ten months later, MDD recurred. During the next 4 years, she was on treatment with escitalopram at 20 mg/d and remained symptom-free. Meanwhile, she achieved notable menstrual cycle improvement and reduction in hirsutism. As Ms A was feeling well, she stopped taking the medication on her own and her menstrual complaints immediately recurred. She restarted escitalopram in 4 months, and her PCOS symptoms remitted again. This was the longest regular menstrual cycle period she had ever had with no use of oral contraceptive pills. Last year, her ultrasounds continued to show polycystic ovaries.\r\n\r\nReports have revealed that hyperandrogenism, hormonal disturbances, obesity, ovarian dysfunction, hypothalamic pituitary abnormalities, and insulin resistance are implicated in the etiology of PCOS.2,3 Hormonal dysregulation is involved with both MDD and PCOS. As mood disorders and PCOS share some level of genetic and pathophysiologic mechanisms,4,5 the intervention on common metabolic changes can treat both conditions.",

      "title": "In vivo exposure treatment for agoraphobia.",
      "abstract": "Agoraphobia is a condition that most often occurs in the context of panic disorder and is characterized by intense fear or anxiety of places or situations in which escape might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of a panic attack or panic-like symptoms (APA, 2000). The purpose of this paper is to examine the behavioral mechanisms that may be responsible for the development and maintenance of the disorder, as well as how the disorder can be treated. In particular, the effective use in vivo exposure is described. Key words: In Vivo Exposure, Agoraphobia, Behavioral Treatments, Anxiety Disorders. ********** Agoraphobia is characterized by intense anxiety or fear of places or situations in which escape might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of a panic attack or panic-like symptoms (APA, 2000). These symptoms may include increased heart rate, sweating, trembling or shaking, shortness of breath, a feeling of choking, chest pain, nausea, dizziness, feelings of derealization or depersonalization, fear of going crazy, fear of dying, numbness or tingling sensations, or chills. The individual develops a fear of dying, losing control, or embarrassing themselves during these panic-like symptoms in a variety of situations such as driving, shopping, being in crowded places, traveling, standing in line, being alone, or attendance of meetings or social gatherings. Mowrer's two-factor theory (1960) proposes to explain the anxiety response based on the principles of both respondent and operant conditioning. Respondent conditioning is believed to have occurred with the pairing of a stimulus that evokes a fear response with stimulus by-products arising from strong bodily somatic sensations. Therefore, bodily sensations become conditioned responses triggered by high levels of private stimulation generated by anxiety and fear. When the individual is confronted with these triggers and the associated aversive emotions, the individual attempts to escape or avoid these triggers. The result may be a reduction in fear and distress and the individual learns through negative reinforcement that escape or avoidance of these cues reduces distress. Some debate exists on the completeness of the respondent conditioning mechanisms involved in the development of panic disorder (Bouton, Mineka, & Barlow, 2001). The debate in part centers on the role of selected cognitive appraisal processes in relation to fear conditioning. Nonetheless, behavioral researchers seem clear on the operant conditioning mechanism in the development of the agoraphobic response. Agoraphobia most often occurs in the context of panic disorder; however, it can become relatively independent of panic attacks (Craske & Barlow, 2001). An individual may not have had a panic response for some time, although the avoidance behaviors associated with agoraphobia remain. Not all persons who have experienced panic attacks or develop panic disorder go on to experience agoraphobia. There has been no evidence that age of onset or frequency of panic predicts an agoraphobic response, however, agoraphobia tends to develop in younger individuals. In a study by Bourden, Boyd, Rae, and Burns, (1988), 74% of the participants had developed agoraphobia before the age of 25. In addition, the likelihood that agoraphobia will develop increases as the length of panic increases (Craske & Barlow, 1988). Panic disorder with agoraphobia is diagnosed three times more often in women than in men (APA, 2000) and this gender difference increases as the severity of the agoraphobic response increases (Craske & Barlow, 1988). It can be challenging to differentiate agoraphobia from a specific phobia. A diagnosis of specific phobia must be considered if the avoidance is limited to one or only a few specific places or situations. Social phobia should be considered if the avoidance behaviors are limited to only social situations and fear of negative evaluation from others. …",

      "title": "The role of depression in coronary artery disease",
      "abstract": "The concept of depression encompasses a series of psychopathological disorders that differ in regard to symptomatology, severity, course and prognosis. It is important to individualize these disorders for a better understanding of the following studies and of their diagnostic management. Major depressive disorder, as defined by CID X 1 and DSM IV , may have different clinical characteristics (table I). A specifier that may be employed in diagnosing the major depressive episode is the presence of melancholic symptoms (melancholia), whose main characteristic is the loss of interest and pleasure in all or almost all activities and a lack of reactivity to usually pleasant stimuli. In these circumstances, the depressive mood does not improve, not even temporarily, when something positive happens. Yet, at least three of the following symptoms should be present for the diagnosis of major depression to be made: depressive mood qualitatively different from the normal, worsening in the morning, terminal insomnia (to wake up at least two hours before the usual time), psychomotor retardation or agitation, anorexia or significant weight loss (5% of the body weight per month), excessive or inappropriate guilt. Sometimes, however, the depressive disorder is atypical with mood reactivity, i.e., enhancement of the mood in response to real or potential positive events, significant weight gain, increase in appetite, hypersomnia, sensation of heaviness in the upper and lower limbs, in addition to a prolonged pattern of sensitivity to interpersonal rejection resulting in significant social or occupational impairment . The dysthymic disorder (dysthymia) is characterized by a chronically depressed mood lasting for most of the day, for the majority of days, and lasting for at least two years . The individual may note significant reduction in usual interests and in self-criticism, frequently seeing himself or herself as uninteresting and incapable. As these symptoms become part of daily life, usually they are not mentioned by the patient unless directly inquired about by Andre Luiz Langer Manica, Carolina Garcia Soares Leaes, Benicio Noronha Frey, Mario Francisco Juruena",

      "abstract": "A 2-year-old, developmentally normal, boy presented with multiple seizure-like events over 10 days. These episodes were described as brief (20–30 s), vacant stares, associated with impaired awareness, hypersalivation, retching, vomiting, tongue thrusts, and pallor of the face and body. A few episodes exhibited tonic posturing of the upper limbs [Figure 1 and https://links.lww.com/IPCR/A7]. Other aspects of history were normal. There was no dysmorphism or neurocutaneous markers. Neurological examination was normal. Cranial Magnetic Resonance Imaging (epilepsy protocol) was normal. The drug-induced sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed multifocal epilepsy with bilateral occipital predominance [Figure 2]. A diagnosis of Self-Limited Epilepsy with Autonomic Seizures (SeLEAS) or \"Panayiotopoulos syndrome\" was made, based on semiology and EEG findings. Seizures stopped within 72 h of starting sodium valproate.Figure 1: The seizure semiology was a vacant stare with impaired awareness associated with hypersalivation, retching, vomiting and tongue thrusting, and pallor of the face and body, lasting for 20–30 s. There was no postictal drowsinessFigure 2: The interictal sleep electroencephalogram record shows frequent sharp wave, spike and slow wave (1–3 Hz, 300–500 microvolt) discharges arising from O1 and O2 with spread to adjacent electrodes, accentuated during photic stimulation. There are independent frequent sharp wave discharges from F3, F4, P3, and FP3 suggestive of multifocal epilepsy with bilateral occipital predominanceSeLEAS is a relatively frequent, benign epileptic syndrome characterized by predominant autonomic symptoms and/or focal onset motor seizures. The former include retching, emesis, changes in color (pallor, flushing, or cyanosis), pupillary dilatation, hypersalivation, cardiorespiratory, and thermoregulatory alterations.[1] Clinicians should be aware of this entity as these events are frequently misdiagnosed as acute encephalitis, syncope, migraine, cyclic vomiting syndrome, motion sickness, sleep disorder, or gastroenteritis.[2] Interictal EEG shows occipital spikes. Multifocal spikes with high amplitude sharp-slow wave complexes can also occur at various locations. Seizures will stop in most children within 2–3 years of the first episode. The risk of developing epilepsy in adulthood is similar to the general population. Anticonvulsant therapy (oxcarbamazepine, valproate, and levetiracetam) are indicated when seizure frequency is high.

The prevalence of akathisia in patients using classical antipsychotics is 20-30% and for users of clozapine, olanzapine and quetiapine (atypical antipsychotics) it is lower. Risk factors are a high dosage of antipsychotics, akathisia in a previous treatment, and diabetes mellitus. The treatment of akathisia starts, if possible, with the antipsychotic being withdrawn or the dose administered being lowered. Another treatment possibility is switching to clozapine, olanzapine or quetiapine, or adding a beta-blocking agent, an anticholinergic or mianserin.",

      "abstract": "Refractory status epilepticus (RSE), defined as status epilepticus that fails to respond to the acute administration of two antiepileptic medications, occurs in approximately a third of patients with status epilepticus, and is associated with increased hospital length of stay, mortality, and functional disability. Common presentations include: (1) generalized convulsive status epilepticus or complex partial status epilepticus that continue despite initial therapies; (2) stupor or coma following a generalized convulsive or complex partial seizure; or (3) stupor or coma following brain surgery or acute brain injury. When status epilepticus continues or recurs 24 hours or more after the initiation of anesthetic therapy, or recurs on the reduction or withdrawal of anesthesia, it is termed super RSE. Published evidence on optimal management of RSE consists largely of case reports or small series. The mainstay of treatment is the administration of anesthetic agents titrated to electrographic seizure control. Adjunctive therapies include hypothermia and immunosuppression and less commonly, surgery, electrical stimulation therapies, and induction of ketosis. Patients with cardiopulmonary complications and prolonged duration of drug-induced coma tend to have worse post-treatment functional outcomes. However, significant improvement over time can occur in survivors, and thus treatment is justified even in patients who require prolonged anesthetic coma. The strongest predictors of outcome are duration of anesthetic coma, etiology, and development of cardiopulmonary complications.",

His symptoms were exacerbated in the wintertime but were not related to meals or sleep. He denied excessive sweating, sensory abnormalities, difficulty with facial or bulbar muscles, and episodes of dark urine. Medical and family history was negative. Cramps and contractures may be identical clinically. The former is more common in neurogenic disease, whereas in myopathies they are more likely to be contractures or myotonia. True cramps occur without provocation. If they are exercise induced (in which the pain has a quasistoichiometric relation to muscle work), they are more suggestive of contractures and suggest abnormal muscle metabolism. Other features of cramps are explosive onset, occurrence in parts of one muscle, occurrence at rest (especially in a muscle in a contracted position) or after triggering movement (either minor or forceful), and relief by passive stretch.",

      "abstract": "Back pain affects most adults, causes disability for some, and is a common reason for seeking healthcare. In the United States, opioid prescription for low back pain has increased, and opioids are now the most commonly prescribed drug class. More than half of regular opioid users report back pain. Rates of opioid prescribing in the US and Canada are two to three times higher than in most European countries. The analgesic efficacy of opioids for acute back pain is inferred from evidence in other acute pain conditions. Opioids do not seem to expedite return to work in injured workers or improve functional outcomes of acute back pain in primary care. For chronic back pain, systematic reviews find scant evidence of efficacy. Randomized controlled trials have high dropout rates, brief duration (four months or less), and highly selected patients. Opioids seem to have short term analgesic efficacy for chronic back pain, but benefits for function are less clear. The magnitude of pain relief across chronic non-cancer pain conditions is about 30%. Given the brevity of randomized controlled trials, the long term effectiveness and safety of opioids are unknown. Loss of long term efficacy could result from drug tolerance and emergence of hyperalgesia. Complications of opioid use include addiction and overdose related mortality, which have risen in parallel with prescription rates. Common short term side effects are constipation, nausea, sedation, and increased risk of falls and fractures. Longer term side effects may include depression and sexual dysfunction. Screening for high risk patients, treatment agreements, and urine testing have not reduced overall rates of opioid prescribing, misuse, or overdose. Newer strategies for reducing risks include more selective prescription of opioids and lower doses; use of prescription monitoring programs; avoidance of co-prescription with sedative hypnotics; and reformulations that make drugs more difficult to snort, smoke, or inject.",

Its use has increased greatly in recent years. The abuse is associated with side effects both physically (endocrine, cardiovascular, liver …) and psychological (anxiety disorders, depression, psychosis, aggression, suicide), in some cases severe and irreversible. Many sports supplements are contaminated with these substances. Methods Based on the exposure of a clinical case, we conducted a systematic review in various databases. Results and case report 25 year old male with no personal or family psychiatric history. It has no history of drug toxicity. Coinciding with a period of major stress (working as a private escort and simultaneously preparing exams for police) he started intensive physical training and sports supplements diet (including anabolic steroids).

      "abstract": "개에서 지속경련증(status epilepticus:SE)이란 30분 이상 동안 경련이 지속되거나, 경련과 경련 사이에 정상적인 의식으로 회복되지 않는 경우를 말한다. 경련이 30분 이상 지속된다면 뇌에는 더 많은 병변이 발생하여 경련은 더 심해질 것이다. 이러한 정의를 임상에 적용하는 것은 의미가 없을 것이다. 따라서 두번째 정의인 경련과 경련 사이에 정상적인 의식으로 회복되지 않는 경우를 임상에 적용하는 것이 더 맞을 것이다. 즉, 경련 후 정상적인 의식으로 회복하지 않는다면 이를 지속경련증으로 판단하면 된다. 또한 지속경련증에 대한 치료를 즉시 시작한다. 본 증례에서 지속경련증이 디아제팜(diazepam)에 반응을 보이지 않았지만, 케타민(ketamine)을 첨가한 후에 경련이 조절되었다.",

      "abstract": "Sudden death is natural death, heralded by loss of consciousness within 1 hour of the onset of acute symptoms. The time and mode of death are unexpected. This definition is meant to satisfy medical and scientific considerations as well legal and social concerns. Included within this construct are four temporal elements: (a) prodromes, (b) onset of terminal event, (c) cardiac arrest, and (d) progression to biological death. Prodromes, if any, are new or worsening symptoms that begin during an arbitrarily defined period of up to 24 hours before the onset of cardiac arrest. The 1-hour time period described in the definition refers to the duration of the terminal event leading to cardiac arrest. Following cardiac arrest – the clinician's synonym for sudden death, biological death may ensue within minutes, or alternatively, due to community-based interventions and life support systems, may be delayed for a long period of time and even aborted altogether. Nonetheless, for legal, forensic, and certain social considerations, biological death is used as the absolute definition of death.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

      "title": "[Pharmacological treatment in alcohol-, drug- and benzodiazepine-dependent patients - the significance of trazodone].",
      "abstract": "Currently detoxification of drug and alcohol dependent patients is pharmacologically unresolved, and long-term treatment following the acute phase is also not very successful including a high number of relapses. We would need medications that on the short term cease: the severe vegetative symptoms, the pain, the extremely distressing psychosyndrome characterised by restlessness, anxiety or acute depressive symptoms, and the craving. The optimal would be if there was one medication capable of simultaneously alleviating or diminishing all the above symptoms without causing dependency and preventing relapse in the long-term. Dependency is almost all cases accompanied by primary and/or secondary mood disorder or sleep disorder which should also be treated. It should be considered, however, that following withdrawal of the agent benzodiazepine dependency often develops. The serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI) trazodone is effective in the treatment of depression accompanied by sleeping disorder and it has also shown efficacy in alcohol and benzodiazepine-dependency. Its administration may improve the efficacy of detoxification and treatment of following conditions, may decrease medication load and the risk of the development of benzodiazepine dependency. In our clinical practice we frequently use this agent to treat our patients simultaneously suffering from depression and addiction problems, gaining experience comparing it to other pharmacotherapies (benzodiazepines or other antidepressants). The medication is not approved for alcohol and drug dependence, however, treatment t of comorbid conditions is not against to the official recommendations. Our aim was, in addition to reviewing the literature, to share our experience which, although cannot be considered an evidence based study, we deemed worthy of publishing. We cannot, at this point, put forward a protocol addressing all related scientific problems and problems of off-label treatment, and we could not so far treat enough patients with trazodone so that our results would be statistically proven. \"Acute\" and long term treatment of dependency is not sufficiently effective with a substantial relapse rate, which is in part related to the lack of specific medication also for long term treatment. Among the available psychopharmacons, trazodone is a possible choice, since, as based on patients' reports and clinical observations, improvement of their depressive conditions and sleep problems potentially decreases the risk of relapse of drug and alcohol dependence.",

Revisão bibliográfica: O TEPT é uma doença psicológica que pode surgir depois que uma pessoa experimenta um ou mais eventos traumáticos, como combate militar, trauma físico devido a lesão ou outros acidentes, como violência doméstica, estupro, trauma de infância, negligência ou abuso. Este se manifesta com sintomas dramáticos de hiperexcitação, lembranças memoriais intrusivas, pesadelos e flashbacks somatossensoriais. É frequentemente acompanhado por comorbidades psiquiátricas, como depressão, abuso de substâncias ou transtornos de ansiedade, o que leva a um alto nível de incapacidade funcional. Considerações finais: O TEPT consiste no desenvolvimento de sintomas relacionados ao estressor após um ou mais eventos traumáticos. Seus sintomas geralmente são classificados em três grupos: intrusão, evitação, e excitação com efeitos preponderantes no sono com insônia e pesadelo. O tratamento farmacológico é feito com Inibidores Seletivos de Recaptação de Serotonina ou Inibidores Seletivos de Recaptação de Norepinefrina, cujos efeitos colaterais são bem tolerados. Nesse sentido, é essencial um diagnóstico precoce e um tratamento multidisciplinar com um médico psiquiatra e um psicólogo a fim de minimizar os impactos do transtorno.",

SummaryRecently there has been an increase in the use of lysergide (lysergic acid diethylamide; L.S.D.) obtained illicitly.Adverse reactions are not uncommon, and six (two fatal) cases are reported.I am grateful to Professor F.

It can be related to opioid therapy and/or medical conditions. After abdominal examination to detect masses or evidence of bowel obstruction and rectal examination to exclude fecal impaction, constipation should be managed with a stimulant laxative (eg, senna) or an osmotic laxative (eg, sorbitol). Dyspnea also is common, and often improves with use of a fan to blow air into the face, as well with breathing and relaxation exercises. However, many patients require titrated doses of opioids to address respiratory depression, and anxiolytics such as haloperidol may be needed to manage dyspnea-related anxiety. Oxygen typically is not effective in dyspnea management in nonhypoxemic patients at the end of life. Cough is managed with antitussives. Nausea and vomiting occur in 70% of patients in palliative care units. If no reversible etiology can be identified, dopamine antagonists and motility-enhancing drugs can be used. There are no clearly effective treatments to manage noisy respiratory secretions, but position change, decrease in fluid intake, and drugs such as scopolamine or glycopyrrolate may be effective.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

Serotonin syndrome is not an idiosyncratic drug reaction. methamphetamine is a psycho stimulant drug which produces increased wakefulness and focus in association with decreased fatigue and appetite. A methamphetamine overdose is rarely fatal but can lead to a number of different symptoms, including psychosis, chest pain, and hypertension. It is among agents with moderate potency to produce Serotonin syndrome. Here we present the first reported case of serotonin syndrome after a single ingestion of high dose methamphetamine (body staffer of 2gr amphetamine) in 28 year-old previously healthy man without any drug history, 2 hours prior to admission. Clinical manifestation included hyperthermia, hypertension, tachycardia, sweating, dilated pupil, agitation, overactive reflexes (greater in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs) and clonus. complete blood count was normal except for severely elevated white blood cell count of 22.3 ×103/µL (22.3 ×10 9 /L) with 74% neutrophils and 24% lymphocytes. His serum blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, liver function tests, and electrolytes were normal. Mildly elevation in Serum creatinine kinas was seen. Coagulation studies and Urine analysis were normal. Serum glucose was 210 mg/dL. An arterial blood gas shows respiratory alkalosis. We intubated him by Rapid Sequence Intubation (RSI) method and then took an emergent abdominal CT scan for any need for surgical intervention; we admitted him in ICU ward and did supportive care including the control of agitation, hyperthermia and autonomic instability. After 2 days we could extubate him and after 5days he discharged from hospital. clonus in moderate cases may be greater in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs. Mental status changes include hyper vigilance and agitation (1). Severe symptoms include severe increases in heart rate and blood pressure that may lead to shock. Temperature may rise to above 41.1 °C (106.0 °F) in life-threatening cases. Other abnormalities include metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, seizure, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation; these effects usually arise as a consequence of hyperthermia (1,3).",

      "abstract": "1) Reserpine is a remarkable and useful drug. It has a definite place in psychiatry for the alleviation of selected symptoms. It is not in any sense a psychic “specific”. 2) The physiologic effects of this drug are relatively constant. The principal ones are a fall in blood pressure, a relative bradycardia, and in adequate dosage, a slowing of the patient's spontaneous activity; feelings of weakness, tiredness and of being held down. 3) There are other effects, which are predominantly psychological and it is felt that they have nothing to do with the physiological effects per se. They are the result of the way in which the physiological action fits into the patient's way of handling and expressing his conflict (i.e. defenses). When a patient does badly it is due to the way in which the physiological effects psychologically threaten the patient. A patient does well or badly depending on this, and we have seen enhanced anxiety as well as psychoses produced by both reserpine and chlorpromazine (8). 4) Because of the above, psychotherapeutic efforts are of the greatest importance, and when used, usually overshadow the effects of the drug. We feel that no patient is treated in a vacuum. Milieu and relationship is what counts most. The other factors, though important, are adjuvants. 5) A level of 10 to 40 mg./day will control most motor over-activity. Anxiety and most panics can be handled at between 2 and 10 mg./day. The average daily dose was 7 mg./day. The average length of treatment was 26 days. 6) Side effects are frequent, but are rapidly reversible. There were no serious or irreversible toxic effects. The drug is remarkably safe. 7) Reserpine is of about the same usefulness as chlorpromazine in psychiatry. Chlorpromazine is quicker acting. Reserpine is safer. When the G.I. tract is irritated or the site of symptoms, chlorpromazine is preferable. Cardiac or cardiovascular symptomatology might indicate a preference for reserpine, especially when bradycardia is desirable. Neither is a “specific” curative agent. Both are useful for the symptomatic relief of selected symptoms. Both have their contra indications. Neither is an effective substitute for intimate human contact with the patient. Both should be used along with psychotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol withdrawal syndrome is the most serious complications associated with chronic alcoholism. Sudden deaths are not uncommon in an Alcohol withdrawal syndrome. In severe stages of Alcohol withdrawal syndrome, delirium tremens occurs, which is characterized with agitation, confusion, disorientation, visual and auditory hallucinations in addition to autonomic hyperactivity. A 36-year-old male chronic and heavy alcohol drinker for 15 years abstained from alcohol for 3 days. Consequently, he started having palpitations, sweating and tremors with the complaints of nausea, vomiting, reduced appetite, disturbed sleep, headache, restlessness, fatigue, constipation as alcohol withdrawal symptoms. There were no\r\npsychotic symptoms, no suicidal ideas, and no obsessions or compulsions. He was treated on an outpatient level with combination of Ayurvedic internal medications and procedures for 60 days and is on follow up till date. The patient was treated with kharjuradi manth, ashvagandha churna, vidharigandha churna, muktashukti, drakashaasav, Brahmi vati, syrup shankhpushpi, taruni kusmakar churna & procedures like Shirodhara with Brahmi Him & nasya with jatamansi tail. The treatment approaches to improve the condition of a patient with improvement in sign and symptoms of alcohol dependence, alcohol withdrawal and to increase metabolism. The resulting assessment is done based on the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol revised scale (CIWA-Ar score) and the Questionnaire. After the comprehensive Ayurvedic intervention, there was a complete remission of symptoms with normal hematological parameters. Hence presenting this case is evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of Ayurvedic treatment in Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome.",

Severe withdrawal dyskinesia, mixed with dystonia and akathisia, was noted immediately after the dosage reduction. The abnormal involuntary movement showed improvement 2 weeks later when the dosage was increased to 100 mg/day.Withdrawal dyskinesia and other abnormal involuntary movements could be noted in a patient with reduction of amisulpride dosage or sudden termination.

To achieve and maintain pain relief many of the patients received diamorphine (heroin) regularly every four hours. Almost all the patients received a phenothiazine concurrently; other drugs were prescribed when indicated. It was concluded that: 1) Although most patients receive parenteral diamorphine during the last 12 to 24 hours, the majority can be maintained on oral medication until this time. 2) There is no single optimal dose of diamorphine. 3) Psychological dependence does not occur. 4) Physical dependence may develop but does not prevent the downward adjustment of the dose of diamorphine when considered clinically feasible. 5) Tolerance is not a practical problem. 6) The prescription of diamorphine does not, by itself, lead to impairment of mental faculties. Also discussed are: 1) the psychobiological nature of pain; 2) the rational use of analgesics; 3) the need for further research; 4) the importance of the doctor's attitude.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Delirium is acute onset &amp; fluctuating disturbance in mental state that causes patient appear confused, disoriented or with difficulty to focus and with decline in cognitive function (memory, orientation, speech), circadian disturbance and behavior of patient either agitated or sleepy,in other words sudden confusion. Delirium, also known as acute confusional state, is an organically-caused decline from a previously baseline level of mental function that develops over a short period of time (hours to days). Delirium is not a disease itself, but a syndrome encompassing disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. It may also involve other neurological deficits, like psychomotor disturbances (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed), impaired sleepwake cycle, emotional disturbances, and perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations and delusions). Objective To determine incidence of post-operative delirium in geriatric patients undergoing hip replacement surgery using pre-operative haloperidol. Patients and Methods This study is conducted through geriatric patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and the incidence of pre.&amp; post-operative delirium. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted post-operative surgical ICU in Demerdash hospital which was closed unit and had the same well-established pain, sedation and delirium assessment practices. A delirium was monitored through CAM score in their stay in ICU (max. for &amp;7 days from admission post-operative). Results Several trials stated that the usage of Haloperidol pre-operative decrease the duration and the severity of Delirium rather than the incidence of delirium. In our trial we will detect the incidence of delirium with using prophylactic haloperidol in geriatric patients undergoing Hip replacement surgery. In our study revealed that using prophylactic pre-operative haloperidol decrease the incidence of delirium among geriatric patient as well as decreasing both the duration and the severity of delirium among the study group. Conclusion Our study and results revealed that Haloperidol as antipsychotic drug have beneficial effect on reduction of incidence of delirium in post-operative geriatric patients, also it showed effect on duration of delirium and severity of the disease as well as ICU stay.",

One of the direct consequences is poorer quality sleep. It has also been proven that sleep-related symptoms correspond to significant changes in the respiratory center, airway resistance, and muscle contractility. The main sleep disorder that these patients may present is Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS), which is characterized by repetitive airway obstruction during sleep with complete or partial cessation of airflow. This alteration can have effects on the circadian rhythm of the sleep-wake cycle, such as a desynchronization of the light-dark cycle or endogenously desynchronized, resulting in: insomnia, fatigue, and poor performance in daily activities and symptoms such as insomnia or hypersomnia, common in patients with circadian sleep disorders, although there are other causes to which they can be attributed and that must be excluded before making the diagnosis of a circadian sleep disorder. In a patient without another sleep pathology, a daily record of activities, meals, exercise, naps, and bedtime is an essential tool to evaluate circadian sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "We report here a case of serotonin syndrome (SS) following initiation of venlafaxine 2 weeks after withdrawal of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), phenelzine, and also following repeated retrials of venlafaxine initiation. The case has clinically important implications regarding the period of time necessary for monoamine oxidase biosynthesis following use of an irreversible MAOI.\r\n\r\nSS is characterized by the presence of autonomic nervous system symptoms (such as hyperthermia, diaphoresis, mydriasis, nausea, shivering, hypertension, tachycardia, and diarrhoea), mental status changes (such as agitation, hypomania, and confusion), and neuromuscular abnormalities (such as myoclonus, incoordination, hyperreflexia, tremors, clonus, and muscle rigidity [Sternbach, 2003]). SS can be a life-threatening condition and occurs acutely due to markedly increased serotonin levels in brain, often following a coprescription or overdose of serotonergic drugs. These drugs can increase serotonin levels by inhibiting metabolism (such as MAOI), increasing formation (such as l-tryptophan), inhibiting reuptake (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), or tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)), increase release (such as amphetamines) or increasing postsynaptic receptor sensitivity (such as lithium). Overdose with a SSRI alone results in mild SS in about 15% of people but does not usually lead to severe toxicity [Isbister et al. 2007]. The occurrence of the syndrome is highest with a combination of SSRIs and MAOIs, though it is also reported with other serotonergic drug combinations.\r\n\r\nSternbach described criteria to diagnose SS (Table 1) and highlighted the importance of identifying it since it is usually reversible following discontinuation of the offending drug(s), supportive treatment and addition of a serotonin antagonist (such as cyproheptadine or chlorpromazine) in more severe cases [Sternbach, 1991]. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1.\r\n\r\nSternbach’s criteria [Modified after Sternbach 1991].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere have been previous case reports of patients who experienced an SS when a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) has been introduced after the traditionally recommended 2-week washout from an irreversible MAOI [Sternbach, 2003]. However, we have been unable to identify any instance in the literature where a patient has been rechallenged with a SRI (such as an SSRI, SNRI or a TCA) after a further period of washout following the occurrence of SS.",

      "title": "Classification of fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease",
      "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson9s disease (PD) are subject to a wide range of fluctuations in their clinical state, most of them treatment-related but some more disease-related. Short-duration motor fluctuations include freezing and paradoxic kinesis, lasting seconds to minutes. It is important to distinguish between \"off\" period freezing, which may be helped by measures to increase time \"on,\" and freezing that is present in both \"on\" and \"off\" periods, which is difficult if not impossible to treat. Medium-duration fluctuations associated with chronic L-dopa treatment include wearing-off and \"on-off\" responses, which can involve (a) return of parkinsonism, (b) dyskinesias, and(c) non-motor fluctuations. A poorly understood long-duration pharmacodynamic response to L-dopa lasting up to 2 weeks may also be seen. This may manifest as late deterioration after L-dopa is withdrawn. More importantly, and more commonly, it is important to recognize that the ultimate effect of an alteration in L-dopa treatment may take 2 weeks to equilibrate in the brain.\"Optimization\" of L-dopa therapy is therefore not a realistic expectation during an inpatient admission and is instead primarily a long-term outpatient procedure. The \"off\" state is not the same as untreated PD, and may represent rebound worsening after the beneficial effect of L-dopa has worn off. Sometimes there is also transient worsening at the onset of effect of a dose.\"Off\" period dyskinesias tend to be relatively fixed, painful, and dystonic. Biphasic (beginning and/or end of dose) dyskinesias are often severe, ballistic, and stereotypic. Peak dose or \"square wave\" dyskinesias comprise a mix of mobile dystonia or chorea that is usually painless. Many patients experience any combination of panic, anxiety, and depression in their \"off\" periods, and many also experience pain, with instant relief as they turn\"on.\" Other parameters that may vary between the \"on\" and \"off\" states include urinary and bowel dysfunction, blood pressure, respiratory function, and sweating attacks. Most but not all of these phenomena can be related to a simplistic but nevertheless usually practically useful model of differing levels of central dopaminergic stimulation. In difficult cases, an acute apomorphine challenge analogous to the effects of a \"Tensilon test\" in myasthenia gravis may help to determine whether a given clinical feature represents over- or understimulation of central dopamine receptors.",

The cause of transient global amnesia is unknown, and the various hypotheses that have been put forward (e.g. epilepsy, transient ischaemia or migraine) have not been confirmed by clinical and epidemiological studies.

If adrenalin may be injected, it would prove an increase invariably; in case atropine is applied, a drop in activity will occur in the schizophrenic group, while various attitude may take place among the non-schizophrenic groupes.

      "abstract": "Simplistic concepts which label a drug as an anesthetic, excitant, hallucinogen, convulsant, anticonvulsant, etc., can be extremely misleading. For example, one could label diethyl ether as a stimulant, euphoriant, hallucinogen or anesthetic. Each description partly characterizes ether at some dose/time period but does not describe the totality of drug action. Another example is phenytoin, which is universally considered to be an anticonvulsant agent, but can induce seizures at high doses. Further, the argument that one action is 'the' desired effect and other actions are side effects is likewise misleading. The decision as to which is a desired effect and which is side effect depends upon the desired effect. For example, ophthalmologists dilate the pupil of the eye and paralyze accommodation with atropine. They regard the dry mouth and reduced bladder and gastrointestinal tract excitability as side effects. However, the urologist or gastroenterologist uses atropine because of the latter effects and considers the effects on the eyes to be the side effects. A more satisfactory approach to drug classification would be to describe the continuum of total drug actions which occur according to the dose and time course of effects. The advent of the excessive nonmedical use of drugs makes this réévaluation of central nervous system (CNS) acting drug classes critical.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: - Fatigue can be defined as an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained exhaustion that makes it harder to carry out activities and function Fatigue describes a state of tiredness or exhaustion. Fatigue is an important symptom in academics due to its association with physical, psychological and social problems and the employee health, performance, safety and general workability continues to grow. Research has shown that fatigue may result from some health and work-related factors, particularly a poor health status, long work hours and extended-duration work shifts. INTRODUCTION: - Fatigue is a state of physical or mental weariness, often accompanied by a reduced capacity to perform tasks effectively. It is characterized by a sensation of tiredness, exhaustion, and a lack of energy, which can result from various factors, including prolonged physical or mental exertion, insufficient rest or sleep, illness, stress, and other physical or psychological conditions. The need for a study aimed to investigate the prevalence of fatigue in female academicians by using a reliable self-completion tool that can measure subjective condition, either in extreme clinical cases or in routine day-to-day functioning, has never been greater. METHODOLOGY: - An observational study was conducted in Ahmadabad city. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee. The Chalder Fatigue Scale was used to assess symptoms of fatigue. Questioner method was used to collect data. Each question was scored by female academicians. Sample size of hundred participants including the female academicians. RESULT: - The result was carried out by using Microsoft excel 2016. Out of hundred sample size 38% middle aged female academicians had fatigue. The mean age was 34.43 years. CONCLUSION: - This study concludes that there is need to reduce fatigue among the female academicians. Clinical implementation: - There is a need to plan a proper treatment protocol and advice for female academicians to reduce the fatigue. Key words: Chadler Fatigue Scale, Female Academicians, Fatigue.",

      "abstract": "Benzodiazepines have anxiolytic, hypnotic, anticonvulsant, and muscle-relaxing properties, therefore, a widely prescribed treatment for anxiety and insomnia. They bind to gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors, which are responsible for most of the inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system and these receptors are a major target of alcohol, barbiturates, muscle relaxants, and other medications with sedative effects, resulting in tolerance and dependence [1]. Benzodiazepines are categorized into short (15 to 30 minutes), intermediate (30 to 60 minutes), and long-acting agents (one hour or longer).\r\nBenzodiazepines are frequently prescribed for elderly patients living in the community and for those in hospitals and institutions. Prolonged use of benzodiazepines is particularly likely in old age for the treatment not only of insomnia and anxiety, but also of a wide range of nonspecific symptoms. Long term users are likely to have multiple concomitant physical and psychological health problems [2].\r\nBenzodiazepines produce dependence, reduce attention, memory, and motor ability. They can cause disinhibition or aggressive behavior, facilitate the appearance of delirium, and increase accident and mortality rates in people older than 60 [3].\r\nAccording to Maudsley guidelines, benzodiazepines use in elderly are poorly supported for their link to cognitive decline, increase risk of falls and hip fractures [4]. And, if indicated, short acting agents should be avoided. Long acting agents should be started in low doses and patients need to be followed and reassessed regularly. Zolpidem or melatonin are indicated for insomnia, clonazepam and diazepam for agitation and pregabalin for generalized anxiety disorder [5].",

      "abstract": "A enxaqueca ou migrânea é definida como uma cefaleia primária que surgi a partir de crises que são acompanhadas geralmente por náusea, fotofobia, hiperacusia, sensibilidade a odores e vômitos. Em algumas pessoas, a enxaqueca pode ser antecedida por sintomas como parestesia, afasia, vertigens e escotoma. Essa condição é denominada como aura, também podendo ser encontrada em outras patologias, como a epilepsia. Considera-se a enxaqueca como uma das vinte doenças mais debilitantes e pode-se relacionar o uso inadequado de medicamentos, absenteísmo, diminuição da produtividade e mudança de humor como fatores impactantes. Tendo na população, uma prevalência de 5-25% em mulheres e 2-10% em homens, sendo que no curso de medicina é de 8,5%. As crises podem ser desencadeadas por fatores ambientais, emocionais ou dietéticos, por exemplo, a mudança de temperatura, alterações hormonais, excesso de exercício físico, automedicação, poluição, uso de contraceptivos, alergias, depressão, queijos e vinho, dentre outros. A vida acadêmica, principalmente no curso de medicina, proporciona inúmeros fatores desencadeantes, como o alto nível de estresse e exigência, acarretando limitações no rendimento durante as crises. O tratamento das crises é feito de maneira emergencial na maioria dos casos, sendo que os pacientes com crises frequentes apresentam geralmente tolerância aos analgésicos comuns. Pacientes com aumento progressivo na frequência de crises, ocorrência de crise uma ou mais vezes por mês, incapacitação devido à dor ou abuso medicamentoso para tratar as crises são recomendados a fazerem tratamento profilático, tratamento que apresenta uma variedade de contraindicações e efeitos colaterais, não sendo eficazes em todos os casos. O objetivo deste trabalho é verificar a prevalência da enxaqueca nos estudantes do curso de medicina do UniFOA e constatar a necessidade da analgesia ao catalogar os principais fármacos utilizados e sua eficácia associada aos principais efeitos colaterais.",

      "abstract": "Bronchial asthma is a distressing and common form of acute, recurrent, or chronic bronchial inflammation and obstructive emphysema, usually of allergic origin. The acute paroxysm of bronchial asthma may last for hours or recur in varying degrees of severity for days. Finally, a state of intractable asthma, during which the episode is continuous and refractory to treatment, may result. In this state the patient presents a picture of marked physiological imbalance. Evidence of hypoxia, cyanosis, dehydration, disturbed psyche, peripheral vascular collapse, and further disturbances may be noted because of changes induced by the widespread use of drug therapy. Death is more commonly due to asphyxia resulting from the plugged and obliterated bronchi and bronchioles and from oversedation; it is also due to the failure of endogenous discharge of adrenal hormones necessary in the defense mechanism against stress, and, in more recent years, particularly to steroid sequelae.

      "abstract": "AbstractOveractive bladder (OAB) is a chronic, distressing condition characterised by symptoms of urgency (sudden overwhelming urge to urinate) and frequency (urinating more than eight times daily), with or without urge urinary incontinence (sudden involuntary loss of urine). It affects millions of people of all ages and both sexes world wide, with greater prevalence in women and the elderly. The treatment of OAB is aimed at reducing debilitating symptoms, which have a significant effect on all aspects of an individual’s quality of life, including social, domestic, psychological, occupational, physical and sexual functioning. Anticholinergic agents are currently recommended as first-line therapy for OAB. Their use results in significant clinical improvement in patients, although a lack of selectivity for receptors in the bladder may lead to troublesome side effects, including dry mouth, blurred vision, somnolence, dizziness and constipation. Recent research efforts have focused on developing drugs with a reduced propensity for causing these problems. Of the available anticholinergic agents, oxybutynin and tolterodine are the most widely used to treat OAB. Studies directly comparing tolterodine immediate-release (IR) with oxybutynin IR have shown that the two agents have similar efficacy. However, tolterodine IR is significantly better tolerated, particularly with respect to the incidence and severity of dry mouth. An extended-release formulation of tolterodine (4 mg capsules) has recently been developed to allow for once-daily dosing. In addition to greater convenience, tolterodine extended-release has shown enhanced efficacy and tolerability compared with tolterodine IR.Keywordsantimuscarinic drugsoveractive bladderoxybutynin chloridetolterodine tartrateurinary incontinence",

      "abstract": "Introduction Alcohol and illicit drug use and associated problems within the adolescent population continue to be a great concern. Accidental death and injury in this age group frequently is alcohol- or drug-related. Venturesomeness and impulsiveness combined with alcohol can produce disastrous results. Alcohol use is more likely to cause an adolescent to be sexually irresponsible, which can lead to sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy. There has been an alarming growth in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive rates recently among the adolescent population. Finally, teenagers who abuse alcohol are more likely to drop out of school, thus damaging their long-term employment prospects. Definition The American Psychiatric Association in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM IV) defines alcohol dependence, a substance use disorder, as a maladaptive pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress as manifested by three of the following seven symptoms occurring during the same 12-month period: tolerance; withdrawal; use greater than intended; inability to cease use; time-consuming activities associated with use; social, occupational, or recreational dysfunction; and continued use despite knowledge of physical or psychological problems. Abuse is defined as one or more of the following: failure to fulfill major roles at home or school, recurrent use in hazardous situations, recurrent legal problems, and use despite persistent social or interpersonal problems.",

      "abstract": "Clozapine alleviates Mr. B's schizophrenia symptoms, but he develops anxieties that leave him virtually homebound. Is antipsychotic to blame? CASE Disabling anxiety Mr. B, age 35, has a history of schizophrenia, chronic paranoid type and has been hospitalized more than 12 times since its onset 10 years ago. He received clozapine during his most recent hospitalization approximately 5 years ago and experienced full symptom response without motor side effects he developed in response to other medications. He visits a psychiatrist monthly for medications and supportive psychotherapy, and he receives intensive case management and housing from a community mental health center. When Mr. B is assigned to my (CK) care, his psychotic symptoms are in remission, but he complains of anxiety that leaves him almost homebound. He has intense fear of bridges, upper-floor windows, express buses, subways, riding in speeding vehicles, and having a seizure. If Mr. B faces any of these triggers, he experiences harmful thoughts--such as jumping out a window or off a bridge--even though he does not endorse suicidality. These thoughts are intrusive, ego-dystonic, and ruminative. He avoids these triggers at all costs, which compromises his housing and employment opportunities. He experienced a single panic attack in subway 1 year earlier. Mr. B firmly believes that any intense anxiety he experiences will trigger a psychotic episode. When faced with sudden urges, he believes his illness would interfere with his ability to his impulses. He reports that these symptoms started when he began clozapine and have worsened. Mr. B says he experiences a feeling of approximately 2 hours after taking clozapine that is exacerbated if he faces a trigger. He describes uneasiness as the feeling of being about to have a seizure during which he would lose control of his body. When I begin treating Mr. B, he is receiving clozapine, 125 mg bid. In an effort to combat Mr. B's anxiety, a previous psychiatrist had titrated clonazepam up to 5 mg/d as needed. Mr. B is compliant with his medications and appointments but refuses to change his psychotropic or psychotherapy regimen. The authors'observations Approximately 50% of patients with schizophrenia have at least 1 anxiety disorder, and close to 30% meet criteria for >1 anxiety disorder. (1) Social anxiety disorder (SAD), generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have been found comorbid with schizophrenia, with rates as high as 30% for each. (1) Possible causes of unusually high rates of anxiety disorders in schizophrenia include trauma history, delusional conviction and inflexibility of abstract thought, (2) and passive coping mechanisms. Schizophrenic illnesses may be linked to anxiety antecedents such as panic or social phobia that: * develop into more profound psychopathology * or bring about anxiety symptoms, given severity of subjective psychotic experience. In a twin pairs study, schizophrenic twin had an almost threefold increase in rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders compared with their non-schizophrenic twins; social or environmental factors may not account for this. (3) Comorbid OCD, panic disorder, and SAD frequently persist after remission of psychotic symptoms. Comorbid anxiety disorders may play a role in psychotic symptoms themselves (such as panic and social anxiety related to paranoia, OCD, and bizarre behavior) and negatively impact quality of life. (4) In patients with schizophrenia, higher anxiety levels are associated with: * increased hallucinations * poor psychosocial function * hopelessness. (5) Accurately assessing and diagnosing anxiety disorders in patients with schizophrenia is challenging because there is inconsistency among clinical interviewers (poor reliability scores), and anxiety scales are not as accurate as we would like them to be (poor construct validity). …",

Ils se plaignent rarement de dépression, mais surtout d'un sentiment de \"vide\" et de tension. Ils sont sujets à des changements d'humeur subits et imprévisibles, ce qui se traduit par une forte tendance de la part des médecins, à diagnostiquer des désordres de la personnalité en termes souvent péjoratifs. Ces patients ont souvent des intérêts médicaux importants ou des occupations paramédicales. Plusieurs d'entre eux se plaignent de symptômes d'inappétence (anoxérie ou excès d'appétit ou encore des combinaisons de l'une et de l'autre), d'usage de la drogue ou d'abus de l'alcool; ils sont portés aux troubles sexuels, à l'angoisse, à la promiscuité. Ils éprouvent plus fréquemment des réaction négatives à la puberté et à la menstruation; ils sont issus de foyer désuni et ont souffert de carence parentale. Une proportion de ce groupe éprouve des difficultés dans la communication verbale. Une tendance marquée à s'évader de l'hôpital se retrouve chez les malades hospitalises pour automutilation. La réaction typique est la suivante: une fois la blessure infligée, et après une période de dépersonnalisation suivit de détente et de repersonnalisation provoquée par le saignement, le patient n'éprouve aucune douleur.",

      "abstract": "A minority of headache patients have a secondary headache disorder. The medical literature presents and promotes red flags to increase the likelihood of identifying a secondary etiology. In this review, we aim to discuss the incidence and prevalence of secondary headaches as well as the data on sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of red flags for secondary headaches. We review the following red flags: (1) systemic symptoms including fever; (2) neoplasm history; (3) neurologic deficit (including decreased consciousness); (4) sudden or abrupt onset; (5) older age (onset after 65 years); (6) pattern change or recent onset of new headache; (7) positional headache; (8) precipitated by sneezing, coughing, or exercise; (9) papilledema; (10) progressive headache and atypical presentations; (11) pregnancy or puerperium; (12) painful eye with autonomic features; (13) posttraumatic onset of headache; (14) pathology of the immune system such as HIV; (15) painkiller overuse or new drug at onset of headache. Using the systematic SNNOOP10 list to screen new headache patients will presumably increase the likelihood of detecting a secondary cause. The lack of prospective epidemiologic studies on red flags and the low incidence of many secondary headaches leave many questions unanswered and call for large prospective studies. A validated screening tool could reduce unneeded neuroimaging and costs.",

      "abstract": "When alcohol abuse occurs with depression, both the substance abuse and the mood disorder necessitate treatment. These conditions may have some similar manifestations, making differential diagnosis difficult. Depressed alcoholics report more previous treatment for substance abuse, withdrawal symptoms, and marital problems than those without depression. They also incur greater loneliness, unemployment, and social ineptness. Depressive symptoms found commonly in this group include work inhibition, guilt, self-disgust, dissatisfaction, and social disinterest. A history of depression among relatives favors a dual diagnosis of alcoholism and depression. Distinguishing those alcoholics with specific depressive illness enhances the therapeutic efficacy. Alcohol abusers need treatment, but those with concomitant depression persisting well beyond detoxification often require antidepressant medications. In long-term care, lithium may reduce alcohol-related rehospitalizations. A strong doctor-patient relationship with or without pharmacotherapy promotes continuation in a therapeutic regimen. Involvement in Alcoholics Anonymous and disulfiram maintenance therapy are other deterrents to drinking relapse.",

Perceptual alteration showed some distinct features that were different from acute symptoms of schizophrenia, and was accompanied by mood changes such as severe anxiety and agitation and, in one of the patients, also by extrapyramidal symptoms. Perceptual alteration, as well as mood changes and extrapyramidal symptoms, responded well to an anticholinergic drug, biperiden. Recent studies have shown that SEPA occurred not only in schizophrenic patients but also in patients on long‐term neuroleptic medication for treating other mental disorders. These findings suggest that SEPA is associated with dopaminergic hypoactivity in the brain, which is induced by long‐term neuroleptic medication.",

It can be primary or secondary, signs and symptoms of which include exorbitant daytime sleepiness, irregular breathing or increased movement during sleep and difficulty falling asleep. A few outcomes of sleep loss are obesity in adults and children, diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, anxiety symptoms, depressed mood and alcohol use. Sleep disorders are frequently associated with psychiatric issues particularly depression. Studies have demonstrated that individuals with a sleeping disorder have a ten times risk of having depression in contrast to individuals who rest soundly. OSA is also linked with depression. SSRIs which increase 5-HT function increase REM sleep latency, and reduce REM sleep. Some individuals show significant improvements in depressive symptoms following a night of incomplete or complete lack of sleep, leading physicians to consider using sleep deprivation as an intervention. Antidepressants and other treatments for depression can have a beneficial effect on sleep. There is a need to evaluate for primary somnipathies, any medications being taken and underlying medical, psychiatric or substance use disorder.",

      "title": "Toxicology Rounds",
      "abstract": "APAP, Tylenol: APAP, TylenolFigureAll emergency physicians and medical toxicologists learn the stages of acute acetaminophen (APAP) toxicity, but there is more here than meets the eye. The first stage, 24 hours after ingestion, mainly consists of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. These manifestations begin several hours after ingestion, and abate as the patient appears to improve. Symptomatic improvement continues during the second stage (24-48 hours), but the alert clinician will look for right upper quadrant tenderness and elevation of liver enzymes, bilirubin, and the INR representing progressive hepatic injury. The patient starts to exhibit signs of acute liver failure—altered mental status, metabolic acidosis, jaundice, and coagulopathy—in the third stage (48-96 hours). It is only about two days after acute ingestion that the patient appears to be critically ill. The patient either dies or recovers completely without liver transplantation during the fourth stage. The chance for complete recovery increases if good supportive care and the antidote N-acetylcysteine (NAC) are provided. We know that severe manifestations of acute APAP toxicity are typically altered mental status and metabolic acidosis resulting from hepatic failure caused by the toxic metabolite NAPQI. The so-called massive acetaminophen overdose, however, can have a different time course and a different mechanism. (See my previous column, “N-Acetylcysteine and Acetaminophen Toxicity: Two Common Misconceptions,” EMN 2004;26[3]:28; http://bit.ly/2f4E30C.) A recent report from Australia vividly illustrates this point. A 21-year-old woman came to the hospital 13 hours after acutely ingesting as much as 239 g of paracetamol (acetaminophen). (Eur J Emerg Med 2016;23[6]:460.) She was agitated and confused, with her consciousness waxing and waning. Tests revealed a metabolic acidosis with elevated anion gap, along with an elevated serum lactate level (11.3 mmol/L) that persisted even after fluid repletion. The serum alanine transferase level was 43 IU/L. Her INR was only slightly elevated at 1.5. The initial paracetamol level was huge: 723 mg/ml. The patient was intubated for airway protection, and was treated with NAC and continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration. She was extubated on hospital day six and transferred to psychiatry on day 10 after complete clinical recovery. The authors noted that acetaminophen can directly poison mitochondria, impairing oxidative phosphorylation. This may occur to some extent even with APAP levels below those considered hepatotoxic. This mechanism becomes clinically significant after massive ingestion. Patients can present with early metabolic (lactic) acidosis and altered mental status typically within 12-18 hours of acute ingestion and before onset of clinically evident hepatotoxicity. Watch Out for CYP2E1 Some toxicologists suggest specific definitions of massive acetaminophen ingestion based on the amount of APAP ingested or the serum level, but I prefer an approach based on presentation. You should suspect massive ingestion if a patient fits the clinical picture after taking an eye-popping amount of acetaminophen or has a level that makes your jaw drop. Of course, other causes of metabolic acidosis and altered mental status such as sepsis should also be considered. The Extracorporeal Treatments in Poisoning Workgroup suggested that hemodialysis may provide benefit in massive APAP ingestions by accelerating acetaminophen clearance and correcting acidosis. (Clin Toxicol [Phila] 2014;52[8]:856.) It will also remove NAC, so the infusion rate of the antidote should be increased during the procedure. Your local poison center can provide specific guidance. Other factors may alter the typical time course and presentation of APAP toxicity. Our service consulted on a case many years ago of a young woman who presented 13 hours after a well-documented history of ingesting 12 g of acetaminophen. She already had manifestations of acute hepatic injury. The patient was taking isoniazid (300 mg daily) for tuberculosis prophylaxis, and it induces CYP2E1, the hepatic enzyme primarily responsible for converting APAP to NAPQI. Normally, less than five percent of a therapeutic APAP dose is metabolized by CYP2E1 to NAPQI, and this is easily detoxified by hepatic glutathione before it can injure liver cells. In overdose, significantly more NAPQI is formed, glutathione stores are depleted, and NAPQI attacks and kills hepatocytes. We hypothesized that enzyme induction caused by isoniazid accelerated and increased the production of NAPQI in our patient, resulting in an early onset of hepatotoxicity. Murphy, et al., published a remarkably similar case report. (Ann Intern Med 1990;113[10]:799.) St. John's Wort, an over-the-counter herbal preparation used to treat depression, is also an inducer of CYP2E1. I also know of a case of life-threatening hepatotoxicity in a patient taking only a slightly supratherapeutic dose of acetaminophen—5 g daily for four or five days—in combination with an opiate for post-surgical pain and a daily dose of St. John's Wort. This is anecdotal, but I strongly suspect that the herbal product contributed to the severe liver failure, but I know of no published cases describing APAP toxicity in patients taking St. John's Wort. We still do not know everything about APAP toxicity despite decades of experience and study. Some patients who take a modest supratherpeutic overdose develop life-threatening hepatotoxicity. Many others do not. Genetics no doubt play a role. But if the severity of liver injury is out of proportion to the dose of APAP taken, other drugs may be involved, such as primadone and phenobarbital, which might enhance APAP toxicity but not induce CYP2E1. Rather, they inhibit the main nontoxic metabolic pathways such as sulfonation and glucuronidation, shunting more APAP through CYP2E1. The result is the same: more NAPQI.",

      "abstract": "Varying resistance to psychotherapy occurred in patients fantasying that the rapid removal of depressions was effected by a “miracle drug” which could be relied upon for “magical” solutions to future problems. Most patients easily transferred their desires for assistance from the medication to the psychotherapist who prescribed it (and might possibly have to do so again). The administration of adrenocorticosteroids, however, may result in undesirable complications. The medical contraindications to steroid therapy must be heeded, and constant watchfulness for the possible development of harmful physical side-effects is essential. Psychiatric and neurologic disturbances may follow the administration of corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropin( 4, 5). A too rapid tapering of steroid dosage may result in a period of relative hypoadrenalism, thereby exacerbating and compounding psychiatric difficulties(5). During this study, reappearance of severe depressions occurred in 1 manicdepressive and 2 neurotic-depressives, in each case about 2 months after the discontinuation of medication. These relapses may indicate the necessity for maintaining the recovered depressive patient on small doses of steroids for periods approximating the average duration of previous phases of severe depression. In this study the rapid relief of depressive symptomatology afforded by therapy with prednisone accentuated the patients’ basic personality problems. In schizo-affectives, adequate doses of phenothiazines were needed to treat the intensification of psychotic thought disorders which began concurrently with the remission of depression. The treatment of patients having involutional psychotic depressions with some paranoid features likewise required phenothiazines to suppress the paranoid thought disorders which replaced their affective disorders.",

The consumption excessive use of alcohol mainly affects the human being that can be physical and mental since some aspects of the social and cultural life are forming and socializing like a placental activity generating effects of euphoria, bad humor and relaxation. Alcoholism produces pathophysiological effects where alcohol is concentrated in the blood which is related to the central nervous system causing depressive disorders where the human can lead to a coma. One of the main consequences is the excessive use of alcohol that causes physical, mental and social damages as it affects the brain centers responsible for self-control, which means that we do not stop taking the effects of substance use. Symptoms of withdrawal include autonomic hyperactivity such as tremor in the hands, insomnia, visual, tactile and auditory hallucinations. One of the factors that increase the level of alcohol consumption is sex, young age, aggression, anxiety, sweating, and depression. Through nursing interventions in a patient with alcohol withdrawal syndrome, it will be possible to identify, plan, organize and execute the actions that will be performed both for the patient and the family and to determine the most damaging effects and consequences in this type of pathology.",

      "abstract": "As Parkinson's disease progresses, fluctuations between akinesia, or hypomobility (\"off\" times), and mobility (\"on\" times) increase in frequency despite optimized pharmacotherapy. Motor fluctuations include predictable shortening of therapeutic effects, nocturnal or early morning akinesia, random hypomobility, and delayed mobility (variable responses to individual doses of drugs). Current oral antiparkinson drugs are inadequate for rapid and consistent relief of symptoms during hypomobility. Apomorphine, an injectable dopamine agonist recently introduced in the United States, is indicated for the management of hypomobility associated with advanced Parkinson's disease. Subcutaneous apomorphine is effective for rapid and consistent rescue from hypomobility, with a magnitude of motor improvement similar to that of levodopa. The effect begins within 20 minutes after dosing and lasts approximately 100 minutes. Therapeutic rescue doses are 2-6 mg, and patients typically require approximately three rescue doses/day. Apomorphine is associated with a clinically significant potential to cause nausea and orthostatic hypotension. These potential effects can be managed with antiemetic prophylaxis and appropriate determination of the therapeutic rescue dose.",

      "title": "THE EFFECT ON THE STOMACH OF STIMULATION OF THE PERIPHERAL END OF THE VAGUS NERVE",
      "abstract": "Stimulation of the peripheral cut end of either vagus by means of the faradic current will, if the organ be in a state of “hypotonus,” either initiate movements in the quiescent stomach, or, if movements are present, augment and sometimes accelerate them. A rise of entogastric pressure may accompany these movements. The contractions produced are indistinguishable from accentuated normal movements‐they are an exaggeration of the normal‐unless the stimulus be exceptionally strong, when a tonic contraction may result : from this, however, “escape” shortly occurs. The motor effect is preceded by a brief interval or latent period of some three seconds, and should the viscus be initially in a condition of “hypertonus,” this is followed by a period during which movements, if present, cease, and relaxation occurs. Augmented or initial contractions ensue later, but may be delayed until after the cessation of stimulus : there is not necessarily a restoration of entogastric pressure. The pre‐existing state of the peripheral mechanism governs the response to stimulation, the most marked results being obtained with the active organ, the least with the passive. The X‐ray picture on vagal stimulation shows that the effects on function are augmentor and accelerator: food in the cesophagus passes through the cardia, the waves of contraction are deeper than normal, and the pylorus functions rapidly, food leaving through the sphincter before every antral contraction. A brief preliminary relaxation may be observed. These effects remain unchanged by alterations of anæsthetics, decerebration, or splanchnic section. A vaso‐constrictor effect may be obtained on stimulation of the peripheral cut end of the vagus. The first part of the duodenum functions with the stomach and is controlled by the vagus in a similar manner. Stimulation of the intact nerve, the other being undivided, gives variable results, depending on the preexisting state, and on whether the centripetal or centrifugal influences predominate. We desire to make clear that our use of the entogastric pressure is only as an index of the activity or inactivity of the organ, and that by it we are endeavounrng to gauge the condition of the peripheral mechanism. We use the digesting or quiescent viscus in order to obtain variations in this state of the peripheral mechanism, and these are demonstrable by the entogastric pressure, latent period, and “response.” The majority of our findings may be summarised as follows:— 1. The primary effect of stimulation of the peripheral cut end of either vagus on the stomach is dependent on the existing condition of the peripheral mechanism (“tonus”), and may be inhibitor or augmentor. 2. The inhibitor or augmentor effect may involve both “tonus” and movement. 3. The final effect of stimulation is to bring about the augmentation of existing movement or to initiate movement. 4. “Tonus” and contraction may vary inversely or directly.",

Alcohol use is more likely to cause an adolescent to be sexually irresponsible, which can lead to sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy. There has been an alarming growth in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive rates recently among the adolescent population. Finally, teenagers who abuse alcohol are more likely to drop out of school, thus damaging their long-term employment prospects.DefinitionThe American Psychiatric Association in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM IV) defines alcohol dependence, a substance use disorder, as a maladaptive pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress as manifested by three of the following seven symptoms occurring during the same 12-month period: tolerance; withdrawal; use greater than intended; inability to cease use; time-consuming activities associated with use; social, occupational, or recreational dysfunction; and continued use despite knowledge of physical or psychological problems. Abuse is defined as one or more of the following: failure to fulfill major roles at home or school, recurrent use in hazardous situations, recurrent legal problems, and use despite persistent social or interpersonal problems.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

      "abstract": "Non-opioid analgesics are commonly used to treat mild and moderate acute and chronic pain. They can be used as monotherapy; however, they have greater efficacy in combination with weak and strong opioids. Unlike opioids, long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs does not lead to physical dependence. One of the main disadvantages of the NSA is the risk of gastrointestinal side effects, especially bleeding into the digestive tract. This is increased especially in ulcerative disease and in higher doses, but also in the elderly (over 65 years), also with concomitant administration of corticosteroids, anticoagulants or other NSAIDs.",

      "title": "Bulimia nervosa: literature review",
      "abstract": "Daniella Meytin1 1Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Academy of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Abstract Bulimia nervosa is one of the most common eating disorders. The disease manifests in episodes of binge eating, accompanied by attempts to get rid of the food eaten by vomiting, taking laxatives, exercising, or reducing food and calorie intake during other meals, along with excessive concerns, regarding weight and appearance. The disease is more common in the Western culture, among women, especially among younger aged (usually beginning in late adolescence). The onset of the disease is influenced by biological and environmental factors. Due to laxative use, hypokalemia and arrhythmias may develop; due to vomiting – enamel damage and voice changes. Bulimia nervosa is diagnosed, if, during the last 3 months, the patient had at least 1 episode of binge eating per week, accompanied by compensatory actions (vomiting, taking laxatives, exercising, or reducing food and calorie intake during other meals). Treatment is started with psychotherapy, if it does not help or the patient is additionally diagnosed with depression, SSRI or SNRI treatment is added. 80% of treated patients achieve remission of the disease. Aim: to determine the epidemiology, etiology, symptoms, diagnostics, treatment, and prognosis of bulimia nervosa. Methods: a systematic review of the literature was performed using the PubMed medical database. Selected articles examining the etiology, epidemiology, symptoms, diagnostics, treatment, and prognosis of bulimia nervosa. English word combinations were used for search: bulimia nervosa, eating disorder, bulimia, bulimia diagnostics, bulimia treatment. Conclusions: after systematic literature review was conducted, the epidemiology, etiology, symptoms, diagnostics, treatment, and prognosis of bulimia nervosa were presented.

The definition of post polio syndrome (PPS) is: a confirmed history of polio, an interval of functional stability after initial recovery, non-disuse increased muscle weakness, and other complaints such as increased general fatigue and pain. Loss of motor units is compensated by collateral re-innervation and hypertrophy of muscle fibre. An elevenfold times increase in the motor unit region can be seen, and around double the muscle fibre area, corresponding to a fivefold increase in the number of muscle fibres in the motor unit. When loss of motor neurons can no longer be compensated for, muscle strength will decrease. Respiratory problems are present in a minority, but these need special attention and intervention. Evaluation and support through a special polio clinic is of value. The trainability varies according to the type and degree of polio changes. There may be a need for technical aids, especially for mobility, but time must be allowed for patients to accept reduced physical activity and changes in life habits recommended.",

      "abstract": "The burden of substance use disorders is increasing in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Individuals with substance use disorders (eg, alcohol use disorder) are at high risk of manifesting extrapyramidal side effects or extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) during treatment of alcohol-induced mental illness symptoms especially psychosis. EPS management poses a challenge since some of the drugs used for treating EPS have addictive properties. The knowledge about EPS diagnosis and treatment is not well distributed across the health system, with health workers at lower health facilities having least awareness. The present case gives details of a patient who developed EPS during the management of alcohol withdrawal symptoms.Following cessation of alcohol use, a 54-year-old man with alcohol use disorder presented with a one-week history of visual, auditory and tactile hallucinations, illusions, insomnia, extreme fear and irritability. He was managed with several daily doses of intramuscular chlorpromazine 100 mg, whenever he woke up aggressive from sedation from a peripheral health facility. Four days after his admission, he became mute, stiff, immobile, triple-flexed, tremulous and was drooling saliva. He was referred to a secondary facility for further management while on antipsychotic medication. Finally, he was referred to a tertiary facility, managed with tablets of benzhexol 5 mg twice daily and intravenous diazepam 20 mg per day. Daily follow-up was done using the extrapyramidal symptom rating scale (ESRS) for EPS. EPS symptoms resolved ten days after initiation of treatment.EPS among individuals with addictive disorders poses a challenge in its management, especially in countries where the mental health care system is not well developed at lower-level health facilities. The mental health system has to prepare sustainable interventions to properly manage EPS among the growing population of individuals with addictive disorders through strengthening the mental health policy by training and equipping all health providers with knowledge and skills in managing EPS, increasing finances allocated for mental health and controlling the production and use of addictive substances.",

Persistent digestive complaints or severe symptoms warrant medical attention. Homeopathy has a very important role to play in the treatment of Gastrointestinal (GI) conditions. Anorexia, Nausea, vomiting, biliousness, hiccough, gastritis, heartburn, indigestion, constipation, Piles, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), nervous disorders and many more conditions are treated successfully with homeopathy. Modern and deskbound lifestyle, tensions, nervousness, stress and strain, irregular sleep pattern, eating habits, smoking and alcohol, and so many other factors are responsible to exacerbate the GI condition. (a) A brilliant student preparing for exams turns up to the doctor with anxiety and diarrhea. b) Held up in a traffic jam trying to reach in time, but couldn't, ends up his day with a bad stomach and abdominal distress. There are so many individual instances in the day to day affairs and the good news is that homeopathy has the cure. It goes deep into the system and treats the cause. It cures by raising the body's immunity, so it can resume its natural functions. Every case of GI condition calls for study of the patients individual symptoms, emotional and physical aspects. Ten patients suffering from IBS will receive ten different remedies. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) Irritable Bowel Syndrome also called colitis refers to a functional disorder of the colon or large intestine. It is an inflammatory disease, of unknown origin, characterised clinically by recurrent attacks of diarrhea with blood and mucus, left sided abdominal pain, heart burn, spasms and cramps and sense of abdominal distention, usually associated with constipation. It is more common in females between the ages 20 -40 years. Various factors like food intolerance, acute stress, anxiety may trigger the disease. Some people experience only mild symptoms of IBS. Others have intermittent episodes, where the symptoms come and go. Some of the patients may have severe and debilitating forms of the condition. Most of the symptoms of the IBS result from increased sensitivity of the intestines and movements of materials through the intestine either too quickly or too slowly. You may have one or more symptoms at any time. Possible aggravators of IBS may include stresses such as travel, social events, stressful events good or bad, certain foods and beverages including alcohol, carbonated drinks, high fat and greasy foods, change in work schedule, fructose(natural sugar in fruit), lactose(natural sugar in milk). The symptoms of IBS differ from person to person. Detail medical history is given by the patient which helps the doctor to analyse symptoms and decide treatment. Fortunately long and protracted history of bowel symptoms without significant deterioration in general health is highly suggestive of IBS. Abdominal pain and diarrhea with mucus is one of the recognized manifestations of this disease.",

      "abstract": "Many patients experience difficulty swallowing pills, for I various reasons: * discomfort (particularly pediatric and geriatric patients) * postsurgical need for an alternate route of enteral intake (nasogastric tube, gastrostomy, jejunostomy) * dysphagia due to a neurologic disorder (multiple sclerosis, impaired gag reflex, dementing processes) * odynophagia (pain upon swallowing) due to gastroesophageal reflux or a structural abnormality * a structural abnormality of the head or neck that impairs swallowing. (1) If these difficulties are not addressed, they can interfere with medication adherence. In those instances, using an alternative dosage form or manipulating an available formulation might be required. Crushing guidelines There are limited data on crushed-form products and their impact on efficacy. Therefore, when patients have difficulty taking pills, switching to liquid solution or orally disintegrating forms is recommended. However, most psychotropics are available only as tablets or capsules. Patients can crush their pills immediately before administration for easier intake. The following are some general guidelines for doing so: (2) * Scored tablets typically can be crushed. * Crushing sublingual and buccal tablets can alter their effectiveness. * Crushing sustained-release medications can eliminate the sustained-release action. (3) * Enteric-coated medications should not be crushed, because this can alter drug absorption. * Capsules generally can be opened to administer powdered contents, unless the capsule has time-release properties or an enteric coating. The accompanying Table, organized by drug class, indicates whether a drug can be crushed to a powdered form, which usually is mixed with food or liquid for easier intake. The Table also lists liquid and orally disintegrating forms available, and other routes, including injectable immediate and long-acting formulations. Helping patients find a medication formulation that suits their needs strengthens adherence and the therapeutic relationship.

      "abstract": "Droxidopa is a first-in-class, orally available, synthetic amino acid precursor of norepinephrine that received accelerated Food and Drug Administration approval in February 2014 after Orphan Drug status for a debilitating condition known as symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. Neurogenic disorders often lead to postural hypotension as a result of poor norepinephrine release from its storage sites. Clinical data suggest increases in standing systolic blood pressure and improvements in many other markers for subjective relief in patients with symptomatic neurogenic hypotension who received droxidopa therapy over 1–2 weeks. Studies evaluating the sustained effects of droxidopa are ongoing. With minimal drug interactions (even with carbidopa use) or adverse effects, droxidopa therapy can be used safely in patients with a variety of neurologic conditions; however, more data are needed to determine its appropriate pharmacotherapeutic role. In all, droxidopa is a safe and effective medication for the treatment of orthostatic dizziness/lightheadedness, or the “feeling that you are about to black out” in adult patients with symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension secondary to primary autonomic failure (Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure), dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency, and nondiabetic autonomic neuropathy.",

      "abstract": "Opioid analgesics are useful agents for treating pain of various etiologies; however, adverse effects are potential limitations to their use. Strategies to minimize adverse effects of opioids include dose reduction, symptomatic management, opioid rotation, and changing the route of administration. Nausea occurs in approximately 25 percent of patients; prophylactic measures may not be required. Patients who do develop nausea will require antiemetic treatment with an antipsychotic, prokinetic agent, or serotonin antagonist. Understanding the mechanism for opioid-induced nausea will aid in the selection of appropriate agents. Constipation is considered an expected side effect with chronic opioid use. Physicians should minimize the development of constipation using prophylactic measures. Monotherapy with stool softeners often is not effective; a stool softener combined with a stimulant laxative is preferred. Sedation and cognitive changes occur with initiation of therapy or dose escalation. Underlying disease states or other centrally acting medications often will compound the opioid's adverse effects. Minimizing unnecessary medications and judicious use of stimulants and antipsychotics are used to manage the central nervous system side effects. Pruritus may develop, but it is generally not considered an allergic reaction. Antihistamines are the preferred management option should pharmacotherapy treatment be required.",

      "title": "Consultation with the Specialist: Management of Status Epilepticus in Children",
      "abstract": "The definition of status epilepticus (SE) is a simple, prolonged seizure or recurrent seizures associated with impaired consciousness for 30 minutes or longer. There are two types of SE: convulsive and nonconvulsive. The latter consists of prolonged absence or complex partial seizures.SE occurs most frequently in patients younger than 1 year of age and those between 60 and 80 years. Determining the underlying cause of SE is of utmost importance and is directed by the clinical presentation. The differential diagnosis is similar in all age groups, although the frequencies change in the various diagnostic categories. Table 1 delineates some of the leading causes of SE in various age groups.The differential diagnosis in any age group should include both systemic and central nervous system (CNS)infections; trauma; hypoxia; CNS malformations; ischemic events, including stroke or hemorrhage; and toxic or metabolic causes, including electrolyte imbalance, alcohol use, illicit drug use, and inborn errors of metabolism. External and internal antiepileptic drug withdrawal also is a significant factor.The incidence of SE due to infection and congenital anomalies is higher in the pediatric age group. If a child is younger than 3 years of age,infection, hypoxia, or metabolic disturbances are the most likely causes. In the child older than 3 years, idiopathic epilepsy, congenital anomalies, or chronic encephalopathies are the more likely precipitants. Although usually benign, febrile seizures can progress to SE.Neonatal SE is challenging to diagnose and treat because seizures in neonates are usually subtle and not dramatic in appearance. Clinical manifestations include rhythmic eye movements, rowing or pedaling motions of the legs, tonic posture, or less commonly focal or multifocal generalized tonic, clonic, or tonic-clonic seizures. It often is difficult to correlate clinical seizures with electrocerebral epileptiform activity on electroencephalography (EEG). The decision to treat needs to be based on the underlying etiology of the seizures, background and ictal activity of the EEG, and consideration of the consequences of chronic antiepileptic drug administration.SE is associated with a poorer prognosis in adults than in children. Average mortality rates in one study were 25% for adults versus 2.5% in children. Alcohol and drug abuse account for a large percentage of cases of SE.Table 2 lists a classification scheme for SE. Convulsive,either generalized or partial, is the most easily recognizable form of SE. Nonconvulsive often is difficult to identify and to differentiate from confusional migraine and psychiatric fugue states. Cascino reported that 25%of persons experiencing SE have absence or complex partial SE.Important differential diagnoses in patients who have nonconvulsive SE (absence or complex partial), depending in part upon their age, include confusional states or unresponsiveness associated with transient ischemic attacks,transient global amnesia, stroke, or migraine. Toxic and metabolic causes should be sought early in the evaluation. One must always consider psychiatric disorders, such as various forms of psychosis, fugue states, and",

Material y Métodos: Paciente de 45 años, consumidor crónico de alcohol, que ingresa en Medicina Interna por cuadro de tres semanas de evolución de deterioro físico con rigidez, pérdida de fuerza, pérdida de apetito y caídas frecuentes secundarias a debilidad en miembros inferiores. Esta sintomatología se acompaña de alucinaciones visuales y alteraciones sensoperceptivas que describen los familiares como intentos de trepar por el techo como si fuera una araña. En este tiempo parece haber empeorado la coordinación de la marcha hasta imposibilitar la deambulación y se ha incrementado la inquietud y dificultades del sueño. A la exploración destaca temblor de reposo, inestabilidad de la marcha que finalmente imposibilitaba la bipedestación, discurso incoherente fluctuante con episodios de desorientación y memoria a corto plazo conservada, déficit de atención y afectación anímica de larga evolución. Resultados: Durante el ingreso sufrió crisis convulsiva así como varios episodios de agitación psicomotriz, realizándose analítica de sangre que mostraba alteraciones compatibles con consumo de alcohol, serología negativa, TAC de cráneo, tórax, abdomen y pelvis en el que solo se objetivaron varices esofágicas y EEG con lentificación de ondas. Finalmente se realizó RNM que mostró hiperintensidad en esplenio del cuerpo calloso compatible con el diagnóstico de Marchiafava-Bignami. Conclusiones: La enfermedad de Marchiafava-Bignami es una encefalopatía que consiste en la desmielinización y necrosis del cuerpo calloso poco frecuente e infradiagnosticada, ya que se solapa con múltiples patologías, siendo necesario un alto índice de sospecha y la realización de una RNM como herramienta diagnóstica.

      "title": "Gambling Disorder",
      "abstract": "Gambling disorder is characterized by a persistent and recurrent maladaptive pattern of gambling behavior, preoccupation with gambling activities, loss of control, and continued gambling despite problems in social or occupational functioning (Box 62- ). It is associated with significant financial losses, legal problems, and disrupted interpersonal and familial relationships. Individuals with gambling disorder are also at increased risk for suicide attempts (Phillips et al. 1997), new-onset comorbid psychiatric disorders (Kessler et al. 2008), and several medical conditions (Morasco et al. 2006). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Gambling Disorder 312.31 F63.0 Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more) of the following in a 12-month period: Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble). Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed). After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (\"chasing\" one's losses). Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic episode . Specify if: Episodic: Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months. Persistent: Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for multiple years. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months. In sustained remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of 12 months or longer. Specify current severity: Mild: 4–5 criteria met. Moderate: 6–7 criteria met. Severe: 8–9 criteria met. Despite its serious consequences (Kessler et al. 2008; Petry et al. 2005), gambling disorder is rarely diagnosed and even more rarely treated (Slutske 2006). Less than 10% of individuals with gambling disorder ever seek treatment (Slutske 2006), probably because of a combination of ambivalence about seeking treatment on the part of the patients and limited access for those who wish to seek it. Although some data suggest that many individuals with gambling disorder recover without formal treatment (Hodgins and el-Guebaly 2000; Slutske et al. 2003), there is no available information on the time to remission in natural recovery or the risk of recurrence. Fortunately, despite our limited knowledge about the epidemiology and etiology of gambling disorders, a growing body of literature has examined pharmacological and psychological treatments for gambling disorder.",

      "title": "First-episode psychosis induced by pregabalin withdrawal: a case report",
      "abstract": "Pregabalin is a novel isomer of gamma-aminobutyric acid that functions as a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. It is used daily in medical practice for treating neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, generalized anxiety disorder, and partial seizures. Due to its anti-glutamatergic effects, it poses a potential addiction risk. For example, an abrupt discontinuation of this substance may cause patients to exhibit physical withdrawal symptoms, such as insomnia, nausea, headache, and diarrhoea. However, there is no information in the literature that addresses whether the rapid discontinuation of pregabalin can cause psychosis to occur. Here we presented a 20-year-old patient with his first episode of psychosis that was likely attributable to his withdrawal from a high dosage pregabalin. He lacked physical signs of withdrawal; however, a psychiatric examination was conducted. It was determined that the patient was experiencing paranoid ideation, auditory hallucinations, and mutism. Furthermore, he had engaged in self-mutilative actions and had attempted suicide. Due to the short time frame between the rapid discontinuation of a relatively large dose of pregabalin and the onset of the patient's first episode of psychosis, it is likely that the psychotic episode was triggered by the cessation of the medication. This is the first known case of psychosis that was caused by the rapid withdrawal of pregabalin to be discussed in the literature. The results of this clinical case may guide clinicians to recognize the symptoms of acute pregabalin withdrawal.",

      "abstract": "The diazepam withdrawal syndrome was studied in 10 patients who had abused the drug for 3 to 14 years. In the previous 6 months their consumption of diazepam had ranged from 60 to 120 mg daily; none had used other drugs during this period. The withdrawal period lasted about 6 weeks. The intensity of the symptoms and signs was high initially, fell during the first 2 weeks, then rose again in the third week, before finally declining. Three groups of symptoms and signs were identified. Group A symptoms occurred throughout withdrawal and included tremor, anorexia, insomnia and myoclonus. Group B symptoms and signs were largely confined to the first 10 days and were those of a toxic psychosis. Group C symptoms reached a peak in the third and fourth weeks of withdrawal and were characterized by sense perceptions that were either heightened or lowered. The symptom groups, the presence of tremor and myoclonus, and the relief of symptoms by a test dose permit diazepam withdrawal to be distinguished from anxiety. The biphasic course of the symptoms is probably related to the pharmacokinetics of diazepam.",

AssessmentThe presence of post-traumatic stress disorder is often missed.When patients present with repeated non-specific health problems the GP should consider asking about exposure to traumatic events.A screening tool can be helpful (Box 1). 5 This brief screen can be supplemented by a more detailed symptom review such as the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist.",

CM has been shown to cause greater headache-related disability, headache impact, societal burden, and lower quality of life scores compared with episodic migraine. In general, all patients with CM require preventive therapy; only onabotulinumtoxinA (OBTA) is approved for the prevention of CM. Many patients receiving treatment with OBTA experience a “wearing off” of the beneficial effects before their next dose is due, often within the past 2 weeks. Increasing the OBTA dose from 155 units to 195 units or redosing at 10 rather than 12 weeks may prevent wear-off. Meanwhile, bridge therapies include occipital nerve or sphenopalatine nerve blocks at the 10-week mark. Adding oral preventive medications or injectable calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibodies to the OBTA may reduce migraine attacks.",

      "abstract": "Medical rehabilitation is a multi-professional / interdisciplinary process aimed at enhancing and restoring functional ability (activity and participation) and quality of life to people with im-pairments or disabilities. Rehabilitation is applied throughout the continuum of care. COVID-19 patients may develop a myriad of acute medical problems (linked to the virus per se, or as con-sequences of the invasive procedures), which can cause acute, post-acute and long-term conse-quences requiring rehabilitation. Information about short and long-term sequelae of COVID-19 indicate an increasing need for rehabilitation. The paper is focused on two main aspects: rehabil-itation of the severe neurological disabilities that occurred during the acute phase and continu-ing in the chronic phase (i.e., different neurological sensory-motor and cognitive deficits sec-ondary to stroke, encephalitis, seizures, encephalopathies). The other main issue is generated by the disruption of regular rehabilitation in people with neurological disabilities and chronic dis-eases (people living with sequels after stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis) due to quarantine, social isolation, movement restriction, and other healthcare systems ’disruptions. Methods Internet literature search (Lit Covid and PubMed) using the following keywords (Covid-19, Coronavirus, neurological complications, rehabilitation). During 2020-2021 were published 88 papers (in 2020 = 54, and in 2021= 54), with 21 reviewes (2020 = 15; 2021 = 8), and 2 systematic reviews, refearing neuroreabilitation in Covid-19 subacutre and long-term cas-es. Discussion REH-COVER Cochrane Rehabilitation WHO initiative (“Rapid Living Systematic Reviews Second Edition, called 2020”), contains the main cornerstones for a tailored rehabilita-tion programme, the best (current) available rehabilitation evidence on recovery interventions, for the patients living with sequelae of COVID-19. Conclusions More than two years since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is obvious that rehabilitation services play a crucial role in post-COVID recovery trajectories. A further achievement of research and evidence focussed on the clinical management, comprehensive treatments, and efficacy need to be targeted on short and long-term (neuro)-rehabilitation service models of care, for COVID-19 survivors.

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> To design a classification concentrating on the art and severity of functional restriction that could include all possible postoperative neurological disturbances and prove its validity to be comparable and easily used in neurosurgery. A seven grade classification was proposed commencing from grade \"0\" for no neurological disturbances to grade \"6\" for coma/vegetative state/demise: grade “1”, any remittent neurological disturbances with full improvement spontaneously or as a result of any temporary drug therapy or re-surgery, a single epileptic seizure without the need for anticonvulsant therapy; grade “2”, lasting neurological disturbances resulting in no functional restrictions, no epileptic seizures needing for long-term anticonvulsant therapy; grade “3”, lasting neurological disturbances resulting in slight functional restrictions, rare epileptic seizures despite of anticonvulsant therapy, slight aphasia; grade “4”, lasting neurological disturbances resulting in moderate functional restrictions and partial need of outside help, average frequency of epileptic seizures despite anticonvulsant therapy, moderate aphasia; and grade “5”, lasting neurological disturbances resulting in severe functional restriction and complete need of outside help, high frequency of epileptic seizures despite of anticonvulsant therapy, severe aphasia. The study included a total of 1681 operations at 1530 patients. The postoperative neurological disturbances occurred in 7.7% (n=119) of patients. All postoperative neurological disturbances could be easily classified according to the CPNC. The ranking system was proportional to the length of hospital stay. The CPNC is useful and easily applicable to assess the rates of postoperative neurological disturbances. It can be a comparable instrument in the quality management of neurosurgery.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) are being used with increasing frequency in critically ill patients. Recently, many centers have described patients with prolonged muscle weakness after long‐term use of these agents, either alone or in combination with other agents or disorders. Brief weakness lasting several hours to several days is probably the result of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, while more prolonged weakness lasting several weeks to months is, in all likelihood, caused by a myopathy. Patients with this myopathic disorder have flaccid paralysis with intact cognition and sensation. Electrodiagnostic findings include decreased M‐wave amplitudes, positive waves and fibrillations, and rapid recruitment of small amplitude short duration, polyphasic motor unit potentials. Muscle biopsy findings include atrophy of type I and type II fibers, myofiber necrosis, and selective loss of thick myofilaments. The myopathy is believed to be related to the prolonged use of NMBA either alone or in combination with other disorders or medications, particularly corticosteroids. The weakness experienced by these patients leads to additional respiratory compromise, difficulty weaning from the ventilator, and prolonged hospitalization. © 1995 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

It adversely effect a wide range of health condition and yoga is the most comprehensive approach to fighting stress. When we are in stress our nervous system respond by releasing a flood of stress hormone. This hormone stimulates the body for emergency action by “fight-flight or freeze” reaction also known as stress response. The agent which causes stress is known as ‘stressors’. Stress causes many harmful effect on the body such as , Physical impact - Weight gain/loss, Unexpected hair loss, Heart palpitations, High blood pressure, Digestive symptoms (such as dryness of mouth, flatulence, nausea, butterfly stomach)etc. Emotional negative effect includes Mood swing, Anxiety, Can lead to depression & unhealthy coping strategies (i.e. alcohol, drugs).",

This may include natural catastrophes, combat experiences, rape, or other such horrifying events. The three major features of the disorder are reexperiencing the trauma through dreams, emotional numbing, and autonomic instability. To date, several treatment modalities have been used, usually consisting of a combination of psychotherapy and drug treatment. Although controversy exists, antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors are used most commonly, while other drugs such as lithium, carbamazepine, and antipsychotic drugs may be useful. We have reported a case involving a 44-year-old combat veteran who experienced severe flashbacks of his time spent in Vietnam. His symptoms and general state of mind improved significantly while taking the antipsychotic drug thioridazine.",

      "title": "Modern Treatment of Status Epilepticus in Adults",
      "abstract": "Status epilepticus is a serious epileptic condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It can be divided into four stages: &nbsp;developing (seizures leading up to status epilepticus), established (&gt;5 minutes convulsive status epilepticus, nonconvulsive/focal status epilepticus &gt;10 min), refractory (failure of two adequately dosed antiseizure medications in different drug classes), and super-refractory (persisting despite &gt;24 hours of anesthesia). All seizure types can develop to status epilepticus. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus &nbsp;has the largest potential for brain damage. The drug treatment algorithms for status epilepticus generally go through three stages, starting with benzodiazepines: lorazepam, midazolam, or diazepam as first line drugs, moving to levetiracetam, valproate or fos-phenytoin as second-line drugs, ending, if necessary, with anesthetics like propofol or midazolam. Lacosamide, topiramate, phenobarbital, brivaracetam, and perampanel are potential alternatives, and pentobarbital is commonly used when long-term anesthesia is needed. Super refractory status epilepticus is the form that usually causes the most concern.Treatment guidelines for newer treatment alternatives are often based only on case reports and small patient series. Such alternatives include ketamine, immunotherapy, ketogenic diet, inhalation anesthetics and hypothermia, and several surgical neurostimulation procedures. This chapter provides an overview of current treatment alternatives, with particular focus on refractory status epilepticus and super-refractory status epilepticus.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCCIÓN Los 2C (popularmente conocidos como tusi o cocaína rosa) son un grupo de sustancias pertenecientes a las fenetilaminas con efecto psicoestimulante y alucinógeno. Su uso, por vía oral o esnifada, se ha visto incrementado en los últimos años, con efectos psicopatológicos variables. CASO CLÍNICO Presentamos el caso clínico de un varón de 22 años, que inicia seguimiento recientemente en su centro de salud mental, observándose rasgos narcisistas de personalidad. Es traído a Urgencias por sobreingesta medicamentosa e intento de ahorcamiento. Reconoce consumo frecuente de tusi o cocaína rosa, refiriendo además sentirse muy inquieto, nervioso y con ideas de muerte y autolesión, llegando a ingerir cantidades excesivas de lormetazepam o intentarse ahorcar en casa, de forma muy impulsiva y sin otro desencadenante aparente. El screening de drogas de abuso resulta negativo para las sustancias estudiadas. DISCUSIÓN Los efectos clínicos del 2C se encuentran entre lo estimulante y lo psicodélico, con sensación de bienestar, euforia, incremento de la sociabilidad, y a más dosis, alteraciones sensoperceptivas. Se ha descrito la aparición de síntomas psicóticos tras su consumo. La aparición de marcada ansiedad, impulsividad y conducta suicida podría estar relacionada con el consumo de esta sustancia, con consecuencias graves. CONCLUSIÓN Se necesita estudiar con mayor profundidad los efectos clínicos, psicopatológicos y especialmente sobre la conducta suicida del consumo de fenetilaminas, cuyo uso va en aumento, según los últimos datos. La correcta anamnesis en los hábitos de consumo debe ocupar un lugar primordial, y estar en alerta al no ser siempre detectada en los tests de drogas de abuso habituales.",

Certain adverse effects of opioids have traditionally been considered most relevant due to their potential impact or high prevalence. The likelihood of opioid toxicity has been associated with several factors, such as patient age, organ dysfunction, pharmacodynamic considerations, concurrent use of medications with overlapping toxicity, and the patient's previous experience with opioids. Several global strategies have been proposed that may reduce the adverse effects sometimes associated with opioid therapy. Opioid rotation has been found by different clinicians to be effective in the management of opioid-induced sedation, cognitive failure, hallucinations, delirium, myoclonus, hyperalgesia, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and dry mouth. Sedation is a common adverse effect either when patients are started on opioid analgesics or after receiving a significant increase in dose.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT People with schizophrenia are more likely to smoke and less likely to quit than people in the general population. Several biological and environmental factors could interact to account for high smoking persistence in this population, including increased sensitivity to the reinforcing effects of nicotine or conditioned cues, beneficial effects of nicotine on symptoms or cognitive function, higher levels of craving or negative affect during abstinence, exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms during abstinence, and reduced motivation, self-efficacy or support for quitting. Controlled comparisons of responses to abstinence, cues and nicotine replacement in smokers with schizophrenia and equally-dependent smokers who do not have psychiatric illness may help to clarify the degree to which these biological and environmental factors may contribute to smoking persistence in people with schizophrenia.

Tics can be voluntarly suppressed for limited periods of time; the sensory-motor phenomena before a tic may be used as signal. Apart from simple movements and vocal impulses, more complex motor (e.g., slapping oneself, hopping, copropraxia = obscene gesturing, echopraxia = imitation of others) and linguistic discharges (such as coprolalia = use of obscene language, palilalia = repetition of the most recently spoken syllables or words and echolalia = repetition of words spoken by others) can also occur.

      "abstract": "Background: Sleep is vital for adolescents’ physical and emotional development; however, sleep disturbances and disorders frequently occur in this age group and affect their health and well-being. In this review, we investigated the prevalence, etiology, diagnosis, clinical characteristics, and treatment of sleep disorders observed among adolescents.Current Concepts: The diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder among adolescents include difficulties in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or waking up too early and feeling unrefreshed, which are observed at least 3 days per week over 3 or more months. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia typically includes identifying and addressing negative thoughts and behaviors associated with sleep and establishing a consistent sleep-wake schedule. Delayed sleep phase syndrome is diagnosed in individuals in whom sleep onset and wake times are persistently delayed by 2 or more hours beyond the desired or existing sleep schedule, which leads to excessive daytime sleepiness or impaired functioning. Behavioral interventions comprise sleep hygiene education, relaxation techniques, and phototherapy. Symptoms such as pronounced snoring, apnea observed by others, and gasping or pauses in breathing during sleep may indicate sleep apnea. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy is an effective treatment strategy for sleep apnea. A history of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy suggests narcolepsy, and treatment options include pharmacotherapy, behavior modification, and lifestyle adjustments. Restless leg syndrome treatments include behavioral therapy, as well as anticonvulsant and dopamine receptor agonist administration.Discussion and Conclusion: Addressing sleep disorders is important to promote optimal health and well-being of adolescents and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Early detection, accurate diagnosis, and individualized treatment improve sleep and overall health outcomes and promote academic and social success.",

The abrupt cessation of baclofen causes baclofen withdrawal–induced psychosis. The risk is exacerbated if the patient has renal insufficiency or if the drug has been taken for a long time at high doses. Gradual tapering of baclofen usually does not produce symptomatic adverse effects. However, abrupt termination of the drug, especially in an inpatient hospital setting, can lead to symptoms such as increased spasticity, agitation, confusion, hallucinations, and seizures. We present a case of a patient who initially presented with seizures and experienced hallucinations after abrupt cessation of the medication. She had baseline chronic kidney disease but presented with acute worsening of her renal function. Impaired renal function decreases baclofen clearance and causes increased concentration of baclofen in circulation. This put the patient at higher risk of developing baclofen withdrawal, even at a lower dose.",

      "title": "Biological treatment of Acute Agitation Or Aggression with Schizophrenia Or Bipolar Disorder in the Inpatient Setting",
      "abstract": "Background Schizophrenia and bipolar disorders are chronic illnesses that commonly present with symptoms of acute agitation and aggression. These symptoms must be managed rapidly to prevent potential harm to the patient and others, including their caregivers, peers, and health care workers. A number of treatment options are available to clinicians to manage acute agitation and aggression, including non-pharmacologic behavioral and environmental de-escalation strategies, as well as biological treatment options such as pharmacologic agents and electroconvulsive therapy. We summarize the available biological treatment options for patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder presenting with acute agitation or aggression in the inpatient setting, focusing on antipsychotics. Methods The following searches were used in PubMed to obtain the most relevant advances in treating schizophrenia or bipolar disorder with acute agitation and aggression: (agitation, agitated, aggression, aggressive, hostile, hostility, violent, or violence) and (schizophr*, psychosis, psychot*, psychos*, mania, manic, or bipolar) and (*pharmacologic, antipsychotic*, neuroleptic*, antiepileptic*, anti-seizure*, mood stabilizer*, lithium, benzodiazepine*, beta blocker, beta-blocker, alpha2, alpha-2, *histamine*, electroconvulsive, ECT, shock, or transcranial). Individual searches were performed for each drug class. The studies were limited to peer-reviewed, English-language, and human studies. Most were placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or meta-analyses. Results Among pharmacologic agents, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, and lithium have been studied in randomized trials. Some typical and, more recently, atypical antipsychotics are available as both oral and short-acting intramuscular (IM) formulations, with 1 typical antipsychotic also available as an inhalable formulation. Conclusions Among the pharmacologic agents studied in RCTs, atypical antipsychotics have the best evidence to support efficacy both in oral and short-acting IM formulations, as well as in one instance in an inhalable formulation.",

      "title": "Clinical management of cannabis withdrawal",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background and Aims Cannabis withdrawal is a well‐characterized phenomenon that occurs in approximately half of regular and dependent cannabis users after abrupt cessation or significant reductions in cannabis products that contain Δ 9 ‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). This review describes the diagnosis, prevalence, course and management of cannabis withdrawal and highlights opportunities for future clinical research. Methods Narrative review of literature. Results Symptom onset typically occurs 24–48 hours after cessation and most symptoms generally peak at days 2–6, with some symptoms lasting up to 3 weeks or more in heavy cannabis users. The most common features of cannabis withdrawal are anxiety, irritability, anger or aggression, disturbed sleep/dreaming, depressed mood and loss of appetite. Less common physical symptoms include chills, headaches, physical tension, sweating and stomach pain. Despite limited empirical evidence, supportive counselling and psychoeducation are the first‐line approaches in the management of cannabis withdrawal. There are no medications currently approved specifically for medically assisted withdrawal (MAW). Medications have been used to manage short‐term symptoms (e.g. anxiety, sleep, nausea). A number of promising pharmacological agents have been examined in controlled trials, but these have been underpowered and positive findings not reliably replicated. Some (e.g. cannabis agonists) are used ‘off‐label’ in clinical practice. Inpatient admission for MAW may be clinically indicated for patients who have significant comorbid mental health disorders and polysubstance use to avoid severe complications. Conclusions The clinical significance of cannabis withdrawal is that its symptoms may precipitate relapse to cannabis use. Complicated withdrawal may occur in people with concurrent mental health and polysubstance use.",

Compared with placebo, treatment with imipramine hydrochloride in a multiple crossover design using threeweek treatment periods led to improved performance on the memory task without either clinically apparent improvement in depression or significantly improved performance on the other tasks. These results may reflect the relative complexity of the memory task rather than a specific impairment of short-term memory, but the data do support the presence of cognitive dysfunction in depression, even in ambulatory patients without substantial impairments of attention or motor functioning. The results also indicate that antidepressant drugs can produce improvement in cognitive function, possibly as a forerunner of clinical improvement.",

Primary care physicians, not mental health professionals, treat the majority of patients with symptoms of depression. Persons who are depressed have feelings of sadness, loneliness, irritability, worthlessness, hopelessness, agitation, and guilt that may be accompanied by an array of physical symptoms. A diagnosis of major depression requires that symptoms be present for two weeks or longer. Identifying patients with depression can be difficult in busy primary care settings where time is limited, but certain depression screening measures may help physicians diagnose the disorder. Patients who score above the predetermined cut-off levels on the screening measures should be interviewed more specifically for a diagnosis of a depressive disorder and treated within the primary care physician's scope of practice or referred to a mental health subspecialist as clinically indicated. Targeted screening in high-risk patients such as those with chronic diseases, pain, unexplained symptoms, stressful home environments, or social isolation, and those who are postnatal or elderly may provide an alternative approach to identifying patients with depression.",

      "title": "Minor Depression and 'Subthreshold' Anxiety Symptoms in Older Adults: Psychosocial Therapies and Special Considerations",
      "abstract": "GENERATIONS A new focus on these common causes of distress and impairment. In recent years more attention has been given to identifying and treating mental disorders in older adults. By and large, these efforts have focused on disorders delineated in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Sta/Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). However, another class of disorders is also beginning to receive attention: mental disorders. Although these sets of symptoms do not meet the full criteria to be classified as specific mental disorders, they are nonetheless associated with clinically significant distress or impairment (Pincus, Davis, and McQueen,1999). In this article we will discuss two specific conditions, and subthreshold generalized anxiety disorder, and the evidence for the efficacy of psychosocial therapies for these conditions for older adults. MINOR DEPRESSION Minor depression is typically defined as the presence of at least two but fewer than five depressive symptoms, including depressed mood or loss of interest in normal daily activities, during the same two-week period with no history of major depressive episode or dysthymic disorder but with clinically significant impairment or distress (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Minor depression is highly prevalent in older adults in the community (9.9 percent) (Hybels, Blazer, and Pieper, 2001) and in primary care (5.2 percent) (Lyness et al., 1999). In mixed-age samples minor depression has been shown to be associated with levels of functional impairment comparable to those caused by medical illnesses (Wells et al., 1992) and with increased expenditures on medical care (Johnson, Weissman, and Klerman, 1992). Morbidity has been less extensively studied in samples of older adults, but the morbidity rates of elders with minor depression may be assumed to be at least comparable to samples with medical illnesses given the higher prevalence of complicating medical conditions. A recent study has shown minor depression to be associated with an increased risk for mortality in older men (Penninx et al., 1999). Although assessment of the prevalence of minor depression in racial and ethnic minority populations tends to be clouded by linguistic and cultural differences in expressing affective and somatic symptoms, recent research taking into account these measurement challenges indicates that minor depression is very common in older ethnic minorities in primary care. According to Arean and Alvidrez (2001), as many as io percent of older African Americans, 15 percent of older Latinos, and 12 percent of older Asians meet criteria for minor depression. SCREENING FOR MINOR DEPRESSION One of the most common instruments for screening and tracking depression in primary care is the Patient Health Questionnaire Nine-- Item Depression Module (PHQ-9). The patient fills out the questionnaire, and the information can yield a diagnosis of major or minor depression. While psychometric studies have yet to be done on the utility of the PHQ-9 with minority elders, the instrument is available in Spanish and Chinese. PSYCHOSOCIAL THERAPIES FOR MINOR DEPRESSION Empirically derived treatment guidelines have been established for major depression. However, a paucity of studies, which have yielded conflicting findings, means that no specific guidelines are currently available for pharmacologic or psychosocial treatment of minor depression. Psychosocial therapies are particularly appealing for older adults because they often have medical conditions as well, leading to an increased possibility of adverse drug interactions. Since the research on treating minor depression in older adults is so limited, we will review the evidence for psychosocial treatments of minor depression in both younger and older adults together. The interventions examined include cognitive-behavioral, interpersonal, and problem-solving therapy, as well as physical exercise. …",

      "abstract": "Most head injured patients arrive in the accident and emergency (A&E) department within a few hours of the injury. This article concerns the investigation of a group that has received less attention: those whose first attendance is delayed, who reattend, or develop complications after a period of observation. Delay in the initial presentation or unplanned return to the A&E department after head injury can occur for a variety of reasons. The abuse of alcohol or drugs may lead to signs of an injury being noted only after the patient wakes up or is found still in coma long after the effects of the agent should have cleared. Sometimes seemingly trivial injury leads to attendance some hours, days, or even weeks later because of persisting or worsening symptoms. Studies in South Africa, England, and Scotland' showed that about 2-3 % of A&E patients reattend after being sent home with an apparently minor head injury (only 0.2% of the total new A&E attenders). Most of these have responded to advice given at the time of discharge and have developed symptoms such as headache, dizziness, or vomiting prompting reattendance within two weeks of the injury. In Scotland in 1979 the annual incidence of an intracranial haematoma undergoing surgery was shown to be 4.5 per 100 000 population.4 Data from a regional neurosurgical unit indicate that one fifth of these are pure extradural haematomas and over two thirds are intradural haematomas, which is the commoner finding at all stages after injury. A report in 1980 showed that over one quarter of surgical intracranial haematomas received surgery after three days (table 1).5 This pattern may have changed with the increased use of computed tomography but intradural haematomas (subdural and intracerebral) still tend to present later than extradural haematomas. Patients with chronic subdural haematoma (a subdural collection of dark fluid occurring at three weeks after injury or later) reach neurosurgical units at the annual rate of one per 100 000 population.6 7",

      "abstract": "In a previous publication (Brown and Birley, 1968) we have presented some findings which suggest that life changes and crises frequently precipitate the acute onset, relapse or exacerbation of schizophrenic states. To summarize : consecutively admitted patients diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia were seen at mental hospitals serving a known catchment area. The first fifty whose onsets occurred within three months of admission and could be accurately dated within a week were included. Both the patient and at least one other informant were interviewed about the occurrence of certain previously defined and datable events occurring to the patient or to close relatives. These included such events as moving house, starting or leaving a job, admission to hospital, birth, marriage or death during the twelve weeks prior to onset. These were classified, according to their apparent independence of the patient's control, as ‘independent’ or ‘possibly independent’. The former were those which could be regarded as outside his control, e.g. discovering a burglary or hearing of a brother's serious illness. ‘Possibly independent’ events were those which were considered to have been within the patient's control but which had not been brought about by any unusual behaviour on the patient's part. They were chiefly changes of job, or of opposite sex friends. (Loss of job would, under certain circumstances, be rated as ‘independent’, e.g. when a whole firm closed down).",

Depression is a common mental disorder usually starts in early adulthood that presents with depressed mood loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, low energy, and poor concentration. It usually occurs as a result of adverse life events, such as: losses of a significant person, object, relationship or health, stressful life, sedentary life and lack of occupation but it can also occur due to no apparent cause. These problems can become chronic or recurrent and lead to substantial impairments in an individual's ability to take care of his or her every day responsibilities As…",

      "abstract": "The incidence and prevalence of alcoholism in the elderly population are tendentially underestimated. There are some reasons for this fact. The pathway to the diagnosis of alcoholism may be considerably compromised in the often comorbid or multimorbid patient. To live up to an advanced age seems to be a good argument against chronic substance abuse. Elderly people and their relatives are often still more reluctant to report about socially stigmatizing disorders. On top of that, the amount of social control is reduced after the end of employment and upon entering retirement. Yet, if alcohol-withdrawal symptoms occur, e.g., following an admission of the addicted patient to a hospital, the missed diagnosis of alcoholism means a delay of the correct interpretation of such complications and of the necessary treatment. Aged patients with reduced physical and mental reserve capacity are at special risk of developing further serious complications. Progressive, sometimes irreversible decay of the cognitive functions in long lasting delirious states or, as an aftermath of withdrawal, epileptic seizures are of particular importance.",

      "title": "Depression and anxiety: Distinguishing unipolar and bipolar disorders",
      "abstract": "The use of steroids and supplements can complicate the clinical picture in a young man with mood swings, anxiety, and depression referred for psychiatric evaluation by his primary care clinician and a psychologist. Identifying information: A 20-year-old single man was referred by his primary care physician and a psychologist for medical management of mood swings, anxiety, and confusion. Chief complaint: The patient reported unremitting sadness that had lasted more than a year, and said that he generally felt dead inside or like a zombie. He was often ruminative and irritable, with difficulty concentrating. History of present illness: The young man's sadness and disagreeable sensations were relieved only for periods of 3 to 4 days when he felt more worried than sad. It was during these intervals of worry that he grew more ruminative, tired, and irritable, and said he could not sort out his thoughts. The patient could not recall when he last felt well enough to have fun with friends. He ruminated about the past, often trying to change it in his mind and thereby causing himself to become confused about what was real and what he might have imagined to be real. In particular, he was preoccupied with the recent loss of a relationship with a girl, which began in high school. He blamed the loss on his moodiness. However, he also acknowledged that he briefly dated her younger sister, a short time after which the girlfriend abruptly stopped returning his calls, telling him it was payback for dating her sister. The patient spent a great deal of time online looking at his ex-girlfriend's MySpace social-interaction page, which only caused him to feel worse. He blamed himself for everything that was wrong in his life and struggled with thoughts that people were talking and thinking about him negatively. Because he believed he was physically too small, he exercised regularly to stay in good shape. Medications and allergies: The referring primary care physician and psychologist had prescribed sertraline 100 mg/d for 3 weeks. They then switched him to venlafaxine 225 mg/d, which he took for 4 to 5 weeks. However, the patient stopped taking both drugs on his own initiative because they made him feel numb, and he also thought they made him feel more depressed. In the week before the initial psychiatric evaluation, his father had given him some sleeping medications because he was often tense, keyed up, and unable to relax in the evenings and around bedtime. They did not help. Otherwise, this young man had not been taking any medications during the previous 6 months. Psychiatric history: The patient had never been hospitalized and denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation. As mentioned, he sometimes thought he could undo the past by some ritualistic rnental action. The young man was an only child and spent a lot of time talking about this. He denied any history of childhood trauma. However, he held an unusual suspicion that his parents were hiding a birth defect from him, and that this defect was in some manner related to his current issues and difficulties. He did not give any more details about this suspicion, saying, Every time I ask them about it, they tell me I'm crazy and just make a joke about it. His mother reported that it took about 10 years to conceive, but there were no complications with the pregnancy or delivery. The patient received no intervention during the first 6 months of the current episode, when his family doctor was contacted. The doctor referred the patient to a psychologist for counseling, and the psychologist quickly referred him back to the doctor, believing that the young man needed a prescription for antidepressant medication. His mother said he was drinking alcohol more regularly while on his medications, and that he was probably not fully compliant with the antidepressant regimens. He was never prescribed benzodiazepines for his anxiety and tension, apparently due to concern about abuse potential. …",

      "abstract": "Being most common mental health disorder, Major depressive disorder, have affected approximately 350 million people all throughout the world at any time. In ranking among the cause of disability it has been ranked as major leading cause for disability in worldwide. (1) Major depressive disorder is debilitating disease and has and at least one individual depressive episode for minimum of two weeks and involves changed mood, decreased interest in surrounding and decreased pleasure specifically in activities which were earlier pleasurable along with changes in cognitive function and changes in vegetative symptoms (2) . few of these patient might report guilt feelings and feelings of worthlessness or feeling of hopelessness, also patient reports of repetitive negative thoughts about individual self and their future (3) . Taking consideration prevalence and the suffering, morbidity, dysfunction, and economic burden depression is major public health concern disorder. Depression being more common in women than men, report on global burden of disease suggests the point prevalence of unipolar depressive episodes is 1.9% for men and 3.2% for women, while the estimated one year prevalence to be 5.8% for men and 9.5% for women. Study says that if current trends for demographic and epidemiologic transitions continue by the year 2020, the burden of disease might increase up to 5.7% of total burden of the disease making it second leading cause of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), second to ischemic heart disease. (4) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are the first-line therapy for treating MDD because of their superior tolerability and safety profiles relative to monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants. (6) Therapeutic application of these inhibitors is based on the monoamine hypothesis of depression. Unfortunately, over half of MDD patients do not achieve remission after a 12-week treatment with SSRIs. Studies have also shown that one-third of patients treated with successive antidepressant therapies do not achieve remission even after a 1-year intervention. (7) Thus in this study we attempt to examine the better treatment amongst two groups that can help to treat our patients and improve clinical outcome.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Psychosis is one of the most prevalent non-motor complications in Parkinson's disease (PD). Risk factors for PD psychosis are advancing age, longer disease duration, severe motor symptoms, presence of dementia, sleep disorders, depression and autonomic dysfunction. Treatment is challenging in this setting because antipsychotic medications are known to worse motor symptoms. Objectives To highlight the therapeutic difficulties in PD-related psychosis. Methods Case description and literature review. Results We report a case of a 74-year-old woman with a 9-year history of PD, who presented a complex psychotic disorder consisting in auditory, olfactory and visual (gulliverian and lilliputian) hallucinations, persecutory and sexual delusions. Additionally, the patient presented euthymic mood, without evidence of cognitive impairment or impulse-control disorder. These symptoms began after dopamine agonist therapy (ropinirole 4 mg/day). Other medical conditions that could justify these symptoms were excluded. Initially, ropinirole was removed, but without psychotic remission. Then, she was treated with antipsychotic medication (clozapine 25 mg/day) with full psychotic remission and without significant worsening of motor symptoms. Conclusions Clozapine treatment is frequently delayed, mainly for fear of its side effects, particularly agranulocytosis. However, this antipsychotic drug presents many benefits regarding the management of PD-related psychosis, namely few motor effects and even improvement of motor fluctuations.

The diagnosis of VP is mainly based on the patient history and requires: A) at least ten attacks of spontaneous spinning or non-spinning vertigo; B) duration less than 1 minute; C) stereotyped phenomenology in a particular patient; D) response to a treatment with carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine; and F) not better accounted for by another diagnosis. Probable VP is defined as follows: A) at least five attacks of spinning or non-spinning vertigo; B) duration less than 5 minutes; C) spontaneous occurrence or provoked by certain head-movements; D) stereotyped phenomenology in a particular patient; E) not better accounted for by another diagnosis.Ephaptic discharges in the proximal part of the 8th cranial nerve, which is covered by oligodendrocytes, are the assumed mechanism. Important differential diagnoses are Menière's disease, vestibular migraine, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, epileptic vestibular aura, paroxysmal brainstem attacks (in multiple sclerosis or after brainstem stroke), superior canal dehiscence syndrome, perilymph fistula, transient ischemic attacks and panic attacks. Current areas of uncertainty in the diagnosis of VP are: a) MRI findings of vascular compression which are not diagnostic of the disease or predictive for the affected side because they are also observed in about 30% of healthy asymptomatic subjects; and b) response to treatment with carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine supports the diagnosis but there are so far no randomized controlled trials for treatment of VP.",

      "title": "A Case of Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder",
      "abstract": "Aims: Background: Depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR), classified under ICD–11 code 6B66, involves persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Depersonalization refers to a sense of detachment from one’s thoughts, emotions, or body, whereas derealization involves perceiving the external world as unreal or distorted. These symptoms cause significant distress or impairment, are not attributable to other mental disorders, substance use, or medical conditions, and occur while reality testing remains intact. Methods: Case Report. An 18-year-old female A-level student presented with a two-year history of frequent episodes in which her surroundings, including people and familiar environments, felt unreal. These episodes varied in duration and were highly distressing, particularly during emotional extremes such as heightened happiness or stress. Symptoms were most pronounced in the evenings or when she was unoccupied, leading to emotional breakdowns. Despite these experiences, she remained aware of her own reality, with disturbances centred on external perceptions. Her symptoms began following a nine-month psychiatric hospitalization. Prior to admission, she experienced unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, and in the absence of an identifiable physical cause, she was diagnosed with conversion disorder. The hospitalization was distressing due to frequent invasive procedures, a perceived sense of blame for her condition, and feelings of entrapment. She subsequently developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of medical settings. However, DPDR symptoms persisted outside of PTSD-related re-experiencing episodes, causing ongoing distress and impairment. Results: Discussion: This case highlights the complex interplay between DPDR and PTSD, particularly following medical trauma. While dissociative symptoms frequently occur in PTSD, ICD–11 differentiates DPDR as a distinct disorder when symptoms persist beyond re-experiencing episodes. In this case, the patient’s prolonged hospitalization, combined with perceived invalidation and invasive interventions, likely contributed to the development of DPDR as a maladaptive dissociative response. The exacerbation of symptoms during emotional extremes aligns with research indicating that dissociation may function as an affect regulation mechanism. Trauma-related dissociation has been linked to disruptions in emotional processing, potentially interfering with adaptive coping strategies. This underscores the importance of targeted psychological interventions to reduce distress and improve functional outcomes. Conclusion: A trauma-informed, multidisciplinary approach is essential in managing this patient’s complex presentation. Psychological interventions such as EMDR or trauma-focused CBT should be integrated with ongoing medical care to address both dissociative symptoms and physical health concerns. Collaborative management between psychiatric and medical teams will be crucial in promoting long-term recovery, enhancing her psychological resilience, and improving overall quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Summary One hundred and eleven cases of syncope or loss of consciousness are analyzed. Most are of obscure nature while some illustrate features of syncope that deserve further scrutiny. The cases are divided into six groups: 1) Resembling cardiac syncope (30 cases); 2) vasovagal syncope (22 cases); 3) features of both cardiac and vasovagal syncope (12 cases); 4) orthostatic hypotensive (29 cases); 5) akinetic seizure? (12 cases); and 6) miscellaneous (5 cases). Some groups are subdivided according to the circumstances surrounding the spells, for example, seated eating, nocturnal, associated with bowel movement, response to anticonvulsant therapy, etc. The following conclusions seem warranted: 1) The evidence favors the existence of a type of akinetic seizure resembling cardiac syncope; 2) loss of consciousness while seated eating (prandial syncope) may comprise a syndrome; 3) syncope related to bowel movement or abdominal pain is a striking association; 4)sporadic nocturnal syncope due to temporary hyp or e activity ofbaroreceptors is not sufficiently recognized; 5) alcohol ingestion may precipitate orthostatic hy-poreactivity of baroreceptors is not sufficiently recognized; 5) alcohol ingestion may precipitate orthostatic hypotension.

The authors describe two cases of benzodiazepine withdrawal accompanied by unusual muscle activity. The neurologic mechanism for the motor abnormalities appears to be marked disinhibition of subcortical motor areas normally inhibited by gamma-aminobutyric acid. The motor phenomena may persist long after the more common signs of withdrawal have resolved and, if unrecognized, can lead to such misdiagnoses as drug seeking, conversion, hysteria, or malingering.",

Sedatives and tranquilizers may eventually enhance rather than reduce fatigue and insomnia. Appropriate medical therapy is essential for acute illness and for relatively short chronic illness, but the beneficial influence of religious activity should not be overlooked. Most elderly people deserve our confidence and respect for the way in which they have passed the tests of life. Their complaints usually are valid and should be given compassionate and enlightened attention.",

      "title": "Bipolar disorder: an overview",
      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic disorder characterised by abnormal mood changes and fluctuation in energy levels. The disease is characterised by a depressive episode, which can last up to a few months, and include low energy levels, hypersomnia, cognitive impairments, decreased sexual desire, carbohydrate craving, and weight gain. Conversely, bipolar disorder also has a stage of exhilaration and excitement, which can be classified as a manic episode. The typical presentation of these episodes of mania includes high energy hallucinations and delusions, sleep deprivation, fast speech and a constant need to be active. Risk factors that contribute to development of BD include the use of cannabis, influenza during the third trimester of pregnancy, as well as smoking during pregnancy, the use of cocaine, opioids, tranquilisers, stimulants and sedatives during pregnancy, and regular substance use during a period of a year. Parental loss before the age of five, war trauma and stress, as well as traumatic head injury may influence the condition. Clinical criteria are the mainstay of diagnosis of BD. Differentiating features, which were found to be related to BD, include early age of onset, family history, atypical features and mixed symptoms. Screening tools like the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) and Hypomania Checklist (HCL-32) have shown the ability to differentiate BD from major depressive disorder (MDD). Treatment differs between the different phases of BD, but lithium can be considered as initial monotherapy, since it is effective against manic, depressive and mixed relapses, and has shown better evidence for prevention of new episodes. It is also associated with a reduced risk of suicide and self-harm in BD patients.",

The essential feature is a cluster of cognitive, behavioral, and physiologic symptoms that constitute a dependence syndrome, indicating that the person has impaired control of psychoactive substance use and continues its use in spite of adverse consequences. Detoxification and treatment of psychiatric complications of alcoholism were discussed elsewhere. The psychotherapeutic approach is primarily supportive with many patients; the therapist plays an active and nurturing role while maintaining clear boundaries of separateness and setting firm limits that discourage acting out and enforce the abstinence rule. Treatment programs for the opioid addict include methadone maintenance, maintenance with opioid antagonists, therapeutic communities, and various abstinence-oriented recovery programs. In general, cocaine treatment programs use the methods of Alcoholics Anonymous, contingency contracting, and urine monitoring. In contrast to other substance use disorders, Nicotine Dependence alone is not associated with impairment in social or occupational functioning.",

Outcome can be psychological and physiological disturbances that can slow down progress or even downgrade performance.\r\n Prevalence of the syndrome is higher among professional runners because of setting higher demands on their bodies, indispensable for achieving top results. But syndrome also targets beginners or recreational runners.\r\n Excessive physical overload is considered to be the main cause of overtraining syndrome, but every other psychological and social stressors can atribute. In fact, accumulation of all the stressors causes collapse of the adaptation mechanisms and long term negative symptoms occur. Individual capacity for stress plays an important role in the development of the syndrome.\r\n Diagnosis of the overtraining syndrome is clinical and accomplished through history, which should demonstrate the following: (1) decreased performance persisting despite weeks and months of recovery, (2) disturbances in mood, and (3) lack of signs and symptoms or diagnosis of other possible causes of underperformance.\r\n Recovery last for weeks, often even months.\r\n It is hard to predict which runner will develop overtraining. Therefore, prevention is the key.\r\n Main components of prevention are education and follow up.\r\n Balance between optimal training and recovery is a strategy of success.\r\n Right amount od training overload and enough time to rest will result in an additional motivation, as psychological, and as physiological set out for new triumph.",

ED could be operationalized as a multidimensional maladaptive pattern of exercise, leading to clinically impairment or distress. Its criteria are: tolerance, withdrawal effects, lack of control, reductions in other activities, impaired psychological, social or physical functioning. For primary ED, the physical activity is an end in itself; for secondary ED, motivation is extrinsic--to control or alter body mass and shape. Estimates of the prevalence of ED range from 2-3% to 20-30%. Hypotheses of ED development concentrate on beta-endorphin, sympathetic arousal, affect regulation or some psychological explanations (e.g., exercise as distractor).",

OSA is characterized by ≥10-s cessation of breathing (apnea) or reduction in airflow (hypopnea) ≥5 times per hour with a drop in oxygen and/or rise in carbon dioxide. It can be associated with sleepiness and fatigue, impaired mood and cognition, cardiometabolic complications, and risk for transportation and work accidents. Although sleep apnea is diagnosed by a sleep physician, its management is interdisciplinary. The dentist’s role includes 1) screening patients for OSA risk factors (e.g., retrognathia, high arched palate, enlarged tonsils or tongue, enlarged tori, high Mallampati score, poor sleep, supine sleep position, obesity, hypertension, morning headache or orofacial pain, bruxism); 2) referring to an appropriate health professional as indicated; and 3) providing oral appliance therapy followed by regular dental and sleep medical follow-up. In addition to the device features and provider expertise, anatomic, behavioral, demographic, and neurophysiologic characteristics can influence oral appliance effectiveness in managing OSA. Therefore, OSA treatment should be tailored to each patient individually. This review highlights some of the putative action mechanisms related to oral appliance effectiveness and proposes future research directions.",

Two of the patients had major depressive disorder, recurrent, with psychotic features (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition [DSM-IV] DSM-IV 296.34) and two had bipolar disorder, not otherwise specified (DSM-IV 296.8) and presented with psychotic and manic features. In three of the four patients, prior treatment with olanzapine or risperidone or both had failed to adequately control psychotic or manic symptoms; in some cases, the treatment worsened the Parkinson's symptoms.In all four patients, ziprasidone greatly improved psychosis and mood disturbances within days. All of the patients were also treated with other medications for comorbidities; these included one or more antiparkinsonian drugs, antidepressants, and, in one case, quetiapine for insomnia. There were no observed serious adverse events, extrapyramidal side effects, or worsening of movement disorder symptoms with the administration of ziprasidone in these patients. All patients remained stable on ziprasidone combination therapy for as long as they were followed, which ranged from several months to three years.These results indicate that ziprasidone may be an efficacious and well tolerated therapy in patients with comorbid Parkinson's disease and psychiatric illness.",

      "title": "What treatment options exist for alcohol abuse?",
      "abstract": "A 47-year-old man with a long history of alcohol dependence and impaired control over intake has refused all the approaches suggested to him (e.g., detoxification followed by residential treatment, Alcoholics Anonymous, cognitive–behavioural therapy). He maintains a reasonable psychosocial adjustment (i.e., family relations, work, leisure), and physical damage (neurological, cardiovascular, liver functions) is still minimal. What can his family physician offer him?\r\n\r\nAmong the emotional and psychological problems treated by primary care physicians, alcoholism is one of the most frequent. However, little of the accumulated knowledge in alcoholism research over the past 20 years has percolated to clinical practice. Psychopharmacological agents in alcohol abuse treatment are largely ignored. At least 3 reasons are easy to identify:\r\n\r\n· Alcohol dependence, when not too severe, is not perceived as an addiction and is not put on the same footing as addictions to illicit substances.\r\n\r\n· Craving for alcohol is not linked with the long-term alterations in neuronal activity of neurotransmitter systems that alcohol abuse induces.\r\n\r\n· Their effects on treatment retention and drinking outcomes are significant but modest. The placebo groups in the clinical trials show usually so much improvement (Malec E, et al. Buspirone in the treatment of alcohol dependence: a placebo-controlled trial. Alcohol Clin Exp Res 1996;20:307-12; Kranzler HR. Pharmacotherapy of alcoholism: gaps in knowledge and opportunities for research. Alcohol Alcohol 2000;35:537-47) that large samples are necessary to demonstrate the superiority of the active medication. What does it mean? That the most important factor in the control group resides in the patient motivation (belief, expectation, readiness to change) and in the therapist's skill in enhancing motivation.\r\n\r\nThe good news concerning the psychotherapeutic approach in alcoholism is that current evidence shows that a brief intervention, easy to learn by nonspecialists, is among the most efficacious and not inferior to more intensive and more costly approaches. Severe cases, as well as less severe ones, can be handled in that way (Miller WR, Rollnick S. Motivational interviewing. 2nd ed. New York: Guilford Press; 2002). Treatment consists of detailed assessment, feedback, an empathic and nonconfrontational approach and systematic resolution of ambivalence.\r\n\r\nAmong the pharmacological adjuvants that can facilitate such brief interventions are opioid antagonists (naltrexone [50 mg/d], approved by the US FDA in 1994, and acamprosate [1.3–2 g/d], in use in Europe for 14 years and currently under review by the FDA). They interfere with the brain neurotransmitter systems that produce the rewarding effects of alcohol and have been shown to contribute significantly to prolong abstinence. Craving scores fall significantly within a few weeks. These antidipsotropic medications are low risk. Lengths of trials have extended to 1 year or more. Reported side effects for naltrexone are nausea, headaches, dizziness and arthralgia; renal insufficiency is the only known contraindication of acamprosate.\r\n\r\nOther psychopharmacological agents, such as buspirone or bromocriptine, contribute to the improvement of alcohol-induced psychopathology (anxiety, depression, aggressiveness), but have no demonstrated effect on craving and relapse prevention.\r\n\r\nThe family physician's current best choice is to learn the motivational interviewing principles and techniques, combined or not with anticraving medication.",

Despite returning to baseline after several days to weeks, patients can suddenly decompensate, exhibiting what is called postictal psychosis despite being abstinent from the substance. This condition can lead to chronic psychosis if not properly treated. In this case, a male in his twenties, presented with 1 month of auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, and paranoid delusions. After his last cocaine use 1 month ago, the patient developed seizure-like activity and shortly after returned to baseline. Approximately 1 week later, the patient started to experience psychosis. Due to persistent symptoms, the patient was admitted and started on Risperidone 2mg twice a day but did not respond. Clonazepam 1mg twice a day was added, which helped patient to return to baseline. Cocaine induced postictal psychosis is underreported, and it can be difficult to recognize. Similarly, there are few guidelines as to how to treat this condition. Clinicians need to rapidly address if they suspect that the patient is experiencing possible postictal psychosis given that this can lead to chronic psychosis.",

Whereas dopaminergic (mainly motor) symptoms are well-defined, the nondopaminergic symptoms (mainly nonmotor, such as depression, cognitive decline, anxiety, apathy, fatigue, sleep disorders, sensory symptoms, postural control deficits, orthostatic hypotension, and urogenital and gastrointestinal symptoms) are frequently missed or neglected during routine clinical visits; consequently, they are underinvestigated and undertreated. The neglect of nondopaminergic symptoms is surprising because i) they occur in almost all patients with PD throughout the course of the disease,(1) and can even precede the occurrence of the classic motor symptoms; ii) they affect almost all aspects of daily life; and iii) have a greater effect on health-related quality of life than dopaminergic symptoms.(2) During the last decade, several initiatives have addressed this deficit with specific assessment procedures for application in clinical practice and research.(1.)",

      "title": "Discontinuing an Antidepressant? Tapering Tips to Ease Distressing Symptoms",
      "abstract": "Most psychiatrists have encountered patients who report distressing symptoms when they have forgotten to take their antidepressant for a few days or during changes in the medication regimen. A discontinuation syndrome can occur with almost any antidepressant, highlighting the need to slowly, taper these medications when discontinuation is part of a treatment plan. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] This article discusses antidepressant discontinuation syndrome. (ADS) in a patient who experienced substantial distress after a rapid antidepressant taper in preparation for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). My goal is. to raise awareness of ADS, promote early detection of the syndrome, and address proper prevention and management strategies. CASE REPORT Feeling 'worse than ever' Mr. J, a 3-2-year-old tax accountant, is hospitalized for a. major depressive episode (MDE) associated, with deteriorating function and suicidal ideation. This second lifetime MDE started 8 months before his admission to an inpatient mood disorders unit. Mr. J initially was treated with fluoxetine, up to 40 mg/d across 14 weeks, with good tolerability but no significant benefit. His psychiatrist switched Mr. J to bupropion but stopped it after 4 weeks because of side effects--including headaches, insomnia, and tremor--and limited antidepressant benefit. Venlafaxine XR was initiated next, at 150 mg/d within the first 2 weeks, increased to 225 mg/d at week 6, then titrated to 300 mg/d at week 10, After 10 weeks, artiprazol, 5 mg/d, was added because Mr. J showed only partial, limited response to venlafaxine XR and this antipsychotic is indicated. for adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder. Mr. J reported mild, transient restlessness but otherwise he tolerated the medications well, and he claimed excellent adherence. After 6 additional weeks of treatment, however, Mr. J was hospitalized because of persistent severely depressed mood, increasing suicidal ideation, and inability to function at work. On admission, Mr. J is evaluated and agrees to ECT. To meet the ECT service's protocol, venlafaxine XR is reduced to 150 mg/d for 2 days and then stopped when ECT is started. Aripiprazole is continued at 5 mg/d. Mr. J tolerates the first ECT treatment well, but the morning before his second treatment he complains of feeling than ever. An agitated Mr. J reports dramatically intensified suicidal ideation--much more intrusive than before he was hospitalized. He also complains of diffuse muscle aches and cramps, runny nose, nausea, headache, and burning sensations in both arms and hands. He withdraws consent for ECT and returns to the mood disorders unit for ongoing treatment. Could this be ADS? Yes, it could. In this case, the inpatient psychiatrist and treatment team were lulled into a false sense of security by Mr. J's history of few side effects with various treatments and medication changes. The ECT service wanted the patient off venlafaxine XR before beginning ECT, and the treatment team believed a quick taper would not cause discontinuation symptoms because Mr. J was taking an extended-release medication. Within 72 hours, Mr. J went from taking 300 mg/d of venlafaxine XR to none. Within 2 days of cessation, he complained of symptoms that could characterize a discontinuation syndrome. A potential red herring in this case is that the patient complained of feeling worse after his first ECT treatment, and one might erroneously think the myalgias, headache, and other somatic symptoms were side effects of ECT and/or anesthesia. Typical ADS symptoms Nearly all antidepressant classes are associated with ADS. Symptoms vary from patient to patient but typically include the FINISH syndrome: flu-like symptoms, insomnia, nausea, imbalance, sensory disturbances, and hyperarousal (anxiety/agitation) (Table 1). …",

For example, suppression of thyrotropic function by thyroid preparations can persist for several months after cessation of therapy. The patient becomes temporarily hypothyroid even if he was originally euthyroid. Thyroid function tests to determine the original state can be misleading under these circumstances. Similarly confusing may be the temporary cessation of menstruation, consequent on lingering suppression of pituitaryovarian function after discontinuance of estrogen intake. The uncertainty about pregnancy may be worrisome. Much more serious is the suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function that lingers after withdrawal of corticosteroid therapy. Without the support of exogenous corticosteroids, the patient is unable to cope with stress, eg, trauma or infection. This potential hazard of sudden withdrawal enters into consideration when the treatment of a steroid-dependent asthmatic patient",

Postpartum depression is associated with anxiety, mood swings, tiredness, feeling scared all the time, trouble sleeping or sleeping, weight loss, stress eating, losing interest, sudden weight gain, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions, fatigue and several other issues. It can happen during pregnancy as well as after giving birth. Some women experience baby blues while some experience postpartum depression. Women feel depressed and sadly most of the time. Depression can make it difficult for mother to take care of herself and the child. Various lifestyle choices also need to be mentioned while talking about factors causing PPD. Some factors affecting PPD are lack of physical activity and exercise, bad eating habits, disturbed sleep cycle etc. it may include hormonal changes, sleep deprivation, risk factors, psychological stress. One of the chief factors affecting postpartum depression is the sleep cycle. It is seen that less sleep is brought near to postnatal depression. Exercise, psychosocial support, physical stretching or working activity can decrease symptoms of depression. Exercise causes the release of mood-boosting hormones such as dopamine and serotonin, which elevates the mood. Low esteem caused by depression can be decreased by an elevated mood. Exercise can also increase endogenous endorphins and opioids which gives a positive mood. It also increases problem solving capacity and confidence. The most common management methods used for managing depression are psychological support, professional help, interpersonal psychotherapy and cognitive therapy.",

      "title": "Daytime Drowsiness",
      "abstract": "Drowsiness is common in those with DLB and PDD, and can interfere with thinking and memory, as well as quality of life. There are a variety of potential reasons for this, many treatable. Getting a little sleepy during a boring task or napping after lunch on the weekend is not a sign of a medical problem. However, daytime drowsiness should draw attention in certain circumstances: 1. More than one nap most days, or near-daily naps that span 2 to 3 hours 2. Falling asleep during conversations or eating 3. Frequently falling asleep during reading, watching TV, doing computer work or other vigilant tasks 4. Returning to sleep after breakfast These are signs that could indicate that nighttime sleep was not adequate (nonrestorative) but could have other explanations. Daytime drowsiness has limited causes: 1. Insomnia at bedtime 2. Awakening during the night 3. Insufficient time spent in bed at night 4. Poor quality sleep at night (despite adequate time in bed) 5. Daytime medications inducing drowsiness 6. A primary sleep disorder directly causing drowsiness (which may be DLB or PDD related) We will explore each of these possible causes and how they might be diagnosed and treated. If a person with DLB or PDD is excessively drowsy, at least one of these could be the problem. Inability to get to sleep at bedtime can translate into sleepiness during the daytime. Many people with DLB or PDD who experience insomnia benefit from nighttime carbidopa/levodopa doses. The benefits of carbidopa/levodopa dosing at bedtime for Lewy-related insomnia were addressed in Chapter 9. Various other factors, however, may contribute to insomnia. Sometimes medications taken in the evening are alerting. Such drugs include duloxetine (Cymbalta) or venlafaxine (Effexor), used for depression and often dosed twice daily. Elimination of all but the morning dose may allow sleep in such cases. Other drugs for depression from the Prozac class (SSRIs; see the list in Chapter 18) may also cause insomnia if taken at bedtime. A simple strategy is to simply switch to morning dosing on a trial basis. The tricyclic antidepressants, such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, or protriptyline, should not cause insomnia; they may induce sleep.

After several visits to the same reason for consulting an exploratory interview alone with the patient in that regard that “sometimes when calms nervous scratching the walls and eating them” is performed. The mother says intrafamily difficulties. Information reported by the patient's mother confirms next visit also providing pictures on the wall of your room is returned. Referral to child and adolescent mental health is decided. Exploration/complementary tests There is no single test for pica. It is carried out systematic blood, biochemical (iron, zinc, lead…) to assess toxic substances and nutritional levels. Abdominal Rx. Both normal. Diagnosis Pica (F98.3). Differential diagnosis Ingestion of nutrients can occur in the course of other mental disorders (for example, a pervasive developmental disorder, schizophrenia), mental retardation, in the Kleine–Levin syndrome… In these cases, should only be established an additional diagnosis of pica if the feeding behavior is sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention. Conclusions Pica disorder has been studied by pediatricians, gynecologists, dermatologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, nutritionists, anthropologists, etc., which has been interpreted as a conduct disorder, food, mental illness, poverty, hunger… but really the cause it is unknown. Although morbidity and mortality is unknown and difficult to study, include poisonings, parasitosis and surgical abdomen as serious complications. Finally, like all other eating disorders, the overall management of this entity requires the coordinated intervention of various professionals.

The patient may develop signs of acute encephalopathy including aggressive combative behavior, hallucinations, decreasing responsiveness to external stimuli, loss of deep tendon reflexes, decorticate or decerebrate posturing, and finally loss of brain-stem function and death. Other clinical findings frequently observed include hyperventilation, widely dilated pupils which respond only to strong light, and mild hepatomegaly.",

Patients may use nicotine, alcohol, cannabis, cocaine or other drugs of abuse in order to overcome symptoms associated with schizophrenia itself or with the side effects of the antipsychotic medications used to treat the underlying illness. The impact of substance abuse for comorbid substance abusers compared with nonabusing schizophrenia patients includes a lower quality of life, increased tardive dyskinesia, increased psychosocial problems, more relationship difficulties, cognitive deficits and even suicide. Patients with a dual diagnosis also tend to have higher relapse rates, higher rates of hospitalization, and by inference, increased healthcare costs.

In recent years,1 a diagnosis of insomnia has also included a report of decreased daytime function associated with the poor sleep at night to differentiate a patient with insomnia from an individual who simply requires less sleep. Insomnia may be either an acute or a chronic problem. Acute insomnia, usually defined as poor sleep associated with a specific life event, such as an important examination, resolves when the event passes or within a period of 3 weeks. Chronic insomnia may begin after an acute episode, if conditioning factors are involved, but typically presents as a long-standing complaint despite varied attempts at treatment.",

Cortical spreading depression (a depolarization wave across the brain cortex) is believed to be the underlying mechanism for a migraine aura, and observed vascular changes are considered epiphenomena. It is likely that there is an individual threshold for spreading depression, influenced by genetic factors.1\n\nIn migraine aura status, patients experience a large number of consecutive (mostly) visual auras, very often without headache.2 Between the auras, the patient is without symptoms. Episodes can last for weeks, and within this period several migraine auras can occur on one day. An aura status generally resolves spontaneously, but during the episodes most patients are greatly bothered by it and cannot perform their daily activities. The treatment of migraine aura status is unknown. One patient failed to improve on daily doses of aspirin, and subsequently appeared to improve on cyproheptadine.2 Other reports of treatments for aura status are lacking.\n\nIn the last few years, seven patients with aura status visited our outpatient clinic.

We present a case of a 58-year-old female with no prior psychiatric history who presented to the psychiatric emergency room with a three-week history of feeling depressed, anhedonic, hopeless, helpless, and worthless, associated with poor sleep, poor concentration, low energy, significant weight loss due to lack of appetite, and suicidal ideations after she saw her ex-boyfriend holding hands with another woman. Patient exhibited symptoms such as mutism, hyperextension of spine, clinching of jaw, psychomotor retardation which suggested probable diagnosis of catatonia at the background of major depressive disorder nonresponding to treatment.

      "abstract": "Many patients are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for acute intoxication, serious complication of overdose, or withdrawal symptoms of illicit drugs. An acute withdrawal of drugs with addiction potential is associated with a sympathetic overactivity leading to marked psychomimetic disturbances. Acute intoxication or withdrawal of such drugs is often associated with life-threatening complications which require ICU admission and necessitate prolonged sedative analgesic medications, weaning from which is often complicated by withdrawal and other psychomimetic symptoms. Dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 (α(2)) agonist, has been used successfully to facilitate withdrawal and detoxification of various drugs and also to control delirium in ICU patients. Herein, we report a case of a chronic opioid abuse (heroin) patient admitted with acute overdose complications leading to a prolonged ICU course requiring sedative-analgesic medication; the drug withdrawal-related symptoms further complicated the weaning process. Dexmedetomidine infusion was successfully used as a sedative-analgesic to control the withdrawal-related psychomimetic symptoms and to facilitate smooth detoxification and weaning from opioid and other sedatives.",

      "title": "Potential Adverse Effects of Discontinuing Psychotropic Drugs",
      "abstract": "Understanding the particular pharmacology of different antidepressant drugs can help explain their adverse effects when they are discontinued. For all antidepressant drugs, abruptly stopping them can sometimes result in “rebound” hypomania or mania. Antidepressant drugs having anticholinergic effects often are associated with a discontinuation syndrome characterized by cholinergic rebound, with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, sweating, headache, and muscle spasms. Discontinuation of monoamine oxidase inhibitor drugs sometimes results in flu-like symptoms, dysphoria, restlessness, tachycardia, hypertension, and a delirium-like state. Serotonergic antidepressant drugs are sometimes associated with a distinct discontinuation syndrome characterized by dizziness, weakness, nausea, headache, lethargy, insomnia, anxiety, poor concentration, and paresthesias. Adverse discontinuation effects can occur with all types of antidepressant drugs, but only rarely would they be considered serious. To minimize adverse discontinuation effects and to reduce the risk of relapse or recurrence of the underlying treated condition, tapering antidepressant medication is prudent for all patients.",

Initial treatment usually includes lifestyle interventions and behavioural modifications such as: reducing fluid intake at least 4 hours prior to bedtime, e.g. caffeine and/or alcohol, both of which are mild diuretics; limiting excessive food volume intake prior to bedtime, e.g. fruits, vegetables; in those with dependent oedema—adequate exercise, elevating the leg in the afternoon above the heart level, compression stockings; and emptying the bladder before going to bed. If conservative treatment fails to control the patient’s symptoms, then medical treatment is aimed at the primary cause of the nocturia. Combination therapy may be required in some cases. However, high-quality clinical trials looking at these combinations are lacking.",

Both cases experienced visual and auditory hallucinations in addition to dizziness, headache, insomnia, and nausea a couple of days after paroxetine discontinuation. These observations suggest that hallucinations are a part of the discontinuation syndrome that results from paroxetine discontinuation. Physicians should be aware of this symptom.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A hiccup is a sudden contraction of the inspiratory and diaphragmatic muscles followed by an abrupt closure of the glottis; that produces a characteristic noise resulting from vibrations of the vocal cords. Brief episodes of hiccups are common in humans at all stages of life and are usually benign. Prolonged attacks that last for days or weeks are considered a more serious phenomenon and may indicate an underlying disorder warranting a comprehensive medical evaluation. These attacks have been associated with significant burden and morbidity. The most common triggers for acute hiccups are linked with gastro-intestinal causes, such as the gastric distension that occurs after an abundant meal, or with gastroesophageal disease. Sudden changes in temperature, excessive alcohol consumption, as well as excitement or emotional stress, may also set off acute hiccups. Certain drugs, including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and many others, have been reported to induce hiccups. Drug-induced hiccups are diagnosed by exclusion of other causes and represent a very unusual side-effect of drugs like corticosteroids. We present a case of hiccups associated with intra-articular Diprospan (Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate) administration.",

      "title": "How once-nightly sodium oxybate is processed in the body in healthy volunteers: a plain language summary",
      "abstract": "What is this summary about? This is a plain language summary of an article originally published in the journal Sleep Medicine. Narcolepsy is a sleep condition in which people have periods of extreme sleepiness during the day. People with narcolepsy may also have symptoms of muscle weakness (cataplexy); seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, or feeling something that seems real but isn't actually there before falling asleep or while waking up (hallucinations); an inability to move before falling asleep or while waking up (sleep paralysis); and poor sleep at night. Sodium oxybate (SXB for short) has been used to treat narcolepsy for over 20 years. For more than 20 years, the only available form of SXB needed to be taken twice each night. Twice-nightly SXB (TN-SXB) requires people to take the first dose at bedtime. Most people fall asleep within 5 to 15 minutes after the first dose. Patients then need to wake up and take the second dose of TN-SXB 2.5 to 4 hours later, which is when most of the medicine has left the body. The United States Food and Drug Administration (also called FDA) approved a once-nightly form of SXB called LUMRYZ ™ (sodium oxybate for extended-release oral suspension; ON-SXB for short) in May 2023. ON-SXB treats excessive daytime sleepiness and muscle weakness, also known as cataplexy. People with narcolepsy who take ON-SXB only need to take 1 dose at bedtime. This summary describes a study that looked at how ON-SXB enters, travels through, and exits the body of healthy volunteers (people without narcolepsy). The study measured the amount of SXB in the blood after taking SXB in 2 different ways: as a once-nightly version and as a twice-nightly version. Looking at the amount of ON-SXB and TN-SXB in the blood at different time points helps researchers see if people who take the 2 medicines, with different dosing, have the same amount of drug in the body overnight. What were the results? Overall, the study found that healthy volunteers had the same amount of SXB in their bodies after taking ON-SXB as they did after taking TN-SXB. When they took the same amounts of ON-SXB and TN-SXB, the SXB stayed in their bodies for similar amounts of time. The highest amount and the total amount of SXB in the participants' blood were similar with ON-SXB and TN-SXB. The amount of SXB in the participants' blood 8 hours after taking the medicine was significantly lower with ON-SXB than with TN-SXB. This means that people taking ON-SXB will have less medication in their blood when they wake up the next morning and may be less groggy. What do the results mean? The results mean that if people with narcolepsy take the same dose amount of ON-SXB or TN-SXB, their bodies will receive the same amount of SXB in their blood. ON-SXB provides an option for people with narcolepsy to take their medicine once at bedtime without the need for a middle-of-the-night dose, which can improve quality of life.",

      "abstract": "The Rome diagnostic criteria for the functional bowel disorders and functional abdominal pain are used widely in research and practice. A committee consensus approach, including criticism from multinational expert reviewers, was used to revise the diagnostic criteria and update diagnosis and treatment recommendations, based on research results. The terminology was clarified and the diagnostic criteria and management recommendations were revised. A functional bowel disorder (FBD) is diagnosed by characteristic symptoms for at least 12 weeks during the preceding 12 months in the absence of a structural or biochemical explanation. The irritable bowel syndrome, functional abdominal bloating, functional constipation, and functional diarrhea are distinguished by symptom-based diagnostic criteria. Unspecified FBD lacks criteria for the other FBDs. Diagnostic testing is individualized, depending on patient age, primary symptom characteristics, and other clinical and laboratory features. Functional abdominal pain (FAP) is defined as either the FAP syndrome, which requires at least six months of pain with poor relation to gut function and loss of daily activities, or unspecified FAP, which lacks criteria for the FAP syndrome. An organic cause for the pain must be excluded, but aspects of the patient’s pain behavior are of primary importance. Treatment of the FBDs relies upon confident diagnosis, explanation, and reassurance. Diet alteration, drug treatment, and psychotherapy may be beneficial, depending on the symptoms and psychological features.",

Nonpharmacologic treatments include moderate exercise; good sleep hygiene; elimination of alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine; and hot baths, massage, and stretching. Activities promoting mental alertness may improve symptoms. Moderate exercise and use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure are the only nonpharmacologic treatments with proven benefit. For intermittent restless legs syndrome, carbidopa/levodopa and nonpharmacologic therapy are recommended as primary treatments. For daily restless legs syndrome, dopamine agonists, particularly ropinirole and pramipexole, are suggested as the drugs of choice. Carbidopa/levodopa could be considered for daily restless legs syndrome, but augmentation is a significant drawback to its use. Carbamazepine and gabapentin have limited data to support their use.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT To the Editor:— The editorial comment on Dr. Gibbs' letter ( Withdrawal Convulsions: Epileptic or Not? JAMA190:944 [Dec 7] 1964) merits elaboration. Nowadays, as part of complete medical work-up, patients with a wide variety of complaints, ranging from life-long headache in the 60-year-old to transient hyperactivity in the 4-year-old, will often have electroencephalograms done. A certain proportion of these tracings will deviate from the standard even in the absence of other clinical or laboratory abnormalities. Some of these patients will be placed on a regimen of anticonvulsants in an effort to help with the primary complaint. A certain number of this group will abruptly discontinue medication for a variety of reasons, amongst which may be lack of change in the primary complaint. When a patient has his first seizure on such withdrawal, this could lead to his being labeled an epileptic, because to the presence of an abnormal EEG",

Patients with physical injury requiring rehabilitation may be at particular risk of AODA due to pain, physical handicaps, mood disturbances, vocational difficulties, and problems of self-image. Their access to AODA, however, is often temporarily or permanently limited. In this literature review, we have explored various aspects of AODA in physically disabled patients. Frequently, AODA are involved in the cause of physical injuries. The average use and abuse of alcohol prior to injury was high. Postinjury alcohol use and abuse frequently declined or remained unchanged. Some non-alcohol drug use and problems increased postinjury, particularly during initial periods. Postinjury abuse of AODA is particularly important with regard to the disruption of the rehabilitation process. Use of adequate control groups and analysis at multiple postinjury time points is recommended in future investigations.",

Confusion, psychomotor restlessness, hallucinations and disorientation, stupor and coma were the main features; some had convulsions and a few exhibited focal neurological deficits or neuropathies. The signs appeared within 2 days in almost half of the patients, and remitted in most within 2-3 days. Predisposing factors, of which more than one may be present, are advanced age, hepatic or renal dysfunction, or severe underlying disease. The 3 cases described were all old, one had cirrhosis with bleeding oesophageal varices, and one had renal failure with nephrotic syndrome and amyloidosis. In view of the increasingly wide use of cimetidine, conditions in which there is decreased metabolic breakdown, or excretion, or predisposition to increased brain levels should prompt careful follow-up, and possibly a lower dosage regimen, especially in elderly patients.",

Sharma Sir, The term tardive dyskinesia has been used to refer to a group of delayed-onset abnormal involuntary movement disorders that present with rapid, repetitive, stereotypic choreoathetoid movements mostly involving the oral, buccal, and lingual areas or the trunk (oro-bucco-lingual variety ).[sup] [1] The word Tardiv e means late appearing movements which start after 3months of neuroleptic exposure.[sup] [2] The annual rate is estimated at 5% for the early years, the cumulative rates over 5 years being between 20-26%.[sup] [3] Most patients with TD have schizophrenia but it can develop in-patients with depression or anxiety. Risk factors for TD are age over 40 years, affective disorder, Negroes, prolonged use and use of high potency neuroleptics in high doses, early occurrence of drug-induced Parkinson's disease, and female gender and smoking, chronic use of anticholinergic drugs and diabetes mellitus.[sup] [1],[3],[4] Of the various pathogenic mechanisms proposed, dopamine receptor hypersensitivity, damage to GABA containing -neurons and free radical formation from catecholamine metabolism are the most widely accepted.[sup] [5] Following are some of the proposed guidelines for its treatment: 1) minimal dose of the causative antipsychotic or switching over to clozapine, after tapering off the offending antipsychotic drug slowly.[sup] [1] 2) Dopamine-depleting drugs -Reserpine (1 to 8 mg/day), Tetrabenazine (25 to 150 mg/day).[sup] [4],[6] 3) GABA-enhancing drugs Clonazepam (1 to 4 mg/day), Valproate, Vigabatrin, Baclofen, 4) Antioxidants: Vitamin E 800 IU/bid.[sup] [1],[7] A 34-year-old male was referred to the Psychiatry OPD of our hospital with complaints of involuntary movement of orofacial region along with difficulty in breathing and swallowing, pain in nuchal region and backache. A detailed examination revealed that the patient had complex repetitive movements of orofacial region including forehead and eyebrows raising, eye closure, puckering of lips, to and fro movements of head and neck, protrusion of and twisting and darting out movement tongue in between the parted lips and repeated clenching of teeth. The patient reported that 3 years ago he had faced some financial loss as result of which he suffered from a bout of depression for which he consulted a private psychiatrist who prescribed him Trifluoperazine 10 mg along with T.Citalopram 20mg and T. Trihexyphenidyl 2mg and T. Propranolol 10-mg tid. After 2 years the patient developed TD. Patient was nonalcoholic but chronic smoker and tobacco chewer since 15 years. His baseline assessment of abnormal involuntary movement scale (AIMS)[sup] [8] revealed a score of 21 qualifying for diagnosis of Tardive Dyskinesia (TD) . All psychotropic drugs were tapered off and a course of Tetrabenazine 25mg 1/2 hs bid was started which was increased to 25mg bid and then tid after 2 weeks. In addition to this Clonazepam 0.5 mg I hs and Cap Vit E 400 mg 1 OD were added. The patient reported a dramatic improvement within first 2 weeks of starting the treatment (AIMS score-13) and finally achieving a score of AIMS - 10 at the end of four weeks. …",

      "title": "Ketamine for Chronic Non-Cancer Pain: A Review of Clinical Effectiveness, Cost-Effectiveness, and Guidelines [Internet]",
      "abstract": "In Canada, about one in five adults older than 18 years of age live with chronic pain. Pain can be sub-defined by three main biological mechanisms: 1) Nociceptive pain (from damage to body tissue, as in injury, disease or inflammation); 2) Neuropathic pain (from direct damage of the nervous system); and 3) Nociplastic pain (from a change in sensory neurons function). Chronic pain is associated with significant emotional distress, like anxiety, anger, frustration and depression, and is recognized by the World Health Organization as a disease by itself listed in the International Classification of Disease version 11. Treatment and management of chronic pain are complex and difficult, involving multiple interventions, including pharmacological and psychological interventions. Pharmacological interventions considered for chronic pain include nonopioid analgesics (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen), antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, other adjuvant medications (e.g., topical agents, cannabis and cannabinoids), opioid, and infusion therapies (e.g., ketamine, lidocaine).Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has been approved and primarily used as an anesthetic induction agent in doses ranging between 1 and 4.5 mg/kg. As it also interacts with other receptors, ketamine has been explored for other indications such as depressive disorders, suicidal ideation, substance-use disorders, anxiety disorders, refractory status epilepticus, bronchial asthma exacerbations, and pain management. In hospital and emergency department, ketamine has been used for pain management of acute conditions such as burns, trauma, or post-operative pain. Recently, intravenous (IV) ketamine infusions has been increasingly used as a treatment option for acute pain as well as chronic non-cancer pain such as complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), neuropathic pain, and other refractory chronic pain conditions. Despite potential opportunities of ketamine for numerous indications, the use of ketamine is known to be associated with psychotomimetic effects such as euphoria, dysphoria, psychomotor retardation, hallucinations, vivid dreams, and nightmares, as common side effects. Given the availability of ketamine of different formulations and its potential opportunities in pain management, there is a need to determine its benefits and risks in the treatment of chronic pain.The aim of this report is to review the evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of ketamine for treating chronic non-cancer pain in adults. This report also aims to review the evidence-based guidelines regarding the use of ketamine for chronic non-cancer pain.",

      "abstract": "A drug can be defined as a substance other than food which may affect the constitution or function of a living thing through its chemical properties. In this sense, it may be possible to place organic solvents like bond, gas or thinner and narcotics like marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine or heroine under the category of drugs. These drugs are characteristic of having positive medicinal as well as side effects upon human being including but not limited to excitement, hallucinatory image, auditory hallucination, relaxation, sleeping, anorexia, nerve stability, schizophrenia, anaesthesia, brain damage, narcissism, etc. Abuse of drugs, however, would result in direct and indirect impact upon the society, family and industry as a whole by ruining of families, unemployment, loss of manpower, and catastrophic damage of physical and mental health of all people. Strong cling to drugs could also cause devastation of personality by abandoning relationship with family members and friends and even jobs, hobbies and culture and would eventually make addicts unsociable. Furthermore, abuse of drugs could be a cause for more serious phenomenon of social pathology such as drastic increase of inhuman violent crimes, crimes without specific motives, frequent burglary and theft to raise the money to buy drugs with. In contrast with the global trend to enforce the regulations for drug-related crimes, the Korean judiciary authorities keep on dealing leniently with offenders, especially when they are first timers, by only charging the fine not exceeding 50 million Won. To put use of drugs under control, it seems more effective to install and operate facilities which are dedicated to providing supports for drug addicts to get free from the cycle of crimes and return to the society. In sum, it would be extremely important to study the measures needed to prevent occurrence of drug-related crimes because the issue of addiction can not　rely on legal punishments alone. The legal system that imposes heavy penalty upon drug-related crimes may be effective to a certain extent in terms of crime prevention but has limit in itself. It is therefore most imperative to respond in a more active way to prevention of drug-related crimes by introducing the educational programs for drug addiction, by training experts who can treat drug addicts, not to speak of working out preventive measures from the perspective of criminal legislation and socio-cultural aspects as well.",

Anxiety sensitivityAnxiety sensitivity (AS) refers to individual differences in the fear of anxietyrelated sensations and the expectation that such sensations can have harmful consequences (Reiss, 1997;Reiss & McNally, 1985).Just as some people are afraid of spiders, some individuals fear the sensations that accompany anxiety.This construct AS can be measured with the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) (Peterson & Reiss, 1992;Reiss, Peterson, Gursky, & McNally, 1986).AS has been proposed as a risk factor for the development of anxiety disorders, specifically PD (Reiss, 1991).Besides AS, trait anxiety is also regarded as a vulnerability factor for the de- Chapter 2Reactivity to a 35% CO2 challenge in healthy first-degree relatives of patients with panic disorder Background: The effects of a 35% CO2 challenge were examined in healthy firstdegree relatives of panic disorder patients and in healthy control subjects matched for age and gender.Methods: One single inhalation of a 35% CO2 / 65% O2 challenge was administered to 50 first-degree relatives of panic disorder patients and 50 control subjects.Results: The first-degree relatives were more reactive to the 35% CO2 challenge than the control subjects.Conclusions: These findings indicate that being a member of a family with a panic disorder patient is, in itself, an important factor in CO2 hypersensitivity among subjects who have never experienced a panic attack.Both panic disorder patients and their first-degree relatives have a tendency to be more reactive to the CO2 challenge.van Beek, N., & Griez, E.

      "abstract": "Drug allergies represent nowadays the big imitators of diseases. One of the still puzzling diseases with irritates doctors and patients alike is the severe drug (induced) hypersensitivity syndrome (D[i]HS), often also called drug rash (or reaction) with eosinolphilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). It appears after 2 ― 12 weeks of treatment, affects liver (hepatitis), but also other organs like the heart (carditis), lung (pneumonitis), colon (colitis) and kidney (nephritis). Most cases have an exanthema, a rather typical swelling of the face, fever and a massive eosinophilia. Eliciting drugs are antiepileptics, certain sulfanil-amides like sulfasalazin and sulfamethoxozalole, minocyclin, allopurinol and antiretroviral agents. Depending on the eliciting drug, some organs are more frequently affected than others. The diagnosis of a drug hypersensitivity reaction underlying the severe disease is often delayed and doubted, in particular as many symptoms may continue for weeks and reappear later with other, non related drugs. Recurrences of symptoms may also be precipitated around the third week by reactivation of herpes viruses (HHV-6, CMV). Since the lethality is in the range of 10%, an early diagnosis and use of corticosteroid in cases with severe organ involvement is necessary.",

      "abstract": "Review of 19 uncontrolled studies of antidepressants in phobic and in obsessive-compulsive disorders suggests that such drugs do not act reliably in the absence of symptoms of anxiety-depression (dysphoria). In dysphoric patients the drugs have a broad-spectrum effect, not only reducing phobias and rituals but also anxiety-depression, panic, anger, and hostility, all of which are highly intercorrelated, but none yet demonstrated to be the core disturbance. Phobics, but not obsessive-compulsives, have an unusually high dropout rate from treatment when drugs or placebo are given. When antidepressants are stopped, even after 6-8 months, relapse is likely. The drugs do not reduce the liability of many phobics and obsessive-compulsives to have dysphoric episodes over the years. Exposure treatments are not lastingly effective for phobias and for rituals, but do not reduce the liability to later dysphoric episodes.",

      "abstract": "Delirium is frequently observed in individuals aged 65 and older (10–30%).1 Delirium has an acute onset—within hours to days—and exhibits a fluctuating course. Delirium is characterized by distorted attention, reduced awareness of the environment, alteration in at least one cognitive area (disturbed memory, orientation, language, perception), and change in sleep cycles.2 Because of the wide range of clinical presentation, clinicians often do not identify or misdiagnose cases of delirium individuals; hypoactive delirium presenting with lethargy, confusion, and indifference to the environment is the most difficult to diagnose subtype, despite being the most commonly occurring type in elderly adults.3 An 87-year-old woman was brought to the geriatric department because of forgetfulness (not recognizing her children), being introverted, distractibility, indifference to the environment, lack of appetite, refusal to take medications, and hallucinations such as seeing her deceased husband in the room for the previous 2 days. She had no known cognitive deficiency. Physical examination showed a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a body temperature of 37.4°C. All systemic examinations were normal. Assessment of mental condition revealed cognitive and perception problems with disturbances of memory and orientation. Psychomotor activity was found to be poor, and she gave short answers to questions during the interview and refused to talk. Based on these clinical findings and symptoms, the newly developed clinical picture was thought to be hypoactive delirium, and she was admitted to the geriatric service. Examination immediately after admission revealed a sinus rhythm electrocardiogram with no pathological characteristics. She had leukocytosis (13,000/μL). Biochemistry showed normal liver, thyroid, and kidney functions, with no electrolyte imbalance. Urinalysis showed no evidence of infection. No pneumonic consolidation or effusion was detected on chest X-ray. Brain tomography ordered to exclude cranial pathology due to acute mental alteration revealed no pathological findings. Sedimentation was 90 mm/h (normal <15 mm/h), C-reactive protein was 115 mg/L (normal 0.1–8.2 mg/L), and lumbar puncture performed to exclude aseptic meningitis and encephalitis was normal. On the fifth day, she was persistently encouraged to mobilize because she did not want to get out of bed and wished to sleep continuously, but she developed exertional dyspnea and syncope. D-dimer was 13,115 mg/L (normal 0–0.5 mg/L), so thoracic tomography was ordered. Filling defects at the main and segmental branches of the pulmonary arteries consistent with embolus were observed on both sides, being more prominent on the right side, and minimal pleural effusion was observed on the left side (Figure 1). Lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasonography findings were consistent with subacute deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity. She was started on 1 mg/kg of enoxaparin sodium twice daily, with the addition of warfarin on the third day. On the fifth day of anticoagulation therapy, the delirium was completely resolved, and she was discharged. During outpatient follow-up, warfarin treatment was regulated to maintain an international normalized ratio level of 2.5–3.5, and she developed no new delirium. Delirium is associated with poor functional capacity, likelihood of admission to a nursing home, mortality, morbidity, and admission to the hospital.4, 5 Hypoactive delirium is the most commonly encountered subtype in elderly adults. Unlike the other subtypes, individuals behave as if they are sedated and do not harm themselves or others; as a consequence, clinicians often do not identify such individuals or misdiagnose them with depression or dementia. Simple conditions such as untreated urinary system infection, constipation, and pain may cause delirium in elderly adults, although life-threatening conditions such as myocardial infarction and stroke can also cause it.6 Pulmonary embolus (PE) may not always cause typical symptoms as dyspnea; it is asymptomatic (32% of cases) or may present with atypical symptoms as acute confusion, chest and back pain, and syncope.7 Rarely, one of the atypical clinical presentations of PE may be delirium, as mentioned in this case report, and PE should be investigated in elderly adults presenting with delirium, even in the absence of typical symptoms. In conclusion, while assessing the etiology of delirium, clinicians should remember that one of the acute conditions leading to development of delirium is PE, particularly in elderly adults.

The commonest variety is true trigeminal neuralgia or tic doloureux, and it has certain definite characteristics which distinguish it and without which the diag‐ nosis should be reviewed. Eight other varieties of facial neuralgia are classified and described. Some of theses have a definite cause and are as‐ sociated with tumours or aneurysms The treatment of these various conditions is discussed on the following 1ines: (a) Analgesics. (b) Anti‐neuritic vitamins. (c) Injections of alcohol into the branches of the 5th nerve, its roots or the Gasserian ganglion. (d) Resection of the sensory root of the 5th nerve. (e) Attack upon the sympathetic nerves or blood vessels supplying the af‐fected area. (f) Removal or correction of the cause, when known. (g) Prefrontal leucotomy for intractable pain. Migraine and neuralgias of nasal and ocular origin are omitted.",

Case presentation: A twenty one year old indian male patient who is a known case of generalized epilepsy for past 2 years on sodium valproate presented with acute onset chorea, four days after starting phenytoin sodium with normal serum phenytoin levels. After excluding the other possible causes of chorea, phenytoin was withdrawn which resulted in a dramatic subsidence of chorea .On rechallenge with phenytoin patient again developed chorieform movements which again subsided after drug withdrawl, thus implicating phenytoin as the possible etiological agent for chorea Conclusion:Phenytoin rarely induces involuntary movements as adverse effect.During phenytoin therapy,if a patient develops involuntary movements,phenytoin toxicity should be suspected. Drug withdrawl leads to complete symptomatic improvement thereby avoiding extensive workup for other secondary causes.

The fear may involve most social interactions/situations where it is possible to be judged or be confronted with specific public performance. Anticipation of these situations is also experienced with uneasiness, distress or fear. The course of SP is that of a chronic, unremitting lifelong disease and secondary complications such as depression, substance abuse (alcohol or tranquillisers) and suicide attempts may be associated with it, thus making the disorder severely disabling. SP is increasingly recognised as one of the more common anxiety disorders.",

      "title": "Drug treatments for schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "This paper summarises the research evidence presented in a recent issue of Effective Health Care on drug treatments for schizophrenia.1\n\nSchizophrenia is an illness or a group of illnesses affecting language, planning, emotion, perceptions, and movement. In the UK, approximately 250 000 people suffer from schizophrenia or a schizophrenia-like illness.2\n\nA quarter of those who have experienced an episode of schizophrenia recover and the illness does not recur. Another 25% experience an unremitting illness. The remaining 50% have a recurrent illness, but with long episodes of considerable recovery from positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disordered thinking, and catatonic movements.3 Many with recurrent illness have enduring problems from schizophrenia such as persistent psychotic symptoms, but, for most people, the problems consist of negative symptoms such as loss of enthusiasm and emotional responsiveness, apathy, and social withdrawal.3 These negative symptoms, though intrinsic to schizophrenia, are compounded by the adverse effects of drugs, living in impoverished circumstances, and by the social stigma associated with mental illness. Recovery from episodes of schizophrenia for some people is often complicated by episodes of depression, substance abuse, and anxiety. People with schizophrenia have a shortened life expectancy4 due to physical illness, accidents, and other causes of violent death, especially suicide.5\n\nTreatments for schizophrenia are divided into the so-called “physical interventions” of drugs, psychological and social managements and, rarely in the UK, electroconvulsant treatment. This article draws upon evidence from systematic reviews undertaken by the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group, and summarises the evidence on the effectiveness of the main drugs used in the treatment of schizophrenia. More detailed information is available on each treatment within the referenced reviews. These reviews are regularly updated in the Cochrane Library .6\n\nThe main class of drugs used to treat or manage schizophrenia is antipsychotics …",

Three categories of manifestations of psycho-violence are distinguished: verbal aggression; dominant behavior; manifestations of jealousy that affect the victim of violence in different ways. Violations developing after the experienced psycho-violence affect all levels of an individual’s functioning and lead to sustainable personality changes. Objective: to identify the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories. My theoretical study of the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories made it possible to identify specific features of the consequences for different age categories. Consequences for children: sleep disturbances; hyperreactivity; impaired memory and concentration; irritability; a sharp decline in school performance; change of worldview; the emergence of many complexes; low self-esteem; maladaptation; health problems (various diseases occur); difficulty in building relationships; developmental delays (mental, emotional, speech); constant stress, fear, expectation of danger; suicidal tendency, asocial lifestyle. The consequences of psycho-violence in adults are disorders of a psychological and physical nature: sleep disturbances; nervous breakdowns; irritability; depression; anxiety; difficulty concentrating; panic conditions, heart attacks; loss of self-esteem; decreased self-esteem; violation of social relations; decrease in labor productivity. The consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories are different, the general thing is that violations affect all levels of a person’s functioning and lead to persistent personality changes.",

Cravings are mediated by brain activation in the amygdala region. Cravings can be activated by exposure to drug cues via classical conditioning. Memories associated with substance use can trigger a craving. Usually, cravings decrease in frequency and intensity as recovery progresses and the client abstains from substance use. The objectives of this chapter are to help the client identify and label a craving to use substances, to teach the client to monitor and rate the level of intensity of cravings, to identify internal and external factors that trigger cravings, and to teach cognitive, behavioral, environmental, and interpersonal strategies to manage alcohol or drug cravings.",

Both were transferred from other asylums, apparently incurable. In each instance the primary condition was one of melancholia, with marked suicidal tendencies, giving place, after a considerable interval, to a definite and prolonged maniacal phase. In one case the resumption of pursuits, abstention from which had presumably brought on the attack, seemed to be the main agent in restoring the mental balance; in the other the shock of a physical injury appeared to be the starting point in the road to convalescence.",

      "title": "Optimising Epilepsy Therapy – Searching for the Evidence – Looking Beyond the Data",
      "abstract": "There is now an extensive range of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) available including older established treatments and a newer generation of medications. The choice of drugs and what constitutes optimal therapy, however, is unclear due to limitations in the data supporting their use, particularly among the newer treatments. In clinical trials of monotherapy, a treatment is required to show only non-inferiority to another benchmark treatment. In trials of polytherapy, comparisons are limited to placebo. It is therefore necessary to look beyond the study data and consider other parameters to ascertain the most suitable treatment for the individual patient. Available evidence suggests that efficacy is similar among most AEDs, but this does not mean they are all the same. Some show efficacy in early and refractory epilepsy and some improve depression and quality of life (QOL) in epilepsy. AEDs are associated with a range of adverse events (AEs) that can limit their usefulness. AE classifications include type A (augmented and dose related) including tiredness, fatigue, insomnia, dizziness, vertigo, imbalance, ataxia, tremor and cognitive impairment; type B (bizarre and idiosyncratic) including various hypersensitivity reactions; type C (chronic long-term toxicity) including hirsutism, alopecia, weight gain and obesity; and type D (teratogenesis and carcinogenesis). The newer AEDs have been more thoroughly assessed for AEs than older drugs and risks are better understood. In AED safety, it is not better to follow a policy of ‘better the devil you know’ but rather to carefully monitor AE incidence and be prepared to switch drugs to improve tolerability and avoid non-compliance and treatment failure.",

Psychiatric emergencies can have a variety of presentations and occur in a variety of settings:. A psychiatric emergency can be conceptualized under following broad categories: Acute onset of illness in a person with no past background of a psychiatric illness Acute exacerbation of a chronic psychiatric illness or an acute relapse in a psychiatric illness of recurring nature Psychiatric symptoms resulting from an underlying medical illness or use of a psychoactive substance or prescription drug. Behavioral symptoms occurring related to use of psychoactive substances Common Psychiatric Emergencies Suicide : Suicide can be defined as intentional self inflicted death. There are three terms frequently used while discussing suicide: suicidal ideation or intent, suicidal attempt or attempted suicide, and completed suicide. Suicide, as such, means completed suicide. Delirium: Transient disorder of brain function manifested by global cognitive impairment, alteration of consciousness and behavioral disturbances. Alcohol Related Emergencies: It is maladaptive behavior after the recent consumption of alcohol. Blood serum alcohol levels range from 10-20 mg/dl in patients who have pathological intoxication to 400- 500 mg/dl or more in patients who are obtunded or near death. Others include:- Delirium Tremens, Psychiatric Emergencies in Disaster Survivors, Rape and Sexual Abuse etc.",

      "title": "Electrodiagnostic Evaluation Of Critical Illness Neuropathy",
      "abstract": "As medicine advances, more critically ill patients are surviving longer ICU admissions. Patients with sepsis, multi-organ failure, severe burns, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and polypharmacy often develop profound neuromuscular weakness during their hospitalization despite appropriate medical interventions and treatments. Often referred to as “intensive care unit acquired weakness” (ICUAW) this underdiagnosed condition most commonly results from a spectrum of critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP), critical illness myopathy (CIM), or a combination of both. While CIP and CIM often occur simultaneously, it is important to understand the key features of each condition to ensure prompt recognition, prevent further disability, and ensure better patient outcomes. While the conditions are often underdiagnosed, studies show that the incidence of ICUAW in patients with greater than seven days of mechanical ventilation may range from 25% to 83%. Critical illness neuropathy may be evident as a patient fails to wean off the ventilator or if the patient has profound weakness or numbness in extremities upon awakening from sedation. A physical exam may also reveal diminished deep tendon reflexes, possible muscle atrophy, or balance impairment upon leaving the ICU. Bulbar and extraocular muscles will often be spared in CIP. Laboratory studies such as cerebrospinal fluid will usually be normal; this may help differentiate the condition from other illnesses with similar presentations, such as Guillain-Barre Syndrome. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) will be within normal limits in CIP and can become elevated in CIM. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or sepsis is the most frequent underlying factor in CIP (as opposed to the use of neuromuscular blocking agents and steroids, which predominate in CIM).Although not often performed, the gold standard for the diagnosis of critical illness neuropathy remains electrodiagnostic testing, which includes nerve conduction studies and needle electromyography. It should be noted that while EMG is the optimal way to make a diagnosis of CIP, there are many challenges to performing a complete study in ICU conditions, including electrical interference, anasarca, hypothermia, peripheral edema, or limited patient participation in the exam. Nevertheless, in the evaluation of profound weakness in the ICU setting, electrodiagnostic testing is an essential tool that can direct the clinical team in determining further management. Pathophysiology of CIP/CIM Etiology is not entirely clear, but it is though to be complex and multi-factorial in nature. Ultimately it lead to axonal dysfunction, ischemia, and degeneration necessitating aggressive treatment of underlying medical causes and physical neurorehabilitation. It is thought to be related to abnormal vascular, metabolic, and electrical processes leading to motor and/or sensory neuron abnormalities: Vascular autoregulation-leading to increase microvascular permeability (e.g. dilation of vessels) which can result in edema, hypoxemia, pro-inflammatory invasion of leukocytes and cytokines, and occlusion within the muscle-neuron units Metabolic-generation of reactive oxygen and nitric oxide species, failure of mitochondrial repair, neuronal hyperglycemic damage, and hypoalbuminemia Electrical-disruption of sodium and calcium channels and loss of cellular excitability Summary of clinical and histopathological features of CIP/CIM 1. Critical Illness Polyneuropathy Predisposing factors: sepsis with concurrent encephalopathy, recurrent exposure to non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, and multi-organ failure Presence of diffuse paraparesis and/or paraplegia, more distal than proximal with preserved muscle bulk or mild atrophy Early loss of deep tendon reflexes or areflexia Long-standing difficulty weaning mechanical ventilation after exclusion of cardiopulmonary etiologies Electrodiagnostic evidence of axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy 2. Critical Illness Myopathy Predisposing factors: recurrent exposure to neuromuscular blocking agents, severe asthma, pneumonia, prolonged acidemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, prolonged high dose corticosteroid use, prolonged use of aminoglycosides, sepsis, multi-organ failure, and organ transplantation Presence of diffuse paraparesis and/or paraplegia, more proximal than distal with severe atrophy Delayed loss of deep tendon reflexes Long-standing difficulty weaning mechanical ventilation after exclusion of cardiopulmonary etiologies Electrodiagnostic evidence of motor unit and recruitment abnormalities as well as an absence of excitability with muscle stimulation, with possible preservation of sensory potentials Biopsy: Type II atrophic myofibers on H&E and myofiber necrosis",

In addition, 30-40% of adults report complaints about sleep quality lifetime, and10-15% report chronic insomniaBenzodiazepines (BZDs) are commonly prescribed to treat insomnia and sleep disorders. BZDs show a rapid sedative and anxiolytic effect, successfully used in the acute treatment of insomnia as well as anxiety, agitation, or anxiety associated with any type of psychiatric disorder. Their use is associated with potential side effects such as residual daytime sleepiness, ataxia, and dizziness. Long-term BZDs use may lead to drug abuse, tolerance, drug dependency, and abstinence. For instance, BZDs abrupt withdrawal can lead to severe symptoms such as insomnia and/or rebound anxiety, an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, nausea and/or vomiting, sweating, diarrhea, convulsions, and other neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Objectives This e-poster aimed to summarize evidence regarding the effect of BZDs treatment on human Sleep Architecture. Methods A bibliopgraphical review was performed using PubMed platform. All relevant articles were found using the keywords: benzodiazepines, sleep architecture, insomnia. Results Prolonged use of benzodiazepines leads to an increase of time spent in stages 2 and a decrease of time in stages 1, 3, and 4. The increased NREM stage 2 is associated with a subjective improvement in sleep quality. The decrease in NREM sleep time in stages 3 and 4 is usually associated with lesser “rest” for the brain, which leads to a lack of concentration. Conclusions BZDs use modified sleep architecture in the short and long term. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

Symptoms consist in the compulsion to move the lower limbs caused by unspecified unpleasant sensations. This disorder is difficult to diagnose because it imitates other diseases. For this reason, differential diagnosis plays a large role in diagnosis. In the case of a slight exacerbation of symptoms, non-pharmacological activities are used, such as improving the conditions of falling asleep, avoiding intense work at the computer just before bedtime, stimulants (coffee, strong tea), energy drinks. Pharmacological treatment should be introduced if the symptoms are more severe. Pharmacotherapy depends on the nature of the symptoms. In the recurrent form, the drug of choice is the lowest effective dose of levodopa. In chronic forms, we permanently use drugs from the group of dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine) or so-called gabapentinoid (gabapentin, pregabalin).",

Such factors are illness, exhaustion, starvation and dehydration. Symptoms similar to those of deterioration, but more acute in onset, appear if man goes too quickly to high altitudes without first acclimatizing. These symptoms of acute mountain sickness disappear if the subject returns to lower levels for some time. If he goes to moderate heights when acclimatizing he will be able to stay for reasonably long periods without undue trouble.

Residual symptoms were more common in subjects with more severe initial illness, but were not related to any other predictors, including longer prior illness, dysthymia, or lower dose of drug treatment during the illness episode. There were weak associations with personality that might have been consequences of symptom presence. Residual symptoms were very strong predictors of subsequent early relapse, which occurred in 76% (13/17) of those with residual symptoms and 25% (10/40) of those without.",

In this article, these papers were reviewed, and the etiology and the clinical features were analyzed. Most of the cases of muscle paralysis after prolonged use of pancuronium bromide were associated with concomitant use of large doses of steroids. In these cases, steroid myopathy and disuse atrophy have been implicated with causes of the paralysis. In patients with impaired hepatic and/or renal functions, metabolites of neuromuscular blocking agents might accumulate. In some patients with paralysis after neuromuscular blocking agents, underlying neuromuscular complications such as critical illness polyneuropathy have been implicated with the cause of the muscle paralysis. In order to avoid paralysis after long-term administration of neuromuscular blocking agents, following recommendations are made. 1) Monitor neuromuscular blockade. 2) Examine patient's neuromuscular status before starting to give relaxants. 3) Be careful in giving relaxants in patients with poor renal and/or hepatic functions. 4) Use smallest possible amount of relaxant. 5) Be careful about the drugs administered simultaneously especially steroids and antibiotics. 6) During the use of a neuromuscular blocking agent, perform physical therapy of extremities to avoid disuse atrophy especially when its administration is temporally terminated.",

      "title": "Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP) is a condition in which affected individuals may experience paralytic episodes with concomitant hypokalemia (serum potassium Some individuals have only one episode in a lifetime; more commonly, crises occur repeatedly: daily, weekly, monthly, or less often. The major triggering factors are cessation of effort following strenuous exercise and carbohydrate-rich evening meals. Additional triggers can include cold, stress/excitement/fear, salt intake, prolonged immobility, use of glucosteroids or alcohol, and anesthetic procedures. The age of onset of the first attack ranges from two to 30 years; the duration of paralytic episodes ranges from one to 72 hours with an average of nearly 24 hours. Long-lasting interictal muscle weakness may occur in some affected individuals and in some stages of the disease and in myopathic muscle changes. A myopathy may occur independent of paralytic symptoms and may be the sole manifestation of hypoPP. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of hypoPP is established in a proband who meets the consensus diagnostic criteria based on a history of attacks of muscle weakness associated with documented serum potassium In the case of long-lasting interictal flaccid muscle weakness, imaging techniques can inform on the pathogenesis, potential therapy, and prognosis. Muscle ultrasound and muscle 1H-MRI are reliable image techniques with high accuracy for the disease. The weakness can be caused by edemas, fatty muscle degeneration, and muscle atrophy or a combination of these pathologies. Management Treatment of manifestations. Treatment varies depending on the intensity and duration of the paralytic attack. Minor attacks may resolve spontaneously. Moderate attacks may be self-treated in a non-medical setting by ingestion of oral potassium salts. Severe attacks typically require more intensive medical management with intravenous potassium infusion, serial measurement of serum potassium concentration, clinical evaluation of possible respiratory involvement, and continuous electrocardiogram monitoring. There is no known curative treatment for hypoPP-related myopathy; physiotherapy may help to maintain strength and motor skills. Prevention of primary manifestations. The goal of preventive treatment is to reduce the frequency and intensity of paralytic attacks. This may be achieved by avoidance of triggering factors, adherence to a diet low in sodium and carbohydrate and rich in potassium, and with the use of oral potassium supplementation. If dietary intervention and oral potassium supplementation are not effective in preventing attacks, treatment with a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide) may be necessary. If carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are not tolerated or not effective after prolonged use, alternatives include potassium-sparing diuretics such as triamterene, spironolactone, or eplerenone. Prevention of secondary complications. Creating a safe environment, getting help in case of paralytic attack, and preventing falls and accidents are critical; an affected person experiencing a paralytic attack must have access to potassium as well as physical assistance and companions must be informed of the risk in order to enable rapid treatment. Anesthetic complications should be prevented by strict control of serum potassium concentration, avoidance of large glucose and salt load, maintenance of body temperature and acid-base balance, and careful use of neuromuscular blocking agents with continuous monitoring of neuromuscular function. It is unknown whether prevention of paralytic attacks also prevents the development of myopathy. Individuals with known pathogenic variants in one of the genes associated with hypoPP who developed myopathy without having experienced episodes of weakness have been reported. Surveillance. The frequency of consultations is adapted to the individual's signs/symptoms and response to preventive treatment. Periodic neurologic examination with attention to muscle strength in the legs should be performed to detect long-lasting weakness associated with myopathy. For those taking acetazolamide, the following are indicated every three months: complete blood count; electrolytes; and glucose, uric acid, and liver enzyme levels. Renal ultrasound should be performed annually. Agents/circumstances to avoid. Factors that trigger paralytic attacks (e.g., unusually strenuous effort, carbohydrate-rich meals or sweets, cold, stress/excitement/fear, high salt intake, prolonged immobility, oral or intravenous glucosteroids, certain anesthetic procedures, alcohol) should be avoided when possible. Evaluation of relatives at risk. When the family-specific pathogenic variant is known, molecular genetic testing of at-risk asymptomatic family members can identify those at risk for unexpected acute paralysis and/or possible anesthetic complications. Genetic counseling HypoPP is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with hypoPP have an affected parent. The proportion of cases caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is unknown. Offspring of a proband are at a 50% risk of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Penetrance is about 90% in males and reduced in females. Once the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

The merits of the method are not only due to the beneficial effects of the relaxant itself; the anaesthetic, that is invariably administered at the same time, plays an essential part in the procedure. Every phase of the treatment is greatly improved. Anxiety, which so often develops during unmodified E.C.T., is greatly reduced if not abolished altogether. There is no cry or other noise that might disturb other patients awaiting treatment; the convulsion is attenuated to a reaction that may be varied at will from a mild modified convulsion to a mere flicker of facial muscles or complete absence of muscular activity. Cyanosis is absent and the colour remains good throughout, and—perhaps most important of all from the therapeutic point of view—there is no restlessness or confusion after the treatment, the patient sleeping quietly after the treatment until he wakes up without any unpleasant sensations or memories.",

      "title": "Exercise for depression",
      "abstract": "Depression is a common clinical condition, affecting over 120 million people worldwide. People experience pervasive, sustained feelings of sadness and hopelessness, persistent loss of interest, enjoyment and motivation as well as disruptions in areas such as appetite, sleep, concentration and energy levels. It is an important cause of morbidity and mortality and produces a greater decrement in health than chronic diseases such as arthritis, diabetes and angina. Conventional treatments centre largely on pharmacological and psychological strategies, either on their own or in combination; but these are not acceptable to everyone. Antidepressant treatment can be complicated by side effects and drug interactions, and psychological therapies require motivation from the participant. Patients may also reject both antidepressants and psychological therapy because of perceived stigma. For several decades, exercise has been investigated as an alternative therapy for depression and several mechanisms have been proposed for its potential efficacy. It may provide distraction from negative thoughts or enhance a sense of self-efficacy through mastering a new skill. Social contact through exercise may also have a positive impact on mood and, from a more biological perspective, changes to circulating monoamines or endorphins, or reductions in the stress hormone cortisol, may also play a role. This review set out to conduct a meta-analysis of randomized trials of the effect of exercise in people with depression. We included studies comparing exercise with no treatment, as well as those that compared exercise with psychological or antidepressant approaches. The current version updates the earlier Cochrane Review, first published in 2009. We included trials of adults with a diagnosis of depression as defined by the original researchers. In assessing the intervention, we were guided by the American College of Sports Medicine definition of exercise as \"planned, structured and repetitive bodily movement done to improve or maintain one or more components of physical fitness\". We identified 39 trials, recruiting approximately 2300 participants, drawn from a variety of sources including inpatient and outpatient populations, as well as from the general public by media advertising. A diagnosis of depression was made either by structured diagnostic interview or through the use of rating scales, such as the Beck Depression Inventory or the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. The included trials varied widely with respect to the type of exercise, as well as its duration and frequency or the overall \"dose\" of exercise. Of the 39 trials, 32 provided aerobic exercise such as running, cycling, walking or dance; with 4 providing muscle-strengthening resistance training. Other trials provided a combination of aerobic and resistance training. There were further differences with respect to whether exercise was conducted alone or in groups, indoors or outdoors, supervised or unsupervised. Our main finding was that when compared to a control intervention, there was a moderate clinical effect in favour of exercise. However, this should be interpreted with caution, as when we analysed the six trials that were considered high quality, the effect size was clinically small and not statistically significant. A series of subgroup analyses suggested that a larger number of exercise sessions may have a greater clinical effect on mood and that resistance training or a mixture of aerobic and resistance training may be more efficacious than aerobic training alone. When exercise was compared with antidepressant medication, there was no statistical difference between the two interventions. Likewise for psychological therapy, our findings revealed no difference between this and an exercise intervention. The nature and extent to which exercise may have an effect on mood remains uncertain. Most included trials were small and many had methodological weaknesses. One inherent difficulty in these studies is that it is not possible to blind participants allocated to exercise. A further potential source of bias is that outcome measures for depression are often gathered from self-rated scales of depression, completed by the participants themselves before and after the intervention. The evidence in this review would be strengthened by further large-scale, high-quality studies, where all participants are diagnosed with depression through structured clinical interview and receive exercise as a stand-alone intervention. Further research comparing exercise with either anti depressant medication or psychological therapies, would also help resolve uncertainties about the choice between these options.",

Assim, sintomas neuropsiquiátricos, dores abdominais, vômitos, neuropatia aguda, convulsões e distúrbios mentais como alucinações, depressão, paranoia e ansiedades são referentes ao aspecto agudo. Já em casos crônicos, a manifestação clínica se dá sob a forma de fotossensibilidade cutânea. O tratamento é realizado após a descoberta dos sintomas. Sendo a Porfiria uma doença considerada rara e com poucos estudos relacionados a ela, este trabalho abrange suas principais características, diferenciando-a segundo sua classificação.",

Three studies of SSRI discontinuation were also reviewed.Demographic and treatment information, as well as the timing, duration, number, nature and frequency of dicontinuation symptoms.Paroxetine was most frequently implicated. The drug had been tapered in half of the cases. In some cases, symptom onset began during taper, whereas, in most cases, symptoms began within 1 to 3 days of drug discontinuation. Fifty-three different symptoms were reported, with dizziness being the most common. Other common symptoms were nausea or emesis, fatigue, headache, gait instability and insomnia. Shock-like sensations, paresthesia and visual disturbances were the most rare. Without intervention, symptoms persisted for more than a week in half of the cases. In cases in which the SSRI was restarted, symptoms resolved within 72 hours. In some cases, withdrawal symptoms recurred when the same SSRI was again discontinued.Findings were used to construct diagnostic criteria for the SSRI discontinuation syndrome. These criteria are 2 or more of the following symptoms developing within 1 to 7 days of discontinuation or reduction in dosage of an SSRI after at least 1 month's use, when these symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment and are not due to a general medical condition or recurrence of a mental disorder: dizziness, light-headedness, vertigo or feeling faint; shock-like sensations or paresthesia; anxiety; diarrhea; fatigue; gait instability; headache; insomnia; irritability; nausea or emesis; tremor; and visual disturbances.",

      "abstract": "Oncologic patients on opioid therapy due to pain may have several side effects, including respiratory depression (in about 1% of cases), pruritus (up to 10% of cases), nausea (in 25-32% of cases), sedation (in 20- 60% of cases); but the most far-reaching side effect (up to 95% of cases) that can occur is constipation. The socalled \"opioid-induced constipation\" (OIC) can develop at the start of opioid therapy and can last as long as continued use. The OIC is a real change in intestinal habits that occurs when opioid treatment is started; it is noted with a reduced frequency of episodes of defecation, with a development or worsening of the effort to defecation, with a feeling of incomplete emptying and a perception on the part of the patient to live in a stressful way the act of defecation. Also because of this, the OIC can induce to tolerate the dose of opioids routinely causing inadequate pain management. Continuous therapy with opioids lasting at least two weeks and resistance to the treatment of constipation with osmotic laxatives for more than three days in patients with terminal disease (Nota 90 AIFA) allow the prescription of naloxegol, a PEGylated derivative of the naloxone. Naloxegol belongs to the PAMORA family (peripheral mu-opioid receptor antagonists) which does not generally cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore does not interfere with the central nervous system-mediated analgesic efficacy. The reported clinical case tends to show how the use of the drug under examination (naloxegol) solves the problem of the OIC in a oncologic patient, improving her quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Nausea is defined as a subjectively unpleasant sensation associated with awareness of the urge to vomit, and vomiting refers to a forceful expulsion of gastric contents from the mouth, or labored, spasmodic, rhythmic contractions of the respiratory muscles without expulsion of gastric contents. The conditions may be caused by multiple factors including organ failure, central nervous system disease, drug therapy, radiation, and gastrointestinal obstruction and pathology. Nausea and vomiting are often associated with other symptoms such as pain, anxiety, depression, shortness of breath, drowsiness, loss of appetite, and tiredness that can negatively influence patients’ activities of daily living and significantly impact their quality of life., The management of nausea and vomiting involves treatment of the underlying cause(s), supportive care measures, and the use of anti-emetics.,Anti-emetics are medications prescribed for the prevention of nausea and vomiting or use as a rescue treatment once symptoms develop. There are many classes of anti-emetic drugs, including 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, NK-1 receptor antagonists, corticosteroids, butyrophenones, antihistamines, anticholinergics, and phenothiazines. Ondansetron is the most well-studied 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and is considered by some to be the gold standard to which other anti-emetics are compared. Ondansetron is commonly prescribed in the form of standard oral pills or tablets. However, there are patients, including those in the palliative setting, for whom such formulations may not be suitable due to difficulty with swallowing caused by co-morbidities such as dysphagia.This report aims to identify and summarize evidence on the comparative clinical effectiveness of oral versus injectable ondansetron formulations in adult patients requiring medication to control nausea or vomiting. An additional objective is to synthesize evidence on the comparative clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of ondansetron versus other anti-emetic agents for palliative patients, as well as evidence-based guidelines for the use of ondansetron to control nausea or vomiting in that population.",

In the other possible scenario, the individual experiences a negative reaction to the stressor. Herein, at some point the person begins to exhibit behavioral, mood, or emotional symptoms, the person is then described as manifesting an adjustment disorder, and there is then the need to initiate change in order to restore even functioning. It is important to emphasize that adjustment disorders differ from acute stress disorders in that the latter represent reactions to extraordinary traumatic stressors (i.e., life‐threatening events).",

In some cases, loss of consciousness is followed by generalized clonic movements of the extremities. In nearly all cases, the precipitating factor is either injury or frustration and the resulting anger, or a combination of both. The spells are said to be an early infantile form of temper tantrum—a primitive expression of anger or frustration. Such being the case,",

Anxiety is associated with poorer quality of life, significant distress and contributes to the onset of disability. Mortality risks are also increased, through physical causes, especially cardiovascular disease, and suicide. Diagnosing anxiety disorders in older adults remains a challenge because of the significant overlap in symptoms between physical disorders (shortness of breath; abdominal and chest pain; palpitations) and depression (disturbed sleep; poor attention, concentration and memory; restlessness). Good history taking is crucial in elucidating whether the complaint is of new onset or a recurrence of a previous disorder. The presence of comorbid depression should be clarified. If present, its temporal relationship with the anxiety symptoms will indicate whether there is an independent anxiety disorder. A medication review is warranted, as a number of drugs may be causative (calcium channel blockers, alpha- and beta-blockers, digoxin, L-thyroxine, bronchodilators, steroids, theophylline, antihistamines) or may cause anxiety in withdrawal (e.g. benzodiazepines). Substance and alcohol abuse should be excluded, as withdrawal from either may cause anxiety. A new or exacerbated physical illness may be related to anxiety. Medical investigations will help clarify the extent to which a particular somatic symptom is the result of anxiety.",

The seizures typically occurred several hours after his last alcohol intake at home (early withdrawal seizure) and 22 days after his last intake of alcohol (14 days after the last dose of diazepam substituting for alcohol: late withdrawal seizure) on the ward. Psychiatrists in charge of this patient found it difficult to attribute his seizures to alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) because of the atypical onset. The patient responded to diazepam resumption and valproate combination. This case highlights the need to always consider AWS as a possible cause of seizures and to gradually decrease diazepam as a substitute for alcohol. Moreover, in this patient, MCI may have induced vulnerability in the brain for AWS and the patients' older age might have decreased liver function leading to delayed onset of the seizures after diazepam withdrawal.",

      "title": "Behavioural Effects of Anti‐epileptic Drugs",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY There is increasing evidence that various types of behavioural disturbance, other than those described for phenytoin, for example, may occur from the use of anti‐epileptic medication, and it has been suggested that these disturbances may not always be reversible. There are suspicions also that certain groups of patients—especially those with structural brain damage—are particularly susceptible. These and other factors relevant to the study of the effects of anti‐epileptic drugs on behaviour are comprehensively reviewed. It is concluded that the psycho‐pharmacology of anti‐epileptic drugs is unsatisfactory at present because of inadequate and unsophisticated reporting of behavioural change and because of the common problem of polypharmacy, and that more accurate observations are needed on less heterogeneous groups of patients than have been described in the past. RÉSUMÉ Effets des medications anti‐épileptiques sur le comportement Il devient de plus en plus évident que des types variés de troubles du comportement, autres que ceux traditionnellement attribués à la phénytoïne, par exemple, peuvent suivre l'emploi de medication anti‐épileptique; il a même été suggéré que ces troubles ne sont pas toujours réversibles. Certaines indications laissent à penser que certains groupes de malades, notamment ceux qui présentent des troubles cérébraux structuraux, sont particulièrement sensibles. Ces faits et les autres facteurs relevant d'une étude de l'action des médications anti‐épileptiques sur le comportement sont systématiquement analysés. L'auteur concluent qu'à l'heure actuelle la psychopharmacologie des médications anti‐épileptiques n'est pas satisfaisante en raison de rapports inadéquats et non qualifiés sur les troubles du comportement ainsi que sur le problème commun des associations médicamenteures. Il est indispensable de disposer d'observations plus précises, de groupes de malades moins hétérogènes que ce qui a été fait dans le passé. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Verhaltenseinflüsse von Antiepileptika Es gibt zunehmend Hinweise darauf, daß verschiedene Arten von Verhaltensstörungen, andere als die zum Beispiel traditionell vom Diphenylhydantoin beschriebenen, bei der Anwendung von Antiepileptika auftreten können; es wurde vermutet, daß die Störungen nicht in alien Fällen reversibel sein könnten. Es gibt weiterhin Vermutungen, daß eine bestimmte Gruppe von Patienten—besonders solche mit strukturellen Hirnschädigungen—im besonderen dafür empfänglich sind. Es wird eine umfassende Übersicht dieser und anderer, für diese Studie der Effekte antikonvulsiver Medikamente auf das Verhalten relevanter Faktoren gegeben. Es wird festgestellt, daß die Psychopharmakologie der Antikonvulsiva zum gegenwärtigen Zeitpunkt unzureichend ist, da adäquate und sorgfältige Berichte über Verhaltensanderungen und die allgemeinen Probleme der Polypharmazie fehlen; es werden genauere Beobachtungen an weniger heterogenen Patientengruppen benötigt, als sie bisher beschrieben sind. RESUMEN Efectos sobre la conducta de los fármacos antiepilépticos Hay una evidencia creciente de que diversos tipos de alteraciones en el comportamiento, además de los ya tradicionalmente descritos para la fenitoína por ejemplo, pueden aparecer por el uso de medicación antiepiléptica, y se ha sugerido que estas alteraciones no siempre pueden ser reversibles. Hay sospechas también de que algunos grupos de pacientes, especialmente aquellos con lesión estructural cerebral, sen particularmente susceptibles. Se revisan de forma complet estos y otros factores en relación con el estudio de los efectos de los fármacos antiepilépticos sobre el comportamiento. Se concluye que la psicofarmacología de los fármacos antiepilépticos no es satisfactoria en el momento presente debido a unas comunicaciones inadecuadas o no sofisticadas sobre los cambios del comportamiento y el problema común de la polifarmacia, y que es necesaria una observación más atenta en grupos de pacientes menos heterogéneos de los que han sido descritos en el pasado.",

Back pain is sorted into three categories, differentiated by the duration of symptoms. Acute back pain, which is the focus of this article, is classified as pain lasting 6 weeks or less, subacute back pain is pain that has been present between 6 and 12 weeks, and chronic back pain is pain that persists longer than 12 weeks. Etiologies of low back pain include (but are certainly not limited to) mechanical injury (e.g., muscle sprain or spasm, ligament strain, facet joint disruption), arthritis, sciatica (lumbar radiculopathy), spinal fracture, malignancy, connective tissue disease, infection (e.g., vertebral osteomyelitis, epidural abscess), cauda equina syndrome, metabolic causes (e.g., hyperparathyroidism), abdominal or retroperitoneal visceral or vascular processes, psychogenic pain, and malingering. Careful history-taking and physical examination are crucial to diagnosing the etiology of back pain.

Familial : This could be an important cause as individuals from families with a history of any kind of addiction are more likely to develop addiction.. The family scenario is again a driving force e.g. history of alcoholism in the parents may become an important cause. Surroundings: Again as the Children are brought up by alcoholic or drug addicted parents gets family environment becomes a causative factor. Individuals from countries where use of a certain substance is not imposed as an illegal sanction have higher role to play as the causative factor. Exploitation: Individuals who experienced sexual, psychological, emotional or physical exploitation are more likely to become addicts. The addiction becomes a coping mechanism in them.High Emotions: Emotional disorders such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder often increase the risk of substance abuse. In them the insecurity feeling flares up the urge to use to drugs. Action of drug: Certain substances are more addictive than others, and risk of full-blown addiction is higher for drugs such as opioids, alcohol & tranquilizer because of their ability to create dependence after just a quick time.Low Frustration Tolerance: One common factor found amongst addicts of all types is a low frustration tolerance. Addicts are highly susceptible to the negative effects of stress, having a low threshold of facing the disturbances. They become easily upset over everyday stress factors, creating a need for escape. They find this escape in their addiction.Absentism at school: Frequently missing classes or missing school, a sudden disinterest in school or school activities, and a drop in grades may be indicators of drug use.Weak All of a Sudden : Lack of energy and motivation may indicate that child is using certain drugs.Listless appearance: Adolescents are generally concerned about how they look. A lack of interest in clothing, grooming or looks may be a warning sign of drug use.c",

      "title": "Integrating Acupressure to Alleviate Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting",
      "abstract": "Nausea, an unpleasant subjective experience, is a feeling that vomiting is imminent, although it may not ensue.1 Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) add to morbidity through dehydration, electrolyte disturbance, aspiration, and wound pain, causing unnecessary delay in recovery, increased costs, and poor satisfaction among patients.2,3 The incidence of PONV varies depending on multiple risk factors. Associated patient factors include increasing age, female sex, obesity, emotions/stress, history of motion sickness, and previous PONV. Treatment factors include operative procedure, inhalation anesthetic agents, and opioids.4–6Typically, PONV is treated with antiemetics. But pharmacological interventions may be only partially effective. Some patients may not tolerate antiemetics because of adverse effects such as headache, agitation, or tachycardia, whereas PONV develops in others despite use of antiemetics.6 Nonpharmacological methods such as acupressure have shown promise in lessening PONV and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Acupressure, a variation of acupuncture based on more than 3000 years of Chinese medicine, involves applying pressure on acupressure points without puncturing the skin. These acupoints correspond to an invisible circuitry of channels known as meridians that conduct energy (qi) to specific anatomic regions. If channels are disturbed, meaning energy flow is too slow, fast, turbulent, or static, there is said to be a qi imbalance, which can cause symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. From the Eastern perspective, acupressure is believed to stimulate or interrupt energy, thereby altering responses to negative stimuli, whereas the mechanism of action proposed in Western medicine involves triggered release of endogenous endorphins.6,7 In this clinical review, we discuss available evidence of the effect of acupressure techniques in reducing PONV.The strategy included searching MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Joanna Briggs Institute, and the TRIP database. Key words included nausea/vomiting, PONV, acupressure, and SeaBands. Only evidence from 1999 to 2010 on pericardial median acupoint (P6) interventions was included. Other exclusions included patients undergoing cesarean section.Two meta-analyses and 13 randomized controlled trials were retrieved (Table 1). Acupressure interventions included bands (SeaBands), electro-acustimulation via ReliefBands, or finger-pressing the P6 acupoint. P6 is located on the dorsal surface of the forearm 2 inches (5 cm) proximal to the wrist crease between the palmaris longus and flexor carpi radialis tendons.6 Five trials evaluated bilateral treatment, 4 unilateral, 1 unilateral vs bilateral, and 3 a combination of treatments. Bands were usually applied 30 to 60 minutes before induction, and duration of treatment ranged from 6 to 72 hours. Primary outcomes included PONV and need for rescue antiemetics.Although available studies reveal mixed findings, evidence from the meta-analyses and larger trials generally favors acupressure in reducing PONV and antiemetic rescue. Populations that benefited included outpatient plastic surgery patients; patients undergoing endoscopic sinus procedures, gynecological procedures, and laparoscopic procedures such as cholecystectomy; and cardiac surgery patients. Overall, adults responded positively, whereas findings for children varied. Bilateral and unilateral bands had mixed effects, although bilateral application had more consistent complete response (PONV incidence and antiemetic use). Results of another trial19 indicated no difference between bilateral and unilateral bands.One meta-analysis8 and 1 randomized controlled trial15 showed comparable efficacy between acupressure bands and antiemetics, suggesting that acupressure was at least as effective as antiemetics for preventing nausea. Time was another important variable, with significant effects of acupressure in the first 6 hours.9,15 Other investigators found that bands significantly affected PONV at 24 hours.16,20 These differences may reflect time intervals of outcome evaluation. Despite the lack of efficacy in other populations,13,17–19 Klein16 demonstrated positive effects of SeaBands on outcomes in female cardiac surgical patients. Alkaissi et al14 also found vaginal surgery patients had significant effects compared with other laparoscopic gynecological procedures.Mixed findings were revealed in trials investigating combination versus antiemetic therapy. Although researchers in 1 study22 found that droperidol was associated with less nausea than acupressure, most evidence favored a combination of acupressure and antiemetic use for PONV outcomes. In 2 large trials,20,21 ReliefBand/Zofran therapy demonstrated efficacy equal to that for antiemetics for complete response (PONV/antiemetic rescue), suggesting that Zofran enhanced the overall efficacy of ReliefBands.Overall, “class 1” evidence exists for the efficacy of acupressure on PONV in surgical populations (Table 2). Acupressure offers a noninvasive approach to preventing PONV that has comparable antiemetic efficacy to more invasive treatments such as acupuncture or medications, with fewer side effects and lower cost. Acupressure is easy to administer and carries no infection risk. Reported side effects are minor: some patients reported that acupressure bands were uncomfortable, causing red indentations and itching, blistering, or swollen wrists; drowsiness; and headache/dizziness.8,9,14,22 Mild cutaneous irritations were reported with acustimulation devices.12 Consequently, clinicians must carefully monitor for local side effects and discontinue use of the bands if needed. No long-term adverse events were documented.9 Thus, these interventions offer potential benefit that outweighs the minimal to no harm they cause.During the preoperative phase, patients should be assessed for PONV risk factors. Such assessment can be accomplished with a screening tool of evidence-based risk factors such as increasing age, sex, obesity, history of motion sickness, and prior PONV history. Noninvasive treatments such as use of SeaBands or ReliefBands may be offered to patients as an adjunct to their care. Bands should be applied before emetic stimulus at the correct P6 location. Either bilateral or unilateral bands may offer PONV protection, although bilateral application appears to be associated with more complete response. Older evidence suggests best results may be achieved through the use of the dominant hand.24 Further considerations in critically ill patients focus on the use of hemodynamic catheters. In patients with catheters in the radial artery, correct placement of acupressure bands in the P6 position on the wrists may not be possible. Therefore, reliance on unilateral application on the nonused extremity may offer potential for using this technique for PONV prevention.Beyond integrative approaches to perioperative care, nurses have an opportunity to collaborate with pharmacists and physicians in modifying postoperative pain protocols to reduce reliance on narcotic analgesics that are emetigenic. Nonpharmacological interventions such as music therapy, guided imagery, healing touch, or massage can be integrated to achieve effective pain control and thereby reduce offenders that contribute to PONV morbidity. Because pain and anxiety often go hand-in-hand, integrative therapies that target both symptoms may be especially effective in promoting postoperative comfort for patients. An added benefit is that therapies such as acupressure may reduce the amount of analgesics and antiemetics that patients may need, further limiting more potential drug-related side effects.",

Four common features were recognized: (1) high-dose polypharmacy of hypnotics and anxiolytics is common in sleep and anxiety disorders; (2) the prevalence of prescriptions for elderly patients is especially high; (3) more than half of the prescriptions are written by physicians; and (4) the prescription of long-term benzodiazepines is still widespread in spite of international clinical guidelines recommending benzodiazepine treatment to be limited to only a few weeks. All these features should be considered when clinicians prescribe hypnotics and anxiolytics. The prescription of minimal dosages is essential both for obtaining clinical benefit and avoiding adverse events, such drug-dependency, falls and hip fractures, and withdrawal symptoms.",

When these symptoms continue for ≥1 month and are associated with daytime dysfunction or distress, they reach the status of an insomnia disorder. Roughly 10% of adults in the United States have an insomnia disorder (hereafter referred to as insomnia), ie, that which is present on most nights and lasts ≥4 weeks. Insomnia can be primary, in which the sleep disturbance exists in the absence of co-existing medical or psychiatric disorders, or comorbid, when it is accompanied by one of these disorders. Although a diagnosis of insomnia requires difficulty with sleep, insomnia is a 24-hour disorder. Individuals with insomnia describe difficulties with concentration, fatigue, and mood, which both influence, and are influenced by, the sleep disturbance. In addition, insomnia is associated with a substantially elevated risk of incident major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder, and substance abuse disorders. There is also emerging evidence that insomnia increases the risk for incident hypertension and diabetes.",

      "title": "Advances in Drug Addiction",
      "abstract": "Drug addiction, also called substance dependence or dependence syndrome, is a condition where a person feels a strong need to take a drug. Addiction also involves other behaviors. These include finding it difficult to control the need to use the drug and feeling the use of the drug to be more important than more normal things such as family or work. When the person does not use the drug for an amount of time, they may suffer from withdrawal. When a person is addicted, they are usually addicted to a class (a specific kind) of drug. For example, Heroin is a drug that is in the Opiate class, which means that a person addicted to Heroin may also be seen to have an addiction to other opiates such as Morphine. A person who may easily become addicted to drugs is said to have an addictive personality. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders defines drug addiction as a mental disorder. Drug addiction is often linked with other mental disorders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn the present book, fifteen typical literatures about drug addiction published on international authoritative journals were selected to introduce the worldwide newest progress, which contains reviews or original researches on human health, illegal drugs, neuroscience, psychology, ect.

They produce euphoria and sense of well-being which makes them addictive to some people. Used in higher doses they can lead to cardiac or respiratory compromise. They also impair cognition leading to impaired decision making. Opioids exert their effects by acting on three different types of receptors mu, delta, and kappa located on neuronal cell membranes causing inhibition of neurotransmitter release. Prolonged use of these drugs can lead to physical dependence causing withdrawal symptoms if a person stops using them. Commonly used medications to treat opiate addiction are methadone, LAAM (longer acting derivative of methadone), buprenorphine, and naltrexone.",

Some caution should be advised. Do not expect total pain relief; the clinical reports indicate improvement in the conditions, not total pain ablation. Although these 5 patients did not have significant deleterious changes in their mental status, it is conceivable that some patients receiving high doses of opioids will lose consciousness when N2O is administered.

Established PONV is treated with rescue medication of a drug group which has not already been used for prophylaxis.

      "abstract": "The various causes of tremor are considered by order of prevalence in the elderly. 1) Essential tremor occurs in 5% of the population beyond 65 years of age. It is characterized by a tremor accompanying muscle activity, and interesting, when complete, the two upper limbs, the head and the voice, with variable degree of severity. Its progression is very slow. The diagnostic criteria are only clinical, but require ruling out iatrogenic and metabolic causes. 2) Tremor in Parkinson's disease is opposed point by point to essential tremor. However, confusion may occur due to some intermediate clinical situations. In these cases, pharmacology or DaTSCAN data can help to distinguish between the two conditions. 3) Other causes are considered, giving the priority to practical and therapeutic aspects. The psychological consequences of tremor should be taken into account to improve the quality of life of patients with tremor. Terms which stigmatize, such as senile tremor, or terms which minimize the relational and social consequences of tremor, such as benign tremor, should be discarded.",

CASE 1A premorbidly normal 35-year-old lady, was brought to the Psychiatry Outpatient Department (OPD) in December 2010 with symptoms of generalized slowness of movement, crying spells, neglect of daily activities and poor self-care, decreased interaction with family members, insomnia, fearfulness, irrelevant talk, disinhibition and inappropriate behaviour.A close scrutiny of the various systems and laboratory parameters did not reveal any abnormalities.Hence, after the conclusion of the history, physical and psychological evaluation, a diagnosis of a psychosis not otherwise classified was made and she was initiated on oral olanzapine 5 mg.Later on, in 2012 she presented with a picture resembling mania with altered lipid profile and hence olanzapine was changed to aripiprazole 10 mg and valproate was initiated at a dose of 500 mg once a day along with lithium 400 mg, risperidone 4 mg and trihexyphenidyl 4 mg.In view of frequent complaints of mania and hypomania dose of valproate was increased to 1000 mg.Subsequently during her follow up in January 2016, she complained of an enormous amount of hair loss, which was persistent in nature for 10 days.On examination diffuse alopecia was present associated with scaling, hair pull test was negative and she was prescribed anti-hair fall serum in February 2016, in view of no improvement in hair fall, a diagnosis of valproate induced alopecia was made and drug was tapered and stopped.Lithium, an established cause for hair loss was ruled out as the serum levels of lithium were within normal range [{Serum lithium-1.1 mmol/L (0.8-1.2 mmol/L)}].Patient showed improvement in symptoms of hair fall during her subsequent visit the next month.",

      "abstract": "Although the advent and widespread use of ataractic drugs has more or less eclipsed lobotomy as a method of dealing with severe psychotic states, variations and adaptations of the operation still can be used with benefit in certain pretty well defined circumstances.\"Chemical lobotomy\" and regressive electroshock bring about alterations in behavior superficially resembling those of lobotomy, but without the changes in personality that are the object of lobotomy. These desirable changes consist in increased extraversion, decreased preoccupation with self and decreased sensitivity to the opinions of others. With restricted operations, undesirable changes-the \"frontal lobe syndrome\"-do not occur. OPERATIVE FAILURES ARE DUE TO THREE MAIN CAUSES: (a) Preoperative emotional deterioration; (b) progress of the underlying disease; (c) relapse, possibly due to inadequate operation. Lobotomy is advisable if the patient does not show sustained improvement after a year of active treatment by other indicated means. The operation often represents the turning point in effective treatment. After the first year of ineffective treatment valuable time is being lost, with danger of fixation and deterioration. Then it is safer to operate than to wait. The future of psychosurgery lies in prompt application, in favorable patients, of selective operations that will reverse the trend of illness. There is particular need for further exploration of the temporal lobes in the hope of finding some procedure that will suppress hallucinations. Some 90 per cent of patients remaining in hospitals after psychosurgery are experiencing hallucinations. If these phenomena can be eliminated without producing serious personality defects, another large field for the application of psychosurgery will be opened.",

      "abstract": "The use over the last 50 years of antidepressants having both serotonergic and noradrenergic properties, as the first line for the management of neuropathic pain or chronic pain syndromes, is based on a twofold rationale: on the one hand, a plausible analgesic mechanism of action independent of the effect on mood, on the other hand, efficacy data in humans and animals. Their prescription should be part of a multimodal approach to pain. The dose to reach the analgesic effect, which on average occurs within four weeks after the initiation of treatment, is sometimes lower than the dose required to achieve the antidepressant effect. The choice of antidepressant will rely on the profile of adverse effects and other expected secondary benefits in the case of comorbidities.L’utilisation depuis 50 ans d’antidépresseurs ayant à la fois une action sérotoninergique et noradrénergique comme première ligne pour la prise en charge de douleurs neuropathiques ou de syndromes douloureux chroniques est basée sur les deux raisons suivantes : d’une part, un mécanisme d’action antalgique plausible et indépendant de l’effet thymique, d’autre part, des données d’efficacité chez l’humain et l’animal. Leur prescription doit s’inscrire dans une approche multimodale de la douleur. La dose nécessaire pour atteindre l’effet antalgique, qui survient en moyenne dans les 4 semaines après l’introduction du traitement, est parfois moins importante que celle qui permet d’obtenir l’effet antidépresseur. Le choix de la molécule se fera en fonction du profil d’effets indésirables et d’autres bénéfices secondaires éventuels attendus.",

      "abstract": "We describe some physiotherapeutic techniques and manoeuvres releasing the increased tone of spastic and shortened muscles. The techniques can be generally characterised and summed up into three groups as follows: I. First types of manoeuvres consists in setting up the extremity or segment into the position usually opposed or antagonistic to the limited direction. This position is held for several tens of seconds. After this, partial of the originally limited range of motion could be observed. A modification of this approach is effective for persistent extensor spasticity of the lower extremities. Extremity is taken up into the internal rotation and flexion of the hip joint, into the maximal flexion of knee joint and into dorsiflexion of ankle joint, and this position is held at least for 30 seconds. After this, the extensor spasticity is usually diminished and also the voluntary movements and gait pattern improved. II. Short active jerk (not exceeding 1/2 sec) in the free direction, alternatively against mild resistance, followed by 3-4 second release and slow stretch into the restricted range. It is essentially important that the initial jerk is as brisk as possible but performed with no special effort. In case the resistance is applied, it should be only slight. Then the therapist must grasp a \"melting\" of the hypertonus and cautiously guide the segment into the slow and gentle stretch. III. Pressure stimulation of the particular active zones. The application of these manoeuvres and its combinations are demonstrated in case reports.",

      "title": "The Depressed Patient",
      "abstract": "DEPRESSION IS A PHENOMENON that most of us experience to a greater or lesser degree at some time in our lives. It is a psychophysiological state, manifested psychologically by feelings of sadness, worthlessness, hopelessness, of emptiness. There is a lack of interest in the events of the outside world. Activities that are usually enjoyed become flat, dull, meaningless. Physically, there is a slowing down of bodily functions. The respiratory rate is slow. The gastrointestinal slowdown results in retarded emptying of the stomach and intestines, leading to a loss of appetite, a feeling of fullness in the stomach, burping, and constipation. Muscle tension decreases, leading to drooping facies, the slumped posture, the slow, dragging gait. Eyeballs tend to be sunken and the eyes lacking in luster. Sleep disturbance is common. There may be difficulty in going to sleep, in staying asleep, or, on the other hand, there may be an increased desire for sleep. Along with a lessened interest in external events, there is a loss of interest in grooming and personal hygiene. The same dark, dull clothes may be worn day after day. These manifestations seem to reflect the depressed person's general lack of selfesteem and self-confidence, and his lack of belief that life can be worth living. The cognitive functions are slowed down. Questions are answered hesitantly, often after a pause. Conversation is seldom initiated and often confined to monosyllables and to reminiscing about past events, frequently of an unhappy nature. Cryng is frequent. Thinking requires conscious effort. Concentration is difficult. The attention span is short for topics unrelated to the feelings of the depression. The depressed person's attitude toward life itself varies from a feeling that this world is unfit to live in to a belief that one is not fit to live and that the world would be a better place if one were not in it, that is, if one were dead. The former set of attitudes is frequently an unspoken plea for succor and support. The latter, which usually occurs only in pathological states of deep depression, indicates a suicidal danger. The old adage that one who talks of suicide will not kill himself is unfounded. Anyone who talks of suicide should be regarded with concern and the matter investigated by someone skilled in dealing with psychiatric illness. Nursing care must be provided to protect the person against his self-destructive tendencies and to reduce the environmental hazards, although this latter is difficult in ordinary life situations. Constant supportive nursing care is probably more fruitful and much more comforting to the person involved.

Además, se continúa tomando la sustancia a pesar de tener conciencia de problemas psicológicos o físicos persistentes relacionados al consumo. Desde la perspectiva psicodinámica, los conflictos intrapsíquicos e inconscientes de personalidad son determinantes para el desarrollo del trastorno por consumo de alcohol. Estos conflictos surgen de la necesidad de reducir la tensión y la inhibición de los impulsos instintivos básicos, donde el consumo de la droga sirve como un medio para reducir la tensión, es entonces, un mecanismo de defensa regresivo y de evitación, constituye una conducta desadaptativa, autodestructiva y debilitante.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizoaffective disorder was first described in the literature by Kasanin in 1933, referring to a group of patients in whom both psychotic (“schizo”) and mood (“affective”) symptoms are prominent features. A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

      "abstract": "Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) include storage symptoms (previously termed as irritative symptoms), voiding symptoms (previously termed as obstructive symptoms) and post-micturition symptoms. The International Continence Society (ICS) published a new standardization of terminology of lower urinary tract function in 2002. Storage symptoms include increased daytime frequency, nocturia, urgency and incontinence. Of incontinence, stress, urge and mixed incontinence are the major symptoms, and ICS has also defined enuresis, continuous incontinence and giggle incontinence as other types of incontinence. Urgency, with or without urge incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia, can be described as overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome, urge syndrome, or urgency/frequency syndrome. These syndromes suggest urodynamically demon- strable detrusor overactivity, but may be due to other forms of urethro-vesical dysfunction. Overactive bladder is an empirical diagnosis used as the basis for initial management after assessing lower urinary tract symptoms, physical findings urinalysis, and other indicated evaluation. Voiding symptoms include slow stream, splitting or spraying, intermittency, hesitancy, straining and terminal dribble. micturition symptoms include a of incomplete and post micturition dribble. The feeling of incomplete emptying symptom was formerly categorized as either a storage symptom or a voiding symptom, but has been categorized among the post micturition symptoms in the new ICS terminology. Post micturition dribble is the term used when an individual describes the involuntary loss of urine immediately after he/she has finished passing urine, usually in men after leaving the toilet. Thus this symptom is not incontinence, and is categorized among the post micturition symptoms.",

      "abstract": "The syndrome of pituitary cachexia has been so completely described and the literature concerning it so thoroughly reviewed in the recent American literature by Silver (1) and Calder (2) that a detailed description of it is unnecessary here. The disease, briefly, is characterized by progessive weight loss and cachexia, loss of libido and potentia, falling of axillary and pubic hair, premature menopause, decrease in basal metabolism, trophic changes in the skin and mental torpor with frequent terminal coma accompanied by hyperpyrexia. Eosinophilia and gastrointestinal disturbances with achlorhydria are not uncommon. Women are affected more frequently than men (about 70 per cent of reported cases) and the symptoms often begin insidiously after a prolonged or difficult labor. The course is chronic, sometimes extending over many years. The primary lesion involves the anterior pituitary; it may be due to a nonspecific atrophy or fibrosis, the degenerative phase of an adenoma or other neoplasm, cysts, tuberculosis, syphilis, or trauma. In a few reported cases no definite structural change has been found in the anterior pituitary; in some instances extension of an adjacent mass lesion occurs, as in the case reported by A. Weinstein (3) in which invasion of an ependymal glioma produced the symptoms. On the other hand, extensive destruction of the anterior pituitary may occur without the syndrome of Simmonds disease. Kaminski (4) has recently described such destruction from extension of a chronic actinomycoticosteomyelitis of the malar bone, invading the basal meninges and pituitary fossa, without any evidence of glandular dysfunction except testicular atrophy. Kaminski attempts to differentiate between ‘exogenous’ and ‘endogenous’ types of pituitary dysfunction, believing that the ‘endogenou’ type is more apt to produce the Simmond’s syndrome.",

A third criterion has been used, including several minor symptoms [fatigue, sleep disorders, stiff ness …] and probable FMS has been defined by two criteria out of three. These different definitions suggest that FMS is more than one disorder and that other criteria are probably needed.Conclusions: Our definition of probable or “in complete” FMS is based on the presence of spontaneous, wide spread, persistent pain, fatigue, and peripheral symptoms such as stiffness, of ten modulated by weather changes, stress, and exercise.Our definition of mechanical allodynia is based on pressure induced tendino-muscular pain [tenderness] usually associated with central symptoms such as sleep disorders [TePs syndrome].Fibromyalgia might then be defined by the association of two distinct conditions: incomplete FMS [spontaneous, diffuse pain, and fatigue], and tenderness [mechanical allodynia], both having been aggravated by physical deconditioning.",

First, a case is presented of a 150-day delay period before the clinical manifestations of brain damage after a single brief (<1 day) exposure to dimethylmercury. The second example is taken from the Iraq outbreak of methylmercury poisoning in which the victims consumed contaminated bread for several weeks without any ill effects. Indeed, signs of poisoning did not appear until weeks or months after exposure stopped. The last example is drawn from observations on nonhuman primates and from the sequelae of the Minamata, Japan, outbreak in which low chronic doses of methylmercury may not have produced observable behavioral effects for periods of time measured in years. The mechanisms of these latency periods are discussed for both acute and chronic exposures. Parallels are drawn with other diseases that affect the central nervous system, such as Parkinson disease and post-polio syndrome, that also reflect the delayed appearance of central nervous system damage.",

DRESS syndrome usually begins within two months from ingestion of the drug, most often two-six weeks after its first use. However, symptoms may occur more rapidly and be more severe upon re-exposure. A six-year-old female child was brought to the hospital with chief complaints of high-grade fever and centrifugal rash; on further investigation, laboratory reports showed organ involvement leading to the diagnosis of DRESS syndrome. The untreated condition may be fatal, so prompt discontinuation of the offending drug and starting the patient on systemic corticosteroids is the mainstay of treatment in DRESS syndrome along with other supportive treatment.",

Placement of children \nand adolescents in residential treatment occurs for a variety of reasons, ranging from \nsevere psychopathology or extreme behavior problems (including legal involvement) \nto significant family dysfunction that interferes with healthy and successful academic, \nsocial, and community functioning. Many young people referred for residential treatment have a long history of family dysfunction that may include experiences of abuse, \ndomestic violence, substance abuse in the home, or neglect, and often school failure \nand aggressive and self-destructive behaviors. Typical diagnoses include Major Depression, Borderline Personality Disorder, Psychotic Disorders, Conduct Disorder, Substance \nAbuse Disorders, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, and other severe personality and \npsychological disorders. They often present with symptoms of oppositional/defiant \nbehavior, anger outbursts, severe mood disturbance, anxiety, self-injurious behaviors, \nsubstance abuse, and poor social skills. It is widely accepted that placing children in the \nleast restrictive placement possible is the goal; however, a child’s referral for this level \nof care often results from the need for more intensive treatment than can be obtained \nthrough outpatient means.",

These symptoms are associated with significant morbidity and ften have a profound impact on patient quality of life. Urinary incontinence is an important contributor o the complications and economic cost of OAB for both community-dwelling and institutionalized elderly ndividuals. Many patients with OAB do not seek treatment because of embarrassment, fear of surgery, or he misperceptions that the problem is untreatable or is a normal and inevitable consequence of aging. onpharmacologic therapies improve bladder control by modifying lifestyle and behavior to prevent urine oss. This requires patient and caregiver motivation and can be time consuming. Improved results may be btained by combining these strategies with pharmacotherapy or by means of pharmacotherapy alone. The ost commonly used pharmacologic agents are the muscarinic receptor antagonists. These include xybutynin, tolterodine, and three agents that have recently been approved for use in the United States: rospium, darifenacin, and solifenacin. In general, these therapies are well tolerated and safe; however, the election of an optimal agent merits careful consideration. For elderly patients, important considerations nclude tolerability, absence of drug interactions, and the availability of a range of dosages to tailor reatment to individual patients. Primary care practitioners and geriatricians can have a key role in uccessful diagnosis and treatment of OAB.

      "abstract": "Motility-like dyspepsia, a clinical subgroup of functional dyspepsia, refers to the cluster of symptoms which suggests an underlying motility disturbance of the upper gut. Characteristic symptoms, in addition to upper abdominal pain or discomfort, are nausea, vomiting, early satiety, anorexia, postprandial abdominal bloating and excessive repetitive postprandial belching. Patients with concomitant symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome are currently excluded from this clinical entity. Delayed gastric emptying of solids and/or liquids, postprandial antral hypomotility and antroduodenal incoordination, gastric myoelectrical arrhythmias and dysfunction of visceral afferents are the major alterations in upper gut sensorimotor activity which have been described. An empirical trial of medical therapy is warranted if there are no “alarm” symptoms at presentation. If symptoms are not relieved after 2-4 weeks, then investigations of the upper gastrointestinal tract, preferably by endoscopy, to exclude the presence of organic disease, is advisable. Management approaches are then reassurance, dietary manipulations and attention to psychosocial aspects. Prokinetic agents appear to be useful as short-term medical therapy in some patients, but optimum long-term treatment strategies, including the use of medications which may improve a diminished tolerance to gut distension, are not established.",

Three presentations of SE are now recognized: recurrent generalized tonic and/or clonic seizures without full recovery of consciousness between attacks, nonconvulsive status where the patient appears to be in a prolonged “epileptic twilight state,” and continuous/repetitive focal seizure activity without alteration of consciousness. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) encompasses a broad spectrum of clinical presentations from repeated overt generalized tonic‐clonic seizures to subtle convulsive movements in a profoundly comatose patient. Thus, GCSE is a dynamic state that is characterized by paroxysmal or continuous tonic and/or clonic motor activity, which may be symmetrical or asymmetrical and overt or subtle but which is associated with a marked impairment of consciousness and with bilateral (although frequently asymmetrical) ictal discharges on the EEG. Just as there is a progression from overt to increasingly subtle clinical manifestations of GCSE, there is also a predictable sequence of progressive EEG changes during untreated GCSE. A sequence of five patterns of ictal discharges has been observed: discrete electrographic seizures, waxing and waning, continuous, continuous with flat periods, and periodic epileptiform discharges on a relatively flat background. A patient actively having seizures or comatose who exhibits any of these patterns on EEG should be considered to be in GCSE and should be treated aggressively to stop all clinical and electrical seizure activity to prevent further neurological morbidity and mortality.",

      "title": "When harms outweigh benefits of long‐term opioid therapy for pain: Need for a new diagnostic entity, research and improved treatments",
      "abstract": "Individuals experiencing difficulty tapering long-term opioid therapy (LTOT) for chronic pain despite harms exceeding benefits do not have opioid use disorder (OUD) as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5). A new diagnosis is needed to expand research and treatment options for this scenario. Given myriad harms and modest or absent benefit of long-term opioid therapy (LTOT) for chronic pain [1], guidelines recommend prescribers frequently reassess LTOT and, in a patient-centered fashion using shared-decision making, taper when harms outweigh benefit [2, 3]. When tapering is indicated, a subset of patients are unsuccessful; some experts suggest that struggling to taper represents impaired control over opioid use, a hallmark of opioid use disorder (OUD), described by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) as a problematic pattern of opioid use leading to problems or distress. Specifically at issue is the DSM-5 criterion of ‘persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts’ to reduce use. We posit that interpretation of this criterion is unclear and leads to confusion about when to diagnose OUD in the context of LTOT, causing negative consequences for patients and stymying treatment and research. We believe the best path forward is to revise DSM-5 to define a condition specific to LTOT with difficulty tapering (without otherwise meeting criteria for OUD). Regarding unsuccessful efforts to cut down and its corollary ‘use for longer than intended’ in the context of LTOT, several points must be considered. First, ‘efforts’ may be driven by the prescriber, conducted at their pace, with prescribers having control rather than patients. Patients may lack desire to cut down, a wholly different scenario than that intended to be captured by the DSM-5, wherein individuals want to curtail substance use, but are unable to. Second, although tolerance and withdrawal were excluded from the DSM-5 definition in the context of LTOT because they are ‘normal, expected’ symptoms, this is also true of difficulty tapering. Prolonged exposure to opioids downregulates μ-opioid receptors, upregulates sympathomimetic hormones and alters in the hypogonadal-pituitary-adrenal axis. Disturbing homeostasis through tapering elicits predictable responses including fear, anxiety and other withdrawal symptoms. Therefore, as DSM-5 asserts tolerance and withdrawal symptoms during LTOT should not be counted when diagnosing OUD, we propose that neither should difficulty tapering. A new diagnosis is needed that better aligns with patients' experience on LTOT; by defining and naming it, the field could more effectively conduct research to measure, prognosticate and treat it. To begin the process of consensus-generation on the diagnostic criteria for a new diagnosis, we engaged 38 multi-disciplinary experts in a Delphi study [4, 5]. Although this project will soon expand—because of a recent United States (US) National Institutes of Health award—to include persons with lived experience and a broader array of researchers, policymakers and clinicians, preliminary criteria include (1) benefits not outweighing harms of LTOT; (2) difficulty tapering; and (3) absence of loss of control, marked by overusing medications and running out of prescriptions early. Presence of loss of control would fulfill an OUD criterion. Another advantage of a new diagnosis for this scenario is to avoid over-diagnosis of OUD. In a chart review study, Howell et al. [6] found that 29% of OUD diagnoses were likely invalid with a major source of misclassification being clinicians' use of OUD among patients on LTOT without documented issues of taking medications other than how prescribed. Consistent with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, assessing LTOT's impact should revolve around comparing improved pain-related function (i.e. benefits) versus harms and should be collaborative and transparent. Should a taper falter, pushing an OUD diagnosis—by asserting the presence of loss of control when the patient has been largely adherent to the treatment plan—can be alienating for the patient and may derail the opportunity to make needed changes. Of course, if clear evidence of loss of control of opioid use emerges (e.g. self-escalating dose) an OUD diagnosis should be strongly considered. As such, we do not advocate for a new diagnosis to spare patients on LTOT the stigma of being correctly diagnosed with OUD; we advocate for a new diagnosis to avoid the stigmatizing and confusing experience of being incorrectly diagnosed with OUD. Finally, we need a new diagnosis for this scenario to design studies that will generate evidence to improve quality of care. Guidelines recommend optimizing non-pharmacologic and non-opioid therapies and working with patients to taper LTOT, but these broad concepts need greater detail to help practicing clinicians. One approach, often helpful to improve pain and function while enhancing opioid safety is switching from LTOT to sublingual buprenorphine [7]. However, as sublingual buprenorphine is only approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for OUD, prescribers seeking to use it to treat this scenario often face regulatory or insurance coverage barriers. Patients may reject it, not recognizing it as a treatment for their condition or may not be able to afford it. One potential solution is for the FDA to expand the indication for sublingual buprenorphine to this scenario, a move we strongly support. It is encouraging that the US Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA, included switch to buprenorphine as a recommended approach among patients on LTOT for whom tapering is indicated, but not tolerated [8]. However, the FDA cannot approve a medication for an undefined indication; another reason to name this diagnosis and develop criteria for it. Beyond buprenorphine, other treatments, including non-pharmacological interventions such as mindfulness-based stress reduction [9] or behavioral therapies [10], also need to be examined. In our experience, for patients on LTOT for whom harms outweigh benefit, but tapering is stalling, misapplying a diagnosis of OUD rarely leads to improvements in patient function or the patient-provider relationship. This condition needs a different treatment approach. Often, such patients will not receive the care they need within OUD treatment programs where clinicians may not be trained to address chronic pain. We believe a new diagnostic entity would align well with guidelines encouraging continuous reassessment of benefits and harms of LTOT and help generate evidence for how to proceed when that balance becomes unfavorable.

Changes in energy levels, sleep patterns, ability to focus, and other features can dramatically impact a person’s behavior, work, relationships, and other aspects of life. Most people experience mood changes at some time, but those related to bipolar disorder are more intense than regular mood changes, and other symptoms can occur. Some people experience psychosis, which can include delusions, hallucinations, and paranoia. Objectives Through this research we aimed to identify all the special features of bipolar depression which will help the clinical psychiatrists in easier diagnosis and management of the disorder. Methods Literature review (PubMed) Results Clinical Characteristics in Favour of Bipolarity in Depression: psychomotor retardation, history of psychotic depression,history of psychotic depression shortly after giving childbirth, frequent catatonic symptoms, atypical depressive features, severe impairment in interpersonal relationships, inconsistency in business life, history of hypomania, mania or mixed episode,common feeling of numbness and anhedonia; less common sadness and feelings of guilt, mood instability, volatility in temperament, frequent change in affect, daydreaming during the episode and daily life, short duration of depression &lt;3 months, poor cognitive functions during depressive episode, generally similar symptom severity during the day and night etc. Conclusions This leads to misdiagnosis of bipolar depression as unipolar depression, which in turn leads to delayed correct diagnosis and treatment and may severely affect the patient’s entire life.

We report a case of a patient with withdrawal psychosis who showed persecutory delusion and disorganized behaviors in addition to common withdrawal symptoms such as agitation and irritability. A 25-year-old male developed a full-blown psychotic episode within one day after discontinuing an Internet game that he had been playing for at least eight hours a day for two years. Upon admission, he had no abnormal brain imaging findings and laboratory tests. With antipsychotic medication (quetiapine up to 800 mg), his psychotic symptoms rapidly subsided and after four days of treatment, he no longer showed any signs of psychosis. This case report suggests that brief psychosis can develop during withdrawal from long-term excessive use of an Internet and the central pathology beneath the IAD is more likely a form of addiction than impulse control.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a syndrome of primarily psychomotor disturbances associated with typical abnormalities of muscle tone. It is characterized by the co-occurrence of several symptoms of decreased, increased, or abnormal psychomotor activity. Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, not an independent nosological entity. Historically associated mainly with schizophrenia (e.g., catatonic subtype), ICD-11, similarly to DSM-5, now recognizes catatonia under a separate classification category, apart from psychotic disorders. In addition to schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, it can occur in the context of other mental disorders, such as mood disorders, or neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or immediately after intoxication or withdrawal from psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine, cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of some psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Moreover, catatonia can occur as a direct pathophysiological consequence of various nonpsychiatric medical conditions, e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, neoplasms head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, or encephalitis. Due to the fact that catatonia was mostly associated witch schizophrenia, many cases were not diagnosed and thus did not receive indicated treatment. There are no specific “anti-catatonic” drugs, first-line treatment are benzodiazepines and ECT, in addition to the symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recognition of catatonia as an independent category in ICD-11 can improve medical care for catatonic patients in clinical practice. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "title": "Brief Apnea and Hypoventilation Reduces Seizure Duration and Shifts Seizure Location for Several Hours in a Model of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Objective Seizures are difficult to control in infants and toddlers. Seizures with periods of apnea and hypoventilation are common following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). In our multifactorial, severe TBI model (cortical impact, mass effect, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, seizures induced with kainic acid, and brief apnea and hypoventilation), we observed that brief apnea with hypoventilation (A&amp;H) after induced seizure acutely interrupted seizures, leading us to hypothesize that brief A&amp;H might reduce seizure duration beyond the brief hypoxia and hypercapnia for several hours thereafter. The effects of the timing of A&amp;H on seizure duration and location might inform the pathophysiology of this hypoxic-ischemic injury as well as potential treatments. Methods Piglets (1 week or 1 month old) received multi-factorial injuries. Apnea and hypoventilation (1 min apnea, 10 min hypoventilation; A&amp;H) was induced either before or after seizure induction, or as a control piglets received subdural/subarachnoid hematoma and seizure without A&amp;H. In an intensive care unit, piglets were sedated, intubated, mechanically ventilated, and epidural EEG was recorded for an average of 18 hours after seizure induction. Results In our severe TBI model, A&amp;H after seizure reduced ipsilateral seizure burden by 80% compared to the same injuries without A&amp;H. In the A&amp;H before seizure induction group, more piglets had exclusively contralateral seizures though most piglets in all groups had seizures that shifted location throughout the several hours of seizure. After 8-10 hours, seizures transitioned to interictal epileptiform discharges regardless of timing of A&amp;H. Significance Even brief A&amp;H may alter traumatic seizures We will address the possibility of induced spreading depolarization prior to preclinical investigations of hypercapnia with normoxia, with controlled intracranial pressure, as a therapeutic option for children with status epilepticus after hemorrhagic TBI.",

      "title": "Intensive Care Unit Neuromuscular Syndrome?",
      "abstract": "Accepted for publication May 1, 1995.Key words: Complications. Neuromuscular blocking drugs. Prolonged infusion.Causes of motor dysfunction of critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) include neuropathies, [1]myopathies, neuromuscular diseases (myasthesia gravis, myasthenic syndrome), dysregulation of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs; burn), [2]nutritional and electrolyte imbalance (Li sup +, Mg sup ++, Ca sup ++, PhO4sup --, Na sup +, K sup +), [3]acid-base abnormalities, hypoxia, fatigue, reperfusion injury, [4]steroids, antibiotics, lesions of the central and peripheral nervous systems, and disuse and immobilization atrophies. [5]Any of these conditions may result in ICU patients responding to neuromuscular blocking drugs (NMBDs) less predictably than do healthy surgical subjects.Despite the unpredictable effect and the great number of conditions complicating their use, NMBDs are used in the ICU frequently, in large doses, and often for a duration much longer than in the operating suite. [5-11]Furthermore, the cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, respiratory, and central nervous systems take priority over the neuromuscular system, which receives little attention except when it is already diseased. Personnel in the ICU receive inadequate training in the pharmacology and management of NMBDs. [8,12]In contrast with the meticulous choice of drug and dosage and the standard of monitoring in the operating suite, personnel in the ICU seem to settle for one favorite drug (pancuronium, vecuronium, atracurium) administered according to one dosing formula and do not monitor the effect or monitor it infrequently. If NMBDs will cause complications, these are the ideal conditions.The pharmacology of neuromuscular transmission as it pertains to the use of NMBDs in the ICU received little attention until prolonged paralysis after cessation of long-term use of NMBDs was described in numerous reports, national surveys, [9,13,14]and reviews. [5,10,15]Miller was personally aware of 45 cases of prolonged responses to NMBDs in 5 yr.* In a report of 12 cases, one patient received 2,780 mg vecuronium over 25 days, at an average dose of 111 mg per day, during 35 days of mechanical ventilation, resulting in a moderately severe motor weakness that took 3 months to resolve. [6]In another report, [7]a patient received 7,728 mg vecuronium over 30 days after a lung transplant and required 4 months to regain most of her strength. As is usual of iatrogenic complications, awareness alone may change the practice. Reported cases of NMBD-induced protracted paralysis may represent only the tip of the iceberg, but the problem already may be lessening. [5,13,14,16]A recent prospective study demonstrated that, by monitoring the neuromuscular transmission and providing adequate sedation and analgesia, smaller doses of pancuronium and pipecuronium than those previously used sufficed, and no prolonged paralysis occurred in a series of 60 ICU patients. [16].Reports describing prolonged paralysis after administration of NMBD to patients in the ICU have varied widely as to the dose and duration of administration of NMBDs, the duration of paralysis, the underlying critical illness, and the neuromuscular pathology. It is possible that the reported cases represent more than one disease entity or none at all. The pathology of NMBD-induced protracted paralysis includes marked atrophy of type I and type II muscle fibers, destructive myopathy, relatively little inflammation, and relatively intact motor and sensory nerves. [6,7]It appears different from the \"critical illness polyneuropathy.\" [1]The disease process is mainly in the muscle. Some of the reported cases have been suspected as simply an exacerbation of one or more existing conditions, e.g., steroid myopathy, altered pharmacokinetics, antibiotic neuromuscular block, or critical illness polyneuropathy. [5,7,11],* If the post-NMBD paralysis can be explained in its entirety as due to pharmacokinetic changes, as has been suggested, [17]the problem represents only a failure to properly modify the use of NMBDs to fit the patient's conditions. However, often this does not seem to be the case. Watling and Dasta divided the reported cases into two categories: pharmacokinetically related and pharmacokinetically unrelated. [15]The pharmacokinetically unrelated cases suggest specific pathology of the neuromuscular structures.Is there a neuromuscular pathology specifically attributable to prolonged action of NMBDs? Prolonged prejunctional and postjunctional actions of NMBDs cause dysregulation of the AChRs of the skeletal muscle. [2,18,19]Botulinum toxin [20]and d-tubocurarine [21]have been shown to increase extrajunctional muscle sensitivity to acetylcholine. Recently, Dodson et al. demonstrated upregulation of AChRs in necropsy muscle samples of deceased critically ill adults [22]who had received long-term, high-dose infusion of vecuronium. NMBD-induced upregulation of AChRs may be extensive enough to cause tolerance to NMBDs in the rat [19]and humans* and hyperkalemia after succinylcholine in the rat [23]and possibly humans. [5,24]The dysregulation of AChRs after prolonged exposure to NMBDs is therefore similar to that after traumatic denervation, disuse, or immobilization. However, it may be different from burn-induced dysregulation, with dissimilarities in receptor subunits. [25].It is tempting to ascribe NMBD-induced dysregulation of AChRs of the muscle, the increased sensitivity to acetylcholine, the resistance to d-tubocurarine, and the hyperkalemic response to succinylcholine simply to a \"chemical denervation.\" However, this NMBD-induced dysregulation occurs even without disuse or immobilization, namely without \"chemical denervation.\" Hogue et al. [19]have demonstrated tolerance and upregulation of AChRs after chronic infusion of d-tubocurarine in rats even at minimally or non-neuromuscular blocking doses. The hyperkalemic reaction to succinylcholine observed by Yanez et al. [23]occurred even after nonimmobilizing doses of d-tubocurarine. NMBD-induced upregulation of AChRs, therefore, differs from traumatic denervation in at least one aspect: Besides secondarily to \"chemical denervation,\" NMBD-induced upregulation of AChRs may be a primary drug action.Does NMBD-induced upregulation of AChRs, as a primary drug action or secondary to disuse, cause or contribute to the pathogenesis of the post-NMBD myopathy and motor dysfunction? In this issue, Kim et al. [26]report that prolonged infusion of d-tubocurarine accentuates burn-induced upregulation of AChRs in the rat. This study provides a critical link between NMBD-induced upregulation of AChRs and that of at least one disease process of patients in the ICU (burn). Synergism between NMBD-induced dysregulation of AChRs (A) and other underlying dysregulation processes (B) might be a major determinant (C) of whether the dysregulation will become severe enough to actually progress to myopathies and protracted paralysis in the critically ill. In this regard, the report of Kim et al. is an important step toward understanding the post-NMBD protracted paralysis of the critically ill. It allows NMBDs to play a partial role. It allows the assumption that patients with certain underlying pathologies (if severe enough) may be more prone to the complication than those without. Conversely, it allows the assumption that sufficient action of NMBDs or sufficient AChR dysregulation is required to consummate a clinically significant motor impairment. [16,22]Finally, upregulation of AChRs may hypothetically be the common specific pathologic process of all post-NMBD protracted paralysis, regardless of the underlying critical illness.Controversies are bound to follow, and many unanswered questions need urgent attention. Clinically, NMBD-induced dysregulation of AchRs occurs in ICU patients. [22]Are the receptor changes and the clinical pathology causally related? If they are, how does the dysregulation cause the myopathy and the motor dysfunction? What is the dose-response relationship? Are the various NMBDs different? Cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia after administration of succinylcholine has been reported to occur in ICU patients who had no previously recognized predisposing factors except a presumed relative disuse due to ICU confinement. [5,24]However, the exact role of NMBD-induced dysregulation of AChRs in hyperkalemia cannot be assessed from these case reports. Tolerance and increasing requirement of NMBDs have been observed clinically but only sporadically. [5],* Given this preliminary evidence, could the clinical disease in question be an \"ICU neuromuscular syndrome\" of protracted paralysis, altered sensitivity to the curariform NMBDs, and susceptibility to succinylcholine-induced hyperkalemia, all based on the common mechanism of NMBD-induced upregulation of AChRs? Could the dysregulation-mediated ICU neuromuscular syndrome, as herein defined, be just one variety of NMBD-related prolonged paralysis, which in turn accounts for only part of all prolonged paralysis of the critically ill? The term ICU neuromuscular syndrome is intended to stress its primarily neuromuscular, not neural or muscular, origin and mechanism. Without first somehow defining a problem or part of a problem, the incidence, prevalence, and exact dose requirement of the problem will be confusing. Other unanswered questions include the exact nature of these abnormal AChRs. Does dysregulation of AChRs occur also prejunctionally? AChRs are present at the motor nerve terminal, [27]and \"very distal denervation\" [6]of the motor nerve has been observed in patients.Finally, I agree with Coursin [28]and Fiamengo and Savarese [29]that each use of an NMBD in the ICU deserves careful thought in terms of indication, selection, dose, and duration. Excessive reliance on NMBDs should be discouraged. Although still unconfirmed, reducing the dose and duration of administration of NMBDs probably will lessen the risk of prolonged paralysis. [16]Monitoring of neuromuscular transmission is essential, especially in critically ill patients who have numerous reasons to respond abnormally and one new reason to be hurt by NMBDs. Many monitoring methods are available, [30]but even the simplest method (e.g., train-of-four count [31]) applied occasionally but regularly may help avoid gross overdose. Most pharmacokinetically related cases [15]probably could have been prevented by careful monitoring. Unfortunately, even subparalytic doses of NMBDs might suffice to dysregulate AChRs and accentuate the process. [19,26]The safe dose may vary from patient to patient and relaxant to relaxant. Some patients, as has been suspected of those with septicemia and steroid neuropathy, may be particularly susceptible. Until further clarified, therefore, it is advisable to go one step further and refrain from using NMBDs whenever they are dispensable or replaceable. If this is not possible, periodic interruption of NMBD administration, pharmacokinetic study and correlation between the neuromuscular transmission and the serum concentration of NMBD, and neurologic and electrophysiologic studies may be useful in the early detection of a potentially devastating complication.Chingmuh Lee, M.D. Professor and Chairman, Department of Anesthesiology, University of California, Los Angeles School of Medicine, Harbor/University of California, Los Angeles Medical Center Campus, 1000 West Carson Street, Torrance, California 90509* Miller RD: Use of muscle relaxants in non-operating room locations: International Anesthesia Research Society 1993 review course lectures. 6-9, 1993.",

Alcohol seems be even the higher risk for soldiers less exposed to combat stressors (e.g. fire), but more to chronic stressors (boredom, isolation, helplessness) than PTSD for a soldier in action. Therefore pre-deployment training of our soldiers should be more devoted to mental health aspects, starting with alcohol overuse.",

      "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a behavioral disorder that typically begins in childhood and is characterized by a short attention span, which refers to inattentiveness, an inability to be calm and stay still, which refers to hyperactivity, and poor impulse control, which refers to impulsivity. People with ADHD usually experience the following types of symptoms: (1) Attention means a person may have difficulty staying on task, sustaining focus, and staying organized, and appear not to listen, even when spoken to directly. (2) Hyperactivity means a person may seem to move about constantly, including in situations when it is not appropriate or excessively fidgets, taps, or talks. They may often be on the go, in constant motion, and have trouble playing or doing an activity quietly. (3) Impulsivity means a person may act without thinking or have difficulty with self-control. Impulsive behavior also occurs when their desire for reward is not satisfied or temporarily put on hold. An impulsive person may interrupt others or make important decisions without considering long-term consequences. Those people’s behaviors are more severe, occur more often, and interfere with or reduce the quality of how they function socially at school or in professional life.",

Seen in the light of the Conceptual Model (Neuromatrix theory) by Ronald. D. Melzack and the concept that chronic pain is bio-psycho-social in origin, three categories of chronic pain patients can be set forth: It is recommended that patients in the last two groups should be referred to a multidisciplinary pain centre. In the Pain Centre in Aalborg, Denmark, the treatment can be coping or pacing in groups of eight. The patients may also be treated by a doctor or physiotherapist or receive counselling from a social worker. Patients that should not be referred to a pain centre include: patients who still need treatment or who are being treated for a somatic disease, patients that are not motivated for the treatment offered by the pain centre, patients abusing analgesics and who do not want to quit, and finally patients with major psychiatric problems such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or patients with personality disorders.",

      "abstract": "Overtraining is an imbalance between training and recovery, exercise and exercise capacity, stress and stress tolerance. Stress is the sum of training and nontraining stress factors. Peripheral (short-term overtraining, STO) or peripheral and central fatigue may result (long-term overtraining, LTO). STO lasting a few days up to 2 wk is termed overreaching. STO is associated with fatigue, reduction, or stagnation of the 4 LT performance capacity (performance at 4 mmol lactate or comparable criterion), reduction of maximum performance capacity, and brief competitive incompetence. Recovery is achieved within days, so the prognosis is favorable, LTO lasting weeks or months causes overtraining syndrome or staleness. The symptomatology associated with overtraining syndrome has changed over the last 50 yr from excitation and restlessness (so-called sympathetic form) to phlegmatic behavior and inhibition (so-called parasympathetic form). Increased volume of training at a high-intensity level is likely the culprit. The parasympathetic form of overtraining syndrome dominates in endurance sports. Accumulation of exercise and nonexercise fatigue, stagnation, or reduction of the 4 LT performance capacity, reduction in maximum performance capacity, mood state disturbances, muscle soreness/stiffness, and long-term competitive incompetence can be expected. Complete recovery requires weeks and months, so the prognosis is unfavorable. Other optional or further confirmation requiring findings include changes in blood chemistry variables, hormone levels, and nocturnal urinary catecholamine excretion. Based on the findings reported, recommendations for training monitoring can be made, but their relevance in the practice must still be clarified.",

      "abstract": "SYNOPSIS Migraine has been hypothesized to be the clinical expression of a deficiency in pain modulating mechanisms. Abnormalities in opiate receptor responsiveness may be an aspect of this dysfunction. In migraine patients, i.v. administration of pentazocine (15 mg), a kappa and sigma opiate receptor agonist, provoked: (1) disturbances in visual and/or body image perception in 9 of the 24 treated patients, different from controls where these phenomena were never observed; (2) other symptoms which were also reported by controls; (3) miosis, without differences from controls. No differences between common and classical migraine sufferers were found. In patients complaining of perceptive disorders from pentazocine the other symptoms were longer lasting and miosis less intense than in the remaining patients, who responded to the drug as controls did. Two subgroups of patients could be defined, with and without pentazocine‐induced perceptive disturbances, the former abnormally, the latter normally reacting to the drug. Pretreatment with naloxone (0.4 mg): (a) prevented pentazocine‐induced perceptive disturbances, (b) shortened duration of the other symptoms in both patients and controls, (c) antagonized pentazocine‐induced miosis in controls but not in patients. It was discussed whether reduced miosis in patients with pentazocine‐induced perceptive disorders depends on a hyporesponsiveness of kappa receptors, or may be attributed to the sigma opiate receptor hyperreactivity upon which the perceptive disturbances seem to depend.",

      "title": "Cocaine-Positive Patients Undergoing Elective Surgery: From Avoiding Case Cancellations to Treating Substance Use Disorders",
      "abstract": "See Article, p 308 The impact of substance use disorders (SUDs) on the management of anesthesia for patients undergoing surgical procedures covers a broad spectrum, from the acute effects of intoxication to chronic effects such as altered anesthetic drug metabolism or a predisposition to perioperative organ injury.1 SUDs, which are characterized by the persistent use of a substance despite adverse consequences, including health problems, are extremely common. For example, in the United States, the 12-month prevalence of alcohol use disorder is 13.9%.2 For the less common substances encompassed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) SUD definition (amphetamines, cannabis, club drugs, cocaine, hallucinogens, heroin, nonheroin opioids, sedative/tranquilizers, and/or solvent/inhalant use disorders), the 12-month prevalence is still 3.9%.3 The immediate dilemma for the anesthesiologist presented with a urine toxicology result that is positive for cocaine, or any of the substances included in the DSM-5 SUD definition, is then whether to (1) postpone the elective surgery or (2) proceed with the anesthetic while anticipating potential problems associated with the urine toxicology result. While option (1) may seem the \"safest\" from a provider's point of view, unanticipated cancellations of surgery come at steep costs. In addition to the financial implications of unused operating room time, prolonged patient suffering, worsened patient experience, and treatment delays resulting in worsened clinical outcomes due to disease progression represent potential consequences to case cancellations.4 The higher prevalence of SUDs in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations5 with limited access to care makes a decision to postpone an elective procedure even more consequential. The acutely cocaine-intoxicated patient may display hypertension, tachyarrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and convulsions, and management of anesthesia in such patients has been described for parturients, fetuses, and neonates.6 Cocaine-using patients presenting in a clinically nontoxic (asymptomatic) state, defined as normal blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and normal or unchanged electrocardiogram, have been shown to receive general anesthesia safely for scheduled elective surgery in a prospective cohort study including 40 cocaine-positive patients.7 In the current issue of the Journal, Moon et al8 report on a single-center prospective cohort study evaluating the association of a positive preoperative urine test for cocaine and intraoperative hemodynamic events in a cohort of 327 asymptomatic patients with a history of cocaine use. Hemodynamic events were defined as a mean arterial blood pressure of <65 or >105 mm Hg, or a heart rate of <50 or >100 beats per minute. They found that the 173 asymptomatic cocaine-positive patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia had similar percentages of intraoperative hemodynamic events when compared to 154 cocaine-negative patients. Moon et al's8 current study adds to a growing body of literature suggesting that urine toxicology results positive for cocaine, per se, may not reflect an absolute contraindication to proceeding with a surgical procedure.7,9,10 While this is undoubtedly a critical conclusion, we would like to contextualize these results with respect to (1) the prevalence of polysubstance use, particularly multiple stimulants, and (2) the effectiveness of in-hospital interventions on SUD trajectories in general. POLYSUBSTANCE USE A complicating factor for patients with cocaine use disorder is the concomitant use of other substances. Accordingly, patients with polysubstance use (except marijuana) were excluded from Moon et al's8 study. However, a patient presenting with a urine toxicology result positive for cocaine plus an additional substance may be quite common. For example, in a sample of 706 rural methamphetamine users in the United States, 35% reported using both methamphetamines and cocaine.11 The example of concurrent cocaine and amphetamine use (which could also be present among cocaine users who use prescription stimulants) illustrates why surgical patients with polysubstance use may demand a more conservative approach. Since both substances can lead to a hypermetabolic state, including tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia, the risk for adverse perioperative outcomes is amplified in these patients. Specific conditions such as serotonin syndrome may further be triggered by preoperatively administered medications and pose a unique risk to polysubstance users. An isolated positive urine toxicology result for cocaine in an otherwise asymptomatic patient may lead to alterations in the anesthetic care plan, but not necessarily postponement of the surgical procedure. However, the detection of other substances in addition to cocaine may still merit delaying an elective procedure, even if the patient appears asymptomatic. Obtaining urine toxicology results as a part of the preoperative assessment in patients at risk for SUD is a requirement to make an informed decision on whether or not to proceed with surgery. IN-HOSPITAL INTERVENTIONS ON SUDS SUDs may have contributed to the presenting complaint that necessitated a surgical procedure and pose challenges to the recovery process after anesthesia and surgery. Hospitalizations, in general, offer the opportunity to administer interventions beyond the primary admission diagnosis, especially in populations that are otherwise unlikely to seek regular primary care. The standard of care in this setting is screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT), which quickly assesses the severity of a patient's substance use, identifies the appropriate level of treatment, and attempts to increase insight regarding substance use and motivation for behavioral change. SBIRT can be implemented by a wide range of health care personnel with varied backgrounds. The efficacy of SBIRT has been well described for common SUDs. A Cochrane review on the effectiveness of interventions for smoking cessation in hospitalized patients found that only high-intensity behavioral interventions that began during a hospital stay and lasted a minimum of 1 month after discharge were effective.12 Interestingly, interventions of low intensity or shorter duration were not successful in this study. Yet, brief interventions administered in the preadmission clinic before elective surgery have shown success in reducing smoking rates at 1 year with a number needed to treat of 5.9.13 Similarly, for perioperative alcohol use, a recent Cochrane review summarized the results of 3 clinical studies.14 The authors found that alcohol cessation interventions significantly increased the number of participants who quit drinking alcohol during the intervention period and likely reduced the number of postoperative complications.14 SBIRT approaches have been successfully implemented across a variety of different health care sites, including emergency departments and urgent care centers, inpatient hospital settings, and outpatient and community-based clinics, and have shown success in regard to reducing cocaine use specifically.15 SBIRT has also been shown to improve functioning in other domains that may have been associated with the initial complaint that brought the patient to medical attention, including general health, mental health, employment, housing status, and criminal behavior.15 Thus, postoperative hospital-based intervention for SUDs following a positive urine toxicology result for cocaine or another substance may decrease future substance use and increase the likelihood that patients adhere to postoperative care recommendations and do not require subsequent readmission. FUTURE DIRECTIONS The study by Moon et al8 may help anesthesiologists who must make a challenging decision when faced with the dilemma of canceling versus proceeding with a scheduled case in a patient with cocaine use disorder and an isolated positive urine toxicology result. In addition to safely shepherding our patients through the intraoperative course, opportunities for expansion of our practice exist. Future study may focus on how to best manage patients presenting with polysubstance use, as well as hospitalization-based interventions geared at the long-term reduction of illicit drug use in these patients.

Sleep-deprived individuals may have trouble making decisions, solving problems, controlling their emotions and behavior, and coping with stress or change. We report a case who started having sleep deprivation over 15 days following a stressor, which resulted in an acute psychosis-like condition with associated disorientation and perplexity.

Academic underachievement and intense loneliness, despite outward signs of feeling at ease, may be manifestations of a poor sense of self-worth, of apathy, and of lack of motivation that the adolescent has sought to alleviate by escaping to a drug-induced euphoric state.

Drugs such as alcohol, antidepressants, amphetamine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, glue, cocaine, hallucinogens, metacular, narcotics, opiates, sedatives, stimulants and some organic solvents can be named [2]. Substance abuse can cause criminal or antisocial behavior, may generate long-term changes in personality [3]. Cocaine has major toxic effects on the body. Treatment of cocaine poisoning is complex. The main sales are those that can lead to patient death. For the proper treatment of any inoculation, it is necessary to identify the xenobiotic that generated it. The presence of metabolites, in the case of cocaine - ethylbenzoylcogene (EBE), provides information on the time of administration of the xenobiotic. Gas chromatography or liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry is an optoelectronic method that can identify the presence of cocaine and / or EBE from biological samples. In order to increase the sensitivity of the method, a special mass metrology technique - MS/MS can be used [4, 5].",

      "abstract": "It is difficult to differentiate whether neuropsychiatric symptoms are caused by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or psychiatric background, coexisting disorders or drug-induced side effects. The aim of this paper is to present two cases of psychotic symptoms (bipolar and paranoid disorder) induced by chloroquine. Case 1: Severe depressive episode with psychotic features appeared in the context of third SLE exacerbation and chloroquine treatment. Hydroxychloroquine was used instead and symptoms resolved. Later, manic episode (with psychotic features) emerged several days after chloroquine was prescribed for concomitant arthritis. Since that time, chloroquine has been withdrawn. Currently the patient is undergoing treatment with hydroxychloroquine and psychiatric drugs with good response. Case 2: The second patient started to suffer from headaches and being lightheaded three days after chloroquine administration and within next few days feeling of derealization and poorly defining persecutory delusions accompanied by strong anxiety with occasional visual illusions occurred with clear consciousness. After eighteen days chloroquine was withdrawn and after two days all the symptoms resolved. Clinicians should be vigilant for possible psychiatric disorder when using chloroquine in patients with SLE. Such cases are probably rare and may include both paranoid and bipolar spectrum disorders. Studies on interactions of chloroquine with brain neurotransmitter systems are needed. Hydroxychloroquine may represent lower risk considering psychiatric complications. Mechanism of the difference is currently not known.",

At least one of the symptoms must be hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized speech. There must be continuous signs of the disturbance for at least six months, although the duration may be shortened with appropriate treatment. The symptoms of schizophrenia typically begin between the ages of 15 and 30 years. Active symptoms are typically preceded by a prodromal phase, marked by a decline in academic and social functioning. The assessment of an adolescent with suspected schizophrenia should include a psychiatric assessment and complete medical history to rule out medical conditions that mimic psychosis. The primary treatment is antipsychotic medications. Adjunctive psychological and social interventions can improve treatment adherence and clinical outcomes.",

      "title": "Case of Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia - Continuum Through Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy",
      "abstract": "Panic disorder is characterized by spontaneous and unexpected occurrence of panic attacks, the frequency of which can vary from several attacks per day to only a few attacks per year. Panic disorder is usually qualified with the presence or absence of agoraphobia. Panic disorder with agoraphobia is an anxious disorder where repeated attacks of fear and anxiety appear at places and situations out of the family surrounding, places where the escape is difficult and where someone would be helpless, as for an example crowded places, passing over bridges, traveling by public transport, walking in an open space. Depressive episodes, as well as obsessive-compulsive procedures, can also follow this condition. A female person aged 25 years presents with a classical panic disorder with an agoraphobia and a classic and secure behavior. She also suffers from dysthymia and a chronic fluctuating mood and low self-confidence. The patient gets panic attack when traveling by public transport in the morning when going to work, in a restaurant, in a supermarket, in a disco, when walking in an open space. The symptomatology started half a year before going to the psychiatrist, after several close persons died. A short description of CBT. CBT is based on the cognitive model of an emotional answer and aspects of stoic philosophy. CBT is based on an idea that our thoughts cause emotions and different behavior, so that we can change the way of thinking, and after that feelings/behavior unchanged situations. CBT uses Socrates' method and some techniques from psychodrama, as well as relaxing techniques. Giving «homework» and keeping a diary is also a very important part of this therapy. Seven therapeutic sessions of a cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy in a combination with the antidepressants (one session weekly) were performed. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is a leading therapy in dealing with agoraphobia and panic attacks. In combination with SSRI, it gives excellent results in reduction of the symptomatology. At the end of the treatment, the mental state was significantly improved. The patient came in contact with her beliefs and the basic models developed in childhood, and learned how to cope with negative thoughts, feelings and maladaptive behavior.",

      "abstract": "It is well known that continued excessive alcohol consumption can lead to the development of physiological dependence. When drinking is abruptly terminated or substantially reduced in the dependent individual, a characteristic withdrawal syndrome ensues. As with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, withdrawal symptoms associated with cessation of chronic alcohol use are opposite in nature to the effects of intoxication. Thus, clinical features of alcohol withdrawal include signs of heightened autonomic nervous system activation (e.g., tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, diaphoresis, tremor), CNS hyperexcitability that may culminate in motor seizures, and, in its most severe form, hallucinosis and delerium tremens (1–3). In addition to physical signs of withdrawal, a constellation of symptoms contributing to psychological discomfort (e.g., irritability, agitation, anxiety, dysphoria) constitute a significant component of the withdrawal syndrome (4–7). The overall intensity of the withdrawal syndrome is presumed to reflect the degree of physiological dependence developed during the course of chronic alcohol use/abuse.",

      "title": "Introduction: Emotion and Psychopathology",
      "abstract": "Abstract Given the complexity and exquisite regulation of emotion described in previous chapters, it is not surprising that emotional dysfunction lies at the core of a variety of psychopathological conditions. The syndromes of emotional dysregulation lie on a continuum of temporal characteristics, ranging from seconds/minutes (panic attacks) to hours/days (borderline personality disorder) to weeks/ months (unipolar and bipolar illness) to years/lifetime (schizophrenia and autism). The panic/anxiety disorders are characterized by paroxysmal episodes of panic, sometimes superimposed on more chronic components of dysphoria, agoraphobia, and depression. The marked mood lability of borderline personality disorder and its interdigitation with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) syndromes are typified by extremely rapid and major mood shifts. Included in this phasic dysregulation are prominent components of anxiety, depression, proneness to substance abuse, and chaotic experience of the self and relationships to others. The unipolar and bipolar affective disorders range from chronic dysthymia to irregular bursts of recurrent brief depression to minor and major depression to these conditions in the context of hypomania (bipolar II) and fullblown mania (bipolar I). This range of depressive and manic mood disorders is common in the general population and most typical of psychopathologies involving dysfunction of emotional regulation. The schizophrenias are more commonly associated with a persistent disconnection of affect from its appropriate context, and thus they present with prominent autistic components. In childhood autism itself there is an early and chronic breakdown of emotional communication that often involves an absence of normal language and affective responsiveness to others. Given this range of type and temporal dissimilarities among the major psychopathological syndromes of emotion, we chose to highlight in this part several of the more prominent syndromes and components that bridge diagnostic categories Although each of the chapters has a separate focus, it is worth emphasizing the constant interaction and interplay of cognition, emotion, and neurobiology that is important not only for understanding the psychological and neurobiological substrates of affective dysregulation but also for approaches to therapeutics that can also involve each of three domains (affective, cognitive, and somatic) as primary targets.",

      "abstract": "Approximately 2% to 9% of patients seen in a family physician's office have alcohol dependence. These patients are at risk of developing alcohol withdrawal syndrome if they abruptly abstain from alcohol use. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome begins six to 24 hours after the last intake of alcohol, and the signs and symptoms include tremors, agitation, nausea, sweating, vomiting, hallucinations, insomnia, tachycardia, hypertension, delirium, and seizures. Treatment aims to minimize symptoms, prevent complications, and facilitate continued abstinence from alcohol. Patients with mild or moderate alcohol withdrawal syndrome can be treated as outpatients, which minimizes expense and allows for less interruption of work and family life. Patients with severe symptoms or who are at high risk of complications should receive inpatient treatment. In addition to supportive therapy, benzodiazepines, either in a fixed-dose or symptom-triggered schedule, are recommended. Medication should be given at the onset of symptoms and continued until symptoms subside. Other medications, including carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, valproic acid, and gabapentin, have less abuse potential but do not prevent seizures. Typically, physicians should see these patients daily until symptoms subside. Although effective treatment is an initial step in recovery, long-term success depends on facilitating the patient's entry into ongoing treatment.",

Progress in symptomatic treatment depends first on the reasonable and graduated use of pure analgesics, looking out for the toxic side effects of the usual drugs and then the fairly definite efficacy of certain psychotropic drugs. The discovery of an etiology gives a specific dimension to the treatment: either anti-cerebral oedema drugs with above all tetracosactide, a diagnostic test of cerebral tumours, or antidepressor or tranquillizer drugs, depending on the variety of disturbance to be corrected. An attack of migraine always benefits from ergotamine used occasionally and in limited dosage (not more than 6 mg daily or 10 mg per week). For the basic treatment the drugs act mainly peripherally and fairly regularly in the following order: methysergide, beta-blockaders, pizotifene, cyproheptadine, oxetorone. Other drugs have a central effect, Tiapridal, MAO inhibitors which are too often neglected, and clonazepam which is not very easy to use.",

Resultados. Alrededor de los dos meses de uso regular la PBC provoca conductas compulsivas de busqueda y consumo de la sustancia.

      "title": "Cancer-Related Fatigue: Nursing Assessment and Management",
      "abstract": "Cancer-related fatigue (CRF), the most common side effect of cancer and cancer treatment, is unlike the acute fatigue we experience from working all day in our jobs and with our families. It is an unpredictable, intense, overwhelming sense of tiredness or energy depletion. Fatigue is also defined as exhaustion, lethargy, lack of concentration and motivation, weakness, and depression. 1 It can occur suddenly and may not end when treatment ends but last months or even years. Patients with advanced colo-rectal cancer, lung and breast cancers, and lymphoma, all of which are managed under a variety of treatment regimens, report fatigue. 2 The onset, duration, and intensity of CRF have variable patterns, most notably in people receiving chemotherapy. Many report fatigue during the first few days after treatment, with a peak in fatigue when blood counts reach their lowest (nadir) and a decrease in fatigue before the next chemotherapy cycle. 1,3 Several studies have examined patterns of fatigue from radiation. 3–5 Findings suggest that fatigue may be cumulative over four to six weeks of treatment, with an increase in the presence of other physical symptoms, mood disturbances, and changes in usual activity. 3 For people receiving biologic therapies, fatigue is cumulative and related to dose and schedule. 6,7 With more types of cancer being treated with a combination of these therapies, the number of people affected by CRF is rising. People receiving cancer treatment can best describe CRF’s effect on their quality of life and thereby provide insight into its definition. A 76-year-old woman with lung cancer stated, “The morning after my treatment I could not get out of bed. When I finally did, I could only walk as far as the bathroom, then back to bed. I did not dare walk into the kitchen to prepare breakfast. My legs felt like lead.” A 52-year-old man with colon cancer described his fatigue. “I tried to work while taking my treatments, but I was exhausted by noon. I decided to work at home with my computer, but found it hard to focus. I tried to nap, but I never felt rested.” On the initiation of her second chemotherapy regimen, a 37-year-old woman with breast cancer recalled, “The first round of treatment made me so tired. My body ached. For the last three treatments, I found myself in bed most of the time. I could not be a wife or a mother to three small children.” A variety of patterns and multiple factors influence an individual’s experience of CRF. 1,8 With the interactions of multiple physiologic and psychological factors, CRF remains difficult to describe, and subsequently, manage. 9 Cancer-related fatigue has long been a misunderstood side effect of cancer treatment, and unfortunately the message often conveyed to patients and their families is that it’s unavoidable and needs to be tolerated. ASSESSING CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE The etiology of CRF cannot always be determined. 10 Several contributing factors have been identified: cancer and cancer treatments, anemia, neutropenia, sleep disturbance, depression, nutritional disturbance, and coping with other side effects of cancer treatment such as pain and nausea. 8 Along with complaints of unusual tiredness or weakness, people with CRF have decreased physical stamina, withdrawal from social activities, and decreased motivation. They may express irritability or impatience. 2 CRF’s cognitive manifestation ranges from sluggish thought process to inability to concentrate, forgetfulness, decreased short-term memory, and shortened attention span, 11 which may interfere with the person’s ability to fully participate in work, family, and social activities. Given that the contributing factors of CRF may be multicausal, and those interrelationships are the subject of many research questions, the current approach to assessment and nursing intervention needs to be multifaceted. Fatigue may present a challenge for nursing assessment because of the inherent difficulty in measuring a subjective symptom. Here are some guidelines to consider in assessing fatigue: Assess CRF as one would pain.1 First, allow patients to describe their fatigue in their own words by using open-ended questions such as, “Tell me about your fatigue.” Afterward, it’s useful to refer to the symptom by using the patient’s own words which hold significant meaning. More specific responses may be prompted by questions related to the patient’s functional mobility and ability to participate in leisure activities. Use a scale. A 0-to-5 or 0-to-10 response scale helps determine the patient’s perception of the severity of his fatigue. Select a scale that’s familiar to other care providers in the clinical setting, and use the same scale for other subjective symptoms such as pain or nausea. Having a consistent rating system helps everyone interpret a patient’s symptom patterns more quickly. Determine aggravating and alleviating factors. Ask the patient what makes his fatigue seem more severe, and what has worked and not worked in the past to prevent or reduce fatigue. Document assessment findings. This is critical for communication among health care providers. One initial assessment strategy is to track hemoglobin counts and fatigue scores on a graph (vital signs or treatment flowsheet) so that the nurse can convey to the physician how the patient is experiencing fatigue in reference to other symptoms, treatments, and lab values. The information also may be useful for individualizing fatigue management. SUGGEST AN ACTIVE APPROACH People experiencing CRF may make adjustments in their lives long before they seek guidance from health care providers. The usual fatigue self-management strategies, such as sleep and rest, which are more appropriate for healthy persons managing acute fatigue, are passive approaches. 9 In managing CRF, strategies need to be targeted toward maintaining sufficient energy to participate in the most meaningful life activities as defined by the person experiencing fatigue. 12 Because of the multicausal and multidimensional nature of CRF, 7 more than one management strategy may be necessary to provide relief. From a review of theoretical and research literature on CRF, Emma Ream and Alison Richardson identified three core activities to reduce the effect of fatigue: effective management of associated symptoms, enhancement of activity balanced with rest, and management of emotional stress. 9 Although more investigation is necessary to identify and test successful strategies for minimizing fatigue, several approaches for managing CRF have been supported by nursing research: preparatory education, physical activity, psychosocial support resources, and attention-restoring activities. Following are self-management strategies that can be incorporated into nursing practice: Acknowledgment of fatigue. Acknowledgment of the existence of CRF is a crucial first step toward assessment and management. Its recognition by the health care provider identifies CRF to be as important as nausea and vomiting, pain, peripheral neuropathy, or other treatment-related symptoms that affect quality of life. People with cancer report that having a health care provider simply inquire about their fatigue is meaningful because it indicates that their fatigue is worthy of intervention. 13 Preparatory information. By providing patients with information on fatigue, what’s known about it, and how it can be managed, the nurse validates not only its presence, but expresses her interest in working with the patient to manage it. A study of people receiving radiation therapy reported that those who prepare themselves for impending fatigue experience it less than those who receive no preparatory information. 14 With realistic expectations, people experiencing CRF can adjust and adapt to this symptom. 2 Prioritizing and pacing activities. Discuss with your patient how to prioritize and pace activities, including rest. 15 In setting priorities, it’s important to include a family member so that the choices for rest and activity reflect the needs of patient and family. As a man receiving chemotherapy explained, “I try to work three days a week—Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. I need one day off to recuperate from eight hours of work. My wife thinks I’m lazy because I have no energy to do what she wants me to do.” Encourage the person with CRF to review his usual weekly activities and identify low, moderate, or high priorities. Eliminate the low-priority activities and negotiate the moderate-priority activities into a daily schedule. Suggest assigning low-or moderate-priorities activities that are essential to other family members. If prioritizing and planning activities are energy depleting for the patient, assign a job broker, a family member or friend who can organize and assign tasks such as grocery shopping and meal preparation. There are certain tasks that may be obligatory to the patient’s role in the family. For example, a mother of three school-age children was undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer. She felt it was her role to complete her usual to-do list of household chores, although she knew it took much of her energy. Her nurse helped her identify realistic expectations and develop new strategies. For this family, the task of doing laundry was divided into smaller activities for each family member. Her husband brought the hamper into the living room where his wife could sort the dirty laundry. She taught the older children to use the washer and dryer in the basement. The children brought the clothes upstairs for their mother to fold and put away. By breaking down household chores, the patient was able to participate and maintain her role in the family. Balancing activity and rest. In addition to prioritizing activities, a balanced schedule of activity and rest is important. 15 One woman in a cancer support group referred to her experience with fatigue as “living with the toddler effect.” She described pushing herself like a toddler who moves from one activity to another before finally collapsing. She stated, “I didn’t know another way to manage my fatigue.” Often, the balance between activity and rest is difficult. For some people, rest means sleeping for an extended time. Whereas lying down and shutting one’s eyes may be appropriate for a short time, sleeping on and off throughout the day interrupts sleep cycles at night and creates more symptom distress. To alleviate CRF, rest is more effective when used as a respite from activity. Short, frequent periods of inactivity, such as sitting quietly or lying down, strategically planned throughout the day, are more beneficial than long periods of sleep. 15 Physical activity. The nurse may need to help a person with CRF develop an incremental plan to increase physical activity. Even normally physically active people can and do exercise during treatment. However, the intensity and duration of the activity may need to be modified. 16 Although regular physical activity is an important component of a healthy lifestyle, Anna Schwartz confirmed that many health care providers do not provide information about it or encourage people with cancer to exercise. 16 Several studies of women receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy for breast cancer and who participated in moderately intense aerobic exercises or a walking program reported that participants had less fatigue and emotional distress than those in usual care groups. 17–19 Patients report that physical activity is most effective when symptoms like fatigue are at their worst. 20 Of all the physical activities studied that have been used by people experiencing fatigue (walking, riding a stationary bicycle, low-impact aerobics, and swimming), walking is the most convenient, low cost, and low risk, regardless of age. In addition, walking may provide distraction, socialization, and attention-restoration. One young man, after his third cycle of treatment for lymphoma, had been hospitalized for an extended period of time. Upon returning home, he needed an incremental plan for increasing his physical activity. The first few days he focused on getting out of bed, getting dressed, and moving about his house. The plan also included activities beginning with sitting on the front porch and progressing toward walking down the driveway, to the end of the street, around the block, and continuing until he was able to choose his own physical activities. When he returned to the clinic, he shared with the staff a rediscovery of what he enjoyed most in life: socializing with friends, hiking, biking, and running. More study is necessary to determine specific recommendations for the appropriate type and amount of exercise. Overall, physical activity needs to be initiated at a comfortable level. Gradually, the intensity and duration may be increased to three to four days per week. 20 Energy conservation. Encourage the person experiencing fatigue to perform tasks that expend the least amount of energy. A collaborative approach among physical therapists, occupational therapists, nurses, and physicians supports the integration of energy-conserving strategies into planning daily activities and adapting the home environment. Eileen Donovan described several energy-conserving strategies for self-care, meal preparation, housekeeping, shopping, child care, and work. 21 Simple strategies, such as sitting rather than standing, or moving items closer within reach, decrease the amount of energy used. A breast cancer survivor, who had experienced fatigue, described her energy-conservation strategy for grocery shopping to her support group. She prepared the grocery list the day before and organized it by aisle. She planned her trip to a familiar neighborhood market at a time when it was less congested. She supported herself with a grocery cart as she moved from aisle to aisle, and took a 15-minute break halfway through on a bench in front of the store. After she paid the bill, she always asked for assistance with carrying the groceries to her car. Psychosocial support resources. People receiving radiation treatment and chemotherapy find it affects many aspects of their lives: their ability to work, their physical and emotional well-being, their ability to enjoy life in the moment, and their intimacy with their partner. 22 People with a history of chemotherapy indicated that CRF made it more difficult to participate in social activities, and to maintain relationships with family and friends. 23 A nurse referral to psychosocial resources, such as support groups, can help the patient cope with the effect of fatigue on quality of life. Through support groups, patients learn new self-management strategies that they can share with others. The selection of a specific psychosocial resource needs to be individualized. 9 Some people with CRF may be open to support group activities and benefit from a group, while others may prefer one-to-one counseling. Attention-restoring activities. People with CRF are often overwhelmed by an overstimulating environment. Their attention is diverted by the many sights, sounds, and objects in the health care environment—alarms, the fast-paced movement of staff, and painful procedures. Consequently, the patient, overburdened by information and environmental distractions, may not understand what’s being said. Bernadine Cimprich pioneered research in attentional fatigue, 1 the decreased capacity to concentrate or direct attention. 24 Natural environments or scenes such as a waterfall, a garden, or a sunrise may restore the patient’s ability to concentrate and comprehend. Women newly diagnosed with breast cancer, who participated in individualized, attention-restoring activities for 30 minutes three times a week, experienced significant improvements in attentional capacity compared to a control group. 11 Following participation in attention-restoring strategies, the person with fatigue may think more clearly and participate more actively in personal care and activities. The implications of Cimprich’s research are significant for providing information and education to people with fatigue and designing more supportive environments for them. Nurses are increasingly aware that the number of people experiencing CRF is rising. Cancer-related fatigue permeates every aspect of daily life: work, family, and social activities. Although more research is required to determine the effectiveness of proposed strategies to prevent and alleviate fatigue, the profound physical, psychological, emotional, and spiritual effect of fatigue demands that nurses intervene now. Nurses can be instrumental in identifying, evaluating, and aiding patients with fatigue to make the transition from passive to more active self-care strategies. Fortunately, more than a trial-and-error approach exists for fatigue management in current clinical practice. CRF theories direct nurses to management strategies such as providing preparatory information, assisting the patient to establish a balance of activity and rest, encouraging use of psychosocial support resources, and recommending attention-restoring activities. Managing CRF effectively requires nurses to thoughtfully and thoroughly pursue strategies that prevent physical deconditioning and allow people with fatigue to continue engaging in meaningful activities.",

      "abstract": "Medically complex infants are experiencing longer hospital stays, more invasive procedures, and increasingly involved therapeutic interventions that often require long-term analgesia and sedation. This is most commonly achieved with continuous intravenous infusions of opioids and benzodiazepines. There are times when patients develop a tolerance for these medications or the clinical scenario necessitates a rapid wean of them. A rapid wean of either class of medication can lead to increased signs of pain and agitation or withdrawal symptoms. As a result, when a rapid wean is needed or there has been a failure to control symptoms with conventional measures, alternative therapies are considered. Propofol, a sedative hypnotic typically used for general anesthesia and procedural sedation, is one such medication. It has effectively been used for short-term sedation in adults and children to facilitate weaning benzodiazepines and opioids. There is a paucity of data on the use of propofol in infants for this purpose. Here we describe the use of propofol to rapidly wean high-dose sedation and analgesia medications, a propofol sedation washout, in 3 infants. The washouts proved to be safe and efficacious. Based on institutional experience and a literature review, considerations and recommendations are made for propofol sedation washouts in infants.",

The main symptoms are emotional liability, dysphoria and anxiety. Objectives To review PMDD for helping in the differential diagnosis between this disease and classical anxiety disorders. Methods It was made a clinical review about differential diagnosis and comorbilities on PMDD in specialized literature and Pub-Med. Results PMDD causes significant distress and impairment in social or occupational functioning the first week following menstruation. In relation with differential diagnosis on PMDD, on the one hand, several organic diseases could produce the same symptoms than PMDD: for example gynecological pathology as dysmenorrhea or menopausal transition, endocrinological diseases as hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism and some hormonal treatment including hormonal contraceptives. In addition, a variety of medical disorders are concomitant pathologies that could be associated with PMDD (eg, migraine; epilepsy, asthma, allergies, systemic exertion intolerance disease, chronic fatigue syndrome; irritable bowel syndrome). These pathologies are exacerbated just before or during menstruation. On the other hand, several psychiatric disorders as bipolar disorder, major depression, dystimia, and anxiety disorders could get worse on the premenstrual phase. Conclusions In relation with the diagnosis of PMDD, it seems necessary to consider various differential diagnosis such as psychiatric, gynecological and endocrine disorders because of all of them share like symptoms. For this purpose it is very important to make both a good clinical history and a comprehensive physical examination to offer the most accurate diagnosis and treatment.

A clear definition has, however, recently been agreed.1 The Rome consensus states that symptoms should be chronic and recurring and consist of abdominal pain that is clearly related to bowel function, being either relieved by defecation or associated with a change in frequency or consistency of stool with or without disturbed defecation, which is defined as two or more of the following: altered stool frequency, altered stool form (hard, loose, or watery), altered stool passage (straining, urgency, or feeling of incomplete defecation), and passage of mucus. The above symptoms are usually associated with bloating or a sense of abdominal distension. The syndrome excludes painless constipation and diarrhoea and also chronic abdominal pain that is unrelated to bowel movement in which psychiatric features predominate.\n\nIrritable bowel symptoms are experienced by 8-22% of the population,2 but most learn to cope with their symptoms and less than one third actually consult a doctor.

Ultimately, it results in global hypoperfusion and a resulting increase in anaerobic respiration causing lactic acidosis. Maintaining adequate oxygen delivery in the critical care setting is of primary importance in the management of a critically ill patient. When oxygen supply is inadequate, the body undergoes several physiological changes to maintain the oxygen delivery requirements and perfusion pressure. This stage is referred to as compensated shock, and early signs of shock may be appreciated during this stage. When compensatory mechanisms are inadequate and DO2 begins to fall beyond the critical point, shock has progressed to the uncompensated stage. During this stage, there is rapid deterioration of the patient due to prolonged hypoxia and anaerobic respiration. Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) is the development of potentially reversible physiological derangement involving two or more organ systems not involved in the causative disorder, which results in persisting states of shock, sepsis and hypoperfusion and a major cause of high mortality in the intensive care unit reaching a range of 11–54% in septic pediatric patients. The final stage of shock is irreversible shock, which is also referred to as refractory shock. This final stage of shock carries a 96–99% mortality rate.",

      "abstract": "Pain is an uncomfortable feeling that tells you something may be wrong. It can be steady, throbbing, stabbing, aching, pinching, or described in many other ways. Sometimes, it’s just a nuisance, like a mild headache. Other times it can be debilitating. Pain can bring about other physical symptoms, like nausea, dizziness, weakness or drowsiness. It can cause emotional effects like anger, depression, mood swings or irritability. Pain can change your lifestyle and impact your job, relationships and independence. Pain is classified as either acute or chronic. Acute pain is usually severe and short-lived, and is often a signal that your body has been injured. Chronic pain can range from mild to severe, is present for long periods of time, and is often the result of a disease that may require ongoing treatment. When we sense pain, we pay attention to our bodies and can take steps to fix what hurts. Pain also may prevent us from injuring a body part even more. If it didn't hurt to walk on a broken leg, a person might keep using it and cause more damage. If your throat is really sore, you'll probably go to the doctor, who can treat the infection if you have one. Pain itself often modifies the way the central nervous system processes pain, so that a patient actually becomes more sensitive and gets more pain with less provocation. This is called “central sensitization.” (And there’s peripheral sensitization too.) Sensitized patients are not only more sensitive to things that should hurt, but also to ordinary touch and pressure as well. Their pain also “echoes,” fading more slowly than in other people. This phenomenon is usually superimposed over other problems, but it can also occur acutely and be the primary issue, as in complex regional pain syndrome, or amplified pain syndrome, which disporportionately affects everyone.

Inattentive symptoms include poor organizational skills, making careless errors, forgetfulness, trouble listening, and distractibility. Hyperactive/impulsive symptoms include restlessness, excessive talking, and interrupting. For the purpose of diagnosis, symptom manifestation should be developmentally inappropriate and exhibited in two or more settings (e.g., home and school). Much of the research in the past decade has focused on deficits associated with the disorder in regard to executive function, response inhibition, cognitive control, and motivational dysfunction in response to delayed reinforcers.",

      "abstract": "Introduction. Long-time consumption of narcotics leads to altered mental status of the addict. It is also connected to damages of different organic systems and it often leads to ap- pearance of multiple organ failure. Excessive narcotics con- sumption or abuse in a long time period can lead to various consequences, such as atraumatic rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure and electrolytic disorders. Rhabdomyolysis is charac- terized by injury of skeletal muscle with subsequent release of intracellular contents, such as myoglobin, potassium and cre- atine phosphokinase. In heroin addicts, rhabdomyolysis is a consequence of the development of a compartment syndrome due to immobilization of patients in the state of unconscious- ness and prolonged compression of extremities, direct heroin toxicity or extremities ischemia caused by intraluminal occlu- sion of blood vessels after intraarterial injection of heroin. Se- vere hyperkalemia and the development of acute renal failure require urgent therapeutic measures, which imply the applica- tion of either conventional treatment or a form of dialysis.

      "title": "Antiandrogenic treatment of obsessive compulsive neurosis: A case review",
      "abstract": "Introduction Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental disorder in which patients who suffer from it have repetitive and undesirable thoughts, feelings, ideas, sensations (obsessions) and behaviors that drive them to do something over and over again (compulsions). Often the person tries to get rid of the obsessive thoughts through compulsions, but this only provides short-term relief. Not carrying out the obsessive rituals can cause enormous anxiety and suffering. Objectives To describe a 23-year-old male patient, who suffers from anxiety and mood symptoms, reacts to ego-dystonic obsessive ideas and sexual content, of months of evolution, and who manages to calm down through compulsive masturbation or watching sexual videos on the internet. All this clinic negatively interferes with their quality of life, asking the patient for medical help to calm these ideas. Methods We carried out a review in Pubmed with the terms Antiandrogens and TOC, in order to make a better description of the clinical case. Results After several treatment attempts (Sertraline, Paroxetine, Clomipramine, Clomipramine + SSRI), reaching maximum doses according to clinical guidelines, and with poor therapeutic response, it was decided to discuss the case with the endocrinology department of our hospital, deciding to start treatment with antiandrogens, in order to alleviate the persistent intrusive ideas of a sexual nature. The administration of antiandrogens in men can cause a decrease or increase in the development or involution of secondary sexual characteristics in men, reducing the activity or function of accessory sexual organs, and hyposexuality, with decreased sexual desire or libido. After several weeks, there was improvement in the obsessive symptoms with a decrease in compulsive rituals. However, after the 3rd mo, some symptoms reappeared, but not with the same severity and intensity as before treatment. In addition, we cannot ignore the adverse effects that have occurred, such as involution of secondary sexual characteristics. However, and taking into account the negative repercussion that this clinic had on the patient’s quality of life, the benefit obtained exceeded the risk, having noted clear improvement with this therapy, and maintaining evolutionary controls by both psychiatry and endocrinology. Conclusions Patients suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder can be effectively treated with anti-androgenic pharmacological agents with various modes of action. The most effective group of such agents is the long-acting analogues of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone. The objective of this review is to elucidate the possibility of using such powerful anti-androgenic agents in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "title": "Clinical and Pathophysiological Aspects of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome",
      "abstract": "SUMMARYProlonged fatigue is a common complaint in the community and is usually transitory. If fatigue continues for more than six months, is disabling, and is accompanied by other constitutional and neuropsychological symptoms, then a diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome [CFS] should be considered, according to the Centers for Disease Control case definition [1994]. Actually, the diagnosis of CFS is only a clinical diagnosis, since laboratory tests are only useful to identify and/or exclude alternative diseases with a well defined etiology, which may explain the same symptoms. The CFS onset is explained by different etiopathogenetic hypotheses: toxic exposure well documented in some cases [e.g., ciguatera poisoning, workers exposure to solvents and other chemicals], infectious agents [e.g., Epstein-Barr virus and other herpesviruses, coxsackievirus, etc.], immunologic factors [CFS = Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome-CFIDS], neuroendocrine alterations [significant dysfunction of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis has been observed in CFS patients]. Also the psychiatric hypothesis is still credited by CFS researchers. However, a concurrent diagnosis of major depression should exclude a diagnosis of CFS according to the last case definition. Furthermore the depressive syndrome often observed in CFS patients is often secondary to the malaise and disability. Although the various pathogenetic hypotheses are not necessarily in contrast, it seems more likely that CFS is a heterogeneous disease, probably multifactorial, or that CFS includes different pathologies which manifest with the same symptoms. Among the several questions which are still unexplained there is one of remarkable importance about the pathogenetic substrate of CFS symptoms and particularly of “fatigue.” Furthermore, it is still unclear whether the fatigue or the other neuromuscular symptoms [e.g., myalgia] have a central or a peripheral origin. Most of the alterations described so far in CFS point out a clinical and a functional impairment of the central nervous system. However, our own observations at the Reference Center for CFS Study of Chieti University indicate the existence of peripheral alterations [neuromuscular] and this supports the theory about a heterogeneity of the CFSs.",

Although patients may present with dysphagia as an issue that requires palliation, other patients may develop dysphagia as a complication of progressive disease and increasing debilitation. The diagnosis of dyspepsia requires patients to be experiencing one or more of the following four problems: epigastric pain, epigastric burning, postprandial fullness, or early satiety. Dyspepsia may occur either as a functional disorder where the cause is not clear or as a secondary disorder. Hiccup, or more correctly, singultus, is a problem where patients experience a sharp and involuntary contraction of the muscles of inspiration which cause a sudden sharp inspiration and closure of the glottis. For most, this is a short-lived experience. This chapter discusses the definition, prevalence, pathophysiology, causes, presenting problems, investigations, and management of dysphagia, dyspepsia, and hiccups.",

      "abstract": "Patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD) will typically experience a range of motor and nonmotor symptoms during the course of their illness, each of which will affect a particular individual to varying degrees. However, patients' perceptions of troublesome symptoms often differ from the clinician's view, and these discrepancies can hamper effective management of PD. In this study, we have assessed 265 consecutive PD patients by asking them to rank their three most troublesome symptoms in the last 6 months, so to gain further insight from the impact of illness on patients' quality of life. Patients were divided into early (<6 years) and late PD groups (>/=6 years) from symptom onset. The division at 6 years was based on the mean time from symptom onset to the development of motor complications. In the early PD group, the 5 most prevalent complaints (ranked in descending order) are slowness, tremor, stiffness, pain, and loss of smell and/or taste. In the advanced PD group, fluctuating response to their medication (most common: wearing-off phenomenon followed by dyskinesia), mood changes, drooling, sleep problems (most common: middle and late night insomnia followed by daytime sleepiness), and tremor were the top 5. Our findings provide further evidence for the diversity of experience in PD and suggest that as the disease advances the most troublesome issues that patients perceive are the lack of response to medication and the nonmotor aspects of the disease, highlighting the importance of assessment and patient-centered management in the follow-up of these patients.",

      "title": "Prevalence and characterization of the insomnia syndrome in an outpatient oncology clinic",
      "abstract": "18612 Background: Insomnia is an often overlooked symptom. One potential reason for this neglect is that insomnia is viewed as a normal and temporary reaction to the cancer diagnosis or treatment. Patients themselves may fail to report their sleep difficulties to their physicians for similar reasons. Previous work in understanding insomnia has been limited by the lack of an operational definition of the insomnia syndrome, small sample size and varied instruments for symptom detection. Hence, the proportion of cancer patients meeting diagnostic criteria for the insomnia syndrome is not well known. Recently the diagnosis of the insomnia syndrome has been redefined using a combination of criteria derived from the International Classification of Sleep Disorders and the DSM-IV. The criteria includes)difficulty in initiating and/or maintaining sleep, whereby sleep-onset latency and/or wake after sleep onset is greater than 30 minutes; sleep efficiency (ratio of total sleep time to total time spent in bed) lower than 85%; difficulties occurring at least 3 nights per week; difficulties occurring for at least 6 months; and difficulties causing marked distress or significant impairment in daytime functioning (eg, fatigue, disturbed mood, performance deficits). Methods: 100 consecutive oncology patients were surveyed using the above criteria for the insomnia syndrome. Symptom assessment was also included. Results: The incidence of the insomnia syndrome seems to correspond to previously reported incidences.Patient have more problems staying asleep than going to sleep. Patients may have dramatic inversions of their sleep/wake cycle yet feel that they do not have insomnia. Pain is the most commonly associated symptom associated with insomnia. Conclusions: There is a great need for better tools to asssess the symptom of insomnia. Focusing on specific characteristics of insomnia and distinguishing the insomnia syndrome versus the symptom of insomnia is an effective way establish if there is a need for specific therapy. The addition of symptom assessment further improves the characterisation insomnia. Characteristics of insomnia experienced by the patient may help direct specific treatment modalities. Pain is a frequently associated symptom with insomnia. No significant financial relationships to disclose.",

We report a young adult female with no history of bipolar disorder who developed mania and psychosis approximately 1 week following initiation of G cambogia and the Cleanse and Detox™ dietary supplement manufactured by Apex Vitality Health. She presented with a predominantly expansive mood, psychomotor agitation, disorganized and pressured speech, flight of ideas, grandiosity, delusions, and auditory hallucinations. Following discontinuation of G cambogia and the initiation of lithium and quetiapine, the patient experienced rapid and progressive mood stabilization and was discharged after 8 days. Seven previous case reports associating (hypo)mania and/or psychosis with G cambogia consumption have been published. The chronology of mania and/or psychosis onset may appear between 1 and 8 weeks following initiation of G cambogia. Psychiatric symptoms have resolved with G cambogia discontinuation in some instances and may not require chronic pharmacotherapy.

It is important to distinguish these from the symptoms of an ongoing or latent medical or psychiatric condition that are magnified in the premenstrual period. A number of preexisting psychiatric conditions may worsen premenstrually, including: affective disorders (depression and mania), anxiety disorders, bulimia, substance abuse, and the psychoses. The physical symptoms are reported to occur cyclically in premenstrual dysphoric disorder or premenstrual syndrome: fatigue, headache, bloating or swelling, breast tenderness, changes in appetite, insomnia, hypersomnia, weight gain, backache, and, more rarely, acne, gastrointestinal upset, vertigo, fainting, heart palpitations, flushing, clumsiness. The complex downstream effects of cycling estrogen and progesterone are believed to account for the multitude of possible manifestations of these disorders as well as for the exacerbation of certain medical and psychiatric conditions in relation to the menstrual cycle.",

Other conditions can mimic PMS, so it's important to rule out look-alikes such as contraceptive side effects, dysmenorrhea, and substance abuse. Moderate exercise and a healthy diet may alleviate symptoms for some patients. Others may require symptom-specific measures, hormonal therapy, psychotropic drugs, or, for recalcitrant cases, ovulation suppression.",

      "abstract": "Urgency for this paper is the result of over 4,000 neuropsychological evaluations conducted by the author, in addition to the author’s past behavioral research in addictions and impulsiveness. The following trends are discussed. First, there is a large number of teens and adults convinced they exhibit symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD); they want medications (psychostimulants) to cure the symptoms. Second, many of the gatekeepers of medication management (physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants) are bombarded with requests for extensive cocktails of psychotropics, and particularly for the psychostimulants. Third, medical specialists delay fulfilment or renewal of psychostimulants by referring the patients for neuropsychological evaluations. High volume testing shows that symptoms reported as ADHD are, frequently, manifestations of other pervasive conditions. These conditions include Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder, Adult Children of Alcoholics/Adult Children of Family Abuse, Medical Conditions, Addictions, and Psychotropic Effects. This article examines the limitations of neuropsychological evaluations, other etiologies responsible for such look-alike or copycat ADHD symptoms, and the problem when reified ADHD symptoms are treated with innovative technologies.",

      "abstract": "Obsessions (e.g. usually associated with blasphemous thoughts) dominate the psyche of those afflicted with OCD until relief comes with a connected compulsive activity (i.e., another thought process, or action). OCD is disabling as to the time and mental energy it consumes. The disorder is characterized by repeated hand washing (the “Pontius Pilot Syndrome”), checking, and ordering. In some instances, these symptoms of OCD can have positive overtones and make a more productive and exacting worker. For example, dentist with OCD probably does more accurate restorations due to a “checker” inclination. Professions depending on industriousness and problem-solving like physician or scientist are custom-made for those with OCD. However, severe observable symptomology and often a dehabilitating decrease in functionality usually occur in those with the disorder. Nonetheless, those afflicted with OCD are quite skilled at hiding their symptoms from others; often including their employer or spouse. In addition, those with OCD usually have one or more depressive episodes or must also deal with chronic depression.

At first, we regarded all the symptoms as alcoholic hallucinosis, by a clinical standpoint, in spite of no auditory hallucination in this case. However, taking the overall clinical course into consideration, withdrawal syndrome could have been affected by some factors.

      "title": "Commentary on Foot <i>et al</i>.: Clinical considerations in addressing comorbid stimulant use in opioid use disorder",
      "abstract": "The opioid overdose crisis has been worsened by the increasing prevalence of comorbid stimulant use together with opioid use disorder. Individuals who also use stimulants are at higher risk of relapse and treatment dropout. Further research is desperately needed to guide clinicians in the treatment of this high-risk population. The United States opioid overdose crisis continues to claim tens of thousands of lives a year [1]. This crisis has been worsened by the introduction of high-potency synthetic opioids into the illicit drug supply, but is further complicated by the increasing prevalence of comorbid stimulant use together with opioid use disorder [2, 3]. In some cases, illicit drug suppliers are adding synthetic opioids to products sold as crystal methamphetamine or other stimulants, and in others, stimulants (usually methamphetamine) are being mixed with opioids to increase the potency of the ‘high’ or to counteract the sedating effects of high-dose opioids [4-6]. Although the increase in overdose deaths is probably fentanyl-associated, there might be a synergistic increase in the toxicity and lethality in individuals combining illicit stimulants with fentanyl [2, 7]. Three effective medications are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of opioid use disorder: an opioid agonist (methadone), a partial agonist (buprenorphine) and an antagonist (XR-naltrexone) [8]. Despite these treatments, only a fraction of patients engage in treatment and, among those who initiate the medication, many continue to use illicit opioids and discontinue medication for OUD within the first few months of treatment [9]. The increase in comorbid stimulant use among individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) only exacerbates these issues, as Foot and colleagues demonstrated in their secondary analysis of a series of large community-based opioid use disorder treatment trials [10]. Our experience in more recent OUD treatment trials echo these findings and has highlighted a clinical challenge for medication-based opioid treatment programs, which primarily have a medical focus. These programs may not be adequately prepared to treat patients presenting with concurrent opioid and stimulant addiction, especially those with major behavioral pathology (e.g. psychosis). Conversely, general addiction treatment programs, which are mainly behaviorally focused, might not be positioned to offer pharmacotherapy for opioid or stimulant use disorder. Unfortunately, decades of pharmacological research trials have yielded no FDA-approved treatments for stimulant use disorders [11], but there are several medications and psychosocial approaches that have proven effective in clinical trials that providers may integrate into treatment of individuals with comorbid opioid and stimulant use disorder. While there might not be an intervention reliably producing abstinence, treatments may be able to facilitate reduction of use. A recent large multi-site trial testing the combination of long-acting injectable naltrexone (XR-naltrexone) and bupropion for methamphetamine use disorder showed that the combination product was more effective than placebo [12]. Although this trial did not specifically recruit individuals with comorbid methamphetamine use disorder and OUD, XR-naltrexone is approved for the treatment of opioid use disorder, and the addition of bupropion for methamphetamine use disorder treatment in individuals maintained on XR-naltrexone for OUD is a straightforward clinical intervention [12]. In individuals maintained on buprenorphine, the addition of bupropion may also be a reasonable intervention, as its partial agonism at the opioid receptor may have some similar benefit to naltrexone on methamphetamine, although no trials have been performed using this combination. Other medication-based options include the noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant mirtazapine, which has shown some promise for methamphetamine use disorder alone, particularly in low severity users [13]. There is also strong evidence for the use of a prescription stimulant in extended-release formulation to treat methamphetamine use disorder [14]. This approach may be practiced in individuals with comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) for whom treatment with a stimulant is FDA-approved. The use of a stimulant in this population comes with both practical and regulatory concerns due to concern for misuse and diversion, but many clinicians use this approach with appropriate safeguards (small quantities prescribed, frequent callbacks or observed therapy, etc.) with good effect. Clinicians may also consider the addition of further psychosocial interventions in this population, although few trials have been performed. In individuals with methamphetamine use disorder, contingency-based management (CM) therapy has shown the strongest evidence of benefit, although its delivery is challenging in real world clinical settings [15]. Despite the available treatment options, patients with comorbid OUD and methamphetamine use often struggle to remain engaged in treatment, and further research is desperately needed to guide clinicians in the treatment of this high-risk population. Providing a range of services is probably needed, with intensive outreach and provision of food and shelter, with a non-stigmatizing low-barrier, supportive treatment environment. Treatment must also address co-occurring psychiatric and medical problems, medications to help reduce craving and distress and decrease drug use, therapy to retain patients in treatment and teach new skills as well as connecting with peer-support networks and recovery-oriented services, harm reduction and other services [15].

      "title": "Cerebrospinal fluid leakage in a patient with depression: pre-existing depression may complicate the clinical picture of this complex syndrome",
      "abstract": "Orthostatic headache is a key symptom of cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Other features may include neck pain, interscapular pain, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, tinnitus, and blurred vision. Various psychological or mental symptoms such as depression, forgetfulness, and a decreased power of concentration may also occur in this syndrome. When these symptoms are prominent or precede the onset of other symptoms, the clinical picture of this syndrome becomes more complicated, leading to misdiagnosis or long-term neglect. Of note, patients with cerebrospinal fluid leakage who visit an otolaryngological or oto-neurological clinic usually have atypical manifestations. In the vast majority of our patients with this syndrome, the presenting symptom is dizziness, not headache. The presenting symptom of the 30-year-old female patient who is the subject of this report was also dizziness. The patient's initial symptom was a stomachache; however, medical therapy was ineffective, and endoscopic examination of the stomach revealed no abnormalities. The stomachache was diagnosed as resulting from psychological or mental causes. Other manifestations also indicated that the patient suffered from mental depression. Antidepressants and sleeping pills were prescribed, but no improvement was noted. Dizziness, unsteadiness, nausea, and loss of concentration occurred insidiously and worsened after the patient hit her occiput strongly against a wall during an attack of hyperventilation. The patient also complained of headache. The patient was referred to our clinic by a local otolaryngologist. At the time of the patient's initial visit, a slight unsteadiness was noted while the patient stood and walked, but other vestibular functions were normal. A neurological examination did not show any abnormalities. Psychological testing confirmed the presence of depression. The patient, presumably because of her depression, was dispirited and never discussed her symptoms voluntarily. However, a detailed history revealed that the patient had an orthostatic headache, paresthesia in both hands, blurred vision, and forgetfulness. Several episodes of falls at a pool-side occurring as early as during elementary school were also noted. The diagnosis of cerebrospinal fluid leakage was confirmed by brain MRI and 111In-cisternography examinations. An epidural blood patch was performed three times. The patient recovered from her depression; although a mild headache and nausea persisted, all the patient's other symptoms, including dizziness and unsteadiness, improved dramatically. The patient returned to work.",

      "abstract": "Objective U.S. military special operation forces represent the most elite units of the U.S. Armed Forces. Their selection is highly competitive, and over the course of their service careers, they experience intensive operational training and combat deployment cycles. Yet, little is known about the health-care needs of this unique population. Method Professional consultations with over 50 special operation forces operators (and many spouses or girlfriends) over the past 6 years created a naturalistic, observational base of knowledge that allowed our team to identify a unique pattern of interrelated medical and behavioral health-care needs. Results We identified a consistent pattern of health-care difficulties within the special operation forces community that we and other special operation forces health-care providers have termed “Operator Syndrome.” This includes interrelated health and functional impairments including traumatic brain injury effects; endocrine dysfunction; sleep disturbance; obstructive sleep apnea; chronic joint/back pain, orthopedic problems, and headaches; substance abuse; depression and suicide; anger; worry, rumination, and stress reactivity; marital, family, and community dysfunction; problems with sexual health and intimacy; being “on guard” or hypervigilant; memory, concentration, and cognitive impairments; vestibular and vision impairments; challenges of the transition from military to civilian life; and common existential issues. Conclusions “Operator Syndrome” may be understood as the natural consequences of an extraordinarily high allostatic load; the accumulation of physiological, neural, and neuroendocrine responses resulting from the prolonged chronic stress; and physical demands of a career with the military special forces. Clinical research and comprehensive, intensive immersion programs are needed to meet the unique needs of this community.",

      "title": "Concepto y manejo práctico de la fragilidad en neurología",
      "abstract": "Frailty is a clinical situation of decreased homeostatic reserve that, after a minor trigger (acute illness, fall, taking a drug...) increases the risk of an adverse event such as hospital admission, institutionalization, functional and/or cognitive decline, death, etc. Frailty can be understood as physical frailty, Fried's phenotype, a true geriatric syndrome that can be reversible by avoiding its progression to more advanced stages of irreversibility and dependence, and Rockwood's frailty due to accumulation of deficits, as a continuum of health or classification typology of the elderly along the frailty spectrum (healthy, robust, vulnerable, mild-moderate-severe and extreme frailty or end of life). The diagnosis of physical frailty is part of the comprehensive geriatric assessment, recommending the use of a performance test such as gait speed (<0,8m/s), Timed Up and Go (>12 s) or Short Physical Performance Battery (<10). Physical frailty is reversible by a multidisciplinary management based on three fundamental pillars: multicomponent physical exercise and resistance training, adequate protein and micronutrient intake (leucine, vitamin D, etc.) and appropriate pharmacological prescription, management of comorbidity and geriatric syndromes. Frailty is a risk factor for neurological disease progression and increased risk of adverse events in neurodegenerative diseases such as mild cognitive impairment, dementia, Parkinson's disease and cerebrovascular disease. Frailty based on the Clinical Frailty Scale or VIG-Frail shows patient typologies in relation to a greater or lesser state of fragility, being a basic prognostic tool of great utility in making diagnostic and therapeutic management decisions. It opens up a new opportunity for improvement in the management of neurological disease in the diagnosis and treatment of frailty.Concepto y manejo práctico de la fragilidad en neurología.La fragilidad se entiende como un situación clínica de disminución de la reserva homeostática que, ante un desencadenante (enfermedad aguda, caída, toma de un fármaco...), aumenta el riesgo de un evento adverso, como ingreso hospitalario, en residencia, deterioro funcional y/o cognitivo, muerte, etc. La fragilidad puede entenderse como fragilidad física, fenotipo de Fried, verdadero síndrome geriátrico, que puede ser reversible evitando su progresión a estadios más avanzados de irreversibilidad y de dependencia, y fragilidad por acúmulo de déficits de Rockwood, como continuum de salud o tipología de clasificación del anciano a lo largo del espectro de la fragilidad (sano, robusto, vulnerable, fragilidad leve-moderada-grave y extrema o final de vida). El diagnóstico de fragilidad física forma parte de la valoración geriátrica integral y se recomienda para su diagnóstico utilizar un test de ejecución, como velocidad de la marcha (menor de 0,8 m/s), Timed Up and Go (>12 segundos) o Short Physical Performance Battery (menor de 10). La fragilidad física es reversible basándose en un tratamiento multidisciplinar sobre tres pilares fundamentales: ejercicio físico multicompetente y contra resistencia, aporte adecuado de proteínas y micronutrientes (leucina, vitamina D, etc.), y adecuada prescripción farmacológica, de tratamiento de comorbilidad y de síndromes geriátricos. La fragilidad es un factor de riesgo de progresión de la enfermedad neurológica y de mayor riesgo de evento adverso tanto en enfermedades neurodegenerativas, como el deterioro cognitivo leve, la demencia o la enfermedad de Parkinson, como en la enfermedad cerebrovascular. La fragilidad a través de la Clinical Frailty Scale o el VIG-Frail muestra tipologías de pacientes en relación con un mayor o menor estado de fragilidad, y es una herramienta básica pronóstica de gran utilidad en la toma de decisiones de manejo diagnóstico y terapéutico. Se abre una nueva oportunidad de mejora en el manejo de la enfermedad neurológica ante el diagnóstico y el tratamiento de la fragilidad.",

      "abstract": "Stopping antidepressants can be challenging due to the high rate of discontinuation symptoms. Patients with antidepressant discontinuation syndrome (ADS) commonly experience insomnia, flu-like symptoms, mood disturbances, dizziness, and paresthesias, but a broad array of adverse effects is possible. Symptoms can last for days to months, and different symptoms have different durations. Patient education, identification of patients most at risk for developing symptoms, and a slow antidepressant taper or cross-taper are important steps in mitigating the risk of ADS and managing patient concerns about ADS. Tapers should be carried out over weeks to months. Discontinuation symptoms should be managed with restarting the prior dose of antidepressant and then tapering even more slowly, with additional symptomatic management as needed.",

      "title": "Cas de dépression post-partum chez une femelle orang-outan",
      "abstract": "Chez l'humain, les dépressions, dont la dépression post-partum, sont regroupées dans la catégorie « Trouble de l'humeur non spécifié ». Les causes de la dépression sont nombreuses et multifactorielles, d'ordre endocrinien, environnemental, social, affectif, psychologique. Quel qu'en soit l'effet déclencheur, la dépression s'accompagne toujours d'un dérèglement biochimique responsable de nombreux symptômes : anhédonie, anorexie ou hyperphagie, hyper- ou insomnie, perte de poids significative (< 5 %), agitation ou prostration, altération de la vie sociale, etc. L'élaboration d'une revue de littérature prépare la présentation d'un cas clinique de femelle orang-outan. L'étude de l'influence des facteurs biologiques et des agents stressants, tels que environnementaux, sociaux et affectifs, sur l'humeur et ses troubles, étaye l'analyse des résultats obtenus. Née en captivité en Allemagne, gestante primipare lors de son transfert en France en février 1996, Jane, jeune femelle orang-outan de 13 ans a commencé à envoyer des signes de détresse au cours du 3e mois de vie de son nourrisson (vomissement, anorexie, prostration). Au fur et à mesure des semaines son état s'aggravant, elle laissa son jeune au soin d'une femelle plus âgée et expérimentée qu'elle. Puisque les résultats médicaux affichaient des constantes normales, Sébastien Laurent, le directeur du parc commença à la masser, la coiffer, la forcer à manger et à la stimuler. Durant huit mois, chaque jour, il lui consacrait ce temps individualisé. Au fur et à mesure des soins, l'état de Jane s'améliora. Au neuvième mois, elle redevint entièrement autonome. Dans la dépression post-partum, le facteur stress jouerait un rôle fondamental dans le dérèglement de l'axe corticotrope, l'activation de la réponse inflammatoire et le syndrome de basse T3. La perte des repères familiers, l'absence de soutien, l'isolement familial ou social, la détresse affective sont des facteurs de stress indiscutables chez l'humain. Le cas clinique de Jane permet de confirmer que son arrivée dans ce nouveau zoo a pu provoquer un stress à l'origine de son désarroi. La massothérapie, l'attention individualisée, et le temps partagé avec un référent sécure et contenant, furent les outils psychothérapiques enrayant le processus dépressif. Les recherches médicales actuelles démontrent les effets positifs des massages au niveau de la diminution du taux de cortisol (hormone du stress) de 31 % et l'augmentation de sérotonine de 28 % et de dopamine de 31 % (neurotransmetteurs du bien-être), à l'issue de massothérapie.",

      "title": "Physiological Background of Muscular Pain During Skiing and Delayed Muscle Soreness after Skiing",
      "abstract": "Physiological Background of Muscular Pain During Skiing and Delayed Muscle Soreness after Skiing During intensive skiing, at each turn, in particular towards the end of the turning steering phase, eccentric work of the lower limb muscles occurs (predominantly of the quadriceps femoris), which is the direct cause of damage within muscle cells. A few or more than ten hours after intensive physical effort the symptoms of delayed onset muscle soreness may appear, which is mainly a result of the micro-damage within the myocytes. The following procedure can be proposed for prevention of muscle soreness for skiers: around a week before first day of skiing in the season, skiers should perform a series of intensive physical exercises involving eccentric contractions, thus inducing delayed muscular soreness. The exercises may involve for example: downhill running, preferably down a steep slope, running down stairs, deep knee bend jumps, deep knee bend jumps over an obstacle, jumping to the ground from a certain height, sit-ups on one or both feet, etc. The exercises should lead considerable local fatigue, in particular of the lower limb muscles, so that muscle soreness occurs on the second day, in particular in the frontal part of the thighs. After approximately two days the pain will alleviate, while after a week the strength of the muscles will return to its pre-exercise condition. This should considerably reduce, or even remove, delayed muscle soreness after skiing, which will not only help skiers use their time more effectively but will also be crucial to the skiers' safety.",

Although diazepam is commonly associated with a variety of side effects, it is generally not believed to cause fugue-like states or retrograde amnesia. This report presents the case of an active duty patient who developed a brief fugue-like state with retrograde amnesia. This was associated with the short-term oral use of diazepam. There was no other apparent cause for his symptoms, which resolved within 24 hours after the diazepam was discontinued. This case suggests that short-term use of diazepam can lead to a brief fugue-like state with retrograde amnesia that has not been reported previously.",

This problem behaviour includes a wide range of symptoms including depression, anxiety and apathy, and behavioural problems such as aggression, general restlessness, compulsion to walk, disinhibition and calling, and psychotic disorders such as delusions and hallucinations. Due to the persistence and complexity of problem behaviour in patients with dementia, doctors often prescribe psychotropic drugs for long periods of time. In nursing homes there is a great need for non-pharmacological treatments for patients with psychological or psychiatric problems. The canopy-enclosed bed seems to meet this need and has positive effects. We observed that within a few weeks of patients getting a canopy-enclosed bed, psychotropic drugs could be reduced or even stopped. Using a canopy-enclosed bed is a measure of restraint. Therefore it remains important to carefully trade off its deployment with the intended goal.",

A number of COVID-19 patients are found to present with complex neuropsychiatric syndromes, including the first onset of psychosis, that seem to be directly related to brain damage in the context of COVID-19. Most cases of psychotic disorder in COVID-19 patients are being found in individuals with no personal or family history of mental illness. Case Description: A 33-year-old man presented with acute restlessness, agitation, wandering, vandalizing things, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behaviour, decreased sleep for 3 days duration. There was no past history or family history of any psychiatric illness. There was a history of mild grade fever 7 days before the onset of the psychotic symptoms. The patient was uncooperative, irritable, and had hallucinatory behaviour. Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) was positive. The patient responded to injectable antipsychotic haloperidol which was later changed to Tab Olanzepine 5 mg. The patient developed no COVID symptoms and no psychotic symptoms were seen further. Conclusion: There is a possibility of a psychosis break as a COVID-19 clinical presentation, suggesting potential participation of inflammatory and autoimmunologic phenomena triggered as a response to the coronavirus infection.",

      "abstract": "A neuropsychiatric and -psychological update of the crime \"profile\" and \"signature\" is a necessary addition to the traditional sociopsychological model likely to miss limbic system dysfunctioning. Thus, occurrence of a brief (c. 20 minutes) limbic seizure has been proposed based on behaviors of 12 white male homicidal loners, who showed a dozen symptoms and signs: Limbic Psychotic Trigger Reaction. Readily overlooked can be (a) a transient psychosis (hallucinations and/or delusions), (b) autonomic hyperactivation (e.g., loss of bladder control, nausea, ejaculation), (c) motiveless, out-of-character, unplanned, and well-remembered homicidal acts, (d) committed with a flat affect (not emotionally or impulsively provoked), (e) typically involving a stranger who happened to provide an objectively harmless and only subjectively important stimulus. (f) Such an individualized stimulus triggered the memory revival of mild to moderate but repeatedly experienced hurts. Such a specific sequence of events implicates the specific mechanism of limbic seizure, \"kindling,\" which does not necessarily involve motor convulsions. Repetition of such limbic episodes with \"criminal acts\" is conceivable under specific circumstances including cases in which the triggering stimulus is associated with pleasurable delusions (e.g., of grandiose power or wealth) or constitutes a specific aspect of a basic drive motive. For example, eating or sexual activities might be planned but degenerate into a limbic episode with a specific core symptomatology.",

The results showed that adepren, due to the predominance in the spectrum of its action of a stimulating effect over a sedative one, proved the least effective in anxiety depressions and most effective in inhibitory, asthenic and adynamic depressions. Linamiphen had a more marked antidepressive and stimulating action and was effective in inhibitory depressions of different genesis but the incidence of side effects (fast pulse, elevated blood pressure) was rather high. Emovit was characterized by the predominance of sedative versus stimulating action and, hence, it was most effective in anxiety, asthenic-anxiety, depressive-paranoid and hypochondriac depressions, showing no effect in inhibitory depressions. It did not lead to exacerbation of any other, in particular paranoid, symptomatology.",

      "title": "Irritability as a Criterion in Diagnosis of Child and Adolescent Bipolar Disorder: Thorny Road Ahead",
      "abstract": "Byline: M. Reddy Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5 [sup]th edition (DSM 5) [sup][1] of bipolar disorder (BD) makes it necessary to meet the following criteria for a manic episode: distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, OR IRRITABLE MOOD… lasting at least one week and present most of the day, nearly everyday…. It is elation or irritation, along with three or four other symptoms. DSM 5 criteria for BD are applicable to all age groups with the same weightage. Irritable occupies a prominent place in the diagnostic criteria of many other disorders, especially childhood and adolescent disorders like oppositional defiant disorder; intermittent explosive disorder; conduct disorder; disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD); other and unspecified disruptive, impulse control, and conduct disorders; and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the classificatory systems. With irritable sharing space in the diagnostic criteria of BD and several childhood and adolescent diagnostic disorders, there looms a possibility of over diagnosis of childhood adolescent bipolar disorder. misdiagnosis, whenever it occurs, hopefully less often, leads to a major therapeutic mismatch resulting in polypharmacy and treatment failures. National Institute of Mental Health research roundtable on prepubertal bipolar disorder, 2001 recommends that patients with grandiosity/elation be classified as bipolar I and irritability/rage be classified as bipolar NOS (DSM IV TR). There was always a doubt about reliability of irritability as a symptom criterion in the of mania as shown in this USA-UK study: USA-UK project (2005) Elation/grandiose - mania - 96.4% USA and 88.9% UK Irritability/rage - mania - 86.2% USA and 31.1% UK There is rather unacceptable poor concordance, with irritability as the criterion. A few valid arguments that merit attention are the following: *That delusions/hallucinations occur only in BD (true, but a significant majority of patients with BD do not have delusions/hallucinations). *Family H/O of BD favors of bipolar illness (yes, very valuable supporting point in those who have a family history). *BD is an episodic disorder, whereas other childhood disorders outlined above are all continuous in course. Is it true? Let us look at the existing data. Evidence Age of onset The greatest frequency of first attacks falls, however, in the period of development with its increased emotional excitability between the fifteenth and twentieth In rare cases, the first beginnings can be traced back even to before the tenth year…. - Kraepelin, 1921 In 28% of the BD patients recruited into the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) study, age at onset was younger than 13, and in the Bipolar Collaborative Network study, 15% of patients had illness onset before the age of 13 years. younger age of onset in BD seems to be a well-documented fact. Diagnosis Some studies have defined mania by the presence of highly labile moods with intense irritability, rage, explosiveness and destructiveness; extreme agitation, and behavioral dysregulation. [sup][2],[3],[4],[5] picture that emerges from several independent research groups is that prepubertal children with BD typically have multiple daily mood swings and that irritability is much more common than euphoria. [sup][6],[7] Course Studies indicate a highly pernicious course with substantial chronicity. In 81% of a well-defined group of patients, Geller et al . [sup][6] reported continuous daily cycling from mania or hypomania to euthymia or depression. In this study, 1-year mania recovery rate stood at 37%. …",

We report the case of a 53-year-old woman, who was previously diagnosed with AIP 5 weeks after therapeutic suspension has developed an acute disease exacerbation. During hospitalisation, further exacerbation has occurred after analgesia with metamizole. Glucose and hemin infusions resulted in slow improvement. Physical rehabilitation was crucial to peripheral polyneuropathy recovery. Taking into account the porphyrinogenic effect described for metamizole, this drug might have triggered the second attack. Clinical history was sufficient to suspect the diagnosis and to start the treatment immediately, preventing important sequelae.",

The Body systems that demonstrate symptoms when deprived of oxygen include the Respiratory or Pulmonary system, the Cardiovascular system (include the heart and vascular supply of blood via arteries and veins), the Neuro-Muscular systems (including the brain, nervous system, and muscles), the renal system and body fluids, the regulation of acid-base balance, and the gastrointestinal system [1]. A synthesis of physiological signs and symptoms demonstrated through various body organs as sources or contributing factors related to hypoxia or prolonged hypoxemia presented as a guide for evaluating oxygen need. There are many symptoms notable for oxygen deprivation and the symptoms may be subtle and occur over long periods of time or they may have a very acute or abrupt disruption of circulation or blood flow that is of immediate concern and life threatening.

      "title": "Personality constellations in suicidal behavior",
      "abstract": "Since the majority of patients with psychiatric disorders do not commit or even attempt suicide, it seems that while psychiatric disorder may be a necessary risk factor for suicide, it is not sufficient in itself. One of the most urgent issues for clinical research in the area of suicide is to determine what factors, in addition to and beyond psychiatric disorders, predispose a person to suicide. Three areas of research : Post-mortem psychological studies of adolescents from eighteen to twenty-one years of age who committed suicide while performing their military service in the Israeli army. Clinical work with suicidal adolescents in a full-time hospital ward for adolescents. Work in the emergency room of a large general hospital during an epidemiological study of conducts associated with suicide. Our hypothesis is that three groups of personality types form the basis for the tendency toward suicide : (1) personalities that are narcissistic, perfectionist, unable to tolerate failure and imperfection ; (2) those characterized by impulsiveness and aggression associated with extreme sensitivity to minor life events ; (3) those characterized by underlying depression, usually the consequence of a psychical affliction, such as mood disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia or mental anorexia. These results seem to reinforce the conclusions that we presented in earlier papers (Apter et al., 1995). We think that suicidal conduct in depressed adolescents differs from that of borderline adolescents. The well-known relationship between impulsiveness, aggression and suicidal tendencies (Apter et al., 1993) may indeed be linked to borderline state and conduct disorders (Apter et al., 1995). This has important consequences for research on adolescent suicide in general, since additional results regarding associated trauma, sexual abuse, family break-up, and drug use may also be linked to specific types of suicide. We can no longer view suicidal conduct as a homogenous set of conducts. Although the non-nosiographical approach developed by Van Praag et al. (1987) has been a very fruitful one, diagnosis and personality differences may play a role in the understanding of suicide.",

      "abstract": "Most disasters produce consistent death and injury patterns. Primary causes stem directly from the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, injury and drowning in tsunamis. Secondary causes are driven by common effects regardless of event type: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Cause of death may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. All of these relate not only to post-impact outcomes but also may affect primary event survival. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory, diabetic, and psychological disorders) and/or rely on recurring outpatient procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease); some conditions require home oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. All categories rely on maintenance care, lack of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants, particularly carbon monoxide. Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes, beyond preexisting conditions, include disrupted routine and lifelines and extended effects (e.g., prolonged disruption, personal loss, subsequent events). Most secondary health effects are recurrent and thus predictable well in advance of an incident. Even if they canâ€™t be prevented in entirety they can be lessened by awareness and deliberate action on the part of governments, institutions, support services, and individuals, including more realistic assumptions, expanded insurance coverage, and refocused preparedness campaigns.",

When administered intravenously in the context of a therapeutic interview, cocaine caused large, rapid increases in pulse and blood pressure concomitant with profound mobilization of affect and tearfulness. Infusions that caused lesser changes in vital signs were associated with milder degrees of affective change and less dysphoria. Thus, while cocaine was capable of eliciting positive affective change (such as calmness and elation) in depressed patients, affective flooding and dysphoric components were often admixed, indicating that cocaine's effect in this context could not be classified simply as antidepressant.",

A rather rare and very much less documented side effect of risperidone is hypothermia: traditionally defined as a drop in core body temperature below 35°C (95°F). We report a case of a 75-year-old woman who had been treated for bipolar affective disorder for nearly 3 years with risperidone went on to develop hypothermia which was reversed with the withdrawal of the offending drug. This case is unique as it reported a rare but potentially serious side effect occurring after a prolonged administration of risperidone contrary to the previous reports in which hypothermia occurred only a few hours or days after the administration of risperidone and occurred in a patient who was diagnosed as having bipolar affective disorder as opposed to schizophrenia, the most common psychiatric disorder associated with previously reported hypothermia. The authors would like to emphasize the importance of this idiosyncratic potentially life-threatening adverse effect of risperidone-induced hypothermia to all clinicians, which occurs regardless of the duration of drug intake, in order to help them identify the condition early and treat it effectively.",

      "title": "Urinary Incontinence1",
      "abstract": "The extent, misery, and costs of urinary incontinence are well known to readers of the Journal. Although much has been accomplished, there are still formidable barriers to clinicians’ efforts to control incontinence. These include physician and patient acceptance of incontinence as an expected accompaniment of aging; a lack of detailed knowledge of the relationships of incontinence with associated conditions such as dementia, depression, urinary infections, and vaginitis; scant empirical information to evaluate symptoms and physical signs; and little knowledge of the operating characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value) of urodynamic tests. Excluding acute or transient incontinence caused by sudden, acute illness or environmental conditions,1 established incontinence is usually due to four types, largely distinguished by urological pathology.2 Sphincter weakness incontinence (SWI) or urethral incompetence (UI) is involuntary loss of urine caused by increases in intra-abdominal pressure without bladder muscle contractions. This is usually associated with stress incontinence, the symptom of incontinence with coughing or exertion. Detrusor instability (DI) or detrusor hyperactivity (DH) is caused by involuntary contractions of the detrusor or bladder muscle sufficient to cause incontinence and is frequently associated with the symptom of urge incontinence, the loss of urine associated with a strong desire to void. Overflow incontinence (OI) occurs when bladder pressure exceeds maximal urethral pressure, due either to bladder distension from a urethral obstruction or an atonic bladder. Functional incontinence occurs with and without other pathology in individuals who are unable to toilet themselves independently due to chronic physical, psychological, or neurological dysfunction. Unlike many other medical conditions, currently these diagnoses can not be made by a short history, physical exam, and easily performed laboratory tests. The existing “gold standards'” of incontinence diagnosis—urodynamic testing—reflect a number of different tests, are expensive, and require referral to subspecialists. However, most incontinence is and always will be treated by geriatricians, internists, nurse practitioners, and nurses in the community and longterm care. These professionals need clear, reliable, and reproducible data on the ability of history questions and clinical bedside tests to detect treatable urinary pathology that causes incontinence. It is clearly necessary to refer certain patients for urodynamics, but the data should suggest how those patients can be identified and delineate the risks of empirical treatment and steps necessary to avoid these risks. Decision rules3 and algorithms4,5 have been proposed, but as of yet little data from comprehensive studies of the incontinent elderly support them. In this issue of the Journal, Wells et al. present data on the clinical characteristics, urodynamics, and the diagnostic usefulness of common tests in a large sample of women with established incontinence. They reconfirm the dismal suspicion of most geriatricians that while incontinence is a chronic problem and many patients do seek care for it, few continue with long-term therapy. In this well-educated, largely upper middle class sample, chronic diseases were common (86%), and the incontinence was not associated with significant dementia, functional disability, or negative health status. Wells et al. identified more SWI or UI incompetency (77%), relatively less DI or DH (25%), and about half the number of patients with normal bladders (7%) and overflow (9%) than seen in other studies of incontinent women.5,6 This probably represents the relatively healthy population, although the use of three separate tests (radiological, clinical, and urodynamic) for urethral incompetence may have identified more of these patients than other studies with less intense evaluations. Clinical diagnoses, easily made by the nurse practitioner using both symptoms and a “bedside'” test, were compared to urodynamic diagnoses and found to be accurate in 55%, over all diagnoses. As a first step in validating decision rules or office procedures for diagnosis, the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of incontinence symptoms, signs, and tests can be determined. These concepts are widely used7 in determining the applicability of clinical data to the diagnosis of disease. In this determination, the diagnoses are made with the best available standard—“the gold standard.'” Sensitivity refers to the percentage of patients with the diagnosis who have the characteristic (symptom, positive test) in question. Specificity refers to the fraction of patients without the diagnosis who do not have the characteristic. The positive predictive value is the fraction of patients with a characteristic who have the diagnosis. The negative predictive value is the fraction of patients without the characteristic who do not have the diagnosis. Sensitivity and specificity are attributes of the test or the symptom being evaluated, but predictive values are the characteristics most clinicians rely on as they specify the probability that a particular patient with a positive (or negative) test or symptom does (or does not) have the diagnosis. For the same test or symptom, the predictive value changes with changes in the prevalence of the disease in the population. Consequently, the prevalence of the disease must be available or estimated. The sequence of diagnoses identified and whether an algorithm should aim to exclude diagnoses or confirm them, depend on the characteristics of the tests. Ideally, available procedures should be able to confirm a diagnosis with a high degree of certainty (a high positive predictive value); alternatively, the test may be able to exclude it with a high degree of confidence (a high negative predictive value). The consequences of misdiagnosis should also be considered and be minimal or, at least, risk-free. A decision rule for incontinence should address the four diagnoses of established incontinence, but practically, office procedures for diagnoses exist only for SWI, DI, and OI. Ouslander's test for DI,4 (slowly filling the bladder by catheter while watching for uninhibited contractions) is not empirically established. Patients with overflow or obstruction can have normal postvoid residual bladder volumes, making simple measurement of this characteristic in the office unreliable. However, sphincter weakness can be identified by an office examination, the stress test. Additionally, therapy for SWI—estrogens and alpha agonists,8 carries little risk to patients with other categories of urinary pathology if misdiagnoses are made, unlike therapy for DI (anticholinergics). Consequently, it would appear that the first step in a diagnostic algorithm should be identification of SWI. According to Wells et al., the standing stress test, an examination for urinary leakage while coughing or sneezing with a full bladder, is useful for the diagnosis of SWI. It can be confused with cough-induced DI, as detrusor contractions can be induced by the coughing and cause urinary leakage five to 15 seconds later. However, the results of Wells et al. show that the standing stress test, as conducted in the office, is 50% sensitive for a urodynamic diagnosis of SWI or mixed SWI and DI, and 76% specific, with a positive predictive value of 88%. In other words, using these results in a similar population, there is an 0.88 probability that a patient with a positive stress test in the office would have sphincter weakness later demonstrated at urodynamics. Thus, the risk of false positives is 12%. Using symptoms with the stress test yields a more sensitive test at 94%, but due to a much lower specificity (13%) the positive predictive value drops to 78%. Before these results can be used with complete confidence, they need careful confirmation and extension to other populations with a lower prevalence of SWI (where the positive predictive value would be lower) and to populations of incontinent men. Using similar tests in the office, if these results are confirmed, clinicians can expect to be able to accurately identify about 50% of women with SWI. The women with a negative test could have SWI, DI, obstructions, or atonic bladders. A bedside test for DI might be able to separate out a group of patients with a high probability of DI and allow them to be effectively treated without initial urodynamics. A postvoid residual measurement, if high, may identify many of the patients with overflow incontinence, who could be referred to urologists.3 Each of these steps, and the role of therapy for patients who do not show evidence of a specific diagnosis, need careful study and validation. These studies should include carefully defined, large populations, specific diagnostic criteria acceptable to experts in urodynamics, and careful attention to the analysis to provide the data and validated approaches clinicians need to treat incontinence. The work by Wells et al. begins this process.",

      "abstract": "After prolonged opioid exposure, children develop opioid-induced hyperalgesia, tolerance, and withdrawal. Strategies for prevention and management should be based on the mechanisms of opioid tolerance and withdrawal.Relevant manuscripts published in the English language were searched in Medline by using search terms \"opioid,\" \"opiate,\" \"sedation,\" \"analgesia,\" \"child,\" \"infant-newborn,\" \"tolerance,\" \"dependency,\" \"withdrawal,\" \"analgesic,\" \"receptor,\" and \"individual opioid drugs.\" Clinical and preclinical studies were reviewed for data synthesis.Mechanisms of opioid-induced hyperalgesia and tolerance suggest important drug- and patient-related risk factors that lead to tolerance and withdrawal. Opioid tolerance occurs earlier in the younger age groups, develops commonly during critical illness, and results more frequently from prolonged intravenous infusions of short-acting opioids. Treatment options include slowly tapering opioid doses, switching to longer-acting opioids, or specifically treating the symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Novel therapies may also include blocking the mechanisms of opioid tolerance, which would enhance the safety and effectiveness of opioid analgesia.Opioid tolerance and withdrawal occur frequently in critically ill children. Novel insights into opioid receptor physiology and cellular biochemical changes will inform scientific approaches for the use of opioid analgesia and the prevention of opioid tolerance and withdrawal.",

Risk factors include problems in cognition, mobility, gastrointestinal motility, dysautonomia, anorectal dysfunction, and disabling neurologic disorders. Faecal incontinence is more common in frail individuals but is often assessed inadequately. The cause is often multifactorial. Treatment depends on the cause: a combination of approaches may be necessary, including avoidance of faecal impaction, instigation of a structured bowel care plan including regular prompted toileting, dietary modification, and (in some cases) use of loperamide or similar medications.",

      "title": "Natural history of alcohol use disorders in liver transplant patients",
      "abstract": "A. Liver transplantation (LT) patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD) often have the comorbid psychiatric disorder of alcohol dependence (AD). 1. Not all patients with AD will develop ALD. 2. Most, but not all patients, with ALD will be AD. 3. Approximately 75-80% of ALD LT patients have AD. B. Diagnostic criteria of alcohol use disorders. 1. Alcohol abuse. a. Clinically important impairment or distress repeatedly in one or more of the following items in a 12-month period. i. Failure to fulfill major obligations (e.g., absences/suspension from work, neglecting household duties). ii. Physically hazardous (e.g., driving while intoxicated). iii. Legal problems (e.g., disorderly conduct, arrest for driving while intoxicated). iv. Social/interpersonal problems (e.g., arguments with spouse about drinking, physical fights). b. Approximately 60% continue with abuse; only 10% go on to develop AD. 2. Diagnostic criteria of AD. a. Clinically important impairment or distress in 3 or more of the following in a 12-month period. i. Tolerance (e.g., increased amount needed for effect, diminished effect). ii. Withdrawal (e.g., autonomic hyperactivity, tremor, or use to avoid withdrawal). iii. Larger amounts/longer period than intended. iv. Persistent desire/unsuccessful attempts to cut down. v. Excessive time spent with alcohol (e.g., spending all of spare time at bar or recovering from effects of alcohol). vi. Activities given up as a result of alcohol (social, occupational, recreational activities give up to use alcohol instead—e.g., preferring to drink instead of attending son's baseball game). vii. Continued use despite problems (e.g., knowing of physical disease such as liver disease or psychological problem such as depression caused or worsened by alcohol use). b. Most LT candidates with ALD meet diagnostic criteria for AD (∼75-80%). c. Nearly 70% of our alcohol-dependent LT cohort endorsed ≥4 of these criteria (when they were active in their addiction before LT). d. Lifetime prevalence of AD is approximately 4%. LT, liver transplantation; ALD, alcoholic liver disease; AD, alcohol dependence; HCV, hepatitis C virus. A. First use of alcohol typically begins early with the development of dependence by early adulthood. 1. AD remains stable over years (unless a patient abstains). 2. Associated with a 10-15-year decrease in life span for a variety of health reasons (including, trauma, suicide). 3. Most (nearly 75%) of those with AD never receive treatment. 4. Physicians need to screen for alcohol consumption and refer AD patients for treatment. B. AD is a chronic medical disorder. 1. Heritability estimates from twin studies indicate that a 60% variance of risk is genetic (heterogeneous and polygenic). 2. Risk factors reflect familial/genetic factors and environment and personal choice. 3. Dependence has a distinct pathophysiology. 4. Effects on brain circuitry. a) Alcohol/drugs either directly or indirectly acutely activate mesolimbic dopamine-rich reward system. b) Prolonged use→changes in brain function. i. Brain metabolic activity. ii. Receptor availability. iii. Gene expression. iv. Responsiveness to environmental cues. c. Unclear whether changes return to normal with abstinence. 5. Changes in brain circuitry→increased difficulty changing alcohol behavior. a. Pairing of person/places/things/specific emotions→rapid and entrenched learning/conditioning. b. May elicit cravings even after long abstinence. C. Treatment is effective. 1. Goals. a. Minimize symptoms/exacerbations. b. Maximize function (physical, social, and role function). c. Treatment requires chronic care and monitoring. i. Insurance restrictions often limit covered services. ii. Emphasis is on acute care rather than ongoing treatment or on the process of relapse to prevent recurrence. 2. Treatment does not cure but reduces symptoms/improve functioning. 3. Longer treatment course more effective. i. Marked decrease in alcohol use in persons in treatment <3 months. Alcohol: long-term residential program lowered 35%, outpatient lowered 65%. ii. Much lowered use if in treatment ≥6 months. Alcohol: long-term residential program/outpatient lowered 75%-80%. A. The percentage of those receiving LT for ALD with or without hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been relatively stable, if not slightly decreasing over the past decade representing 15-20% of all U.S. LTs. B. Patients with ALD are not proportionally represented among LT recipients. ALD accounts for: 1. Thirty percent of all liver deaths in United States. 2. Only 15% of all LTs in the United States. C. AD is a chronic medical illness that spans decades. 1. After ≥10 years of AD, as few as 20-35% will be abstinent for 1 year. 2. Patients with ALD often drink in a heavy, sustained pattern for 10-20 years. 3. Patients referred for transplant often, but not always, have a sustained period of sobriety. D. Patients with AD have greater odds of having: 1. Mood disorder (mostly depression)—4× risk. 2. Drug dependence—37× risk. 3. Nicotine dependence—6.4× risk. E. Our cohort of 208 ALD LT patients. 1. Predominately white men, average age 51 years. 2. Nearly 75% AD. 3. Approximately 60% family history of alcohol use disorder. 4. Seventeen percent depressive disorder. 5. Forty-one percent used drugs in addition to alcohol (38% used intravenous drugs). 6. Nearly 75% used nicotine (smoked or smokeless). 7. Eight percent sober for ≥1 year. 8. Forty-five percent attended addiction rehabilitation. 9. Many similarities to the AD population in general. A. Time to specific alcohol use outcomes by 5 years after LT in a cohort. 1. Any alcohol use—43% had had at least one drink. 2. Binge use—27% had at least a single binge episode (defined as ≥6 drinks per occasion). 3. Frequency use—20% had at least a 1-week period that included 4 days of drinking. 4. Drinking most often began within the first post-LT year but could begin even after ≥4 years of post-LT sobriety. B. Those who took a first drink were at very high risk to continue drinking and to escalate to other, more serious patterns of use. Sixty percent who took a first drink eventually went on to have a binge episode. Additionally, for 20%, their first drink was a binge episode, highlighting the quick loss of control over drinking. For this reason, we recommend no alcohol at all, not even a single drink for a special occasion. C. Drinking trajectories—demonstrating the quantity, frequency, and duration of alcohol consumption. 1. Seventy-one percent either were complete abstainers or drank very minimally on 1-2 occasions. 2. Sixteen percent drank minimally to moderately rarely to occasionally. 3. Only 7% developed an escalating heavy drinking pattern. 4. Five percent drank moderately over time. D. Predictors of post-LT alcohol use—predicted the time to onset of specific alcohol outcomes and the moderate to high drinking trajectories. 1. Diagnosis of AD was associated with a 2.8× greater likelihood of alcohol use. 2. Each month of pre-LT sobriety conferred a lesser risk to drink (21% less risk for each month sober). 3. Addiction rehabilitation was associated with a 2× greater likelihood to use alcohol. We interpreted this to mean that patients who required addiction rehabilitation in order to stop drinking before LT (compared with those who stopped on their own) had a more severe form of the addiction. 4. First-degree biologic relative with an alcohol use disorder was associated with a 1.5× greater risk. E. There was no specific clinical cutpoint for pre-LT length of sobriety that would have high sensitivity and specificity in determining those unlikely to drink. 1. Months of pre-LT sobriety conferred less risk in a linear fashion. 2. Similar to what is seen in the general AD population, the longer the sobriety, the less risk to drink. 3. In the general AD population, stable sobriety is measured in years, not months. F. Survival up to 7 years after LT was not different between groups based on drinking outcomes. Our survival data are comparable to United Network for Organ Sharing survival data. G. Causes of death. 1. For recurrent diseases, 48% of our cohort was infected with hepatitis B virus and/or HCV. Fifteen died of recurrent HCV, with a mean survival of 3.3 years. 2. Thirteen died of cancer; mean survival was 3.5 years. Seven cancer deaths were most likely from tobacco exposure (lung and throat cancers in smokers/chewers). 3. Five died of alcohol-related causes; mean survival was 4 years. A. AD LT recipients share the same general characteristics of those with AD in the general population. 1. We have patients with complex histories, early onset, family histories of AD, comorbid drug use, depression, and tobacco use histories. a. We are selecting patients for LT with long sobriety. b. In the general AD population, this represents only a small percentage: 20-35% who had AD for 10-20 years and were 1 year sober. c. Members of our cohort were more likely to have attended addiction rehabilitation before LT. B. Outcomes are very good. 1. Most (71%) were completely or nearly completely abstainers. 2. Only 12% returned to a pattern of repeated drinking (only 7% in the heaviest repeated pattern of use). Many of these patients sought help for their addiction. 3. Few died as the result of alcohol consumption. 4. Patients in our cohort were more likely to die of recurrent HCV or cancer. C. Suggest considering recruiting patients from the still alcohol-dependent population if they can. 1. Begin active addiction treatment. 2. Have adequate support (family and LT team) for ongoing addiction treatment. 3. Demonstrate abstinence. 4. Recall that 75% of AD population never get treatment for their addiction. We could improve the course of their AD and medical outcome by identifying these patients and referring them for assessment and addiction treatment.

      "abstract": "Myxedema coma is a critical disorder with high mortality rates. Disruption of the compensatory mechanism for severe and long-term hypothyroidism by various causes leads to serious complications, including hypothermia, respiratory failure, circulatory failure, and central nervous system dysfunction. The most common causes of myxedema coma are thought to include infectious disease, stroke, myocardial infarction, sedative medicines, exposure to the cold and surgery in patients with poorly controlled hypothyroidism. We present a case of an 82-year-old female presented with complaints of loss of speech for 3 days, complaint of easy fatiguability for 3 days, altered sensorium since 1 day, weakness of both upper and lower limbs for 3 days and the patient attenders complaint of that patient is not taking food and difficult in swallowing since 3 days. In spite of the foregoing, patients with decreased mental status who have undergone thyroid surgery or hypothyroidism should be evaluated for myxedema coma. Additionally, this condition may be caused on by chronic hypothyroidism or by experiencing acute precipitating events like sepsis, a cerebrovascular accident, gastrointestinal bleeding, exposure to cold, trauma, or taking certain medications. A high mortality rate was noted, so patients whose myxedema coma is suspected should start receiving treatment right away.",

      "title": "Opioids for Chronic Nonterminal Pain",
      "abstract": "This article first reviews the evidence for and against chronic opioid therapy. Evidence supporting the opioid responsiveness of chronic pain, including neuropathic pain, includes multiple randomized trials conducted over months (up to 8 months). Observational studies are conducted for longer, and many also support opioid analgesic efficacy. Concerns have arisen about loss of efficacy with prolonged use, possibly related to tolerance or opioid-induced hyperalgesia. Mechanisms of tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia are explored. Evidence on other important outcomes such as improvement in function and quality of life is mixed, and is less convincing than evidence supporting analgesic efficacy. It is clear from current evidence that many patients abandon chronic opioid therapy because of the unacceptability of side effects. There are also concerns about toxicity, especially when opioids are used in high doses for prolonged periods, related to hormonal and immune function. The issue of addiction during opioid treatment of chronic pain is also explored. Addiction issues present many complex questions that have not been satisfactorily answered. Opioid treatment of pain has been, and remains, severely hampered because of actual and legal constraints related to addiction risk. Pain advocacy has focused on placing addiction risk into context so that addiction fears do not compromise effective treatment of pain. On the other hand, denying addiction risk during opioid treatment of chronic pain has not been helpful in terms of providing physicians with the tools needed for safe chronic opioid therapy. Here, a structured goal-directed approach to chronic opioid treatment is suggested; this aims to select and monitor patients carefully, and wean therapy if treatment goals are not reached. Chronic opioid therapy for pain has not been a universal success since it was re-established during the last two decades of the twentieth century. It is now realized that the therapy is not as effective or as free from addiction risk as was once thought. Knowing this, many ethical dilemmas arise, especially in relation to patients' right to treatment competing with physicians' need to offer the treatment selectively. In the future, we must learn how to select patients for this therapy who are likely to achieve improvement in pain, function and quality of life without interference from addiction. Efforts will also be made in the laboratory to identify opioids with lower abuse potential.",

Other agents are responsible for drop of arterial pressure by changing position, including antihypertensive drugs, alpha-blocking agents used in urology, antipsychotics, cyclic antidepressants, vasodilators and nitrates, dopaminergic antiparkinson drugs, sedatives, etc. Only drug with true ototoxic properties will be discussed here, namely substances that are able to damage the inner ear (cochlear or vestibular damage) or the VIIIth cranial nerve, causing impairment of equilibrium and/or (most often) hearing. No relevant data report the actual incidence of ototoxic problems, but more than 130 products have been classified as potentially dangerous. Individual susceptibility seems highly variable, but some predisposing factors have been identified: renal failure, age, combination of ototoxic drugs, familial sensitivity to ototoxic effects or previous neurosensorial deficit. We will first discuss the ototoxic medications that have certainly been extensively studied and among which we find several antibiotics (especially aminoglycosides and macrolides), the loop diuretics, and some antimalarial or chemotherapeutic agents. Environmental toxins and drug of abuse will then be discussed briefly because scientific data are much less significant. Early recognition of subjects who are at risk of developing ototoxicity, use of therapeutic monitoring and close observation of cochleovestibular functions in high risk situations (often not easy in critical patients) are the best way to prevent severe complications that have occasionally disastrous consequences on the quality of further life.",

      "title": "[Headache caused by analgesic and/or ergotamine abuse].",
      "abstract": "Headache induced by ergotamine-abuse was described 40 years ago. More recently there is ample evidence suggesting that chronic headache may also be provoked by analgesic abuse. A recent Classification of the International Headache Society has defined this kind of headache as an autonomous disease. It consists in a daily chronic headache with paroxysmal attacks associated with daily or almost daily assumption of analgesics and/or ergotamine. It is debated whether the term \"abuse\" or \"dependence\" is correct. Almost 5% of patients of the Headache Centres in Italy were found to be drug abusers. Most of these patients originally suffered from migraine. The therapeutic approach consists in hospitalization, withdrawal of analgesics and/or ergotamine, treatment of the withdrawal headache (which appears within 48 hours and lasts even 1-2 weeks) and finally in a prophylactic therapy. Although several treatments have been suggested for the abstinence syndrome, only fluid replacement, antiemetics, hypnotic-sedative drugs and rarely mild analgesics are necessary. A review of the literature shows the following success rates in the relief of the headache: above 50% relief in more than 60% of patients within a follow up period of 1 to 3.5 years as mean. Even if caffeine and barbiturates, which are often contained in the analgesic and ergotamine preparations, might be considered the cause of the abuse and withdrawal syndrome, they don't seem to play a fundamental role in this syndrome. An impairment of the central antinociceptive system was hypothesized to be involved in the pathogenesis of the headache associated with analgesic and/or ergotamine abuse. Recently there has been evidence of a possible hyposensitivity of the adrenergic and serotoninergic receptors of the central nervous system. It is still to be proved whether drug abuse is the cause or the consequence of the headache chronicization. The remarkable improvement of headache after analgesic withdrawal suggests a causal factor.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The term supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) refers to all tachycardias originating from supraventricular tissue (i.e. the sinus node, atria, or atrioventricular junction) or requiring it for their maintenance. Paroxysmal SVT is a clinical syndrome characterized by a tachycardia with an abrupt onset and termination. Non-paroxysmal SVTs have a gradual onset and offset sometimes characterized by the 'warm-up' and 'warm-down' phenomena. The term incessant is used to describe continuous SVTs, or repetitive SVTs recorded during 90% or more of the monitoring period. Clinical presentation of SVT is heterogeneous, depending on the SVT type, the patient's age, and underlying comorbidities. Some SVT patients may be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic. Symptoms related to SVTs include palpitations, lightheadedness, dizziness, diaphoresis, chest discomfort or chest pain, shortness of breath/dyspnoea, anxiety, polyuria, presyncope, and syncope, which may have different causes (cardiogenic syncope, vasovagal reflex syncope, or syncope due to sinus node dysfunction). A detailed appreciation of the SVT pattern (e.g. abrupt or gradual onset/offset), frequency of episodes, duration, symptoms (e.g. regular fast heart beating, or irregular palpitations), and possible triggers may aid the interpretation of the electrocardiogram tracings and definite diagnosis. Although SVTs are generally more common in younger, healthy individuals, a variable disease course may significantly alter the patient's quality of life. Many SVT patients have insufficient knowledge about their disease and available treatment. Patient education can improve their understanding of the disease and facilitate active participation of patients in the informed, shared decision-making regarding treatment.",

      "title": "CAUSES AND MANAGEMENT OF STRESS AT WORK",
      "abstract": "tress has been defined in different ways over the years.Originally, it was conceived of as pressure from the environment, then as strain within the person.The generally accepted definition today is one of interaction between the situation and the individual.It is the psychological and physical state that results when the resources of the individual are not sufficient to cope with the demands and pressures of the situation.Thus, stress is more likely in some situations than others and in some individuals than others.Stress can undermine the achievement of goals, both for individuals and for organisations (box 1).Signs of stress can be seen in people's behaviour, especially in changes in behaviour.Acute responses to stress may be in the areas of feelings (for example, anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue), behaviour (for example, being withdrawn, aggressive, tearful, unmotivated), thinking (for example, difficulties of concentration and problem solving) or physical symptoms (for example, palpitations, nausea, headaches).If stress persists, there are changes in neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, autonomic and immunological functioning, leading to mental and physical ill health (for example anxiety, depression, heart disease) (box 2, fig 1). 1 Situations that are likely to cause stress are those that are unpredictable or uncontrollable, uncertain, ambiguous or unfamiliar, or involving conflict, loss or performance expectations.Stress may be caused by time limited events, such as the pressures of examinations or work deadlines, or by ongoing situations, such as family demands, job insecurity, or long commuting journeys.Resources that help meet the pressures and demands faced at work include personal characteristics such as coping skills (for example, problem solving, assertiveness, time management) and the work situation such as a good working environment and social support.These resources can be increased by investment in work infrastructure, training, good management and employment practices, and the way that work is organised.Historically, the typical response from employers to stress at work has been to blame the victim of stress, rather than its cause.Increasingly, it is being recognised that employers have a duty, in many cases in law, to ensure that employees do not become ill.It is also in their long term economic interests to prevent stress, as stress is likely to lead to high staff turnover, an increase in sickness absence and early retirement, increased stress in those staff still at work, reduced work performance and increased rate of accidents, and reduced client satisfaction.Good employment practice includes assessing the risk of stress amongst employees.This involves:c looking for pressures at work which could cause high and long lasting levels of stress c deciding who might be harmed by these c deciding whether you are doing enough to prevent that harm. c HOW STRESS IS CAUSEDThe degree of stress experienced depends on the functioning of two protective physiological mechanisms:c \"Alarm reaction\".When confronted with a threat to our safety, our first response is physiological arousal: our muscles tense and breathing and heart rate become more rapid.This serves us well when the threat is the proverbial bull in the field rushing towards us.We either fight or flee.Present day threats tend to be more psychological-for example, unjustified verbal attack by a superior at work.It is usually not socially acceptable to act by \"fight or flight\", and an alternative means of expressing the resultant emotional and physical energy is required.This falls in the arena of assertive communication.c \"Adaptation\".The second adaptive mechanism allows us to cease responding when we learn that stimuli in the environment are no longer a threat to our safety.For example, when we first spend time in a house near a railway line, our response to trains hurtling past is to be startled, as described above.Over time, our response dwindles.If this process did not function, we would eventually collapse from physical wear and tear, and mental exhaustion.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Many medical disorders can give rise to disturbances of sleep and alter sleep architecture. Sleep can be impaired by the medical conditions themselves or by the medications used to treat them. Several symptoms associated with medical disorders, such as pain, dyspnea, nocturia, and pruritus can potentially disturb sleep, with the severity of sleep complaints waxing and waning in relation to the course of the medical illness. More than one sleep pathology may be present in a particular patient. The sleep disturbance causes distress and functional impairment, and requires independent clinical management. Conversely, sleep impairment can alter the presentation and adversely affect the symptoms of a variety of medical conditions, including respiratory, cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal, rheumatologic and infectious disorders. Asthma is a disease characterized by episodic dyspnea and wheezing, reversible episodes of bronchoconstriction, and airway hyperreactivity to a variety of specific and nonspecific stimuli. Sleep disturbance in patients with asthma can result in complaints of insomnia (including early morning awakenings) or excessive sleepiness. In one study, three of every four asthmatics reported nocturnal awakenings occurring at least once weekly, whereas two-thirds had nocturnal awakenings at least three times a week. Sleep in patients with nocturnal asthma is characterized by poor sleep quality with frequent arousals. They may awaken repeatedly due to coughing, dyspnea, wheezing, and chest discomfort. Complaints of insomnia and/or excessive daytime sleepiness are not infrequent.",

It is considered one of the most complex sensorimotor functions because of the high level of coordination needed to accomplish the swallowing task over a very short period of 1-2s and the multiple subsystems it involves. Dysphagia (i.e., swallowing difficulties) refers to any swallowing disorder and is commonly caused by a variety of neurological conditions (e.g., stroke, cerebral palsy, Parkinson disease), head and neck cancer and its treatment, genetic syndromes, and iatrogenic conditions or trauma. The signs and symptoms of dysphagia range from anterior loss of food while eating, difficulty chewing, and subjective difficulty swallowing food or liquids to choking or coughing before, during, or after eating because of impaired clearance of swallowed material from the throat into the digestive system. When not effectively treated, dysphagia can cause malnutrition, dehydration, immune system failure, psychosocial degradation, and generally decreased quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is a risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and typically results from caloric intake in excess of energy expenditure. Sleep-related eating disorder, a parasomnia associated with binge eating during the sleep period, typically with minimal recollection or conscious control, is also associated with weight gain. In some instances, sleep eating episodes may be induced by arousals related to untreated OSA that occur during sleep. A 41-year old male veteran with a medical history of obesity, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol use disorder in remission, vitamin D deficiency, hypothyroidism and chronic pain, who was prescribed gabapentin, aripiprazole, prazosin, escitalopram, levothyroxine, cholecalciferol, meloxicam, methocarbamol and nicotine supplements for these difficulties, presented with complaints of snoring, nightly sleep eating behaviors, excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue, non-restorative sleep and 40 pounds weight gain over 8 months. The patient’s main concern was sleep eating which had been occurring nightly, for at least two years. Behaviors were characterized by getting up, going to the kitchen and eating whatever was easily available, without preferences for certain types of foods. The patient did not have recollection for these events in the morning. Nocturnal polysomnography demonstrated severe OSA with an overall apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) of 108.3/hour. Titration of positive airway pressure (PAP) was tolerated well, and the patient was prescribed AutoCPAP 8–14 cmH2O. There was no sleep eating behavior or other parasomnia noted during the polysomnogram. This case highlights the possible associations between sleep eating behaviors and sleep disordered breathing. When these sleep disorders co-occur, it is often difficult to identify which disorder is causal. Longitudinal assessment is required to clarify the effects of positive airway pressure therapy on sleep eating, and whether such treatment has a direct impact on body habitus.",

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is an important neurological emergency. It is defined as seizures lasting for 5 minutes or more or recurrent seizures without recovery of consciousness to baseline between the attacks. Refractory SE (RSE) is defined as SE persisting despite sufficient dose of benzodiazepines and at least one antiepileptic drug (AED), irrespective of time. Super refractory SE (SRSE) is defined as SE that continues for 24 hours or more after the use of anesthetic therapy, including cases that recur on weaning of the anesthestic agent. RSE occurs in 23%–48% of the patients and SRSE in approximately 22% of the patients with SE. In general, RSE occurs in patients with new-onset seizures rather than in patients with chronic epilepsy. The etiology of RSE in developing countries is dominated by central nervous system (CNS) infections and head injury compared to stroke and drug withdrawal in the developed countries. The treatment of RSE and SRSE is not evidence based. Following benzodiazepines, the second line antiepileptic drugs include sodium valproate, phenytoin, levetiracetam, and anesthetic drugs such as midazolam, phenobarbital, and propofol. Most intravenous anesthetic drugs produce hypotension and respiratory suppression; therefore, patients with RSE are managed in intensive care units (ICUs). In RSE patients, electroencephalogram (EEG) burst suppression with interburst interval of 2–20 s or even flat EEG has been tried. Recently, concerns have been raised on the safety of burst suppression in RSE and SRSE. The paucity of ICUs in developing countries limits the use of these management protocols. There is a need to explore intravenous AEDs with safer cardiovascular and respiratory profile for the management of SE.",

Materiales y métodos: se hizo una búsqueda en la base de datos PUBMED con las palabras clave “major depression” (depresión mayor), “explicit memory” (memoria explícita) y “recollection memory” (memoria de recolección); se tomaron los artículos publicados después del año 2000; adicionalmente se incluyó bibliografía científica relevante para el cumplimiento del objetivo. Desarrollo: en la neuroanatomía del trastorno depresivo mayor se encuentran implicadas redes fronto-subcorticales (como las áreas prefrontales, tálamo, ganglios basales, hipocampo, entre otras). Estas estructuras pueden presentar atrofias que explicarían la persistencia o cronicidad de algunos de los síntomas cognitivos de la depresión. Las alteraciones en la memoria explícita, declarativa o de recolección, son de particular importancia por ser las más frecuentemente encontradas en sujetos con uno o más episodios depresivos mayores, y la estructura cerebral que se ha correlacionado más directamente con alteraciones en el almacenamiento de la memoria explícita es el hipocampo. Se ha observado actividad continua de neurogénesis en el hipocampo de animales adultos, la cual es especialmente susceptible cuando hay exposición prolongada a situaciones de estrés grave. Esto se evidencia en estudios que han encontrado reducido su volumen en sujetos con trastorno depresivo mayor, en comparación con individuos sanos. De todas maneras, aunque no se encuentre una reducción marcada del volumen, se sugiere que hay una alteración de su funcionamiento.Conclusiones: la memoria explícita es un proceso psicológico con base biológica precisa, cuya estructura y funcionamiento se alteran en presencia de una condición menos precisa como la depresión mayor.",

      "abstract": "A panic attack is characterized by the abrupt onset of apprehension or fear, accompanied by symptoms such as dyspnea, palpitations, chest pain, dizziness, sweating, the feeling of going mad or the fear of dying. The feeling of anxiety often recedes into the background and such patients present to nonpsychiatric physicians with mainly somatic symptoms. The consequences of frequent panic attacks, named panic disorder, are agoraphobia with impairment of psychic and social functioning, increased prevalence of alcohol abuse, depression and, in particular, suicidal attempts. It is of the utmost importance that physicians recognize the somatic symptoms of panic anxiety and plan integrated treatment. The main therapeutic resources at present include antidepressants, selected benzodiazepines and behavioral treatments and are very successful in improving panic attacks and their consequences, which may long go undiagnosed.",

      "title": "Persistent Psychosis After a Single Ingestion of “Ecstasy” (MDMA)",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: The street drug “ecstasy” (3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA; also “X” or “E”]) is a synthetic amphetamine that has both stimulant and hallucinogenic properties.1 It is increasingly used as a recreational drug and has a strong association with the “rave” culture. Subjective effects of MDMA include elevated mood, increased self-confidence and sensory sensitivity, and a peaceful feeling coupled with insight, empathy, and closeness to persons.2 It has gained a deceptive reputation as a “safe” drug among its users. MDMA use has been associated with various medical complications such as renal and liver failure, rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hepatitis, cerebral infarction, seizures, delirium, fulminant hyperthermia, intracranial bleed, cerebral edema, and coma.3–6 Adverse psychiatric symptomatology associated with MDMA includes panic attack, depression, suicidal ideation, flashbacks, rage reactions, psychosis, and severe paranoia.3 Persistent psychosis after even a single use has been reported.1,4,7 This case report describes persistent psychosis in a previously healthy adolescent girl after a single ingestion of MDMA\r\n\r\nCase report. In October 2010, Ms A, a 17-year-old African American girl without previous psychiatric or medical history, obtained MDMA from her friend and ingested the pill. She began experiencing auditory hallucinations and displaying disorganized speech and behavior shortly thereafter. She was taken to the University of South Alabama, Mobile, emergency department for evaluation and treatment of her behavior. In the emergency department, the consultation-liaison psychiatrist noticed that the patient was awake and alert, but could not engage in meaningful communication. Results of routine laboratory testing showed no alcohol or illicit drugs present. Physical examination findings were unremarkable. She was seen by the neurology service, where physicians believed that the patient had no obvious etiology for her current symptomatology. There was no family history of mood disorders or psychosis among first- or second-degree relatives. The patient was cleared medically in the emergency department and was then transferred to an acute care inpatient psychiatric unit affiliated with the University of South Alabama.\r\n\r\nIn the psychiatric unit, she continued to demonstrate odd, bizarre behavior. She exhibited frequent episodes of crying and using profanity. She displayed sexually inappropriate behavior, eg, touching others sexually, dancing seductively, and assuming unusual postures by putting her hands underneath her pelvis while pushing the pelvis upwards. In addition, she attempted to eat food from another person's plate and multiple trash cans. Her speech was mostly nonsensical, and at times she claimed that she was pregnant and had an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) infection. She appeared to be responding strongly to internal stimuli. She gave the appearance of being paranoid, feeling scared, and being socially withdrawn.\r\n\r\nAfter a literature review, we decided to institute olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets 10 mg every 12 hours. Haloperidol 5 mg and lorazepam 1 mg were also employed on an as-needed basis and were administered frequently over several days. After 14 days of this medication regimen, normal behavior was noticed, but there were intervals during which she became agitated and confused. After that point, her family had decided to take her home against medical advice. She was sent to school for a day by family to resume a normal life (she is an honor roll student and had been accepted to college on a scholarship). According to the family, the school personnel advised her to go back home immediately because “she is not normal.” She was promptly rehospitalized in our care due to frequent agitation, confusion, leaving the house at night, and walking in traffic.\r\n\r\nIn the unit, her assessment demonstrated her to be staring off blankly into space and making repetitive hand, eye, and head movements while screaming. She was placed on 1:1 observation due to her unpredictable behavior. Olanzapine was increased to 15 mg every 12 hours. Gradually, her behavior improved, such that she was no longer displaying stereotypic behavior. She was capable of having meaningful conversations. Furthermore, her reality testing improved. Upon discharge, she showed improvement of symptoms and organized thoughts. However, she continued to describe dysphoric mood. She recounted use of MDMA in October. Instantaneously she noticed she was not herself nor did she recall what happened immediately after taking MDMA.\r\n\r\nMDMA-induced psychotic disorder can be distinguished from schizophrenia by several characteristics associated with the former, including complete lack of prodromal symptoms (social withdrawal, anxiety, or lack of motivation), absence of sustained mood disturbance, and good premorbid functioning.1 The cause of MDMA-induced psychotic symptoms is not well understood.1 Evidence from animal and human studies suggests that MDMA reduces levels of brain serotonergic activity and depletes serotonin stores.8 MDMA acts by binding to presynaptic monoamine transporters, most strongly to the serotonin receptor transporter, causing rapid release and subsequent depletion of serotonin and dopamine from presynaptic terminals.6,9–11 Further damage is caused by the generation of free radicals that are taken by the serotonin nerve terminal, exhausting the antioxidant capacity of brain tissues.12 In laboratory animals, MDMA causes persistent damage to serotonergic neurons.6,9,12 It is thought that it causes similar damage to neurons in the human brain. MDMA does not have a potent direct agonist effect on dopamine receptors.1,2 MDMA may induce psychosis through dopaminergic or serotonergic pathways.13 Our patient did not have medical complications, as compared to a published case report.14 In our case, there was no laboratory toxicology evidence of MDMA exposure; however, routine toxicology screens do not screen for MDMA. Furthermore, presumptive diagnosis of MDMA use is often made without toxicologic evidence. In our patient, we were able to support MDMA use through patient interview and collateral from friends and family. The use of high-dose antipsychotic medication (haloperidol and olanzapine) and anticonvulsants (diazepam and carbamazepine) has been documented for the treatment of psychosis after MDMA use.1,5,6,15\r\n\r\nThe widespread use of MDMA and the potential adverse effects associated with it underlines the need for clinicians to inquire carefully about MDMA use and to include MDMA in toxicology screenings. MDMA use as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with paranoid psychosis, affective disorders, or anxiety has become increasingly important. When MDMA exposure is suspected, there should be close collaboration between the psychiatrist and medical personnel, since MDMA use is associated with serious medical complications. Whether these complications are due to MDMA use directly or caused by unrelated adulterants added during manufacturing is an area of ongoing research. Further studies are required to clarify the etiology of persistent psychosis after MDMA use and to describe the treatment options.",

      "abstract": "Chronic low back pain, defined as lumbar pain persisting for 12 weeks or more, occurs in about 13% of U.S. adults. Patients with chronic low back pain should have a history and physical examination to identify red flags that may indicate serious conditions that warrant immediate intervention or yellow flags (i.e., psychological, environmental, and social factors) that indicate risk of disability. The examination should include an evaluation for radicular symptoms. Routine imaging is not recommended but is indicated when red flags are present, there is a neuromuscular deficit, or if pain does not resolve with conservative therapy. Patients should avoid bed rest. Nonpharmacologic treatment is first-line management and may include therapies with varying evidence of support, such as counseling, exercise therapy, spinal manipulation, massage, heat, dry needling, acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and physical therapy. Pharmacologic interventions are second-line treatment. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the initial medication of choice; duloxetine may also be beneficial. Evidence is inconclusive to recommend the use of benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants, antidepressants, corticosteroids, insomnia agents, anticonvulsants, cannabis, acetaminophen, or long-term opioids. Epidural corticosteroid injections are not recommended except for short-term symptom relief in patients with radicular pain. Most patients with chronic low back pain will not require surgery; evaluation for surgery may be considered in those with persistent functional disabilities and pain from progressive spinal stenosis, worsening spondylolisthesis, or herniated disk. Physicians should consider prevention of chronic low back pain when patients present with acute back pain. Screening tools are available to predict the progression from acute to chronic low back pain, and targeted treatment strategies are beneficial for preventing progression.",

      "title": "Pseudobulbar Affect Presenting as Aggressive Behavior",
      "abstract": "Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is an affective disorder of emotional expression characterized by frequent uncontrollable outbursts of laughing or crying. It is usually associated with stroke, traumatic brain injury, and other neurological conditions. This disorder can present a challenge to clinicians to distinguish this from mood disorders or to diagnose this disorder in the context of underlying mood disorders. In addition, the delay in the diagnosis can impact patients' quality of life. We describe a 48-year-old man who presented with frequent episodes of sudden, frequent, uncontrollable laughing two years after his recurrent stroke. The patient initially had his first stroke about three years ago and had a recurrent stroke eight months after his first stroke. A few days after getting discharged after his second stroke, the patient was admitted to the psychiatric unit after his family members reported aggressive behavior. The patient also reported symptoms of depression and was discharged on escitalopram for mood and divalproex for his aggressive behavior. Unfortunately, the patient was not compliant with these medications with no resolution of his symptoms. The patient was then treated with dextromethorphan-quinidine, escitalopram, and divalproex, resulting in significant improvement in his mood and aggressive behavior with a resolution of uncontrollable laughing spells. Clinicians are encouraged to inquire about symptoms of pseudobulbar affect in the context of stroke or other neurological disorders. Appropriate management of this condition can help improve patients' symptoms and positively affect their wellbeing.",

      "title": "Status epilepticus",
      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a medical emergency associated with significant morbidity and mortality. SE is defined as a continuous seizure lasting more than 30 min, or two or more seizures without full recovery of consciousness between any of them. Based on recent understanding of the pathophysiology, it is now considered that any seizure that lasts more than 5 min probably needs to be treated as SE. GABAergic mechanisms play a crucial role in terminating seizures. When the seizure persists, GABA-mediated mechanisms become ineffective and several other putative mechanisms of seizure suppression have been recognized. Early treatment of SE with benzodiazepines, followed if necessary by fosphenytoin administration, is the most widely followed strategy. About a third of patients with SE may have persistent seizures refractory to the first-line medications. They require aggressive management with second-line medications such as barbiturates, propofol, or other agents. In developing countries where facilities for assisted ventilation are not readily available, it may be helpful to use nonsedating antiepileptic drugs (such as sodium valproate, levetiracetam, or topiramate) at this stage. It is important to recognize SE and institute treatment as early as possible in order to avoid a refractory state. It is equally important to attend to the general condition of the patient and to ensure that the patient is hemodynamically stable. This article reviews current knowledge regarding the management of convulsive SE in adults.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The cauda equina is a collection of peripheral nerves in the common dural sheath within the lumbar spinal canal. Cauda equina syndrome, also known as bilateral acute radicular syndrome, usually is caused by a large, sequestered acute disc rupture at L3-4, L4-5, or L5-S1 that produces partial or complete lesions of the cauda equina–lower motor neuron lesions associated with flaccid paralysis, atrophy, and other conditions. Patients usually present with a history of back symptoms that have worsened precipitously. The syndrome includes back pain, bilateral leg pain, saddle anesthesia, bilateral lower extremity weakness, urinary bladder retention, and lax rectal tone. Cauda equina syndrome is rated using Diagnosis-related estimates (DRE) lumbosacral categories VI or VII. Category VI, Cauda Equina–like Syndrome Without Bowel or Bladder Signs, is used when there is permanent bilateral partial loss of lower extremity function but no bowel or bladder impairment. Category VII, Cauda Equina Syndrome with Bowel or Bladder Impairment, is similar to Category VI but also includes bowel or bladder impairment. The AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ) uses the term cauda equina syndrome with reference to both the thoracolumbar and cervicothoracic spine regions; this usage is unique to the AMA Guides but maintains the internal consistency of the Injury Model, which is the best approach to date for assessing spine impairment.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is a heritable psychiatric condition, that is, associated with lifelong distress and impairment. There has been a long-standing interest in the early-life origins of BD, not least because as many as 50% of adults with BD report onset of their symptoms during childhood and adolescence.1 In this article, we present evidence on the assessment and treatment of BD and related conditions in young people. We also discuss the recent controversy about BD in children and adolescents that has led to the introduction of the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM)-5.\n\n### Diagnostic features\n\nBD is characterised by episodes, that is, distinct periods of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive or irritable mood. During these episodes, patients experience symptoms such as grandiosity, distractibility, decreased need for sleep, pressure of speech, an increase in activity, flight of ideas and psychomotor agitation. These episodes are required to last by at least 4 days to diagnose hypomania or at least 7 days to diagnose mania. The insistence on episodic mood changes is crucial and prevents clinicians from rating symptoms such as the chronic concentration problems of a child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as evidence for mania.2 Manic episodes are extremely rare in children and relatively rare in adolescents according to epidemiological studies in the UK and the USA.3\n\n### Acute treatment\n\nPharmacotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for acute mania. Aripiprazole, quetiapine and risperidone are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of mania in children and adolescents, and olanzapine in approved only for adolescents. A comparative analysis of randomised, placebo-controlled trials in youth BD established that atypical antipsychotics have better efficacy and tolerability compared with anticonvulsants and lithium (effect size atypical antipsychotics 0.65, CI 0.53 to 0.78 vs …",

In addition, some report increased libido and enhancement of the sexual experience (Chin et al. 1998; Laborit 1972). GHB gained notoriety among regulatory agencies as well as in the club/party scene because of increases in the numbers of adverse effects and overdoses associated with its use (most often when co-administered with other substances). These can include weakness, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, loss of peripheral vision, hypothermia, respiratory acidosis, decrease or loss of consciousness, and coma. Overdosed users generally regain consciousness within 1–5 hours without sequelae (Chin et al. 1992, 1999; Dyer 1991; Ross 1995). Because the median lethal dose (LD50) is only about five times the intoxicating dose (Vickers 1969), and because it is synergistic with alcohol, the risk of central nervous system (CNS) depression is greater with GHB than with other club drugs.",

The kind of disease which those alcoholics who support the disease concept have in mind is something which would describe a condition preceding their drinking, something constitutional, that is to say, present from their earliest days, and therefore likely to be in the nature of a biochemical or psychological abnormality.

Stressors can trigger a variety of stress reactions, including psychological, physiological, and behavioural ones. A multitude of health problems that impact most of the body's systems are brought on by prolonged exposure to such stress. Both physical and mental health is impacted by stress. Perhaps not everyone's bodies react to stress in the same way. Depending on the person's genotype, sex, age, physiological conditions, and prior experiences, it might be different. However, some of these effects apply to everyone. Additionally, stress may work in conjunction with other pathogenic factors to induce gastrointestinal illness. Higher amounts of corticoids and adrenaline are primarily responsible for the effects. Disrupted eating habits, acid reflux, diarrhoea, or constipation are common indications of stress. Stress should be managed by making tiny changes to attitude and way of life, even though it is impossible to escape stress in day-to-day existence.",

Each of the four subtypes, A, B, C, and D, is caused by the deficiency of a different enzyme in the degradative pathway of heparan sulphate: heparan-N-sulphatase (EC 3.10.1.1), α-N-acetylglucosaminidase (EC3.2.1.50), acetyl-CoA N-acetyl transferase (EC 2.3.1.3), and N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulphatase (EC 3.1.6.14), respectively.1 Clinical symptoms usually occur after two years of apparently normal development and include hyperactivity, aggressive behaviour, delayed development (particularly in speech), sleep disturbances, coarse hair, hirsutism, and diarrhoea. There are only relatively mild somatic manifestations. There then follows a period of progressive mental retardation with death usually between the second and third decade of life. In a small number of patients with Sanfilippo syndrome type B, there is a more slowly progressive form of the disease with later onset known as the attenuated phenotype.2-4 A late onset phenotype has also been described for Sanfilippo syndrome type A.5 \n\nSanfilippo syndrome type A (MPS IIIA) is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme heparan-N-sulphatase (sulphamidase).

      "abstract": "FIFTEEN to 20 million Americans suffer chronically from the tyranny of insomnia. Over-the-counter medications, the first line of defense, have little impact on sleep beyond placebo effects. Ironically, antihistamines in them can increase daytime drowsiness and may enhance the person's belief that sleep is getting worse. When these drugs fail, the chronic sufferer often turns to the physician, who is expected to be ready with medically proved answers. Twenty-seven million prescriptions were written for hypnotics in 1976. Barbiturates, accounting for 20% of these prescriptions, lead to a predictable cycle of dependence, tolerance, and escalating doses. These medications also disrupt the sleep structure. Rapid eye movement (REM) and slow-wave sleep (stages 3 and 4) are suppressed, and the EEG shows increased β activity. Physical and psychological dependence, withdrawal reactions, and \"REM rebound\" reactions (severe nightmares and sleep more disturbed than before taking medication) often accompany attempts to stop using these drugs.",

      "abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is a multisystem disorder caused by Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb). Neurological symptoms such as lymphocytic meningoradiculoneuritis (Bannwart’s syndrome), cranial neuritis (II,III,IV,V,VI), encephalitis, transverse myelitis are found in about 10% of cases during the second phase of the disease. In the chronic stage, many months or years after the initial infection, other neurologic complications may occur, such as encephalomyelitis, epileptic crises, cognitive impairment, peripheral neuropathy and psychiatric disturbances such as depression, anxiety, panick attacks, catatonia, psychosis etc. Some patient continue to experience symptoms of fatigue, insomnia or psychiatric disorder in the post borrelia syndrome. We describe here a patient with a triad of unusual symptoms in chronic LNB including tremor, seizures and psychosis. Standardized medical interview, neurologic examination, neuroimaging, serum and CSF serology as well as EEG and EMNG evaluation were performed. The patient was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and doxycycline and responded with rapid clinical and functional improvement. Newertheless, he suffered from multiple systemic and neurologic sequelas that influenced his daily activities in post treatment period. Emphasis is placed on the atypical onset and evolution, the difficulties encountered in formulating diagnosis, early treatment and the uncertainties concerning the sequelae after treatment. In patients with non-specific long lasting symptoms in the absence of overt clinical signs suggesting CNS involvement, routine treatment with i.v. ceftriaxone is not to be encouraged.",

      "title": "Pharmacological Treatment of Psychosis",
      "abstract": "Psychotic symptoms may be the primary characteristic of a specific disorder such as schizophrenia, occur secondary to a mood disorder such as major depression, or be due to a known causative factor such as a drug-induced paranoid reaction. Schizophrenia is the best studied disorder in terms of pharmacological treatment, and schizoaffective disorder is often included in these medication trials. Although antipsychotics have often been prescribed for major mood disorders with psychotic features, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has dramatically expanded their approved uses in recent years. Several of these agents are now indicated for bipolar and unipolar disorders, even in the absence of psychosis. Antipsychotics are also often prescribed off-label, but limited data are available to guide their appropriate use. For example, they are widely administered to older patients experiencing behavioral disturbances or psychosis associated with dementia. The potential risks of such off-label use are underscored by an FDA-mandated box warning for all antipsychotics, primarily due to an increased incidence of cardiovascular events and the related morbidity and mortality. Because individuals with schizophrenia may experience subtle changes in behavior and cognition for long periods prior to their first acute psychotic episode, early diagnosis and intervention are increasingly emphasized. Recognition of impending or subtle signs of psychosis and introduction of an antipsychotic to reduce duration of untreated symptoms may have a substantial impact on long-term outcome. For example, a recent meta-analysis found that limiting the duration of untreated psychosis to less than 9 months was associated with a substantially greater reduction in negative symptoms (Boonstra et al. 2012). Imaging studies indicate that during the early years after illness onset, a subset of patients with schizophrenia may demonstrate significant decreases in gray matter and white matter, as well as increases in cerebrospinal fluid (Andreasen et al. 2011). The use of antipsychotic drugs in this population, however, is complicated by conflicting reports of an association between exposure to them and either neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects (Lewis 2011). Although antipsychotic drug therapy is used for several FDA-approved and unapproved indications, the existing evidence base for these medications is strongest for their role in managing multiple-episode schizophrenia, which is the focus of this chapter. (For management of first-episode patients, see Chapter 8, \"Early-Stage Schizophrenia.\") In this chapter, data for both acute and long-term management are considered. Because inadequate response and treatment resistance are common in this population, strategies to augment standard antipsychotics or to serve as alternatives are also reviewed. Throughout the chapter, an emphasis is placed on the value of a risk-benefit assessment that takes into account the substantial safety and tolerability issues associated with this class of psychotropic medications.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To report a case of delirium involving a drug interaction of the antidepressant phenelzine in combination with an opiate and to discuss the exacerbation of delirium secondary to a withdrawal syndrome caused by the abrupt discontinuation of phenelzine. Case Summary: A 67-year-old white woman with a history of major depression and chronic anxiety developed delirium shortly after the postsurgical administration of opioid analgesics. In addition, she was taking the antidepressant phenelzine and had been maintained on this medication for approximately 20 years. Her presenting symptoms included combativeness, auditory and visual hallucinations, and persecutory delusions. After development of the delirium, the patient's phenelzine medication was abruptly discontinued, introducing a withdrawal syndrome that further aggravated her condition. Discussion: This case emphasizes the importance of the potentially fatal drug interaction involving phenelzine and opiates and addresses the adverse consequences of abruptly discontinuing phenelzine during phenelzine–opiate–induced delirium. Phenelzine–opiate interactions and phenelzine withdrawal should be considered as possible etiologies of delirium in patients with a history of phenelzine use. Conclusions: Less widely prescribed antidepressants such as phenelzine may be unfamiliar to contemporary clinicians, resulting in adverse consequences for patients, such as phenelzine–opiate drug interactions and phenelzine withdrawal.",

      "title": "The treatment of benzodiazepine dependence",
      "abstract": "Abstract Withdrawal of benzodiazepines is currently advised for long‐term benzodiazepine users because of doubts about continued efficacy, risks of adverse effects, including dependence and neuropsychological impairment and socio‐economic costs. About half a million people in the UK may need advice on withdrawal. Successful withdrawal strategies should combine gradual dosage reduction and psychological support. The benzodiazepine dosage should be tapered at an individually titrated rate which should usually be under the patient's control. The whole process may take weeks or months. Withdrawal from diazepam is convenient because of available dosage strengths, but can be carried out directly from other benzodiazepines. Adjuvant medication may occasionally be required (antidepressants, propranolol) but no drugs have been proved to be of general utility in alleviating withdrawal‐related symptoms. Psychological support should be available both during dosage reduction and for some months after cessation of drug use. Such support should include the provision of information about benzodiazepines, general encouragement, and measures to reduce anxiety and promote the learning of non‐pharmacological ways of coping with stress. For many patients the degree of support required is minimal; a minority may need counselling or formal psychological therapy. Unwilling patients should not be forced to withdraw. With these methods, success rates of withdrawal are high and are unaffected by duration of usage, dosage or type of benzodiazepine, rate of withdrawal, symptom severity, psychiatric history or personality disorder. Longer‐term outcome is less clear; a considerable proportion of patients may temporarily take benzodiazepines again and some need other psychotropic medication. However, the outcome may be improved by careful pharmacological and psychological handling of withdrawal and post‐withdrawal phases.",

Regarding depression as just the defined episode when patients meet the criteria for diagnosis, ignores the fluctuating character of the illness and the role of the patient. The patient is, after all, the one who decides if and when the symptoms experienced are important enough to seek medical assistance. How a patient with depression should be treated, and whether or not and to whom the patient should be referred, depends on more than just the severity of the depression. This is because severity involves more than just the number of symptoms when the depression was first diagnosed. Ineffective coping behaviour and lack of social support both negatively influence the course of depression and if the initial treatment is not effective enough, the episode will be prolonged. The interest and skills of the general practitioners as well as the expectations and former experiences of the patient play a major role in deciding whether to refer a patient to secondary care.",

      "abstract": "Mr. R, age 75, is having difficulty sleeping. When he goes to bed, he lies there for what seems like forever, unable to fall asleep. He feels so tired and ends up taking naps during the day, but he cannot break this cycle. He has tried using over-the-counter products with little relief. Mr. R's primary care physician prescribes zaleplon, 10 mg/d, and asks him to call the clinic in 2 weeks to discuss his progress. He takes zaleplon as directed for several nights and begins to feel sluggish during the day, both mentally and physically, despite reporting an increase in the overall amount of sleep at night. Sedative-hypnotic drugs are among the most commonly used medications in the United States. Use of these drugs, as well as anxiolytics, has increased from 2.8% between 1988 and 1994 to 4.7% between 2007 and 2010, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. (1) In 2011, drugs categorized as sedative-hypnotics or antipsychotics were involved in 6.1% of all human exposures identified in the American Association of Poison Control Centers' National Poison Data System. (2) Therefore, an understanding of clinical and pharmacological variables related to safe and effective use is important for clinicians prescribing and monitoring therapy with these agents. Neuropsychiatric disorders are prevalent among geriatric patients and are associated with age-related physiologic changes in the CNS. (3) Such changes involve: * neuroanatomy (brain atrophy, decreased neuronal density, increased plaque formation) * neurotransmitters (reduced cholinergic transmission, decreased synthesis of dopamine and catecholamines), and * neurophysiology (reduced cerebral blood flow). These physiologic processes manifest as alterations in mental status, reflexes, sensation, gait, balance, and sleep. Examples of sleep changes among geriatric patients include decreased sleep efficiency, more frequent awakenings, and more variable sleep duration. (3), (4) Sleep disorders also may be related to mental disorders and other medical conditions. (5) For example, the prevalence of sleep-related respiratory disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea, increases with age. (6) Sleep disorders are common among geriatric patients. In a large epidemiologic study of sleep complaints in patients age [greater than or equal to]65, more than one-half of patients had at least 1 sleep complaint (ie, difficulty falling asleep, trouble waking up, early awakening, need for naps, and feeling ill-rested). (7) As many as 34% of patients reported symptoms of insomnia. In an analysis of National Ambulatory Medical Survey Data over 6 years, 24.8% to 27.9% of sleep-related medical office visits were attributed to patients age [greater than or equal to]65. (8) Pharmacology in aging Prescribing sedative-hypnotic drugs is not routinely recommended for older patients with a sleep disorder. Geriatric patients, compared with younger patients, are at higher risk of iatrogenic complications because of polypharmacy, comorbidities, relative renal and hepatic insufficiency, and other physiologic changes leading to alterations in drug exposure and metabolism (Table 1).(9-12) Aging is associated with changes in body composition, including an increase in total body fat and decrease in lean body mass and total body water. These changes, as well as a prolonged GI transit time, decrease in active gut transporters, decreased blood perfusion, and decrease in plasma proteins such as albumin (because of 'educed liver function or malnutrition), may lead to alteration in drug absorption patterns and may increase the volume of distribution for lipophilic drugs. Additionally, the elimination half-life of some drugs may increase with age because of larger volumes of distribution and reduction in hepatic or renal clearance. The clinical significance of these changes is not well established. …",

In extreme cases the diagnosis can even lead to suicide. Parents feel guilty and search for reasons why this has happened to one of their children. Is it attributable to some defect in their family, such as an alcoholic uncle or a mentally disturbed relative, or to their own misdeeds? The mother may blame herself for trying to avoid pregnancy, or for an attempted termination, or just not wanting the child. Arising from these deeply-felt feelings and anxieties the child may be rejected or overprotected. . The child who has epilepsy will have to grow up ID an atmosphere of anxiety about his condition. Parents are concerned about their responsibility and how far they can allow the child to follow a normal existence. There may be disputes about this, and as to how far the child should be subject to the same discipline as the other children. The child may endure many restrictions (swimming, riding a bicycle, etc), limitations on activities or going out with other children. Drugs may have to be taken-a nuisance in itself-and he will suffer the effects of taking drugs even if these are minimal. There may be difficulty in keeping up with schooling, and in many ways he will feel different from other children. Later the inability to drive a car may be a social handicap. Epilepsy, to the individual, means a ~reat deal ~f uncertainty. Will a seizure interfere with taking an exan:nnation or an interview for a job, or plans for some social activity or a holiday? Epileptics may feel that the risk. of causing a disturbance at a cinema or a dance by havIDg a seizure is too embarrassing, and so they become more and more isolated. All these factors play a significant role in the development of the individual and his per~onality. There is no clear evidence that epilepsy itself causes behavioural disturbance. Occasionally the underlying cause of the seizure may be responsible for disturbed behaviour in a child or some cases of temporal lobe epilepsy cause behavioural disorders. The extremes of epileptic personalitv are more often the sort of behaviour which follows lo~g periods of institutional care and it is r~re ~o find someone demonstrating the old textbook epileptic personality outside of an institution.

When we encounter stressful situations such as an examination, a difficult task at work, a personal or family crisis, any one of us may feel anxious or tense. Such feelings may included headaches, finding it hard to relax, having difficulty with concentration, being irritable and sometimes snapping at family or colleagues with scant cause. More or less extreme outbursts of emotion such as anger or inappropriate laughter are commonly understood as due to 'stress'. There may also be physical symptoms like dry mouth, sweating, palpitations as heart rate increases, and shallow, rapid breathing.",

In some instances, such hypertension develops from a benign form, while in others it is malignant in type, almost from its inception; the latter type has constituted approximately 10 per cent. of the total number of cases in our hospital experience. The cause of the disease is unknown; the course is stormy and rapid; the prognosis is extremely grave, and the medical treatment is entirely unsatisfactory. The clinical symptoms are: (1) marked and continuous elevation of systolic blood pressure and disproportionately high diastolic pressure; (2) cerebral manifestations—that is, excruciating dull headaches, intermittent or continuous in character, affecting as a rule the entire cranium, but centering especially in the occiput—insomnia, irritability and mental deterioration, changes in personality and at times apoplectic or epileptiform seizures; (3)",

      "title": "Serotonin Syndrome: Pathophysiology, Clinical Features, Management, and Potential Future Directions",
      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome (SS) (also referred to as serotonin toxicity) is a potentially life-threatening drug-induced toxidrome associated with increased serotonergic activity in both the peripheral (PNS) and central nervous systems (CNS). It is characterised by a dose-relevant spectrum of clinical findings related to the level of free serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]), or 5-HT receptor activation (predominantly the 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A subtypes), which include neuromuscular abnormalities, autonomic hyperactivity, and mental state changes. Severe SS is only usually precipitated by the simultaneous initiation of 2 or more serotonergic drugs, but the syndrome can also occur after the initiation of a single serotonergic drug in a susceptible individual, the addition of a second or third agent to long-standing doses of a maintenance serotonergic drug, or after an overdose. The combination of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), in particular MAO-A inhibitors that preferentially inhibit the metabolism of 5-HT, with serotonergic drugs is especially dangerous, and may lead to the most severe form of the syndrome, and occasionally death. This review describes our current understanding of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation and management of SS, and summarises some of the drugs and interactions that may precipitate the condition. We also discuss the newer novel psychoactive substances (NPSs), a growing public health concern due to their increased availability and use, and their potential risk to evoke the syndrome. Finally, we discuss whether the inhibition of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), in particular the neuronal isoform (TPH2), may provide an opportunity to pharmacologically target central 5-HT synthesis, and so develop new treatments for severe, life-threatening SS.",

      "title": "Driving under the influence of opioids: What prescribers should know",
      "abstract": "Opioids affect the central nervous system and are known to produce dizziness, sleepiness, mood changes, and other actions that in some people have a negative impact on psychomotor or mental performance. The negative effects can be exacerbated in persons who are taking other prescription medications or illegal substances. Opioid-abusing drivers clearly represent an unnecessary danger to the public; although the vast majority of patients taking prescription opioids for pain safely drive to work and other activities, a subset may be impaired, but not be aware of or recognize the problem. The majority of pain patients would likely be surprised to learn that the legal systems in most parts of the world, including most states in the United States, do not differentiate between a pain patient taking a prescribed opioid at the right dose and frequency, and an abuser taking an illegal drug. For example, in some parts of the United States, a driver may be initially stopped for a relatively minor offense and, if the officer notices that the driver is wearing a fentanyl patch, charged with driving under the influence of drugs (DUID). The present narrative review attempts to highlight the existing problem, the different legal thresholds for arrest and prosecution for DUID, and the challenge of trying to have zero-tolerance for driving under the influence of a drug used illegally, while at the same time not arresting legitimate patients who are taking pain medication as prescribed. There is a clear and present need for an integrated assessment and addressing of the current confounding situation.",

In about 5 per cent of cases the alteration in mood may be accompanied by clouding of consciousness, delusions, hallucinations and disorientation. This picture of an organic confusional state is said to result from high doses and prolonged therapy with corticosteroids and ACTH. The latter is recognized to cause psychiatric sequelae more often than the corticosteroids (Truelove and Witts, 1959).

The patient suffered from anxiety and inner restlessness when trying to discontinue the medication, as well as from fatigue and forgetfulness when on medication. The medical history was free of psychiatric disorders and abuse of psychoactive substances.Apart from mild attention and concentration deficits with a mildly depressed mood the psychiatric findings were normal.Consistent with the preliminary diagnosis of a primary non-benzodiazepine dependence (zopiclone), after withdrawal of zopiclone the patient suffered from inner restlessness and psychomotor agitation, vague abdominal pain, and hypertension. The symptoms subsided after administration and subsequent gradual discontinuation of diazepam.Zopiclone dependence has repeatedly been reported in patients with pre-existing substance-related addictions, and in patients with other psychiatric disorders. Primary zopiclone dependence may be regarded as rare. Despite the low dependence potential of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, the indication of prescription should be thoroughly considered.",

      "title": "Psychedelic Therapy: A Primer for Primary Care Clinicians – Part V. Ibogaine",
      "abstract": "Background: Ibogaine is a plant-derived alkaloid that has been used for thousands of years in rites of passage and spiritual ceremonies in West-Central Africa. In the West, it has primarily been used and studied for its anti-addictive properties and more recently for other neuropsychiatric indications, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Areas of Uncertainty: Ibogaine requires careful patient screening and monitoring due to significant safety issues. There is potential for cardiotoxicity (prolonged QT interval); without rigorous screening, fatal arrhythmias may occur. Additionally, ibogaine may have dangerous interactions with opiates, so patients who receive ibogaine treatment for opioid use disorder must withdraw from long-acting opioids. Other potential concerning effects of ibogaine include rare incidents of mania or psychosis. Anticipated transient effects during ibogaine treatment can include ataxia, tremors, and gastrointestinal symptoms.Therapeutic Advances: Nonetheless, robust effects following a single treatment with ibogaine have been reported. In open-label and randomized controlled trials (RCTs), ibogaine reduces heroin and opioid cravings by upwards of 50%, up to 24 weeks after the treatment. Observational studies have shown that ibogaine, in combination with the psychedelic 5-methoxy-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT), significantly diminishes PTSD (d = 0.414) and depression symptoms (d = 0.275). Treatment clinics have opened in countries where ibogaine is either legal or unregulated for people struggling with substance use disorders or refractory distress. Conclusions: Given the promising preliminary findings, ibogaine could potentially fill a much-needed gap in treatments for challenging conditions, including opioid dependence and combat-related symptom complexes. However, there is currently a lack of rigorous research, such as double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs, to support ibogaine’s safety and efficacy. It is imperative to develop practices that reduce patient risk and improve treatment sustainability, given high rates of ibogaine trafficking.",

      "title": "Advances in the characterization of negative affect caused by acute and protracted opioid withdrawal using animal models",
      "abstract": "Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic brain disease which originates from long-term neuroadaptations that develop after repeated opioid consumption and withdrawal episodes. These neuroadaptations lead among other things to the development of a negative affect, which includes loss of motivation for natural rewards, higher anxiety, social deficits, heightened stress reactivity, an inability to identify and describe emotions, physical and/or emotional pain, malaise, dysphoria, sleep disorders and chronic irritability. The urge for relief from this negative affect is one of major causes of relapse, and thus represents a critical challenge for treatment and relapse prevention. Animal models of negative affect induced by opioid withdrawal have recapitulated the development of a negative emotional state with signs such as anhedonia, increased anxiety responses, increased despair-like behaviour and deficits in social interaction. This research has been critical to determine neurocircuitry adaptations during chronic opioid administration or upon withdrawal. In this review, we summarize the recent literature of rodent models of (i) acute withdrawal, (ii) protracted abstinence from passive administration of opioids, (iii) withdrawal or protracted abstinence from opioid self-administration. Finally, we describe neurocircuitry involved in acute withdrawal and protracted abstinence. This article is part of the Special Issue on \"Opioid-induced changes in addiction and pain circuits\".",

      "abstract": "Objectives. Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects such as nausea and vomiting are common following opioid analgesia and represent a significant cause of patient discomfort and treatment dissatisfaction. This review examines the mechanisms that produce these side effects, their impact on treatment outcomes in chronic pain patients, and counteractive strategies. Results. A number of mechanisms by which opioids produce nausea and vomiting have been identified. These involve both central and peripheral sites including the vomiting center, chemoreceptor trigger zones, cerebral cortex, and the vestibular apparatus of the brain, as well as the GI tract itself. Nausea and vomiting have a negative impact on treatment efficacy and successful patient management because they limit the effective analgesic dosage that can be achieved and are frequently reported as the reason for discontinuation of opioid pain medication or missed doses. While various strategies such as antiemetic agents or opioid switching can be employed to control these side effects, neither option is ideal because they are not always effective and incur additional costs and inconvenience. Opioid-sparing analgesic agents may provide a further alternative to avoid nausea and vomiting due to their reduced reliance on mu-opioid signalling pathways to induce analgesia. Conclusions. Nausea and vomiting side effects limit the analgesic efficiency of current opioid therapies. There is a clear need for the development of improved opioid-based analgesics that mitigate these intolerable effects.",

      "abstract": "The etiology of seizures in the Neurosurgical/Neurological Intensive Care Unit (NICU) can be categorized as emanating from either primary brain pathology, at either macro- or microscopic level, or from physiological derangements of critical care illness such as toxic or metabolic abnormalities. Particular etiologies at risk for seizures include ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke and traumatic brain injury. The use of prophylactic antiepileptic drug administration remains controversial in many situations, with most of the larger studies having used older antiepileptic drugs prophylactically. If seizures do occur, patients are typically treated with parenteral antiepileptic drugs. The duration of treatment is unknown in most situations, but it should be individualized depending on acute and monophasic injury versus chronic process. Late seizures, which occur after the first 2 weeks from the insult, have a more ominous risk for subsequent epilepsy and should be treated for extended periods of time or indefinitely. Electrolyte and glucose abnormalities and medications at high or low levels, when corrected, usually lead to seizure control. This review discusses the risk for seizures with commonly encountered types of brain injuries in the NICU and ends by examining the treatment algorithms for simple seizures and status epilepticus and the role newer antiepileptics may potentially play.",

      "title": "Evaluation and Treatment of Nausea and Vomiting in Adults.",
      "abstract": "Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms that can reduce quality of life and indicate life-threatening illness. Acute nausea and vomiting last up to 7 days. In the absence of alarm symptoms, they are typically treated symptomatically and without an extensive evaluation. Typical causes include gastroenteritis or other viral syndromes, foodborne illness, acute migraine headaches, vestibular disturbances, early pregnancy, and adverse effects of medication. Chronic nausea and vomiting last 4 weeks or longer and have a broad differential diagnosis. Causes can be gastrointestinal, infectious, metabolic, neurologic, psychiatric, or related to medications and toxins. A careful history of related factors is essential to guide the initial evaluation and narrow the differential diagnosis. These factors include associated symptoms, timing of onset and duration of symptoms, exacerbating or relieving factors, alarm symptoms, medication and substance use, relationship with recent food ingestion, and comorbidities. Nonpharmacologic management options include fluid and electrolyte replacement; small, frequent meals; and avoidance of trigger foods. Antiemetic drugs effectively reduce symptoms of acute nausea and vomiting, but chronic symptoms are often more challenging to treat. When a specific etiology is not identified, a serotonin antagonist or dopamine antagonist can be used. However, medications may also target the suspected cause of symptoms and the neurotransmitters involved in central and peripheral pathways of nausea and vomiting. Pharmacologic therapy should be used for the shortest time necessary to control symptoms.",

As a general rule, sexual activity can be resumed when the patient can walk a kilometre at a comfortable pace or climb two flights of stairs without undue breathlessness. Sexual patterns and positions used prior to the heart attack should be continued. Symptoms that occur during sexual intercourse or any other exercise should be reported to a doctor. Taking more than two alcoholic drinks or eating a large meal may hinder sexual activity. Psychological problems that interfere with sexual function can develop in patients or their partners. Anxiety and depression are the most common causes of reduced libido, impotence and frigidity. Some people abandon sex after a heart attack because they feel they have aged significantly as a result of their illness. Doctors should ask post-myocardial infarction patients about sexual activity when inquiring about other symptoms and well-being. Given support, understanding and attendance to any associated problems, most patients will recover their normal sexual function after a heart attack. (author abstract)",

Milnacipran is a norepinephrine-serotonin reuptake inhibitor that is only approved in the US for fibromyalgia. It has 3-fold increased selectivity for norepinephrine compared to serotonin. Milnacipran is well absorbed (85% bioavailability), has a half-life of 6-8 hours, and does not undergo cytochrome P450 metabolism. Milnacipran in doses of 50 mg PO BID to 100 mg PO BID has been shown to have efficacy for fibromyalgia. The most common adverse effect is nausea.",

Behavioral disorders linked to pathological inebriety can be improved by moderate doses of sedatives such as benzodiazepine, carbamate, tetrabamate or neuroleptic drugs for the most agitated states. States of anxiety generally regress with non-neuroleptic tranquilizers, and attempted suicide mainly requires close surveillance or intensive care.",

      "abstract": "Individuals suffering from mental illnesses, unfortunately, have a shorter lifespan. An increase in mortality rates is primarily due to physical illness, unhealthy lifestyle, and associated comorbidities. Antipsychotic medications, previously known as tranquilizers, antipsychotics, or neuroleptics, can alleviate or attenuate symptoms related to psychosis, delusion, and/or hallucinations and are used in the treatment of psychosis, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, or Alzheimer's disease. Within hours to days, these medications alleviate symptoms and reduce confusion in individuals with psychosis; however, the full effect may take longer than usual in some cases. Importantly, these drugs do not cure the disease, but only treat the symptoms of the disease. The treatment is adjusted to reduce any psychotic symptoms while keeping the adverse effects to a minimum level. Antipsychotics may lead to increased risk of diseases, including but not limited to, diabetes, obesity, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular, renal, or respiratory disorders. Improved dosages, polypharmacy, and age-specific treatment play an important role in limiting the comorbidities, as well as the side effects. Further research and clinical attention are required to understand the functioning of these medications. The review focuses on the use of antipsychotic medications in different diseases and their effect on mental health.",

The presentation of this condition is very nonspecific and commonly presents with a constellation of symptoms including peripheral neuropathy, stomatitis, dermatitis, confusion, depression, encephalopathy, and seizures. Over half of these patients have associated alcohol use disorder, which causes pyridoxine deficiency due to the breakdown of pyridoxal phosphate during ethanol metabolism in the liver. As an important cofactor in the synthesis of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), deficient levels of pyridoxine may lower the seizure threshold due to reduced GABA-mediated inhibition. This case details a 57-year-old male with chronic alcoholism and a history of seizures who developed episodes of myoclonic jerks, tremors, anxiety, and neuropathy whose symptoms persisted even while on anti-epileptic medication. He was found to have pyridoxine deficiency and had full resolution of symptoms shortly after the administration of vitamin B6 supplementation. Pyridoxine deficiency may lead to severe neurologic disorders such as encephalopathy and seizures. Hence, it is important to consider pyridoxine deficiency in the workup of neurologic complaints, especially in high-risk patients.",

      "title": "Recent advances in opioid prescription for chronic non-cancer pain",
      "abstract": "Abstract Chronic pain is pain that persists past the normal time of healing, and is seen as a common problem with a significant socioeconomic impact. Pharmacological management for chronic non-cancer pain also involves the prescription of opioids, with the aim of an improved quality of life for the patient. New guidelines have been published to aid prescribing clinicians improve opioid safety and patient care, and include recommendations on when to refer patients to a pain specialist. In recent years there has been a rapid increase in opioid prescription in the UK and USA, prompting further concern regarding opioid abuse and side effects. Opioid use may also result in physical dependence and tolerance. Earlier recognition and diagnosis of unwanted effects of long term opioid use is needed, such as opioid induced suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis, and opioid induced immunosuppression. Patients may themselves discontinue opioids, however, due to minor side effects. Recent advances in opioid prescription include the increasing use of transdermal preparations and extended release, oral, once daily preparations. New formulations of existing drugs have been developed, as well as a new chemical entity. Abuse deterrent formulations and delivery systems may prevent the artificial acceleration of drug delivery and reduce the potential for opioid addiction. Overdose concerns and the potential for fatal overdose may necessitate mandatory training for all clinicians who prescribe opioids. Despite the widespread use of opioids in the management of chronic non-cancer pain, significant research gaps remain. An improvement in the evidence base for its prescription is required.",

El consumo de cocaína se asocia a la presentación, transitoria o persistente, de síntomas psicóticos por su potente acción como inhibidor de la recaptación de dopamina. Se presenta un caso clínico de una paciente con TLP y psicosis inducida por cocaína que se ensaya tratamiento con cariprazina. Los criterios diagnósticos para el trastorno psicótico inducido por sustancias según DSM-V son: delirios o alucinaciones, examen físico compatible y resultados analíticos en orina positivos a tóxicos, con síntomas durante o inmediatamente después de la intoxicación o abstinencia de la sustancia psicoactiva. La cariprazina difiere de otros antipsicóticos por su actividad agonista parcial y su mayor afinidad por los receptores D3. Este perfil exclusivo parece tener consecuencias beneficiosas sobre los síntomas negativos, la disforia y el deterioro cognitivo. Estudios realizados apuntan a que la cariprazina reduciría el efecto gratificante de la cocaína sobre el sistema de recompensa y reduciría la necesidad de su consumo. Material y métodos: Descripción de un caso clínico y revisión de la literatura. Resultados y conclusiones: Se presenta el caso clínico de una mujer con antecedente de trastorno límite de la personalidad y trastorno por uso de sustancias (cannabis y cocaína) que consulta por síntomas psicóticos en contexto de consumo de cocaína. Se realiza tratamiento ambulatorio inicialmente con olanzapina y diazepam, siendo su evolución parcialmente favorable, presentando hiperfagia y aumento de peso, por lo que se cambia a cariprazina, mejorando la hiperorexia, el craving a cocaína y manteniéndose abstinente y en remisión de la clínica psicótica. Cariprazina se presenta como una opción para el tratamiento de la psicosis aguda por cocaína y mantenimiento de la abstinencia.",

Neuroimaging is indicated only with abnormal neurologic features, systemic symptoms, an abrupt change in pattern, or with chronic daily headaches. With recurrent headaches the 1st step in management is promoting healthy lifestyle habits—nutrition, sleep, exercise, hydration, etc. With migraine, DON’T WAIT—medication works best the earlier it is given. Ibuprofen is the initial treatment of choice. If needed, triptans are safe and can be effective.",

Medicine, psychiatry belongs to that part of the alcohol abuse which has the characteristics of the disease, the disease of addiction. Suppresses the craving for alcohol and changed all mental functions, emotions, morality, accountability, value systems and encourages those traits that serve the satisfaction of desire - manipulative, passivity, impatience, recklessness, self-centeredness, hedonism.Dependence means the state of periodic or chronic intoxication with alcohol and is characterized by: a strong desire and need for acquiring and consuming alcohol, the tendency of increasing amounts of alcohol taken, physical and psychological dependence, adverse health consequences and distortions in social and professional functioning.There are several different divisions of alcoholics, today in most of our institutions and the distribution of benefits by the way alcoholics drinking on periodic and continuous (daily), which is easier and more convenient to use. In order to evaluate whether social status affect the way drinking alcohol, we investigated the medical social characteristics and differences between alcoholics with periodic and continuous drinking.The results of our study indicate that alcoholics consume alcohol periodically are mostly unmarried, living with friends more frequently in rural areas, are employed and have children. Family history is burdened by their addiction to alcohol and often come not treatment to avoid legal sanctions. Alcoholics with continuous drinking more frequently as a result of the facts of alcoholism are alcoholic polinuropatiju, in most cases, are divorced, live alone and have no children. They grew up with a father or both parents, in these alcoholics no existence, depending on the family or the father has, have trouble with the law as well as injuries in a drunken state. The higher percentage have komoriditet with depressive disorders.",

Alternatively, where there is a slight physical anomaly, then the person's concern is markedly excessive. The preoccupation is associated with many time consuming rituals such as mirror gazing or constant comparing. BDD patients have a distorted body image, which may be associated with bullying or abuse during childhood or adolescence. Such patients have a poor quality of life, are socially isolated, depressed, and at high risk of committing suicide. They often have needless dermatological treatment and cosmetic surgery. The condition is easily trivialised and stigmatised. There is evidence for the benefit of cognitive behaviour therapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in high doses for at least 12 weeks, as in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. There is no evidence of any benefit of antipsychotic drugs or other forms of psychotherapy.",

      "title": "Management of opioid poisoning",
      "abstract": "Abstract Opioids are ‘morphine like’ substances that have actions at specific opioid receptors (especially µ receptors) in the central nervous system (CNS). Tolerance of respiratory depression develops at a slower rate than analgesic tolerance, placing patients with a long history of opioid use at particular risk for respiratory depression. If chronic users abruptly stop taking opioids, they develop an acute withdrawal syndrome. Most opioid toxicity is the result of inadvertent overdosage during recreational use or in self-harm, but it can also be due to medication misuse and drug errors. It is characterized by three main clinical features (all may not be consistently present); depressed respiratory rate (the sine qua non of opioid poisoning) and respiratory volume, and reduced arterial oxygen desaturation, CNS depression, and small or pin-point pupils. Opioid-poisoned patients require early clinical assessment, appropriate administration of intravenous naloxone (competitive opioid antagonist) and meticulous respiratory supportive care, with close observation. Because of the longer half-life of opioids than naloxone, repeated doses may be needed for long-acting opioids or large doses of shorter acting opioids. If opioid antagonists are given to regular opioid users in excess, they can precipitate acute withdrawal symptoms. The need for ITU admission usually occurs as a result of a complication of the opioid toxicity.",

      "abstract": "The main criteria for the diagnosis of delirium are a change in cognitive function with rapid onset of symptoms and/or fluctuating sensorium, impairment of attention and development of perceptual disturbance. Disorientation to time and place, and disturbance of the sleep–wake cycle are also common features (American Psychiatric Association 1994). The clinical picture in a developing delirium is often characterised by new onset: • social withdrawal • restlessness • anxiety (or an increase in anxiety) • irritability • insomnia • nightmares (Jacobson & Leuchter 1996) There is a lack of consensus about the factors that are likely to precipitate a delirium. The most significant risk factors for Levkoff et al (1992) are ageing, dementia, sensory impairment, ill-health and being in institutional care. However, the use of physical restraints, malnutrition, more than three medications, presence of an indwelling bladder catheter, and ‘any iatrogenic event’ were identified by Inouye and Charpentier (1996). They also propose sleep deprivation, sensory impairment, existing cognitive impairment, poor hydration and nutritional status and immobility as risk factors (Inouye & Charpentier 1996). Some of the risk factors identified clinically are: • large number of medications • drug and alcohol use / misuse or withdrawal • dehydration and poor nutrition • hepatic or renal dysfunction • electrolyte disturbance • sensory impairment • sleep deprivation • existing cognitive impairment / brain damage • pain • respiratory / cardiovascular disease • infection • immobility Stephen Harding MMHN CCMH CertPsych CredMHN RN, Lecturer, School of Nursing and Midwifery, University of South Australia Email: sharding@netspace.net.au Continuing Professional Development Managing delirium in older people",

The classic form, primary delusional infestation, develops without any known cause or underling illness and meets criteria for a persistent delusional disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision)) or delusional disorder somatic type (DSM-5 ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fifth edition)). Approximately 60% of patients, however, have secondary forms of delusional infestation2 that occur in the context of substance misuse (such as cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis), dopaminergic medications, antibiotics, or during physical or psychiatric illnesses (such as delirium, dementia, depression, schizophrenia, stroke, and other medical conditions that affect the brain or cause pruritus).1 2\n\nThe neurobiology of delusional infestation is not fully understood.

There are majorly three different categories; the retarded, excited and malignant types. The latter is the most severe due to the associated autonomic instability. Much is unknown about the pathophysiology, but dysfunction of cortico-cortical modulation and a \"top-down modulation\" of the basal ganglia resulting from a deficiency of GABA in the cerebral cortex, resulting in motor dysfunction and glutamate hyperactivity and dopamine hypoactivity at the D2 receptor have been proposed. Benzodiazepines, especially Lorazepam, are reportedly effective, but reports of other benzodiazepines, Zopiclone and trials of mood stabilisers are documented. Electroconvulsive therapy is the suggested next line of action in case benzodiazepine fail, while the use of antipsychotic in catatonia is inconclusive.

      "abstract": "Approximately one-half of patients with alcohol use disorder who abruptly stop or reduce their alcohol use will develop signs or symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The syndrome is due to overactivity of the central and autonomic nervous systems, leading to tremors, insomnia, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, anxiety, and agitation. If untreated or inadequately treated, withdrawal can progress to generalized tonic-clonic seizures, delirium tremens, and death. The three-question Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption and the Single Alcohol Screening Question instrument have the best accuracy for assessing unhealthy alcohol use in adults 18 years and older. Two commonly used tools to assess withdrawal symptoms are the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale, Revised, and the Short Alcohol Withdrawal Scale. Patients with mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms without additional risk factors for developing severe or complicated withdrawal should be treated as outpatients when possible. Ambulatory withdrawal treatment should include supportive care and pharmacotherapy as appropriate. Mild symptoms can be treated with carbamazepine or gabapentin. Benzodiazepines are first-line therapy for moderate to severe symptoms, with carbamazepine and gabapentin as potential adjunctive or alternative therapies. Physicians should monitor outpatients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome daily for up to five days after their last drink to verify symptom improvement and to evaluate the need for additional treatment. Primary care physicians should offer to initiate long-term treatment for alcohol use disorder, including pharmacotherapy, in addition to withdrawal management.",

La experiencia clinica muestra situaciones concretas donde es probable que exista una cierta confusion de terminos. Asi, se pueden entender de manera erronea como sedacion paliativa los casos de tratamiento sintomatico del delirium hiperactivo en la etapa de ultimos dias (una situacion que se presenta a menudo como la primera causa de sedacion en agonia) o aquellos en que se lleva a cabo un aumento progresivo de la medicacion paliativa, que con frecuencia puede tener un efecto sedante, paralelo a la mayor intensidad de los sintomas en enfermos con un deterioro severo debido a la progresion de la enfermedad. En ambos casos se emplean farmacos con efecto sedante para aliviar las complicaciones clinicas y el sufrimiento en un enfermo que tiene la muerte cercana pero las circunstancias del enfermo, el objetivo de estos tratamientos y el modo en que se emplean no coinciden con la definicion de sedacion paliativa. EnglishPalliative sedation in defined as the deliberate reduction in the level of consciousness of the patient by administering the appropriate drugs in order to avoid intense suffering caused by one or more refractory symptoms; sedation in the patient who is in his last days or hours of life is assumed to be continuous and as deep as needed. Clinical experience shows specific situations where it is likely that there is some confusion of terms. We could erroneously understand as palliative sedation the cases of symptomatic treatment of hyperactive delirium in a patient in its last days (a situation that sometimes is presented as the first cause of palliative sedation) or those in which it is carried out a progressive increase in the palliative treatment that often have a sedative effect, parallel to the increased severity of symptoms because of disease progression in severe ill patients. In both scenarios, sedating drugs are used to relieve end-of-life clinical complications and suffering but the circumstances of the patient, the goal of these treatments, and the way they are used do not match the definition of sedation.",

A key question is whether this has long term consequences. Cognitive problems are commonly reported in patients 3 months after acute infection as part of the so called Long-Covid syndrome. However, the underlying cause is not well understood. Candidate explanations include legacy from encephalitis and stroke; however, other complications such as the sequelae, delirium, remain underexplored. Furthermore, little consideration has been given to functional cognitive disorders and the cognitive consequences of depression, anxiety and fatigue. Aims We propose a structured approach to clinical assessment for clinicians reviewing late cognitive complaints after COVID 19. Methods We created our own unique framework for neurocognitive Covid assessment based upon a review of the literature. Results Covid status- Any positive test. If not review of core symptoms such as breathlessness, headache, anosmia, nasal obstruction, cough, myalgia, or gustatory dysfunction; duration, extent of exposure to Covid confirmed cases.

      "title": "Aims of sedation/analgesia.",
      "abstract": "The concept of analgo-sedation in intensive care medicine has changed considerably since the last decades. Deep sedation, keeping patients artificially unconscious, is not necessary anymore, it postpones weaning from mechanical ventilation, it provokes complications, and prolongs the length of ICU stay. On the other hand, recent surveys have shown that patients recall their intensive care experience still as stressing and painful. This need more awareness of patient's pain and the readiness to give analgesics particularly before painful procedures. The frightening environment of the ICU, sleep deprivation, pain and discomfort related not only to the actual dysfunctions, but even more to the stressing procedures of care and treatment, make a certain level of sedation necessary. But patients' discomfort may also originate from many other reasons, such as hypoxaemia, hypotension, cardiac failure, drugs overdose or withdrawal, or simply from an uncomfortable body position. These sometimes non-obvious reasons have to be carefully looked for in order to treat the problem effectively. Delirium and other mental problems are common in critically ill patients. They have to be diagnosed with particular attention and treated specifically. Sedatives must be carefully adapted to the individual needs and the actual situation. Modern modes of mechanical ventilation allows lower levels of sedation. Regularly repeated assessment of the sedation level (e.g. by Ramsay score) is mandatory; a sedation protocol seems advantageous. To avoid inadvertent accumulation and overdose, it is recommended to keep the patient at a sedation level at which communication is still possible. A daily interruption of the sedation has shown to shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of ICU stay.",

      "title": "The Role of Lofexidine in Management of Opioid Withdrawal",
      "abstract": "Fear of withdrawal symptoms has been cited by survey respondents as the main reason that they continued to use opioids. Lofexidine is an α2-adrenergic agonist that decreases the sympathetic outflow that results in the characteristic symptoms of opioid withdrawal. A structural analog of clonidine, lofexidine has a higher affinity and specificity for the α2a receptors and does not reinforce opioid dependence. Withdrawal symptoms correlate approximately to the half-life of the opioid; patient factors such as age, duration of opioid exposure, physical status, and other considerations may influence the nature and duration of withdrawal symptoms. For patients with opioid use disorder and psychiatric comorbidities, withdrawal may be destabilizing and may exacerbate mental health status. Lofexidine has been shown in clinical trials to be safe and effective in helping to manage the symptoms of withdrawal and has been recommended in guidelines for this purpose. Adverse events associated with lofexidine include QT prolongation, hypotension, orthostasis, and bradycardia. The maximum course of treatment is 14 days, and doses should be titrated, with the recommended maximum dose to coincide with the most severe withdrawal symptoms (about 5-7 days after opioid discontinuation).",

In the paper, a report of three cases regarding patients with anxiety disorders who have experienced very severe anxiety episodes is presented. In two cases, the therapy was continued or an antidepressant was administered. A thorough history of the episode circumstances and anxiety-related thoughts revealed a psychological background of exacerbation or occurrence of the anxiety disorder. Alprazolam sublingual tablets were administered in order to achieve rapid reduction in the severity of the condition and to restore the patients’ ability to control their emotional states and activities. A combination of alprazolam sublingual tablets and the intervention based on the understanding of the intrapsychic meaning of the circumstances that caused the symptoms was found to be an effective method of severe anxiety symptom relief.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Although diseases similar to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) have been recognized for centuries under various rubrics, strict diagnostic criteria for conditions dominated by medically unexplained chronic fatigue were first proposed in 1988. Current diagnostic criteria were originally crafted in 1994 by an International Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Study Group as an attempt to standardize patient populations included in research studies. The International CFS Research Case Definition requires chronic fatigue of at least six‐months duration; this fatigue cannot be substantially alleviated by rest, is not the result of ongoing exertion, and is associated with substantial reductions in occupational, social, and personal activities. In addition, at least four out of the following eight symptoms must occur with fatigue in a six‐month period: prolonged extraordinary postexertional fatigue, impaired memory or concentration, unrefreshing sleep, aching or stiff muscles, multijoint pain, sore throat, tender glands, and new headaches (Fukuda et al., 1994). Importantly, the research case definition precludes classification as CFS if a patient has an identifiable medical cause of being fatigued. Similarly, individuals with certain psychiatric conditions cannot be classified as CFS in research studies. Exclusionary psychiatric conditions include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and melancholic major depression. Notably, comorbidity with psychiatric disorders is relatively high. Recent data indicate that almost 60% of CFS cases in the population suffer from at least one comorbid psychiatric condition, with affective disorders being the most prevalent ones.",

      "abstract": "L’insomni es un trastorn caracteritzat per la insatisfaccio en la qualitat i/o quantitat del son, que persisteix durant un considerable periode de temps. Es un son no reparador, amb consequencies diurnes com la fatiga, la irritabilitat o la disminucio de l’alerta, que afecta tant la vida social com laboral de l’individu. Dels diferents trastorns primaris del son, l’etiologia dels quals no es deguda a una malaltia mental, medica o a cap substancia, l’insomni primari te una prevalenca mitjana a la poblacio del 30%. Historicament el tractament farmacologic de l’insomni ha tingut com a principal diana el receptor GABA(A). L’evolucio dels hipnotics que actuen sobre aquest receptor, ha aportat una millora en la seva eficacia i seguretat. Tot i aixi, encara tenen efectes no desitjats com l’insomni de rebot, la dependencia, l’amnesia anterograda o la tolerancia. El nostre objectiu es trobar un candidat que millori els inconvenients dels hipnotics actuals. Seguint una estrategia de cribratge, seleccionar un compost amb: 1) major selectivitat in vitro per la subunitat ?1 del receptor GABA(A), implicada en el son, 2) activitat hipnotica in vivo que no alteri l’arquitectura del son i 3) una absorcio oral rapida i vida mitjana adequada. Dels 1214 compostos que es van cribrar en total, dos van presentar una elevada selectivitat in vitro per la subunitat alfa-1 del receptor GABA(A) major que la del zolpidem, el farmac de referencia mes selectiu que hi ha actualment al mercat. Aquesta selectivitat in vitro dels compostos, es correlaciona amb la selectivitat in vivo, de manera que els compostos mes selectius per la subunitat alfa-1 in vitro, son tambe els que indueixen sedacio in vivo sense efectes no desitjats com la relaxacio muscular associada a la subunitat alfa-2 del receptor GABA(A) Pero l’efecte in vivo no depen nomes de l’afinitat del compost pel receptor, sino tambe del nombre de receptors que el compost ocupa al teixit diana i de la seva eficacia intrinseca per activar-los i generar una resposta biologica. L’ocupacio de receptors s’ha analitzat en estudis ex-vivo i s’ha relacionat amb l’efecte observat en els assaigs de comportament in vivo. Quan es determina l’ocupacio ex-vivo del receptor GABA(A) per part dels compostos en determinades arees del cervell, on predomina una determinada subunitat del receptor, els compostos amb mes afinitat per la subunitat alfa-1 que indueixen sedacio a dosi mes baixa, tambe son els que per norma general requereixen menys dosi per assolir el 50% d’ocupacio ex-vivo dels receptors a cerebel (on predomina la subunitat alfa-1 implicada en sedacio). En el mateix sentit, els compostos menys afins per alfa-2 que requereixen una dosi mes alta per induir relaxacio muscular, son tambe els que per norma general assoleixen el 50% d’ocupacio ex-vivo a medul•la (on predomina la subunitat alfa-2) a una dosi mes gran. Les dades d’ocupacio ex-vivo a cerebel corroboren l’afinitat dels compostos in vitro per la subunitat alfa-1 del receptor GABA(A). En base als resultats presentats en la present Tesi Doctoral, es conclou que s’ha generat i seleccionat un candidat que podria millorar els inconvenients dels hipnotics actuals en els estudis preclinics.",

      "title": "Reexamining opioid addiction as a co-occurring disorder: A clinical perspective on the “Chronic Pain Paradox”",
      "abstract": "The use of opioids as an anodyne for chronic pain was not prevalent before the 1980s1. Students in medical schools had learnt to avoid prescribing opioids, considered highly addictive for treatment of non-malignant chronic pain1. Yet, from the early 1990s, prescription opioids emerged as a widely accepted method of treating chronic pain and palliative care2. Previously, chronic pain was treated in multidisciplinary clinics with coordinated care which included physical exams, medication management, biopsychosocial evaluation, cognitive behavioral treatment, physical therapy, and occupational therapy2. Starting in the early 1990’s, under dubious antecedence, opioid analgesics were promoted as the proprietary remedy for chronic pain and received endorsement and support from care providers across the United States3. Non-cancerous chronic pain, as a phenomenon, was thus elevated to an ailment or a medical condition by its own right from its erstwhile status as a corollary to another medical condition. This led to an increase in opioid analgesic prescriptions, followed by a wide-ranging abuse by patients, converting opioid use disorder (OUD) to a problem of epidemic proportions4. Apart from the legal course of action initiated against Perdue Pharma, in 2020, the maker and distributor of Oxycontin that resulted in a $3.8 billion lawsuit settlement, in which Perdue Pharma pleaded guilty; since the recognition of this problem, new measures have been adopted to counter the opioid epidemic by clinicians. There has been a significant shift towards circumvention by physicians prescribing opioids for non-cancerous chronic pain. In a few instances, providers have resorted to putting a temporary moratorium on prescribing opioids to all non-cancerous chronic pain cases5. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) and various state agencies have passed protocols, installed prescription monitoring programs (PMPs), and created taskforces to rein in flagrant prescription practices by medical providers. Mental health counseling and alternative, non-prescriptive pain management procedures have been reintroduced in treatment as a new way of approaching the problem6,7. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA) have suggested hybrid programs such as medically assisted treatment (MAT) which utilizes the medical approach of prescribing slow releasing drugs with concomitant counseling for patients, as one of the best practices to intervene with opioid use disorders8. An integrated healthcare approach brought primary care physicians, nurses, and physician’s assistants together with addiction counselors and social workers to coordinate and implement treatment for opioid misuse9,10. These new approaches are laudable and effective, yet we argue, in this paper, for ascertaining the treatment of chronic pain as a co-occurring disorder to addiction. While acknowledging the two original transgressions of the opioid epidemic: a) the delineation and decontextualization of chronic pain as an independent medical phenomenon, and b) the over-prescription of opioid analgesics to treat chronic pain; we argue that recognizing chronic pain as a co-occurring disorder with addiction and psychological trauma could help providers contextualize it better, leading to an improved treatment protocol. Over last two decades, persistent over-prescribing has set forth a culture of righteous demand among patients to obtain opioids and receive instant pharmacological sedation as an antidote to chronic pain. This culture, which may have taken roots, could cause resistance among chronic pain patients towards any change to alternative treatment plans. This could frustrate medical providers and reformers as they usher in the new treatment procedures promulgated by SAMHSA and the CDC. Thus, a co-occurring diagnostic framework could provide a pathway to better understand this treatment dilemma. The co-occurring disorder lens of diagnosis could provide a pathway to understand this treatment dilemma. In this paper, we do a critical, non-systematic review of existing literature that explores the intersection of chronic pain and OUD to make a case that these issues should be treated as co-occurring disorders and not as disconnected, independent phenomenon. We review the scope of the problem and provide an analysis of the complex relationship between chronic pain and usage of opioids from both pharmacological and psychological viewpoints and explore the challenges to treatment. We take an ecological and exchange theory perspective to understand the co-occurrence of pain and opioids addiction from a trauma-informed lens to unpack the complexity that OUD poses in juxtaposition to chronic pain. Furthermore, we explore the strategies to develop an integrated healthcare workforce from a co-occurring disorder perspective. Furthermore, we explain the context of co-occurring pain, addiction, and psychological trauma and identify the pertinent questions that such co-occurrences pose for treatment protocols. We draw our argument from a critical review of the literature as well as the incidence and prevalence of OUD.",

      "title": "Recent developments in the pharmacological treatment of Parkinson’s disease",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The decline of dopamine leads to motor dysfunctions manifested as tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia. The pharmacological treatment of choice for the past 30 years has primarily been the dopamine precursor levodopa. Although it is the most effective treatment available, it is clear that other drugs are needed in order to sustain a therapeutic benefit and to alleviate fluctuations in mobility (i.e., motor fluctuations). Furthermore, there is some evidence that levodopa may hasten the occurrence of motor fluctuations and involuntary movements called dyskinesias. Hence, many clinicians delay the use of levodopa and employ the use of other symptomatic treatments including monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitors and dopamine agonists as first-line therapy in de novo patients. Regardless of treatment, the disease continues to progress as there is still no obvious means of altering disease progression (i.e., no neuroprotective therapy), to restore loss of dopamine (i.e., no restorative therapy) or prevent the disease (i.e. preventative therapy). With disease progression, polypharmacy is common and often employs a combination of antiparkinsonian agents. There have been some key advances in treatment with the advent of MAO-B inhibitors, dopamine agonists and catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors; however, the arsenal of drug treatment remains limited. As the mechanism of PD is further elucidated, novel drug treatments will continue to emerge in the areas of preventative, restorative or symptomatic therapy. Despite the purpose of treatment, the ideal pharmacological drug for PD will include the presence of a safe side-effect profile, a simple dosing schedule, the ability to provide symptomatic relief and the potential to alter disease progression. The purpose of this article is to examine upcoming antiparkinsonian drugs in clinical trials based on their pharmacology, safety and efficacy.",

En pacientes con perfiles determinados pueden existir riesgos especificos -mayor riesgo de alteracion cognitiva en pacientes de mas de 69 anos o con alteracion cognitiva precirugia; mayor riesgo de depresion, mania o suicidio en pacientes con patologia psiquiatrica previa-. Conclusiones. Es necesario valorar el riesgo-beneficio individualmente para obtener resultados optimos con este tratamiento. Se requieren estudios multicentricos que permitan esclarecer el papel de la ECP sobre los SNM.",

      "abstract": "Es wird über eine 37-jährige Patientin mit Anorexia nervosa berichtet, die seit vielen Jahren für mehrere Tage bis Wochen hungerte, um ihr Körpergewicht zu senken und eine euphorisierende Wirkung zu erzielen. Im Verlauf der letzten vier Jahre entwickelte sich bei der Patientin jeweils unmittelbar nach einer einwöchigen Hungerperiode eine akute paranoid-halluzinatorische Psychose, die 3-mal stationär behandelt werden musste. Psychotische Prodromalsymptome waren vor und zu Beginn der Hungerzeit nicht eruierbar, so dass ein kausaler Zusammenhang zwischen dem Hungern und der psychotischen Dekompensation gesehen werden kann. Anhand dieser Kasuistik wird die Hypothese diskutiert, dass während des Hungerns im Rahmen der Anorexia nervosa temporär eine Hyperaktivität des dopaminergen Systems entstehen könnte und dadurch der Übergang in eine paranoid-halluzinatorische Psychose erklärbar wäre. Der Fall zeigt, dass bei vulnerablen Patienten mit einer ähnlichen Anamnese von einer Hungerkur oder anderen eingreifenden Diätmaßnahmen dringend abgeraten werden muss. Der Hinweis auf das erhöhte Psychoserisiko könnte so einen therapeutischen Nutzen für die Behandlung der Anorexia nervosa bei solchen Patienten haben.",

Drug abuse is associated with many medical problems and complications stemming both from regular use and from overdoses. Another serious medical complication arising from drug abuse is the withdrawal syndrome, which manifests during abstinence from the drug. Stimulant drugs are a diverse group of chemicals that act primarily through activation of the sympathetic nervous system. They are sometimes referred to as sympathomimetics. In small to moderate doses, they result in an elevated mood, increased energy and alertness, and decreased appetite. During intoxication, they have profound CNS, cardiovascular system, and metabolic effects. In moderate doses, cocaine produces arousal and euphoria but also anxiety and restlessness. Acute intoxication may result in severe psychiatric disturbances, such as acute anxiety, panic attacks, delirium, or acute psychosis.",

      "title": "RELAPSE: Answers to Why a Patient Is Having a New Mood Episode",
      "abstract": "A mood disorder is a chronic illness, associated with episodic recurrence over time (1,2); when a patient experiences a new mood episode, explore possible underlying causes of that recurrence. The mnemonic RELAPSE can help you take an informed approach to treatment, instead of making reflexive medication changes (Table, page 54). [R]hythm disturbances. Seasonal changes, shift work, jet lag, and sleep irregularity can induce a mood episode in a vulnerable patient. Failure of a patient's circadian clock to resynchronize itself after such disruption in the dark-light cycle can trigger mood symptoms. [E]nding treatment. Intentional or unintentional non-adherence to a prescribed medication or psychotherapy can trigger a mood episode. Likewise, switching from a brand-name medication to a generic equivalent can induce a new episode because the generic drug might be as much as 20% less bioavailable than the brand formulation. (3) [L]ife change. Some life events, such as divorce or job loss, can be sufficiently overwhelming--despite medical therapy and psychotherapy--to induce a new episode in a vulnerable patient. [A]dditional drugs. Opiates, interferon, steroids, reserpine, and other drugs can be depressogenic; on the other hand, steroids, anticholinergic agents, and antidepressants can induce mania. If another physician, or the patient, adds a medication or supplement that causes an interaction with the patient's current psychotropic prescription, the result might be increased metabolism or clearance of the psychotropic--thus decreasing its efficacy and leading to a new mood episode. [P]hysical health changes. Neurologic conditions (epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, stroke), autoimmune illnesses (eg, lupus), primary sleep disorders (eg, obstructive sleep apnea), and hormone changes (eg, testosterone, estrogen, and thyroid) that can occur over the lifespan of a patient with a mood disorder can trigger a new episode. [S]ubstance use and withdrawal. Chronic use of alcohol and opiates and withdrawal from cocaine and stimulants in a patient with a mood disorder can induce a depressive episode; use of cocaine, stimulants, and caffeine can induce a manic state. [E]nd of drug response. Some patients experience a loss of drug response over time (tachyphylaxis) or a depressive recurrence while taking an antidepressant.

One of the most frequent late complications in levodopa therapy is a wearing off phenomenon. We present a patient treated for Parkinson's disease in whom during the period of levodopa wearing off we observed a paroxysmal abdominalgia apart from other features of a typical movement disorders like: increasing rigidity, gait disturbances and tremor. Abdominalgia consisted of stomach cramps, with variable localization in epi-, meso- and hypogastrium. Rectal tenesmus was also present. The patient was treated with analgesics, spasmolytics and carminative drugs with no effect. Abdominal pains regressed after an intake of the next levodopa dose. The patient presented with other features of a gastrointestinal tract autonomic system dysfunction like: chronic constipation, preterm satiety resulting in food intake reduction and a decrease in body weight. There was no organic lesions of the gastrointestinal system that could explain such disturbances. Pharmacologic treatment modification (more frequent levodopa dosage, additional dopamine agonist) resulted in some improvement.

      "title": "Designation of a new drug as a controlled substance",
      "abstract": "Opioids are widely used as painkillers and anesthetics. Though we use opioids to relieve pain, these drugs can induce mood elevation, dependency, and withdrawal symptoms. This is why opioids are controlled-substances. Most physicians think that some substances should be controlled if they have opioid-like pharmacological properties, especially a long duration, preservation of respiration, and dependency. It is noteworthy that short-acting substances, such as midazolam and thiopental, are included in controlled substances. Their abuse is very dangerous because they frequently induce severe respiratory depression due to a narrow therapeutic window. Teaching point of this article is that designation of a new drug as a controlled substance requires scientific evidence of its link to dependency and/or withdrawal symptoms. However, this does not require abusers' convenience (long duration) or safety (maintenance of respiration). The authors present the addiction and abuse patterns of propofol as an reasons for the Korean Food and Drug Administration to designate propofol as a controlled substance. As a future study, an animal and/or a clinical model for dependency is needed to identify addictive substances. Though several neurotransmitters and their loci in the central nervous system have been studied, the precise mechanism for addiction is unknown. Also, it should be recognized that the potential for drug addiction and abuse could be masked in the early marketing period of a new drug. Physicians should monitor patients' responses carefully when they deal with the drug.",

      "abstract": "The Neurobiology of Opioid Dependence: Implications for Treatment W W hile the individual patient, rather than his or her disease, is the appro- priate focus of treatment for opioid abuse, an understanding of the neurobiology of dependence and addiction can be invaluable to the clinician.It can provide insight about patient behaviors and problems, help define realistic expectations, and clarify the rationales for treatment methods and goals.As well, patients who are informed about the brain origins of addiction can benefit from understanding that their illness has a biological basis and does not mean they are \"bad\" people.Brain abnormalities resulting from chronic use of heroin, oxycodone, and other morphine-derived drugs are underlying causes of opioid dependence (the need to keep taking drugs to avoid a withdrawal syndrome) and addiction (intense drug craving and compulsive use).The abnormalities that produce dependence, well understood by science, appear to resolve after detoxification, within days or weeks after opioid use stops.The abnormalities that produce addiction, however, are more wide-ranging, complex, and long-lasting.They may involve an interaction of environmental effects-for example, stress, the social context of initial opiate use, and psychological conditioning-and a genetic predisposition in the form of brain pathways that were abnormal even before the first dose of opioid was taken.Such abnormalities can produce craving that leads to relapse months or years after the individual is no longer opioid dependent.In this article we describe how opioids affect brain processes to produce drug liking, tolerance, dependence, and addiction.While these processes, like everything else that happens in the brain, are highly complex, we try to explain them in terms that can be easily understood and explained to patients.We also discuss Opioid tolerance, dependence, and addiction are all manifestations of brain changes resulting from chronic opioid abuse.The opioid abuser's struggle for recovery is in great part a struggle to overcome the effects of these changes.Medications such as methadone, LAAM, buprenorphine, and naltrexone act on the same brain structures and processes as addictive opioids, but with protective or normalizing effects.Despite the effectiveness of medications, they must be used in conjunction with appropriate psychosocial treatments.",

Effective treatment always depends on making as precise a diagnosis as possible (e.g. pharmacological management of nausea and vomiting is guided by the presumed mechanism).

Serious adverse effects are likely to occur only after abrupt discontinuation of benzodiazepine drugs, and they should almost always be tapered.

It is a new concept that has been the focus of recent basic and therapeutic work, and is defined as “SE that continues or recurs 24 hours or more after the onset of anesthesia, including those cases in which SE recurs on the reduction or withdrawl of anesthesia.” It is encountered typically, but not exclusively, in two quite distinctive clinical situations: (1) in patients with severe acute brain injury, and (2) in patients with no history of epilepsy in whom status epilepticus develops out of the blue with no overt cause. There are a variety of treatments used, almost entirely based on open observational studies or case reports. Therapy includes anesthesia, antiepileptic drug therapy, hypothermia and ICU therapy, other medical, immunological, and physical therapies. In this review, the range of possible therapies is outlined and an approach to therapy is discussed.",

According to DSM‐5 , a diagnosis of pica requires symptoms to occur, at minimum, for a 1‐month period. Pica behaviors are inappropriate to the individual's developmental level and not part of a social or cultural practice. When the symptoms occur within the course of another mental disorder or medical condition, a diagnosis of pica is made only if the eating behaviors require clinical attention or significantly interrupt social functioning. Pica can be dangerous, depending on the amounts and types of substances consumed and the degree of nutritional deficiency that may be present. Although pica is an old illness, little is known about its prevalence and course because it has not been formally studied in high‐risk populations, and treatment is difficult to assess.",

      "title": "NARRATIVE REVIEW A quick and comprehensive guide to differential diagnosis of neck and back pain: a narrative review",
      "abstract": "The list of possible differential diagnoses for complaints of back and neck pain is enormously long. Many proposed diagnostic workups trying to avoid the challenge of considering all possible etiologies by early commitment to a specific area of the spine (i.e., neck or lower back). Others limit the differential diagnoses by pursuing a rational but limited goal, like ruling out conditions that may result in disability or death in the setting of an emergency department. We have briefly described a long list of medical conditions, each of which may present as back or neck pain, and whose prevalence ranges from common to very rare. We then showed that they all can be assigned to one of 7 groups according to judicious history taking, physical examination and simple imaging and laboratory tests: (1) pain that radiates from the cranium, chest or abdomen; (2) pain with signs of infection; (3) pain with signs of nerve root compression; (4) pain with signs of cord or cauda compression; (5) mechanical pain; (6) rheumatic pain; (7) pain with other characteristics, with or without local tenderness. Further referral to diagnostic tests and specialist consultations after initial assignment to one of these seven categories would save the patient time and unnecessary tests. We believe that this review and the proposed diagnostic algorithm may be valuable for medical education and for application in the primary care setting for the purpose of conducting a diagnostic workup of any type of back or neck pain in all patient groups and may be possibly used for development of diagnostic software and machine learning.",

Report of a Case.— A 42-year-old woman was being treated for at least three years with a steady dose of 600 mg of propoxyphene napsylate (Darvon-N) daily in divided doses for chronic low back pain, and with 75 mg of amitriptyline at bedtime for a chronic depressive neurosis. During the last six months she began to complain of extreme fatigue, low endurance, loss of energy, severe muscle pains, and weakness in her legs and arms, and she had difficulty climbing",

      "abstract": "Although nitrate therapy, used in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders, is frequently associated with side-effects, mainly headaches, the summaries of product characteristics of nitrate-containing medicines do not report detailed description of headaches and even do not highlight the possibility of nitrate-induced migraine. Two different types of nitrate-induced headaches have been described: (i) immediate headaches that develop within the first hour of the application, are mild or medium severity without characteristic symptoms for migraine, and ease spontaneously; and (ii) delayed, moderate or severe migraine-type headaches (occurring mainly in subjects with personal or family history of migraine), that develop 3-6 h after the intake of nitrates, with debilitating, long-lasting symptoms including nausea, vomiting, photo- and/or phono-phobia. These two types of headaches are remarkably different, not only in their timing and symptoms, but also in the persons who are at risk. Recent studies provide evidence that the two headache types are caused by different mechanisms: immediate headaches are connected to vasodilation caused by nitric oxide (NO) release, while migraines are triggered by other actions such as the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide or glutamate, or changes in ion channel function mediated by cyclic guanosine monophosphate or S-nitrosylation. Migraines usually need anti-attack medication, such as triptans, but these drugs are contraindicated in most medical conditions that are treated using nitrates. In conclusion, these data recommend the correction of summaries of nitrate product characteristics, and also suggest a need to develop new types of anti-migraine drugs, effective in migraine attacks, that could be used in patients with risk for angina pectoris.",

This predisposition to affective episodes, rather than the episodes themselves (which can have many causes), is arguably the hallmark of bipolar disorder. Most episodes of bipolar disorder, including the first episode, are depressive. This exposes an inherent flaw in our nosological system, which requires a manic or hypomanic episode for diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Treatment of a depressive episode in undiagnosed bipolar disorder can entail the use of medications that were developed to treat a different disorder (major depressive illness) and that may have mood-destabilizing or activating properties.",

      "abstract": "To review current knowledge on blood pressure variability.Blood pressure variability has a time-course ranging from a few seconds or minutes (short-term variability) to 24 h (long-term variability) or 1 year (seasonal variations). The variability is influenced by physiological factors such as physical and mental activity (posture, exercise, talking) or behavioral and environmental factors (salt, caffeine, alcohol), and by pathological conditions. In patients with essential hypertension, the day-night pattern of blood pressure change is generally similar to that of normotensives, with a significant nocturnal blood pressure fall (dippers), except that the entire profile is shifted upwards. Nevertheless, in some essential hypertensives the nocturnal fall in blood pressure is absent or reversed (non-dippers), in spite of a decrease in the nocturnal heart rate. In several forms of secondary hypertension (pheochromocytoma, renal failure) and other clinical conditions (sleep apnea syndrome, diabetes mellitus, cardiac transplantation) the nocturnal fall in blood pressure is also absent or reversed.Blood pressure variability and the blunted nocturnal fall in blood pressure may be clinically relevant. Several studies have demonstrated that subjects whose 24-h variability was higher than the group average were more likely to have target-organ damage. Moreover, hypertensive women with a blunted nocturnal fall in blood pressure (non-dippers) are more likely to suffer morbid cardiovascular events than dippers. On theoretical grounds, therefore, antihypertensive treatment that reduces blood pressure variability and preserves the nocturnal fall in blood pressure will help to protect target organs in hypertension. So far, this has not been demonstrated in clinical trials.",

Drug addiction causes are multiple and include psychological, family, social and obviously biological factors (drug addicting potential). In to-day clinical practice, addiction to benzodiazepines or opioids prescribed for maintenance therapy and the newly described secondary addiction of later onset are predominant. Severe social consequences and many psychiatric and medical disorders in particular due to HIV infection also result from drug addiction.

      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

The pain does not worsen with routine physical activity, but may be associated with mild nausea, photophobia or phonophobia. The feeling of deontological guilt occurs in individuals who, violating moral standards of the society in which they live, wonder how they were capable of such an attitude.\r\n\r\nIn this guilt feeling brain areas that mediate disgust are stimulated as the insulas.\r\n\r\nThe proposal was to evaluate the ineffectiveness of the treatments [antidepressants, anticonvulsants, beta-blockers, NSAIDs or acetaminophen, tramadol, acetylsalicylic acid, opioids, muscle relaxants, psychotherapy, acupuncture] to which that 21 patients (15 men and 6 women) aged 40 to 52 were submitted for 2 years after stealing money from their clients motivated by revenge.

      "abstract": "A general review of psychological reactions to a disaster situation in four groups of people is presented. Adult reactions (and management thereof) vary according to the phase of the disaster, viz (i) the pre-impact phase characterized by underactivity, development of anxiety symptoms or involvement in adaptive activities; (ii) the warning phase typically manifested by overactivity; (iii) the impact phase characterized by bewilderment, confusion or hysteria; (iv) the turmoil-recoil phase manifesting in emotional expression relating to the immediate past; and (v) the emotionally wounded or post-traumatic phase featuring reconstructive activity with some elements of anger and resentment. Reactions in children are usually transitory but may be influenced by parental psychopathology, separation anxiety or previous emotional disturbances. Typical adult reactions seen in the elderly may be compounded by what has been termed a high sense of deprivation. Relief workers are exposed to psychic stress in the form of greater responsibilities and role identification and many also show delayed reactions to the death and destruction observed.",

      "abstract": "One of the reasons for the development or worsening of cognitive impairment (CI) may be the use of a number of drugs: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antiarrhythmics, antidepressants, glucocorticosteroids, antitumor drugs and a number of others. The negative effect of drugs on cognitive functions is realized due to many pathophysiological mechanisms: disruption of hormonal regulation, decreased neuronal excitability, increased activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors, decreased cerebral circulation, atrophic changes in the brain; many mechanisms have not been fully established. Risk factors for the development of drug-induced CIs are: old age or childhood, brain damage, chronic diseases, genetic factors, the patient's initial CI, polypharmacy, dose and duration of drug use, acute infectious diseases, metabolic disorders, dehydration, acute urinary retention, etc. To diagnose and differentially diagnose drug-induced CI, it is necessary to establish a connection between the start of taking a suspected drug-inducer and a decrease in cognitive functions. The first step in the treatment of drug-induced CI is the abolition of an inducer drug or a reduction in its dose, in cases where it is impossible to discontinue the drug and there is no replacement, special slow-release dosage forms can be considered. The main measures to prevent drug-induced CI include the use of drugs with the lowest risk of their development, assessment of drug interactions, and the use of modern scales to assess the risk of developing this side-effect (anticholinergic burden scale, etc.).",

      "title": "Composers - Substance Abusers",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONThe aim of this article is to emphasize and summarize pathographies of eminent composers, 77 of them, who were substance abusers. In this section we can divide them into three groups as follows: substance abusers who suffered from primary alcoholism, secondary alcoholism, and those who were alcohol and/or tobacco, drugs abusers. Most of them had different anxiety and depressive disorders (neurosis, panic disorder, cyclothymia, manic depressive disorder).1Substance abuse is the use of alcohol, tobacco and/or illegal drugs in a way that is harmful for health. Most of the composers mentioned in this article were alcohol abusers. Alcoholism is a syndrome of physical dependence on alcohol, whose sudden deprivation may cause withdrawal symptoms - tremor, anxiety, hallucinations and delusions (delirium tremens). Alcoholism impairs intellectual functions, physical skills, memory, judgment and social skills, such as conversation. Heavy consumption or alcohol abuse also causes following complications and diseases of different organs and systems, for example cardiovascular - cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure; nervous system - neuritis, funnicular myelosis, cerebral atrophy; gastrointestinal tract - gastropathy, ulcers, portal hypertension, acute and chronic pancreatitis, enteritis, cirrhosis of the liver etc. There are many substance abusers, but only a few of them (Dussek, Mysliveoek, Mussorgsky etc.) suffered primarily from alcoholism to such extent that their careers were interrupted and stopped because of alcohol abuse. Therefore they were unable to finish their creative work.11 In this journal we previously published pathographies of the following composers: J.C. Bach, W.F. Bach, Beethoven, Berlioz, Brahms, Debussy, Glinka, Gluck, Handel, Liszt, Mozart, Mussorgsky, Puccini, Ravel, Schonberg, Schubert, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky, Wolf.COMPOSERS AND RESULTS1. Pietro Marc Antonio Cesti(1623-1669) Italian composer and conductor who was born in Arezzo and studied with various local musicians. In 1637 he joined the Franciscan order. While he was in Volterra he turned more toward secular music, probably due to the patronage of the powerful Medici family. There he also came in contact with Salvator Rosa who wrote librettos for a number of Cesti' s cantatas. By 1650 Cesti' s calling as a monk and his success as a singer and composer of operas were coming into conflict so he was officially reprimanded. In 1652 he became a court member in Innsbruck. After holding a post somewhere in Florence as maestro di cappella, he entered the papal chapel in 1660. In 1666 he became Vice-Kapellmeister in Vienna. He was described as unstable, stubborn, quarrelsome and often seeking confrontation. He had frequent disagreements with other musicians. His frequent changes of living places were caused by his conflicting nature and connected with his alcohol abuse because of which he had problems with the society. His health was impaired because of alcohol abuse, so he died at the age of 46 in Venice as a result of complications of alcoholism, probably poisoned by his rivals in Florence.2-82. Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf(1739-1799) Austrian violinist and composer who was born in Vienna. He was a brilliant musician of great technical skills and soon became a member of the court chapels held by prince Sachsen - Hildburghausen, and later of another held by Bishop Adam Pataoic. Afterwards he was active in Breslau - Wroclaw and again in Vienna. He was a member of the royal orchestra and later a capelmeister in service of Bratislava Duke. He cooperated with J. Haydn and W.A. Mozart extensively. His musical drama »A doctor and a chemist« became very famous and was even compared to Mozart's »Figaro«. He was a master of »Singspiel«; he composed more than forty of them, and comic operas. He led a decadent life, eating and drinking excessively. He was one of the last composers living that kind of life. Later, he suffered from uric arthritis and hemorrhoids, what is more, he became almost paralyzed. …",

      "abstract": "Various reactions to benzodiazepine withdrawal have been widely described. Among these, seizures have occasionally occurred on abrupt withdrawal. Our own experience of 48 cases of seizures suspected to have been caused by benzodiazepine withdrawal and reported to the Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) Monitoring Center (1979-1985) showed that a great variety of benzodiazepines with different half-lives were involved, those most frequently implicated being the most widely prescribed. The occurrence of seizures was not always related to the interruption of long-term treatment (from a few days to greater than 7 years) nor to high-dose treatment, the range of dosages being usually close to that recommended. However, in some cases, several benzodiazepines had been taken simultaneously. The time between the last intake of the drug(s) and the occurrence of the seizures was shorter when a short-life benzodiazepine had been used. Additional factors were frequently involved; these factors were present in 29 cases and were multiple in nine of them. The incidence of withdrawal seizures was related more to the presence of these additional factors than to either the pharmacokinetics of the drugs or the pattern of treatment.",

In those early years only hypnotics and anticonvulsants were available and they were administered chiefly for the management of excitement and agitation. The discovery of chlorpromazine (Delay & Deniker, 1952) and other neuroleptics resulted in a revolution in the treatment of psychoses of adults. It was hoped that these drugs would arrest or decrease the psychotic process in the child and that after the reduction of anxiety, hyperactivity, and/or aggressiveness he would become more amenable to special education and other treatment modalities. These hopes were not always fulfilled. Drug therapy has come under attack because of improper use, especially with institutionalized retarded Children. This abuse has included high dosage over prolonged periods of time, multiple drug usage—children receiving from two to eight drugs at the same time—no drug holidays, little or no evidence of drug monitoring, and usage of sedative types of phenothiazines which probably suppress cognitive learning functions (Lipman, 1970).",

Some of the most frequent complications are cardiovascular effects (acute coronary syndrome, cardiac arrhythmias, increased blood pressure); respiratory effects (fibrosis, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, alveolar haemorrhage, asthma exacerbation; emphysema), neurological effects (strokes, aneurysms, seizures, headaches); risk for contracting HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B and C, sexual transmitted disease and otolaryngologic effects. Other complications are not discussed here. The vast majority of studies indicate that there are cognitive deficits induced by cocaine addiction. Attention, visual and working memories, executive functioning are affected in cocaine users. Psychiatric complications found in clinical practice are major depressive disorders, cocaine-induced paranoia, cocaine-induced compulsive foraging and panic attacks.",

      "abstract": "Climate solutions are available now, are widespread, and support psychological health.Increasing adoption of active commuting, public transportation, green spaces, and clean energy are all solutions that people can choose to support and integrate into their daily lives.These climate solutions, among others, can help to curb the stress, anxiety, and other mental illnesses incurred from the decline of economies, infrastructure, and social identity that comes from damage to the climate.Major acute mental health impacts include increases in trauma and shock, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), compounded stress, anxiety, substance abuse, and depression.Climate changeinduced extreme weather, changing weather patterns, damaged food and water resources, and polluted air impact human mental health.Increased levels of stress and distress from these factors can also put strains on social relationships and even have impacts on physical health, such as memory loss, sleep disorders, immune suppression, and changes in digestion.Major chronic mental health impacts include higher rates of aggression and violence, more mental health emergencies, an increased sense of helplessness, hopelessness, or fatalism, and intense feelings of loss.These feelings of loss may be due to profound changes in a personally important place (such as one's home) and/ or a sense that one has lost control over events in one's life due to disturbances from climate change.Additionally, a sense of loss regarding one's personal or occupational identity can arise when treasured objects are destroyed by a disaster or place-based occupations are disrupted by climate change.Personal relationships and the ways in which people interact in communities and with each other are affected by a changing climate.Compounded stress from a changing environment, ecomigration, and/or ecoanxiety can affect community mental well-being through the loss of social identity and cohesion, hostility, violence, and interpersonal and intergroup aggression.Recent increases in natural disasters illustrate the relationship between the acceleration of climate change and severe weather.Areas that endure a natural disaster face a number of risks and difficulties.Direct physical impacts range from brute physical trauma to more pernicious effects, like increased incidence of infectious disease, asthma, heart disease, and lung problems.These physical health impacts interact with mental health impacts, which is why they are detailed in this report on page 39.In this section, we use floods, the most common form of natural disasters (EM-DAT, 2011, as reported in Alderman, Turner, & Tong, 2012), as an example to illustrate the ways in which direct health impacts of disasters come about.",

This include psychogenic headache and epileptic headache. In the case of psychogenic headache, pericranial tenderness is not observed, and headache is medium in intensity. Most often patient complains of a headache originating frontal area. There are more than five various symptoms such as general malaise, numbness, tingling sensation, vertigo, sleeplessness. However, although symptoms are multiple, patients spend a life commonly. In other words, a patient is protected by a headache against his or her stress. No medication is needed in such a case. In epileptic headache, pressing type pain is felt over the forehead for several minutes to a few hours. Tremor or convulsion sometimes follow the headache. EEG shows spike and wave activities. In the case of focal epilepsy, headache occurs contralateral to the focus. Anti-epileptic drugs such as VPA or CBZ is a choice in such case, and headache as well as seizure disappears. (2) Front-orbital headache with autonomic symptoms include various trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias. These include cluster headache, episodic paroxysmal hemicrania, hemicrania continua, among others. Precise history taking is necessary for the treatment, because no drug is 100% effective.",

PMADs are highly prevalent during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Depressive disorders are characterized by abnormal low mood. Bipolar disorder is a severe mood disorder characterized by periods of depression and periods of abnormally elevated mood. Anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder. Any mental health disorder with symptoms specifically during pregnancy or during the first year postpartum may be referred to with one of the following specifiers: with peripartum onset and with peripartum exacerbation. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale has been validated for screening during both pregnancy and the postpartum period. Patients with PMADs will typically present with emotional symptoms (sadness, mood swings, crying bouts, excessive worry about the baby) or somatic complaints (fatigue, headaches, poor sleep, low energy, appetite changes).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Post concussive headache (PCH) is a new headache that follows a blunt or open injury to the head or brain (Headache Classification Committee, 2004). Post concussion syndrome is a constellation of symptoms that may follow a mild to moderate closed head injury. Symptoms of post concussion syndrome include headache, depression, irritability, memory impairment, alcohol intolerance, dizziness or vertigo, attention and concentration difficulties, and loss of libido. Concussion, minor head injury, and minor traumatic brain injury are difficult to define, compared with moderate or severe injury, in which structural damage is evident. The American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine defined minor traumatic brain injury as “a traumatically induced physiological disruption of brain function” with at least one of the following: (1) any period of loss of consciousness; (2) any memory loss for events just before or after the accident; (3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the accident; and (4) focal neurologic deficits that may or may not be transient (Packard, 1999).",

      "title": "Guidelines for treating depressive illness with antidepressants: A statement from the British Association for Psychopharmacology",
      "abstract": "Depression is a common illness which affects some 3% of the population per year. At least 25% of those with marked depression do not consult their general practitioner and in half of those who do the illness is not detected. Depression is easy to recognize when four or five of the core symptoms have been present for 2 weeks which often coincides with some occupational and social impairment. The core symptoms are depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, loss of energy or fatigue, concentration difficulties, appetite disturbance, sleep disturbance, agitation or retardation, worthlessness or self blame and suicidal thoughts. A diagnosis of depression is made when five of these core symptoms, one of which should be depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure, have been present for 2 weeks. Four core symptoms are probably sufficient. Response to antidepressants is good in those with more than mild symptoms. When there are only few or very mild depressive symptoms evidence of response to antidepressants is more uncertain. Antidepressants are effective, they are not addictive and do not lose efficacy with prolonged use. The newer antidepressants have fewer side effects than the older tricyclics, they are better tolerated and lead to less withdrawals from treatment. They are less cardiotoxic and are safer in overdose. Antidepressants should be used at full therapeutic doses. Treatment failure is often due to too low a dose being used in general practice. It may be difficult to reach the right dose with the older tricyclics because of side effects. To consolidate response, treatment should be continued for at least 4 months after the patient is apparently well. Stopping the treatment before this is ill-advised as the partially treated depression frequently returns. Most depression is recurrent. Long-term antidepressant treatment is effective in reducing the risk of new episodes of depression and should be continued to keep the patient well.",

Emergency signs in headaches are: violent headache (hemorrhage meninges), convulsions in epilepsy, fever, neck pain (meningitis), neurological disorders (vertigo, paresis, diplopia). Migraine begins with aura (20%), with reversible phenomena within 60 min, with small scotoma that expands, associated with homonymous, lateral hemianopsia (or blindness), scotoma bordered by zigzag bright spots (sensory aura may present progressively transient hemiplegia, auditory hallucinations). All signs regress without sequelae. Treatment in primary headache requires elimination of risk factors: stress, fatigue, food chocolate, coffee, wine, cheese, aspartane, prophylactic treatment as needed with propanolol methysergyl, calcium channel blockers, amitriptyline. Treatment of the acute migraine episode with acetaminophen; in aura, ergotamine tartrate, sumatriptan, topiramate, metoclopramide are indicated. Secondary headache recognizes multiple causes: ocular, cerebral, postneoplazic, posttraumatic, postinfectios, in which the treatment is that of the causal condition.",

El estudio incluyo historia clinica completa, examenes de laboratorio, interrogatorio sobre habitos y niveles de consumo, y consecuencias sociales del consumo de alcohol. Ademas, se diseno un cuestionario para la identificacion temprana de los bebedores que abusan del alcohol en forma excesiva. Se encontro que el consumo excesivo de alcohol esta asociado con numerosos signos y sintomas relacionados con el aparato cardiovascular, el digestivo y el sistema nervioso central, incluyendo la esfera mental. Asimismo, que estas manifestaciones producen, con cierta frecuencia, confusion en el medico y son atribuidas a otros procesos patologicos. La aplicacion del cuestionario, denominado AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test), permitio establecer ciertos indicadores clinicos de las fases tempranas de consumo peligroso de alcohol; de ellos destacan: insomnio y/o ansiedad, temblor distal de miembros superiores, trastornos digestivos vagos, accidentes frecuentes, impuntualidad en el trabajo y/o ausentismo laboral, tension nerviosa sin causa aparente, elevacion de la gamaglutamil-transferasa, aumento del volumen globular medio, macrocitosis sin anemia y aumento de lipoproteinas de alta densidad. El analisis de estos resultados demostro que el AUDIT es un instrumento de tamizaje altamente sensible (80%) y especifico (89%), con un valor promedio predictivo positivo de 60% y un valor promedio predictivo negativo de 95%. La aplicacion sistematica del AUDIT, particularmente en el primer nivel de atencion medica, podria ser de gran beneficio para los pacientes y para la comunidad.",

      "abstract": "La prescription d’opioides est en augmentation constante dans la prise en charge de la douleur. Un des principaux effets secondaires digestifs est la constipation induite par les opioides (CIO). Celle-ci peut etre severe et aboutir a un arret du traitement antalgique et a un soulagement inefficace des douleurs, avec un risque majore chez la personne âgee. Ces effets secondaires digestifs resultent de l’activation des recepteurs μ2 situes sur le tractus gastro-intestinal, a l’origine de troubles de la motricite, de la secretion-absorption et de la coordination des sphincters. La CIO est definie selon les criteres de Rome IV comme l’apparition ou l’aggravation d’une constipation sous opioides. Une autre cause de constipation (medicamenteuse, secondaire a une maladie…) doit avoir ete eliminee au prealable. Le Bowel Function Index (BFI) et l’echelle de Bristol sont deux outils simples qui peuvent aider le clinicien dans l’evaluation de la CIO. Le traitement de la CIO repose avant tout sur la prevention avec l’information du patient de la survenue possible d’une constipation sous traitement, et de l’enrichissement en fibres dans l’alimentation avec une hydratation suffisante en particulier chez les personnes âgees. En cas d’echec de ces mesures, elle sera traitee en premiere intention par des laxatifs « standards » : osmotiques, stimulants puis en association si besoin. En cas de reponse inappropriee aux laxatifs, une classe therapeutique specifique (Peripherally-Acting μ-Opioid Receptor Antagonist : PAMORA) peut etre proposee en deuxieme intention en l’absence de contre-indication. En France, le naloxegol en prise orale et la methylnaltrexone en injection sous-cutanee sont les deux representants de cette classe therapeutique indiques dans le traitement de la CIO.",

Accidental poisoningThis is usually a problem of the young child or toddler, with a mean age of presentation of 2.5 years.Accidental poisoning usually occurs when the child is unsupervised, and there is an increased incidence in poisoning following recent disruption in households, such as a new baby, moving house or where there is maternal depression. Intentional overdoseSuicide or parasuicide attempts are usually made by young people in their teens; however, sometimes they may be as young as 8 or 9 years old.These children or adolescents should undergo psychiatric and social assessment. Drug abuseAlcohol and solvent abuse are among the commonest forms of drug abuse in children. Iatrogenic drugsThe commonest offender is diphenoxylate with atropine (Lomotil).This combination is toxic to some children at therapeutic doses.The most frequently fatal drug is digoxin. Deliberate poisoningRarely, symptoms are induced in children by adults via the administration of drugs.A history of poisoning will often not be given at presentation. F.2 Primary assessment and resuscitation in poisoningz Respiratory rate: the rate may be increased in poisoning from amphetamines, ecstasy, salicylates, ethylene glycol and methanol z Acidotic sighing respirations: this may suggest metabolic acidosis from salicylates or ethylene glycol poisoning as a cause for the coma z Heart rate: tachycardia is caused by amphetamines, ecstasy, β-agonists, phenothiazines, theophylline and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs); bradycardia is caused by β-blockers, digoxin and organophosphates z Blood pressure: hypotension is commonly seen in serious poisoning; hypertension is caused by ecstasy and monoamine oxidase inhibitors z If heart rate is above 200 beats/min in an infant or above 150 beats/min in a child, or if the rhythm is abnormal, perform cardiac monitoring.QRS prolongation and ventricular tachycardia are seen in TCA poisoning z Depression of conscious level suggests poisoning with opiates, sedatives (such as benzodiazepines), antihistamines and hypoglycaemic agents z Pupillary size and reaction should be noted.Very small pupils suggest opiate or organophosphate poisoning; large pupils suggest amphetamines, atropine and TCAs 10.",

      "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or spastic colon, is a syndrome with numerous symptoms, and is associated with abdominal colicky pain and disturbed gastrointestinal functioning (constipation or diarrhoea, or a fluctuation between both) in the absence of organic disease. Previously it was considered to be a diagnosis of exclusion. There is no single confirmatory test and no specific cure for IBS. Several diagnostic criteria exist that evaluate symptoms and their duration, for example, the Manning and Rome criteria, but they are not always helpful in practice because of complex interactions between IBS and chronic pain syndromes. The condition is extremely common, especially in young adults, but symptoms can occur at any age. Emotion and stress are aggravating factors. Lifetime prevalence is estimated to be approximately 20%, but most patients never consult a medical practitioner. Treatment should be tailored to individual symptoms with dietary changes, exercise, psychotherapy and medication (e.g. bulk-forming laxatives, antispasmodics, antibiotics, probiotics and/or agents active at serotonin receptors). The pharmacist has an important supportive role to play in the optimal management of IBS.",

Esta afeccion se presenta frecuentemente en todas las personas del mundo y mas, si estos se encuentran laborando y/o estudiando, si el estres se presenta en exceso o no se puede revertir, se pueden generar distintas enfermedades como: hipertension y diabetes, las cuales presentan sintomatologias como: aumento de la presion sanguinea, gastritis, problemas del sueno, agotamiento, alteraciones de apetito, tension y dolor muscular, dolores de cabeza, alta temperatura corporal, pesadillas, ansiedad, fobias e irritabilidad, ademas, no solo se generan alteraciones a la salud, sino tambien en el rendimiento academico y laboral causando ausencia e incapacidad para cumplir con sus deberes, hasta incluso se pudiese llegar a la muerte. En la presente investigacion se determinaron las diferentes variantes que pueden llegar a ser alteradas por el estres academico y laboral. Los datos se obtuvieron midiendo los parametros fisiologicos de frecuencia cardiaca, presion arterial y glucosa serica utilizando los equipos necesarios para ello, ademas, se aplicaron diferentes encuestas como el PSS-14 e Inventario SISCO, los resultados recabados se verificaron estadisticamente con las pruebas de Ryan-Joiner y Kruskal-Wallis aplicando un nivel de confianza del 95%, concluyendo estadisticamente que el estres fisiologico no puede ser danino o mortal cuando se liga directamente con el estres academico y laboral.",

Other, not officially approved, uses of trazodone include: the treatment of bulimia, benzodiazepine and/or alcohol dependence or abuse, fibromyalgia, degenerative diseases of the central nervous system such as dementia and other organic disorders, schizophrenia, chronic pain, and diabetic neuropathy. In addition, due to its 5HT2A receptor antagonistic action, trazodone may be used to prevent the occurrence of initial and long-term side effects of SSRI, such as anxiety, insomnia and sexual dysfunction. Despite the favorable clinical experience and the encouraging results from the studies that have tested the efficacy of trazodone for some of its off-label indications, it is paramount that large, randomized and controlled clinical trials be conducted in the near future to evaluate which of the many off-label indications are supported by a strong scientific evidence.

Soon after the poisoning, the patient was treated with life-saving mechanical ventilation and haemodialysis. Subsequently brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and nerve conduction study (NCS) and electromyography (EMG) demonstrated toxic encephalopathy and peripheral nerve injury. Over the next 2 months the patient's limb function gradually recovered under treatment with hyperbaric oxygen, glucocorticoid pulses and neurotrophic drugs.This case documents a rare presentation of toxic encephalopathy complicated with peripheral neuropathy following AVP poisoning.

OBJETIVO: contribuir para um maior conhecimento do profissional fonoaudiólogo sobre as causas, consequências, diagnóstico e formas de tratamento da apneia obstrutiva do sono (AOS), a fim de favorecer a definição da conduta por este profissional, seja ela, encaminhar para um diagnóstico, tratar (por meio de fonoterapia) essa patologia ou indicar o tratamento médico, seja ele, cirúrgico ou conservador. CONCLUSÃO: as possíveis alterações fonoaudiológicas encontradas nestes pacientes são: língua alargada apresentando hipotonia, palato mole com volume aumentado, dificuldade na alimentação devido ao aporte insuficiente de ar e ao bruxismo, possivelmente causado pela tensão e ansiedade decorrentes das noites mal dormidas. Outras alterações podem ser encontradas decorrentes do tratamento cirúrgico empregado em alguns casos, como a disfagia ou até mesmo alterações na fala e na ressonância da fala decorrente de uma uvulopalatoplastia. O enfoque do tratamento fonoaudiológico é a mioterapia dos músculos envolvidos, priorizando a musculatura palatal.

There are barriers to successful treatment, which often result in early discontinuation and relapse.

      "abstract": "Up to 30% of athletes experience low back pain (LBP) depending on sport type, sex, training intensity and frequency, and technique. United States clinical guidelines define back pain as chronic if it persists for ≥ 12 weeks, and subacute if it persists 4 to < 12 weeks. Certain sports injuries are likely to lead to chronic pain. Persistent or chronic symptoms are frequently associated with degenerative lumbar disc disease or spondylolytic stress lesions. Exercise therapy is widely used and is the most conservative form of treatment for chronic LBP (cLBP). Pharmacotherapies for cLBP include acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opioids. Acetaminophen is a well-tolerated first-line pharmacotherapy, but high-dose, long-term use is associated with hepatic toxicity. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be an effective second-line option if acetaminophen proves inadequate but they have well-known risks of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and other systemic adverse effects that increase with patient age, dose amount, and duration of use. The serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, duloxetine, has demonstrated modest efficacy and is associated with systematic adverse events, including serotonin syndrome, which can be dose related or result from interaction with other analgesics. Opioids may be an effective choice for moderate to severe pain but also have significant risks of adverse events and carry a substantial risk of addiction and abuse. Because the course of cLBP may be protracted, patients may require treatment over years or decades, and it is critical that the risk/benefit profiles of pharmacotherapies are closely evaluated to ensure that short- and long-term treatments are optimized for each patient. This article reviews the clinical evidence and the guideline recommendations for pharmacotherapy of cLBP.",

      "title": "Alteraciones estructurales de las regiones cerebrales sexuales tras empleo de paroxetina versus agomelatina",
      "abstract": "El estado de animo del individuo es un tono vital interno dominante y mantenido, que influye en el comportamiento de la persona y en su percepcion del mundo. Este puede verse normal o eutimico, elevado o hipertimico; bajo o deprimido. Las alteraciones de la esfera afectiva son un grupo de afecciones clinicas que se caracterizan por la perdida de ese sentido del control y por el sentimiento subjetivo de un gran malestar. (SINTOMAS) Los pacientes con animo deprimido experimentan una perdida de energia y del interes, sentimientos de culpa, dificultades de concentracion, perdida del apetito, pensamientos de muerte… entre otros sintomas. Los trastornos del espectro depresivo, cuentan actualmente con una extensa farmacopea, centrados fundamentalmente por los psicofarmacos del grupo de los antidepresivos. Tanto el propio deterioro animico asi como su tratamiento pueden traer consigo un sintoma adicional, la disfuncion sexual (DS). Los Inhibidores Selectivos de Recaptacion de Serotonina (ISRS) provocan una amplia variedad de DS, desde las mas habituales como descenso en la libido, disminucion de la excitacion y retardo en el orgasmo, a otras mas anecdoticas como priapismo (en pene y clitoris), anestesia genital, anestesia peneana, ereccion, orgasmos y eyaculacion espontaneos, aumento de la libido, orgasmos dolorosos… (F. Arias et al, 2000). A pesar de todo, en las fichas tecnicas, la incidencia de la disfuncion sexual se establece entre 2-16%, muy inferior a la estimada en la practica real (Montejo AL, 2001). A modo de resumen, podemos concluir que existe bibliografia que justifica la DS provocada por los antidepresivos (concretamente los ISRS) en seres humanos, no obstante con las limitaciones: 1) Los pacientes con Trastorno del espectro depresivo pueden presentar en si mismo DS como sintoma de la enfermedad. 2) Los pacientes pueden presentar comorbilidad que de lugar a DS. 3) La infraestimacion de la DS debido a la dificultad que supone recoger en una historia clinica reglada la sexualidad como ritmo biologico esencial. Es por eso que creemos que es esencial dar un paso mas y buscar a nivel biologico, que es lo que se modifica a nivel estructural en la esfera, tras el empleo de psicofarmacos del grupo de los antidepresivos, concretamente comparando un ISRS con un antidepresivo melatoninergico. Para ello creemos que es una herramienta muy util el estudio anatomopatologico del Sistema Nervioso Central de animales de experimentacion. Trabajando sobre las areas cerebrales implicadas en la sexualidad. Nuestra hipotesis de trabajo se basa en que la Paroxetina produce disfuncion sexual y la Agomelatina no, por tanto las regiones cerebrales estudiadas en los animales a los que se les administro Paroxetina mostraran diferencias con respecto a los animales a los que se les administro Agomelatina. La descripcion de dichas diferencias podria dar lugar a las bases que expliquen de forma estructural la disfuncion sexual producida por un ISRS. Para la realizacion de nuestro trabajo hemos utilizado como animal de experimentacion un total de 20 ratas de la raza Wistar que al inicio del tratamiento tenian aproximadamente 50 dias (postpuberales); y un peso aproximado de 150 gr. Esta camada de ratas se divide en 4 grupos: dos experimentales y dos controles. 1) Animales del Grupo control 1 Formado por 4 animales. Una jaula. No se administra ninguna sustancia. 2) Animales del Grupo control 2 Formado por 4 animales. Una jaula. Se admInistra HMC. 3) Animales del Grupo experimental 1 Formado por 6 animales. Dos jaulas de tres animales cada una. Se administra Paroxetina. 4) Animales del Grupo experimental 2 Formado por 6 animales. Dos jaulas de tres animales cada una. Se administra Agomelatina. A todos los animales se les expuso a un ciclo de luz-oscuridad de 12 horas a traves de un punto de luz y un temporizador y se les administro las sustancias correspondientes a lo largo de 28 dias naturales. Se realizo un pesaje de los animales en tres momentos del estudio: al inicio, en el dia 14 y en el dia 28. Pesamos la jaula con animales y sin animales, hallamos la diferencia y hacemos un promedio del peso. A lo largo de los 28 dias se realiza un diario de conducta: conductas extranas, psicomotricidad, subida en patas traseras, olfateo general, olfateo anal, intromisiones, etc. Tras 28 dias de administracion de las sustancias; se procede al sacrificio e inclusion de muestras. Tincion mediante la tecnica inmunohistoquimica con los anticuerpos murinos: • Anticuerpo Tiroxina-Hidroxilasa (TH): es un anticuerpo policlonal de conejo. Concentrada a 1/300 • Anticuerpo Receptor alfa de Estrogenos (RE-a): es un anticuerpo policlonal de conejo. Concentrada a 1/300 • Anticuerpo Oxitocina (OXT): es un anticuerpo policlonal de conejo. Concentrada a 1/500 RESULTADOS FRUTO DE LA OBSERVACION (DIARIO DE CONDUCTA) En el grupo de las ratas a las que se les administro Paroxetina se produjo un importante incremento de peso en comparacion con el grupo al que se le administro Agomelatina. Las primeras doblaron su peso y las segundas experimentaron un incremento del 40% del peso corporal aproximadamente. Estos cambios de peso dieron lugar al reajuste de dosis. En el grupo de Paroxetina llamaba la atencion el intenso apetito que mostraban a partir del dia 10 del estudio. En comparacion con los otros grupos de estudio mostraban una importante voracidad. Ademas mostraban un incremento de la actividad motora que se mostraba en subidas sobre patas traseras y olfateo general. A pesar de todo esto era un grupo de ratas muy colaboradoras, que no mostraban resistencia ni a ser manipuladas ni a la administracion del farmaco. Respecto al grupo de Agomelatina mantenian un apetito estable. La psicomotricidad solo se veia incrementada en el momento de la manipulacion, que comenzaban a dar vueltas alrededor de la jaula. Se mostraban parcialmente colaboradoras a la manipulacion y a la administracion del farmaco, con una conducta ambivalente e imprevisible, en ningun momento agresiva. Los grupos control mantuvieron un apetito estable, no sufrieron incremento ni descenso de peso. Respecto a la psicomotricidad no hay hallazgos destacables.

      "title": "Excessive Cry in a 5-Month-Old Infant Possibly due to Abdominal Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Excessive and unexplained cry is a common problem with infants. Most of the causes are benign or easily treatable, with exception of a few. However, we encountered a 5-month-old, otherwise healthy male infant, who used to cry inconsolably every day on the afternoon for about 3 hours and then used to fall asleep. This had been going on for the last 6 weeks. After waking up, infant seemed perfectly normal. History, physical examination, and routine investigations failed to diagnose the cause. An electroencephalogram showed epileptic abnormalities. The “crying episodes” disappeared after starting phenobarbitone. Although two of the four criteria for diagnosis of abdominal epilepsy (AE) are impossible to be met in an infant of this age (because he cannot speak out his ailments whether he is having abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, etc.); still we believe that this was a case of AE. Various case reports have stated that “sustained response to anticonvulsants has been accepted as one of the criteria for the diagnosis of AE.” We suggest AE to be kept in mind even when dealing with an infant of unresolved excessive crying.",

      "abstract": "Une douleur qui persiste plus de 3 mois est considérée comme chronique. La douleur chronique touche entre 20 et 45 % de la population mondiale et les traitements habituellement prescrits sont peu efficaces. Certains antidépresseurs, mais aussi des antiépileptiques sont recommandés en première intention. En l’absence d’effet analgésique, des traitements à base d’opiacés sont ensuite envisagés. Ces derniers agissent sur les récepteurs opioïdes mu (μ), responsables à la fois des effets analgésiques et des nombreux effets indésirables. Dans ce contexte, il est nécessaire de concevoir des analgésiques opiacés efficaces et dépourvus d’effets secondaires. Un autre récepteur opioïde, le récepteur delta (δ), est largement distribué dans les régions du circuit de la douleur. Toutefois, les agonistes de ce récepteur ont une faible puissance analgésique chez l’humain. Par ailleurs, le récepteur δ peut s’associer avec d’autres pour former une nouvelle entité appelée hétéromère dont les propriétés fonctionnelles ont attiré l’attention. Nous évaluons ici leur rôle dans la douleur aiguë et chronique.",

      "title": "[P1–606]: IMPACT OF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL ACTIVITIES VERSUS PROTEIN MALNUTRITION ASSOCIATED WITH SOCIAL ISOLATION DURING INDUCTION AND PROGRESSION OF ALZHEIMER's DISEASE IN RATS",
      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible progressive neurodegenerative condition characterized by deterioration of cognition, memory and physical functions. Social isolation (SI) or insufficient contact with others can exacerbate memory deficits. Malnutrition and weight loss are frequent complications of AD. Protein malnutrition (PM) was reported to predict rapid cognitive decline and progression of AD. Physical and mental activities (Ph&M) influence the rate and prevalence of cognitive decline and may protect against dementia; their role especially in the presence of AD risk factors is still under investigation. Two major groups of rats each of 8 subgroups were used and treated for either 4 or 5 weeks as following: 2 groups received saline either alone or with Ph&M; 2 groups subjected to both SI&PM (10% casein) either alone or with Ph&M and 4 AD groups received every day 70mg/kg of ALCl3,IP; one group served as AD model while the other 3 groups were subjected to Ph&M, SI&PM or both of them. Swimming and forced swimming tests were performed each for one time/week during the 4 or 5 weeks of the experiment for maintaining Ph&M. Histopathological changes in different brain regions as well as biochemical changes in Aβ, Tau, β-secretase, ACHE, monoamins (DA, NE, 5-HT), inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-1β), oxidative parameters (MDA, SOD, TAC), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and DNA fragmentation were measured for all groups. Brain neurological damage characterizing AD or PM associated with SI was more pronounced when AD is associated with PM&SI in rats and the severity increased by time. By maintaining Ph&M; Aβ, β-secretase, Tau, ACHE, MDA, TNF-α, IL-1β and DNA fragmentation were significantly decreased while SOD, TAC, DA, NE, 5-HT and BDNF were increased. The protective effect of Ph&M against brain neuronal damage was clearer by time especially when AD is associated with PM&SI. These results were confirmed by the histopathological examinations. Maintaining Ph&M can protect from brain neuronal degenerations induced by AD especially when associated with the risk of PM&SI. The protection was more marked in AD associated risk factors especially during the disease progression.",

      "abstract": "This article describes the common causes of recurrent vertigo and dizziness that can be diagnosed largely on the basis of history.Ninety percent of spontaneous recurrent vertigo and dizziness can be explained by six disorders: (1) Ménière disease is characterized by vertigo attacks, lasting 20 minutes to several hours, with concomitant hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness. Aural symptoms become permanent during the course of the disease. (2) Attacks of vestibular migraine may last anywhere from minutes to days. Most patients have a previous history of migraine headaches, and many experience migraine symptoms during the attack. (3) Vertebrobasilar TIAs affect older adults with vascular risk factors. Most attacks last less than 1 hour and are accompanied by other symptoms from the posterior circulation territory. (4) Vestibular paroxysmia is caused by vascular compression of the eighth cranial nerve. It manifests itself with brief attacks of vertigo that recur many times per day, sometimes with concomitant cochlear symptoms. (5) Orthostatic hypotension causes brief episodes of dizziness lasting seconds to a few minutes after standing up and is relieved by sitting or lying down. In older adults, it may be accompanied by supine hypertension. (6) Panic attacks usually last minutes, occur in specific situations, and are accompanied by choking, palpitations, tremor, heat, and anxiety. Less common causes of spontaneous recurrent vertigo and dizziness include perilymph fistula, superior canal dehiscence, autoimmune inner ear disease, otosclerosis, cardiac arrhythmia, and medication side effects.Neurologists need to venture into otolaryngology, internal medicine, and psychiatry to master the differential diagnosis of recurrent dizziness.",

It is indicated that the basic symptoms include: depressed mood, loss of curiosity and pleasure from daily activities, increased fatigue, loss of energy and decreased activity. The risk factors that most influence the formation of depressive disorders are analyzed. These factors include: job loss, divorce, loss of relatives, high levels of personal anxiety, and stressful life events. The main goal of therapy in patients with VDR is complete functional recovery and return to the premorbid state. The difficulty of treating depressive disorders lies in the lack of complete recovery in the case of severe or complicated forms of depressive disorders. The author identifies the main emotional and cognitive signs of depressive disorder, namely: low or increased mood, feelings of anxiety and unreasonable anxiety, irritability or manifestations of anger towards yourself or other people, repeated negative thoughts about yourself, about drug addicts and the future, reduced concentration of attention, apathy, inattention. Recovery from depression is not the absence of negative affective symptoms, but the restoration of normal emotional functioning, the ability to be yourself and experience positive emotions. The goal of psychotherapy for depression is to change the patient's negative thoughts, emotional state and mood.",

      "title": "Revisiting a dilemma: repetitive pain vs. opioid exposures?",
      "abstract": "Multiple lines of evidence suggest that cognitive/behavioural outcomes of ex-preterm children are worse than in term-born children. Various risk factors could explain these outcomes, including the triggers of preterm labour such as perinatal infections or inflammation, or birth asphyxia, hypoxic events due to recurrent apnoea/bradycardia, prolonged mechanical ventilation, hypothyroidism, hyperbilirubinemia, protein–calorie or micronutrient deficiencies, or drug therapies such as glucocorticoids, caffeine, theophylline, morphine and others. Extrapolating from clinical observations and animal studies, several hypotheses were floated to explain the neurodevelopmental impact of NICU care, such as neuroinflammation, nutritional deprivation, impaired neurogenesis or neuronal apoptosis/excitotoxicity 1. Postulating that reductions in pain and stress may improve outcomes, as in postsurgical neonates, opiates were investigated as one strategy for providing analgesia to the sickest and most preterm neonates 2, as they experience the most frequent and prolonged exposures to pain and/or stress. Given the absence of robust conclusive results, as well as limited follow-up studies of the preterm neonates originally enrolled in large multicentre trials, the question of whether opiate exposures promote or damage preterm brain development largely remains unanswered. To answer this question, Deindl et al. compared the in-hospital and 12-month follow-up outcomes for 140 ELBW infants (<1500 grams) before and after implementation of the Vienna Protocol for Neonatal Pain and Sedation. Although cumulative opioid exposures increased sixfold between the control and intervention groups, they found no significant differences in their in-hospital and 12-month neurodevelopmental outcomes 3. Multivariable regression analyses showed that the CRIB score at birth (p < 0.001) and cumulative opioid exposures in the NICU (p = 0.006) were associated with lower scores in the Behavior Rating Scale (BRS) of the Bayley Developmental Scales (2nd Edition). Although median CRIB scores were higher in the intervention group vs. the control group (7 vs. 4, p-value not reported) and regression estimates for CRIB scores were much greater than opioid exposures (−2.91 vs. −0.04), however, the authors concluded that ‘opiate exposure increased the risk for lower BRS scores in our study population’ 3. Predictive factors for the mental (MDI) and psychomotor (PDI) developmental indices were well supported by previously published literature and therefore not surprising. The authors contrast their results with those of the NEOPAIN study 4, while discounting the differences between the two study designs. Results from a single-centre, observational, retrospective case–cohort analysis using historical controls cannot be rationally compared with a prospective, multicentre, blinded, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial using concurrent controls, which also selected patients using well-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria and standardised various other aspects of NICU care, other than randomising subjects to morphine or placebo infusions. These data, for example, are susceptible to significant selection bias, as only 15% of the original cohort (N = 949) or 38% of ELBW survivors (n = 367) contributed to the results reported in this study 3. All case–cohort comparisons with historical controls are notoriously open to unmeasured systematic bias that may result from myriad, known and unknown, temporal factors that may or may not be related to the intervention being studied. Given these limitations and those eruditely discussed by Diendl and colleagues, how important are the findings from this study? The results of this study are perhaps inadequate to dispel the rampant opiophobia prevailing in some NICUs, or an equally rampant opiophilia being practiced in others 5. The EUROPAIN study, for example, showed widely different sedation–analgesia practices between individual NICUs, within and between the 18 participating countries. Much of this clinical variability was driven by the use of opioids 5, rather than use of nonopioids or nonpharmacologic approaches. The current results, however, may serve to reassure clinicians that a systematic, protocol-driven approach to neonatal analgesia and sedation, one that incorporates routine assessments of pain/sedation using a validated scale, will very likely not lead to poorer short-term outcomes or major complications in ELBW infants. The jury is still out on the long-term effects of cumulative opioid exposures on preterm brain development, or their effects on the neurodevelopmental outcomes of premature birth. Despite multiple attempts, funding was not obtained to enable neurodevelopmental follow-up of subjects in the NEOPAIN multicentre trial. The Dutch morphine trial, modelled after the NEOPAIN protocol, however, has published a series of follow-up studies 6. A small pilot study, designed to demonstrate the feasibility of locating, contacting and recruiting school-age children from NEOPAIN many years after NICU discharge, reported preliminary findings on their long-term outcomes 7. Findings from this pilot study (N = 19) certainly cannot be related to the overall results from NEOPAIN (N = 898); thus, ascribing smaller head circumferences at 5–7 years 7 to delayed enteral feeding associated with morphine therapy in the neonatal period 4 lacks scientific validity. In the NEOPAIN trial, however, intermittent boluses of open-label morphine were associated with worse neurological outcomes 4, 8. Perhaps preterm neonates showing increased irritability, myoclonus or other clinical signs of severe IVH were misdiagnosed as having pain and thus given intravenous morphine boluses in addition to the masked study drug 4, 8. The fact that Diendl et al. found no increases in IVH among ELBW neonates despite sixfold increases in morphine exposure after their intervention, again, will reassure clinicians on the horns of this dilemma. The dilemma to treat neonatal pain with opioids, thereby courting potential risks for long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae is not unlike the effects of neonatal antibiotic use on gut microbiome and its association with subsequent inflammatory bowel disease. Yet concerns regarding analgesic use seem much greater than those regarding antibiotic use, although it is likely that preclinical evidence for anaesthetic-related neurotoxicity may have fuelled some of these concerns 9. Apart from one recent study 10, opioids had hitherto not been implicated with anaesthetic neurotoxicity in newborns – in animal or human studies. Zwicker et al. reported that a 10-fold increase in morphine exposure was associated with 5.5% reduction in cerebellar volume, which also correlated with poorer motor and cognitive outcomes 10. On the other hand, a large body of data have confirmed the long-term neurodevelopmental impact of repetitive neonatal pain. In conclusion, extravagant concerns with the immediate or long-term effects of neonatal opioids should not interfere with a real clinical need for opioid analgesia 6. Diendl et al. now provide additional evidence to support this conclusion. No conflict of interests to disclose regarding this publication.",

      "abstract": "The neuropsychiatric symptoms of old patients with disturbed cerebral metabolism or blood flow mostly lead to great individual difficulties and make those patients difficult to handle: in the family as well as in hospital such patients develop alienation, isolation and therefore adaptation to a social structure deteriorates with time. In the course of a test program for medicinal therapy of this syndrome we studied the efficacy of a vincamine containing formulation (Pervincamin forte retard or Pervincamin ampoules, respectively) on the symptoms of a chronical brain disturbance. The study was randomised double-blind. We found that under the influence of the vincamine formulation the subjective symptoms, such as lack of interest, apathy, aggressiveness, raging, psychomotoric retardation, lack of concentration, dysmnesia, decreased with a statistical significance (p less than or equal to 0.05). Also the subjective symptoms, reported by the patients, such as tinnitus and vertigo decreased significantly under the treatment with the vincamine preparation. Therefore some of the parameters important for resocialisation and revitalisation of old patients could be influenced in a favourable way. Basing on the good results of our investigations, the treatment of psychiatric disturbances in old patients with vincamine containing drugs seems to be justified.",

      "title": "ApoE e3 allele and DRS Outcome in Patients with Severe Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) (S46.007)",
      "abstract": "Objective: ApoE e4 is associated with poor prognosis in patients with severe traumatic brain injury, other polymorphisms may confer protective or have no effect in outcome measure by DRS at hospital discharge, three and six months follow-up. Background: The ApoE protein exists in three major isoforms, denoted as apoE2, apoE3 and apoE4. Various combinations of any two of the three major alleles will give rise to one of six possible genotypes (APOE e2/e2, APOE e3/e3, APOE e4/e4, APOE e2/e3, APOE e3/e4 and APOE e2/e4). ApoE may be a requirement in the mobilization of cholesterol in the CNS, where it is required for neural plasticity. Poorer scores on the GCS, unfavorable outcome on the GOS 6 months post-TBI, and/or lower Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores have been observed for ɛ4 carriers. Outcome following TBI is, however, highly variable. Design/Methods: 170 patients (White 22.9[percnt], Hispanic 48.2[percnt], Black 26.4[percnt], Asian 2.4[percnt]; Male 78.8[percnt]) with severe TBI, GCS ≤ 8 were included. A blood sample was collected for DNA analysis, and genotyping of the following variants of ApoE gene was performed: ɛ2-4. Other variables included age, injury severity score, race, gender. Functional outcome was measured by Disability Rating Scale at hospital discharge, 3 and 6 months. Generalized linear model and Elastic net regularization were used to select the important predictors. Results: Two variables came out as significant predicting outcome by DRS: age and ApoE e3 variant. ApoE3-containing genotypes (e2/e3, e3/3 or e3/e4) were associated with lower DRS scores (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The findings in this study support the importance of ApoE in predicting outcome in patients with severe traumatic brain injury. However, in our study ApoE e3-containg genotypes predict better outcome when compared to ApoE e4 allele as previously described. Further differences in outcome may be accounted by polymorphisms in promoter regions.",

      "title": "Vertigo",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: “Dizziness” is a common complaint that implies a sense of disorientation, usually an altered perception of position in the environment. It may be due to lightheadedness or faintness (eg, the adolescent who has orthostatic hypotension), occur in association with a variety of acute medical disorders (eg, the febrile child who has vomiting and dehydration), or have a psychosomatic origin (eg, depression, anxiety, or exhaustion).Dizziness is formally classified into four categories: vertigo, presyncope, dysequilibrium, and light-headedness. Vertigo is defined as an illusion of movement, most often a sensation of rotation or, less frequently, linear displacement or tilt. Vertigo is the key symptom of vestibular pathology and usually the result of abnormalities of the labyrinth, although it also may be symptomatic of other neurologic disease (eg, seizures or migraines). It typically is accompanied by symptoms of varying degree, including nausea, vomiting, pallor, and perspiration. There is no loss of consciousness.The prevalence of vertigo in children is unknown. A recently published study of Scottish school children reported that 15% had experienced at least one episode of dizziness in a 1-year period. Almost 50% were assessed as having “paroxysmal vertigo” with accompanying symptoms frequently suggestive of migraine (pallor, nausea, phonophobia, and photophobia).The etiology of vertigo may be due to abnormalities of the vestibular, visual, or proprioceptive systems. The labyrinth (the paired organs of equilibrium) consists of three semicircular canals stimulated by angular acceleration and the utricle and saccule stimulated by gravitational forces and vertical acceleration. Impulses pass via the vestibular nerve to the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem and then ascend in the medial longitudinal fasiculus (to the cranial nerves for eye movement) and descend in the vestibulospinal tracts (excitatory stimuli to the extensor muscles of the head, extremities, and trunk for maintenance of upright posture). The cerebellum receives afferent impulses and functions as a center for integrating oculovestibular and postural responses. Cortical vestibular representation is at the level of the posterior temporal gyrus.Vestibular function is assessed by evaluating the oculovestibular reflex and intensity of nystagmus produced by rotatory and caloric stimulation of the labyrinth. The oculovestibular reflex permits ocular fixation on stationary objects while the head and body are in motion.Nystagmus is the observed movement of the eye in response to stimulation of the labyrinth, retrocochlear vestibular, or central vestibulo-ocular pathway. It is classified as spontaneous or induced by direction and by fatigability. The direction of nystagmus is designated by the fast component (ocular realignment). The slow component represents the oculovestibular response.Vertigo may be due to peripheral vestibular disease or central vestibular dysfunction. When not associated with actual movement, the cause of vertigo is found in the peripheral system in 85% of cases. Use of the term “peripheral” implies that the problem occurs either in the end organ (semicircular canals or utricle) or in the peripheral nerve.The clinical presentations differ and allow for localization of the vertiginous symptomatology (Table 1).The medical history is the initial and most important step in evaluation of the child who complains of dizziness or vertigo. Young children may not have the capacity or vocabulary to describe the sensation of vertigo, but they can use “playground synonyms” such as spinning, swinging, sliding, or like “a merry-go-round.” The key symptom is a sensation of motion that is either rotatory or linear.The associated aural and neurologic symptoms must be sought carefully. Are there other symptoms of hearing loss (that may fluctuate), fullness, pressure, or ringing? Is there objective evidence of a hearing disorder? If tinnitus or ringing is present, is it continuous, intermittent, or pausitile? Are there symptoms of cortical or brainstem disorders such as headache, visual changes, seizures, or loss of consciousness?The complete physical examination should focus on neurologic evaluation of the cranial nerves and cerebellar function (past-pointing and tandem gait). The auditory canal and tympanic membranes must be examined to evaluate for evidence of middle ear infection, malformations, cholesteatoma, or a perilymphatic fistula. A fistula test can be performed in a cooperative child with a pneumatic otoscope or tragal pressure. The child is instructed to look straight ahead, and the eyes are examined while continuous positive and then negative pressure is applied. Normally, there should be no drift of the eyes. In the presence of perilymphatic fistula, the eyes may drift slowly away from the ear with positive pressure and back toward the ear with negative pressure.An important sign is the presence of spontaneous or induced nystagmus. Endpoint or physiologic nystagmus is seen in normal children at a 40-degree deviation of the eyes. Because visual fixation may inhibit mild vestibular nystagmus, otolaryngologists use Frenzel glasses (+10 diopters) both to magnify the eyes and to prevent fixation suppression.Clinical testing in the office or emergency department may provide much information about the child or adolescent who has vertigo. Simple tests of balance include the Romberg and Unterberger-Fukuda test (stepping or marching test). The Romberg test evaluates proprioceptive function. A variation of the original examination—the tandem Romberg test—can be performed by having the child place one foot directly in front of the other with the arms either at the sides or crossed in front. Vision is allowed and then excluded. The Unterberger-Fukuda test is performed with the arms placed straight out in front at shoulder height. Vision is excluded, and the child is instructed to maintain the original position and march in place. A total of 50 marching steps should be taken. Normally, patients either will remain in place, step forward up to 50 cms, or turn within approximately 30 degrees of center. Patients who have chronic peripheral vestibular lesions will march slowly toward the side of the lesion.The Hallpike-Dix maneuver should be used during the neurologic examination to elicit paroxysmal positional nystagmus. The child is placed in a sitting position midway on a flat examining table and instructed to look straight ahead at all times. The examiner first turns the head to the side, and the patient then quickly is placed backwards with the head over the end of the table. The response in patients who have a positional vertigo is horizontal rotary nystagmus with the fast phase to the downward ear. The onset of the nystagmus is delayed with typically a 1- to 2-second latency that lasts for 10 to 20 seconds and is associated with a sensation of rotational vertigo. With this positioning maneuver, nystagmus and vertigo occur with the affected ear down. If a diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is considered clinically, the Hallpike-Dix maneuver is not recommended because it may interfere with immediate bedside treatment of this disorder.All patients who have symptoms of vertigo must undergo hearing testing or, in infants, auditory brainstem evoked response testing. Additional pediatric investigations depend on the characteristics of the vertigo and accompanying symptoms in the individual patient. Children who have persistent nonspecific vertigo require a complete blood count, glucose tolerance test, and measurement of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, and thyroid function. Certain patients may require testing for sickle cell disease. Patients who have sensorineural hearing loss or neurologic findings should receive computed tomography with thin cuts through the temporal bones, magnetic resonance imaging (± gadolinium), or angiography. If there is a history of associated loss of consciousness, an electroencephalographic study should be obtained.Based on the course of the symptoms, the physical examination, and the results of the previously noted investigations, the child may require referral to an otolaryngologist for additional vestibular testing. Caloric testing is the definitive procedure for identification of vestibular pathology. Electronystagmography is a collection of examinations for the saccadic, optokinetic, and smooth pursuit systems and of nystagmus induced by warming and cooling the labyrinth. These tests are nonspecific and do not provide a diagnosis, but when results are abnormal, they are suggestive of vestibular dysfunction.Other testing used by otolaryngologists in specific circumstances includes rotating chair tests, vestibular autorotation test (physiologic stimuli of high frequency produced by active head oscillations), and posturography (sway movement testing).Acute-onset vertigo or paroxysmal episodes of vertigo can be approached clinically based on the presence or absence of hearing loss (Table 2). If vertigo is continuous and unremitting, assessment can be based on the presence or absence of neurologic abnormalities (Table 3). The diagnosis of labyrinthitis is based on a history of infection preceding the onset of vertigo and the presence of hearing impairment. The child usually is most comfortable lying on the unaffected side. Any movement causes severe vertigo, nausea, and vomiting. These episodic symptoms usually subside after several days. This condition is much more frequent in children than had been recognized in the past and often is caused by minor head trauma. There is a sudden onset of hearing loss and vertigo from rupture of the round or oval window into the vestibule that results in the creation of a fistula. An abrupt change in barometric pressure (eg, decompression syndrome) also can result in a similar rupture.Menière syndrome is very uncommon in children. Symptoms consist of vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, a sensation of pressure in the ear, and tinnitus. Recurrent episodes of vertigo and tinnitus are common, with progressive hearing loss after each event.This disorder primarily occurs in adolescents following respiratory infection. Symptoms include vertigo, nausea, and vomiting with postural instability. Episodes are self-limited but tend to recur with decreasing intensity. Diagnosis is made by electronystagmography and thermal caloric testing. Benign paroxysmal vertigo presents initially between 1 and 2 years of age, with symptoms recurring to the age of 4 years. The child presents suddenly with extreme unsteadiness and may be unable to remain upright. Nystagmus may be present, but other symptoms such as vomiting are uncommon. The child is fully conscious throughout the entire episode. Many children develop migraine later in life. The diagnosis is supported by a family history of migraine. Another migraine variant seen in infants is paroxysmal torticollis. A child who has this rare form of migraine will tilt his or her head to one side for several hours (and infrequently for up to several days). There may be associated vomiting. These episodes usually cease by 2 years of age, with many children developing typical migraine headaches by early childhood.Head trauma with or without temporal bone fracture can produce labyrinthine concussion. There is severe vertigo, with unsteadiness and falling toward the affected side. These symptoms may persist, but they gradually diminish in intensity over a 4- to 6-week period.Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo has been described in children as young as 11 years of age. The cause has been determined to be the presence of free-floating debris in the posterior semicircular canal. This type of vertigo has been related to head trauma or vestibular neuronitis. In a proportion of patients, no cause can be found. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is provoked by a change in position and lasts for seconds. Basilar artery migraine presents primarily in adolescent girls with recurrent stereotypic attacks of brainstem and cerebellar dysfunction. The clinical features can include ataxia, dysarthria, vertigo, and tinnitus. There are variable bilateral visual complaints. Alternating hemiplegia and paresthesias of the face and limbs can occur, and there can be alteration of consciousness. A severe pounding or pulsatile headache will follow. Vertigo also may be the aura preceding a generalized seizure or present as an actual ictal phenomenon (partial complex seizure). Vestibulogenic seizures are very rare and represent a form of reflex sensory epilepsy (induced by spinning).The treatment of vertigo depends on the duration and discomfort of the symptom and the underlying pathology. Acute vertigo can be treated symptomatically and with reassurance. Antiemetics can be given rectally or intramuscularly. Vestibular sedation or suppressant medication is also useful (meclizine, dimenhydrinate, promethazine, and diazepam). Persistent severe nausea and vomiting may require administration of prochlorperazine or metoclopramide.Most children who have acute vertigo recover spontaneously over a period of several weeks to months. Symptomatic recovery is due to vestibular compensation and central plasticity (reorganization of vestibular circuits). In some children and adolescents, symptoms recur, often in association with physical or psychological stress. Medications producing vestibular sedation should not be prescribed for long-term daily use because they may interfere with the normal compensation process.A specific treatment for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is a bedside maneuver (Epley particle repositioning maneuver). This maneuver relocates the free floating debris from the posterior semicircular canal into the vestibule of the labyrinth. Symptomatic relief after a single treatment session is reported in 80% to 90% of patients, although 15% to 30% may have recurrence of symptoms. The maneuver is repeated until nystagmus no longer can be elicited (Figure). A modified version of the Epley maneuver can be taught to patients with instructions to perform the activity three times a day until there are no symptoms of positional vertigo for 24 hours.Chronic or recurrent vertigo is often resistant to treatment, but it may respond to a course of clonazepam or carbamazepine. Exercise regimens also have been prescribed, with balance and gait training during dynamic tasks that precipitate the patient’s symptoms. These exercises are practiced until an asymptomatic state is reached. Management of accompanying psychological symptoms (eg, anxiety, panic attacks, depression) depends on the nature of the associated symptom.Surgical procedures for the treatment of vertigo rarely are required in childhood. Endolymphatic arachnoid shunt operations are successful in 65% of patients who have Menière disease. Disabling vertigo due to vestibular nerve or labyrinthine disorders may require vestibular nerve section. Surgery is an option for patients who have severe intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo using procedures to disable the posterior semicircular canal.Appropriate management of vertigo depends on determination of the etiology and carefully tailored treatment plans specific to the vestibular or central disorder producing the vertigo.",

This gap is compounded by the lack of objective biomarkers to guide such decision-making. Current recommendations for retirement center around worrisome neurological findings on exam or brain imaging, prolonged recovery following concussion, low threshold for developing concussion, and shortened time intervals between concussions. Retirement from sport following one (or multiple) concussions should be based on multiple factors, including evidence of neurologic impairment, prolonged recovery, lower threshold for developing concussion, and personal/family concerns.",

In other words, in each case, the subject described him/herself as \"being depressed.\" The detailed examination of the case notes kept by the counselors who treated these individuals indicates a more specific symptomology associated with their depression. On a more specific level, each of the subjects expressed feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, despair, and self-destruction. In at least two of the cases, self-destructive feelings were translated into potentially suicidal actions. In addition, each of the three subjects experienced pronounced mood swings. Alternating between periods of deep depression (associated with stagnant or regressive behavior) and periods of relative optimism when at least temporary progress in therapy was evident. During these apparent periods of improvement, the subjects often related major plans of action intended to improve their lot, including new jobs, furthering their education, withdrawing entirely from drug use, patching up marital and family disorder, etc. In each case before these major improvements could be initiated, the subjects would relapse into depressed states and their plans would dissolve like so many fantasies. These cyclical mood swings and their accompanying polar manifestations would seem, superficially, indicative of a type of manic-depressive illness. It should be noted, however, that at no time did any of the subjects undergo thorough psychological testing. Such testing is planned for Subject B, who remains in treatment at this time. Each subject complained of experiencing acute anxiety attacks during his periods of depression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Many of the standard antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have been reported to have antimyoclonic action in some types of myoclonus. L-5-Hydroxytryptophan (L-5HTP), in combination with carbidopa, is the most effective antimyoclonic drug in this class of pharmacologic agents. L-5HTP is an amino acid which readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and is decarboxylated in the brain to form the neurotransmitter serotonin. Numerous clinical trials of L-5HTP, in combination with carbidopa, have established its effectiveness in the treatment of postanoxic intention myoclonus. The most common adverse effects of L-5HTP/carbidopa are anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting, which usually decrease or disappear within several months after initiating therapy. Dyspnea with hyperventilation, hypotension, and sleepiness have been observed with doses of L-5HTP greater than 2000 mg/day.

      "title": "Prevention and diagnosis of neuropathy during dental treatment",
      "abstract": "Peripheral nerves are often subjected to various forces such as surgical invasion, trauma, disease infiltration, and drug action. These attacks cause the peripheral nerve fibers to be pulled, pressed, damaged, or ruptured, resulting in a decline in peripheral function or loss of function. This symptom is often expressed in various ways such as numbness, palsy, paralysis, neuropathy, and nerve abnormality. Paralysis in the oral and facial areas includes motor palsy associated with efferent peripheral neuropathy such as the facial and hypoglossal nerves and sensory palsy associated with afferent peripheral neuropathy such as the inferior alveolar nerve and the lingual nerve. In addition, dysgeusia, taste disorders, dysfunction of autonomic nerves, and autonomic neuropathy may occur in the oral cavity and the facial region as one of paralysis. If these symptoms or disorders recover within days to weeks, it is temporary loss of motor and sensory function due to blockage of nerve conduction, and the diagnosis is neurapraxia. On the other hand, if the symptoms of paralysis persist and the aftereffects remain, or if the function does not recover at all, it can be diagnosed as axonotmesis or neurotmesis. Paralysis is exceedingly difficult to diagnose the prognosis and degree of disability only by the initial symptoms. In particular, the sensory function is more difficult to evaluate than the motor function because the sensory cannot be visualized, and therefore the diagnostic criteria cannot be determined, and inaccurate diagnosis causes confusion in the course of treatment. As a result, despite the definitive diagnosis being Neurapraxia, there is the possibility of giving unnecessary medication, surgical treatment, or wrong physical therapy. Not only that, but for axonotmesis and neurotmesis, which must be treated early, there is a possibility that the start of treatment will be delayed. A quantitative and objective, reproducible and accurate diagnosis is needed to determine the prognosis of paralysis and to make treatment decisions. Accurately grasping the cause of external force applied to the peripheral nerves and the timing of damage, it is possible to cure peripheral functions if the amount and duration of drug therapy and physical therapy and the timing of surgical treatment can be correctly determined. The purpose of this review is to explore preventive and diagnostic methods for peripheral neuropathy during dental treatment. Therefore, we considered the need for a Precision tactile function test for painful trigeminal neuropathy and neuropathic pain, considering the time to fix the symptoms of neuropathy. In addition, we discussed the treatment experience of hyperalgesia and allodynia caused by disorders of the somatosensory nervous system.",

The order of 1) to 6) is the order of major disability and there is no need to evaluate a lower order disability when a higher order one exists in the same joint or a part of the upper extremity. However, some disabilities can be either added or substituted when there are special contributions from multiple disabilities. An upper extremity disability should be evaluated after the completion of treatment and full adaptation when further functional changes are not expected.

      "abstract": "Medical cannabis is increasingly used as a treatment or adjunct treatment with different levels of efficacy in several neurological disorders or related symptoms (such as multiple sclerosis, autism, Parkinson and Alzheimer disease, Tourette's syndrome, Huntington's disease, neuropathic pain, epilepsy, headache), as well as in other medical conditions (e.g. nausea and vomiting, glaucoma, appetite stimulation, cancer, inflammatory conditions, asthma). Nevertheless, a number of neurological adverse effects from use of medical cannabis on the short- and on the longterm have been reported, in addition to other adverse health events.It has been noticed that the use of medical cannabis can lead to a paradoxical effects depending on the amount of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) -like cannabinoids the preparation contain. Accordingly, some neurological disorders or symptoms (e.g. multiple sclerosis, seizures, epilepsy, headache) may be caused or exacerbated by the same treatment supposed to cure them. The current review presents an update of the neurological adverse effects resulting from the use of cannabis for medical purposes, highlighting the need to weigh the benefits and risks, when using cannabinoidbased treatments.",

      "title": "Chronic Pain: The Need and Hope for Opioid Alternatives",
      "abstract": "Chronic Pain: The Need and Hope for Opioid Alternatives On January 11, 2016, a Phase 1 trial in France of the investigational drug BIA 10-2474 was abruptly halted when one of the six dosed subjects fell into a coma after experiencing symptoms resembling a stroke.The subject died several days later and four others were left with what doctors suspect may be lasting neurological damage.What precipitated this tragedy is still unclear.As an inhibitor of fatty acid amide hydrolase, a critical enzyme in the biosynthesis of endocannabinoids, it was thought that BIA 10-2474 could target aberrant neurotransmission in disorders ranging from anxiety and Parkinson's disease to chronic pain.While the failure of the BIA 10-2474 trial should not be downplayed, it does at least herald the critical need for further investigation into new ways of treating nervous system disordersincluding chronic pain, whose current therapies include those that may themselves be perilous.Chronic pain is generally defined as that which lasts between three and six months after the acute symptoms should have subsided.It can arise from myriad conditions including arthritis, diabetic neuropathy, cancer, traumatic injury, certain viral infections, and many other diseases that lead to persistent inflammation or nerve dysfunction.Roughly 25% of people worldwide will at some point suffer from chronic pain.Consequently, the WHO estimates chronic pain to be one of the leading causes of Years Lost to Disability globally.In the US alone, where up to 12 million people have chronic pain, this equates to an economic burden of nearly $635 billion per year.Opioids are widely used as first line drugs for both acute and chronic moderate to severe pain.While opioids often produce unmatched analgesic effects, at sufficient doses or with prolonged use they can trigger psychoactive effects, tolerance, and addiction.Prescription opioid abuse has exploded in developed nations over the last decade.In the US, the epidemic has grown to such proportions that the Centers for Disease Control estimates over 19,000 people died from overdose of prescription opioids in 2014, a cause of death whose rate now exceeds that of motor vehicle accidents.These troubling statistics led the US Food and Drug Administration in February, 2016 to largely amend its stance on opioids.Among other policy statements was a call to action to develop novel therapies with reduced potential for misuse.Given that opioids are the only currently-available means of relief from chronic pain for many patients, one branch of research focusses on ways to limit their use at the high doses necessary to elicit harmful effects.These efforts include drug formulations that confer delayed release and technologies such as implantable devices that dispense precise doses to provide only analgesia.Other research is aimed at developing opioids with fewer adverse effects.Of the mu, delta, and kappa subtypes of opioid receptors, most analgesia is thought to derive from mu activation.Recent studies in pre-clinical pain models suggest that a synthetic opioid derivative, UMB 425, which both agonizes mu and antagonizes delta receptors, provides analgesia without the development of tolerance.Another compound, MMG22, both agonizes mu receptors for analgesia and antagonizes metabotropic glutamate",

      "abstract": "Opioid therapy for chronic pain has been popularized over the past few decades, and a concern has arisen that the analgesic efficacy of opioids is not always maintained over prolonged courses of treatment despite dose escalation and stable pain. Considering the potentially serious adverse effects of opioids, the idea that pain relief could diminish over time may have a significant impact on the decision to embark on this therapy, especially in vulnerable individuals. Possible loss of analgesic efficacy is especially concerning, considering that dependence may make it hard to withdraw opioid therapy even in the face of poor analgesia. This article first reviews the evidence on opioid efficacy when used for the treatment of chronic pain, and concludes that existing evidence suggests that analgesic efficacy, although initially good, is not always sustained during continuous and long-term opioid therapy (months to years). The theoretical basis for loss of analgesic efficacy over time is then examined. Mechanisms for loss of analgesic efficacy proposed are pharmacologic tolerance, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, subtle and intermittent withdrawal, and a number of psychologic factors including loss of the placebo component.",

Achalasia is seen in the gastroesophageal sphincter. Partial or complete failure of contraction occurs most commonly in the esophagus. In dyskinesia, the progressive sequence of the contraction is lost, and the entire organ or a part of it contracts simultaneously. Too much contraction for too long a period causes diffuse spasm. Refinements in technics of detection should result in better definition of esophageal motor disorders and better management of patients.",

The two major problem areas are pain associated with nerve damage, and 'incident' (movement-related) bone pain. Nerve damage pain tends not to respond well to morphine or other opioids. The difficulty with severe incident pain is that if the dose of opioid is titrated sufficiently to relieve the pain on weight-bearing or on movement and is then given regularly at this level, it is too much for the patient at rest. The patient may then experience excessive side-effects at rest, but still have pain on movement. Other examples of pain which may be resistant to treatment with opioid analgesics are bladder and rectal tenesmus, pancreatic pain, and pain associated with decubitus ulcers or other superficial ulcers subjected to pressure or shearing forces. Management of non-opioid-responsive pain may include a variety of treatments involving adjuvant analgesic drugs and non-drug measures.",

Sleep bruxism latest definition, epidemiology and etiologyIn accordance with the latest consensus, sleep bruxism (SB) is defined as a masticatory muscle activity during sleep, characterized as rhythmic (phasic) or non-rhythmic (tonic), and is not considered a movement disorder or a sleep disorder in otherwise healthy individuals. 1It is estimated to occur in up to 15% of the human adult population. 2 Despite many years of research, SB still constitutes a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.There are various risk factors that can contribute to SB: exogenous risk factors, such as smoking, heavy alcohol intake, caffeine, medications, or illicit drugs; psychosocial factors, including perceived stress and anxiety; sleep disorders, involving sleep arousal; and comorbidities, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). 3Recent research also indicates that SB may be related to the neurotransmission of the serotonin and/or dopamine pathway. 4,5Severe SB seem to co-occur with lower serotonin blood levels, but is not correlated with the blood levels of the enzymes involved in the serotonin synthesis pathway. 5There are also studies supporting the genetic background of SB.The latest studies suggest that the polymorphisms occurring within the genes encoding dopamine and serotonin receptors may be linked with predisposition to SB and SB pathogenesis, and may contribute to the association between SB and OSA in adults. 6Similar associations with regard to the genes encoding dopamine receptors have been observed in children. 7In children, the additional factors increasing SB are the consumption of sugar, screen-time and sleeping habits. 8,9",

Therefore, for cases in which verbal de-escalation fails, physical restraint and sedation may be required to ensure a safe environment where further acute care diagnosis and treatment can proceed., Treatment goals for this indication are rapid and safe sedation.Droperidol is a butyrophenone used in acute care settings for a variety of purposes, including the rapid sedation of patients with agitation, aggression, or who are exhibiting violent behaviour., Droperidol can be administered intravenously and it can also be administered intramuscularly, which has practical advantages when safely dealing with agitated patients. Many antipsychotic drugs, including droperidol, haloperidol, and olanzapine, have a similar adverse event profile that includes serious events such as respiratory depression, cardiac events, and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).In 2001, a black box warning was issued by the US FDA for the use of droperidol based on post-marketing surveillance data., The black box warning emphasized careful patient selection and increased monitoring to prevent corrected QT (QTc) interval elongation in patients administered droperidol. QTc elongation can lead to sudden cardiac death. The extra burden placed on management of patients with droperidol has greatly decreased its use and availability in the US.The purpose of this report was to retrieve and review the current evidence on the safety and efficacy of droperidol for patients with agitation, aggression, or violent behaviour in acute care settings. In addition, this report aimed to retrieve and review relevant evidence-based guidelines regarding the use of droperidol in acute care settings.",

They present: a)viral etiology from: Epstein-Barr virus with pyscho-somatic substrate. b)Immune factors: inflammatory cytokine IL-1, T.N.F. alpha. c)Organic etiology: alteration of biochemical and morphological markers, metabolic oxidative stress. d)Psychological or traumatic stress : anxiety, reactive depression, panic attacks whiplash. e)Environmental factors : change in electromagnetic fields, geopathic stress, pesticide poisoning with multiple chemical syndrome, mercury poisoning. f)Dietary factors : presence of glutamate in food. g)Gulf war syndrome : 30% of soldiers develop P. F. S. MATERIAL and METHODS: The patient is evaluated from a psychological point of view (psychological trauma), associated with the use of Acetyl-L-Carnitine, Naltrexone hydrocloride low dose and Cell Food-S-Adenosin Methionine. With additional therapies : Mineralogram , Chelation Therapy , Viral Seriology with Labò Live , Micro-immunotherapy (with homeopathic interleukin), Dr. Pierpaoli protocol with the use of vitamins A, D, E, C, Melatonin, Glutathione, Ubiquinone. Protocol: -Infiltration of the Trigger Points, mix of oxygen-ozone (O2O3) concentration 15-10 mcgrg/mL in cycles assessed with the Kinesiology Test (K.T.) -Minor Autohemotherapy (PAET) : concentration 20-15-10 mcgr/mL in cycles (K.T.) -Major Autohemotherapy (GAET) : concentration 20-15-10 mcgr/mL in cycles (K.T.) -Rectal insufflation (R.I.) : concentration 20-15-10 mcgr/mL in cycles (K.T.) From 1988 to 2017, I have treated 900 cases with this method, with the following results : significant symptom remission in the secondary form in around 60-70% of patients treated with infiltration of the Trigger Points and PAET. In more resistant cases, I have used homotoxicology, psychological counseling, Dr. Pierpaoli protocol and micro-immunotherapy RESULTS: These method results in good symptom remission in 50-60% of the cases treated. CONCLUSIONS: In the multi-factor genesis of PFS, an early diagnosis is important to prevent the pain occurring alongside psycho-somatic disturbances, which lead the subject into a reactive-depressive state. In the complex symptom variety, the obtained percentage results have improved with this additional method, as, by alleviating the symptoms, you assure a better quality of life for the patient.",

      "abstract": "Person with disability is person who is less or more disabled in everyday life during overcoming social,economic and other barriers for whom they are not able to succeed like average people.The main problem with person with disability is if he/she can normally funcionate less or more or he/she needs help from the other person.\r\n Physical disability is when some person do not have hand(s), leg(s), spleen or bile which causes weak imunity, or lungs, liver or kidney during surgical process. Sight lose , hearing or voice loseness after surgical process of carcinoma is sensory disability. Besides general decreased fitness for work there is a professional disability for fitness for work to the old-age disablement insurance regulation. Special part are persons with autism, mentally deficient and psychophysiologic disorder. There are different shapes of disability.\r\n Deaf and half-deaf are people with particulary or complete disability with hearing, in one of five basic human sensory. Particulary or complete hearing transformation disability caused in one or both ears. Deafness and partial deafness is hearing damage caused by sickness or injury.Partial deafness is caused by strong noise during explosion , diving-trauma, on work place and presbyacusis- an old-age partial hearness.\r\n Deaf and mute are people born with this problem and they are special category in this part. Speech disability is less important to the deaf people because they use body language ( read from lips) to comunicate with others. They know what other person thinks by reading their`s body position, movement dinamics, face and lips mimicking approach.\r\n There are differencies between couple in love or violent group of people. Also there is some advantage: deaf and mute people do not have to learn foreign languages because they have universal language. Deaf tourists with different parts of world, language and body colour can normally collect information with any television because he/she receives information from translator who gives hand movements which presents words for deaf people.\r\n Professional rehabilitation is procedure after medicinal rehabilitation. That is group of balanced rules with specifical goal for person with disabilty so he/she can achive\r\n 54\r\n economical and social abilities so they can find good place in community. The main goal is to help to person with disability to recruit or get a new job in case of professional incompetence.\r\n It is important to see how many work capacity person with disability have in relation to the average worker. It is important to see school and personal skills, work experince so they are treated to see performance and professional abilites for particular kind of job.\r\n After all comes some kind of fitness for work, retraining or additional qualification training.

      "abstract": "DESCRIPTION: There have been numerous case reports of adverse reactions involving monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), including reactions that developed when one MAOI was substituted for another. Although most reports have usually described a switch from isocarboxazid or phenelzine to tranylcypromine, we report a case of acute central nervous system toxicity possibly associated with a switch from phenelzine to isocarboxazid. SYMPTOMATOLOGY: Predominant symptoms included stuporous sensorium, hypertension, tachycardia, tremor, and urinary retention. Onset of symptoms began within 48 hours after the abrupt MAOI switch. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians must allow a sufficient washout period before adding any agent that has a known potential to interact adversely with MAOIs. In addition, patients who are unusually sensitive to one type of MAOI may also be at increased risk for developing problems with a different MAOI secondary to unforeseen pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic effects, even at doses that are usually considered subtherapeutic.",

The anxiety may be sustained, but more often is episodic from a few minutes to hours or days. The chief symptoms are those of anxiety and its physical concomitants in the absence of other illness and independent of specific situations; they include breathing and swallowing difficulties, palpitations, dizziness, irritability, and faintness. Depression, phobias, and obsessions are common complications. The syndrome occurs in young adults of both sexes and its course may be acute or chronic. Acute forms may present in epidemics which are culture bound, e.g., Koro and epidemic hysteria. Chronic forms can fluctuate and persist for many years without other physical or psychiatric syndromes appearing. Between attacks the patient feels fairly well. Prevalence is estimated at 2 to 5 per cent of the normal population and 6 to 27 per cent of psychiatric outpatients. The syndrome requires differentiation from depressive and phobic disorders and from physical conditions which produce anxiety.",

      "title": "Fatigue in Healthy and Diseased Individuals",
      "abstract": "Objectives: Although fatigue is experienced by everyone, its definition and classification remains under debate. Methods: A review of the previously published data on fatigue. Results: Fatigue is influenced by age, gender, physical condition, type of food, latency to last meal, mental status, psychological conditions, personality type, life experience, and the health status of an individual. Fatigue may not only be a symptom but also a measurable and quantifiable dimension, also known as fatigability. Additionally, it may be classified as a condition occurring at rest or under exercise or stress, as physiologic reaction or pathologic condition, as spontaneous phenomenon or triggerable state, as resistant or irresistant to preconditioning, training, or attitude, as prominent or collateral experience, and as accessible or inaccessible to any type of treatment or intervention. Fatigue may be the sole symptom of a disease or one among others. It may be also classified as acute or chronic. Quantification of fatigability is achievable by fatigue scores, force measurement, electromyography, or other means. Fatigue and fatigability need to be delineated from conditions such as sleepiness, apathy, exhaustion, exercise intolerance, lack of vigor, weakness, inertia, or tiredness. Among neurological disorders, the prevalence of fatigue is particularly increased in multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson disease, traumatic brain injury, stroke, and bleeding and also in neuromuscular disorders. Fatigue may be influenced by training, mental preconditioning, or drugs. Conclusions: Fatigue needs to be recognized as an important condition that is not only a symptom but may also be quantified and can be modified by various measures depending on the underlying cause.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Alcohol dysphoria is a pathognomonic, severe, and therapeutically resistant syndrome considerable for alcohol and drug-addicted patients. The term “dysphoria” (from Greek δυσφορέω to suffer, torment, annoy) means an abnormally low type of mood, characterized by anger, gloom, irritability, feelings of hostility to others. In addictology, it is often identified in the withdrawal syndrome structure. Objectives To develop innovative improvement in treatment for alcohol dysphoria. Methods Valid clinical diagnostic, laboratory, biochemical, electrophysiological, psychological (scaling, testing), statistical methods identifying alcohol dependence complicated by dysphoria. Results The proposed method involves a complex of anti-affective, anti-abstinence, anti-craving pharmacological agents and drug-free methods, and differs from those conventional, along with psychotherapeutic potentiation, by additional targeted pharmacological triad (peroral Carbamazepine 200 mg twice a day: in the morning and in the evening; intramuscular Halopril (Haloperidol) 1 ml (5 mg) daily; oral Sonapax 1 tablet (25 mg) three times a day for 3-5 day treatment) used for a new purpose. 17 patients experienced this method. Efficacy: alcohol dysphoria acute manifestations were relieved by our method within 3-5 days that 37.8% exceeds conventional treatment. In 15 minutes, patients decreased irritability, motor restlessness, stress, cravings for alcohol. In 30 minutes, the patients fell asleep. Sleep lasted 3.5 hours on average. Subsequently, patients denied craving for alcohol, calmed down emotionally and psychomotorically, wished to be treated for alcoholism. No dysphoric relapses were observed. Conclusions The proposed multimodality method alleviates alcohol-induced dysphoria, involving pharmacotherapeutic triad along with psychotherapeutic potentiation.",

These three functions may vary, from a normal base-line of activity, in either an overactive or an underactive direction. Overactivity leads to hypermotility, vascular engorgement, and excessive secretion; underactivity leads to hypomotility, vascular pallor, and minimal secretion. It is generally felt that these states are mediated through the rich innervation of the gastrointestinal tract with both sympathetic and parasympathetic elements of the autonomic nervous system. Extensive experimental work has shown that the most significant factors in varying states of motility, vascularity, and secretion appear to be emotional ones.* These three functions may change rapidly, within minutes, depending on the emotional state of the subject. Feelings of marked anxiety, unexpressed or unaware anger and resentment, and frustrated needs for affection may lead to hypermotility, hypervascularity, and hypersecretion.

      "abstract": "Opioids have long been associated with addiction and antisocial behavior. Yet recent experience and studies raise questions about the prohibition of chronic opioids in nonmalignant pain. From a purely pharmacologic point of view, opioids have perhaps the best side effect profile in our armamentarium. Studies suggest addiction is not as dependent on the nature of the drug as it is on the particular patient, some patients being highly addictable while the majority are not. Successful use of opioids for chronic nonmalignant pain depends on using them only when other measures have failed, when psychosocial and other addiction risk factors are clearly identified, and when guidelines and documentation are meticulous. Then opioids can often be used successfully to achieve good pain relief without undue risk of addiction or other side effects. The endpoint for opioid use is not the absolute dose of medications but rather the balance between benefits and side effects.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Dementia is characterized by an insidious and progressive loss of memory, disorientation, cognitive decline in other domains, and affective flattening. It is often accompanied by neuropsychological deficits such as aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or disturbances in executive functioning including planning, organizing, and sequencing of events in a logical fashion. Behavioural symptoms such as withdrawal, depression, delusions, motor restlessness, wander-ing, or aggression may complicate dementia, particularly in advanced stages of the disorder. These behavioural symptoms may occur, in part, secondary to loss of orientation and memory, with loss of autobiographic memory perhaps being most devastating. A patient, for example, who is impaired in retrieving past social interactions from autobiographical memory or recalling other relevant personal information may be more likely to respond with increasing irritability or anxiety in situations that are actually or perceived unfamiliar. Such a patient may perhaps choose a ‘safety first’ strategy or remain captured in indecisiveness, which could manifest in ruminating thinking and stereotyped behaviour, or displacement activities expressing motivational conflict and ambivalence. In any event, the combination of memory loss with other cognitive disturbances certainly leads to a profound deterioration of social competence. It is also noteworthy that, in addition to the problems the patients have themselves, which they generally deny except in the earliest stages of the disorder (anosognosia), dementia creates a substantial burden on patients’ spouses, children and other carers.",

      "title": "Clinical characteristics and treatment of treatment-resistant bipolar depression",
      "abstract": "Depression represents the predominant mood pole in bipolar disorder. Bipolar depression typically has a poor response to antidepressant medication, and also involves the risk of polarity shifts, induction of mixed states, and / or rapid cycle induction. The diagnosis of bipolar depression can be delayed by 8 to 10 years. The reason for this delay is mainly the fact that both manic and hypomanic episodes appear lately in the course of the disorder. It is therefore necessary to diagnose this clinical entity as early as possible versus monopolar depression in order to treat it more effectively. This differential diagnosis is based on certain clinical features of bipolar depression, which are often difficult to be distinguished from those of monopolar depression and therefore it is necessary to know specific criteria that differentiate them to some extent qualitatively and / or quantitatively. Such characteristics are daily mood swings, multiple physical complaints, psychomotor retardation, psychotic elements (delusions and perceptual disorders mood congruent or noncongruent), the disturbance of certain bodily functions, including circadian rhythms, sexual desire, appetite, and disorders of sleep architecture. The treatment of bipolar depression is based on the options known from monopolar depression (such as the use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and certain antiepileptic agents) and their combinations, while in recent years it has been enriched with new pharmaceutical agents and non-pharmacological approaches. New glutaminergic regulators dominate the new pharmacological agents' research, and among them the antidepressant effect of ketamine and esketamine at sub-anesthetic doses is being extensively investigated during recent years. Non-pharmacological approaches include methods such as electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), sleep deprivation, and phototherapy.",

      "abstract": "Baclofen, a GABA agonist, is frequently used to treat muscle spasticity due to spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis. Baclofen overdose can lead to coma, respiratory depression, hyporeflexia, and flaccidity. Because baclofen is primarily excreted unchanged through the kidneys, it should be given with caution, and it may be necessary to reduce the dosage.Signs of overdose may appear suddenly or insidiously. Acute massive overdose may present as coma. Less sudden and/or less severe forms of overdose may present with signs of CNS depression, excessive salivation, dizziness, nausea and/or vomiting, somnolence, and hypotonia. Should overdose appear likely, the patient should be taken immediately to a hospital. A 46‐year‐old man, who was treated by intermittent hemodialysis (three times a week), was admitted to our unit for signs of CNS depression, dizziness, vomiting, somnolence, and hypotonia. He was treated at the relatively low dose of baclofen, 5 mg/day, because of muscle spasticity due to spinal cord injury. His temperature was 37 °C, and predialysis laboratory data were hemoglobin 11.4 g/dl, white blood cells 6550/mm 3 with normal differential count, and platelets 330000/mm 3 . Serum sodium was 134 mmol/l, potassium 6.4 mmom/l, bicarbonate 18.3 mmol/l, urea 30 mmol/l, creatinine 998 μmol/l, glucose 5.16 mmol/l, and calcium level 2.4 mmol/l. Serum transaminases were normal. A brain computerized tomography (CT) scan showed no abnormalities. Baclofen‐associated encephalopathy was considered to be the most likely etiology for this acute neurological picture. Baclofen was then stopped. Plasma concentration of baclofen was &gt;600 ng/ml (therapeutic range 80–400 ng/ml) after 2 hours of hemodialysis and the baclofen level rapidly fell (&lt;200 ng/ml) at the end of the hemodialysis session. After the first 4‐h haemodialysis session, there was an incomplete recovery of the neurological status. After a renewed hemodialysis session the symptoms completely receded.The patient was discharged from the hospital 72 h later in a good condition. Patients with severely impaired renal function generally develop baclofen intoxication soon after the initiation of low‐dose therapy. Thus, the administration of baclofen, regardless of the dosage, in these patients is not appropriate.",

      "abstract": "This chapter deals with the diagnosis of mood disorders. The adoption of a lumping strategy for mood disorders, particularly for classifying depressive disorders, reflects the perspective of depression as a unitary construct that represents a final common pathway derived from a variety of etiological and pathophysiological sources, which accounts for the shared clinical features seen in the heterogeneous groups of depressive disorders. A diagnosis of a major depressive episode (MDE) is made by recognizing the characteristic syndrome of symptoms that cluster together during the same period of time. The hallmark of manic and hypomanic episodes is a discrete period of abnormally elevated, euphoric, expansive, or irritable mood that persists for at least a week in the case of mania or at least 4 days in the case of hypomania. Major depressive disorder is characterized by one or more major depressive episodes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Obsessions are described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) as recurrent intrusive thoughts, impulses, or images that produce marked anxiety or discomfort. The content of obsessions is ego‐dystonic, meaning that they are experienced as intrusive, unwanted, and generally inconsistent with one's self‐image, values, beliefs, and behaviors. Obsessions differ from ego‐syntonic thoughts about everyday problems (e.g., recurrent thoughts or worries about finances, occupation, relationships, and the like) and should be distinguished from the “brooding” ruminations that are common in depression. Typical obsessions include doubts about whether one did something adequately (e.g., turned off the stove); intrusive sexual, aggressive, or religious thoughts or images (e.g., horrific image of stabbing a friend); thoughts about contamination; and excessive concerns about symmetry or exactness. Individuals with Obsessive‐Compulsive Disorder (OCD) experience frequent obsessions that are severe enough to cause significant functioning impairment and try to suppress or neutralize their obsessions with other thoughts or compulsive actions. Unlike individuals with psychotic or delusional disorders, individuals with OCD generally recognize their obsessions as senseless and know that the obsessions originate in their own minds.",

      "title": "Trichotillomania: Its Classification and Treatment",
      "abstract": "Trichotillomania is categorized as an Impulse-Control Disorder. The following article brings to light that this disorder man not be as rare as some clinicians think. The following discussion delineates Trichotillomania in terms of its descriptive characteristics, onset and course, associated disorders, relationship to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and treatment. Research indicates a combination of psychopharmacology and cognitive-behavioral therapy as the choice of treatment for this disorder. Following the content discussion of Trichotillomania is a transcript of an interview with one of the authors (K. A.) who was previously diagnosed with Trichotillomania. INTRODUCTION Trichotillomania is categorized as an Impulse-Control Disorder and is defined by the following five criteria listed in the DSM-IV (1994): a) recurrent pulling of one's hair resulting in noticeable hair loss, b) an increasing sense of tension immediately before pulling out the hair or when attempting to resist the behavior, c) pleasure, gratification, or relief when pulling out the hair, d) the disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental disorder and is not due to a general medical condition, e) the disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. (p. 621) This article seeks to provide an overview of Trichotillomania in terms of its history and descriptive characteristics, onset and course of illness, associated disorders, its relationship to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and the treatment of choice for Trichotillomania. HISTORY AND DESCRIPTIVE CHARACTERISTICS History In 1889 a French dermatologist, Hallopeau, described a man who pulled out his hair in large amounts (Swedo, 1993). Hallopeau used the term trichotillomania to describe this behavior. Before Hallopeau's encounter with his client, references to hair-pulling had already been documented. In 1779, Baudament reported on a 16-year-old boy who pulled out his hair and actually ate it. Eventually, this ingestion of hair led to gastrointestinal problems because the boy developed hair balls in his stomach (Christenson & Mackenzie, 1994). Once thought to be rare, this disorder is far from uncommon. It has been estimated that approximately eight million Americans are afflicted with this disorder (Azrin & Nunn, 1978). A survey conducted by Rothbaum, Shaw, Morris, and Ninan (1993) revealed that of the 490 college freshman respondents, 10% reported compulsive hair-pulling. Despite these statistics, the literature is very scarce regarding this disorder. Characteristics Trichotillomania is predominately found in the female population. Christenson, Mackenzie, and Mitchell (1991) found that 93% of 60 adult chronic hair-pullers were women. Likewise, Swedo and Leonard (1992) found that 70% of 43 sampled children, adolescents, and adults who were chronic hair-pullers were female. Christenson and Mackenzie (1994) found a more equal sex ratio in children under the age of six. Hair-pulling can occur from many body locations. A study done by Swedo and Leonard (1992) found that the most common area from which hair is pulled is the scalp, followed by eyelashes, eyebrows, pubis, body (arm/leg), and face (beard). Most individuals pluck hair from at least two sites, with sites varying over time. Those diagnosed with this disorder typically think that the hair that is pulled is somehow different from other hair. For example, chronic hair-pullers may pluck kinky or course hair so that they may feel right about their hair, thus reducing anxiety (Swedo & Rapoport, 1991.). After the hair is pulled, other ritualistic acts can follow. For instance, some individuals will play with or twirl their extracted hair, while others may brush it against their cheeks or lips. Some individuals will even go as far as ingesting their hair (trichophagia), possibly leading to gastrointestinal difficulties or even death (Swedo & Leonard, 1992). …",

      "abstract": "Besides cognitive changes, dementia disorders have other very important symptoms. Some of these symptoms, that include an array of behavioral and psychiatric manifestations, are known as behavioral and psychiatric (or psychological) symptoms of dementia (BPSD). For several reasons they are an important case for General Practitioner consultation. Some of the se symptoms tend to oc cur si mul ta ne ously, in factors, such as psychosis (agitation and aggressiveness), mood (depression and anxiety), frontal behavior (desinhibition and euphoria), apathy and insomnia. The cause of these symptoms can be dementia itself, and in some situations they are a core diagnostic feature in the diagnosis. However, the possibility of a drug or a somatic disease as a cause for the se symptoms must always be actively sought, especially if the BPSD have a particular clinical presentation. So, the exclusion of another medial disorder (that is non demential) is mandatory. After excluding other causes, a treatment with an anti-dementia drug must be offered, as there is evidence that acetylcholines terase inhibitors and memantine improve, not only cognition, but also BPSD in some dementia (including Alzheimer's disease). Then, non-pharmacologial measures must be started. However, a pharmacological treatment with psychotropic drugs should also be started, if treatment is urgent or the symptoms severe. The symptom or symptoms should be identified and the therapeutic targeted for those specific symptoms. Despite the clinical trials performed with psychotropics for BPSD are uncommon and sometimes have questionable designs, it is very important to treat these symptoms. Care givers should also be instructed on how to deal with BPSD. Whenever a BPSD is difficult to control, especially if not improving after a trial with the measures here described, a referral for Neurologic or Psychiatric evaluation should be done. There ferral note should be \"BPSD [specify] severe and not improving after treatment with [specify]\".",

Insomnia or Nidranasha, is not just about being not getting proper sleep but it means that the nervous system has been weakened and reduces our ability to cope up with daily sleep. Insomnia is named as Nidranasha, happens due to vitiation of Kapha, Pitta and Vata dosha. Proper and deep sleep helps the person keep Energetic, Enthusiastic, does Brumhana, increases the Bala, increases vigour and vitality and most it keeps the Mind in stable state for gaining knowledge. Insomnia means inability to get sleep at night or inability to have a restful and sound sleep. Insomnia is typically followed by daytime sleepiness, low energy, irritability, and a depressed mood. Insomnia can be short term, lasting for days or weeks, or long term, lasting more than a month. Insomnia can occur independently or as a result of another problem. Conditions that can result in insomnia include psychological stress, chronic pain, heart failure, hyperthyroidism, heartburn, Alzheimerâ€™s disease and Parkinsonâ€™s disease, Arthritis, menopause, and certain medications, and drugs such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol. Treatment of Insomnia:- Panchakarma â€“ Taila dhara a type of Shirodhara is very much useful in combacting the Insomnia caused due to various above said disorders.

Based on the National Center for Sleep Disorders Research Classification,5 insomnia symptoms can be defined as subjective complaints of difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early awakening and non refreshing sleep despite an adequate opportunity to sleep. An important consideration is whether the presence of one or more of these symptoms causes significant impairment to the patient’s social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Insomnia can be due to primary or secondary causes. Primary insomnia refers to insomnia that appears to be unrelated to any identifiable underlying medical or psychiatric disorder.6,7 Secondary causes of insomnia include conditions where another disorder contributing to or aggravating the insomnia can be diagnosed (Table1). The diagnosis of sleep disorders is often based on obtaining a detailed sleep history, a neuropsychiatric evaluation, a physical examination looking for medical and other disorders, mental status examination and relevant investigations. A sleep diary that the patient maintains in which sleep-relevant behaviours such as bedtime and waking times, awakenings, total sleep time, napping, medications, alcohol and mood on waking often provides valuable information for the patient and physician.

      "abstract": "This epidemic encephalitis differs from the usual lethargic type of the disease in that practically hone of the patients fall into a deep sleep, but are merely drowsy the greater part of the time during the febrile period. The cases which we have admitted have varied a great deal in severity. The following symptoms are present in varying degrees in all cases: headache (usually quite severe), elevated temperature with low pulse rate. (lasting usually only five days), photophobia, rigidity of neck, pain in back, dizziness, nausea, drowsiness, decrease in size of pupils, hesitancy of speech, muscular pains, constipation, furring and tremor of tongue, tremor of outstretched fingers, absence of abdominal reflexes, and knee and ankle jerks of low grade. Occasionallythere is a facial paralysis and paralysis of one extremity or both on the same side, coma, and retention of urine or inability to void. An aphasia for happenings during the febrile period is usually present when the patient begins to improve. Lumbar punctures show increased pressure, increased cell count and a positive Pandy. The normal spinal fluid cell count is below 10; positive Pandy is a spinal fluid test denoting increased globulin, thereby denoting inflammation of the cord-positive in such diseases as meningitis and latent syphilis. Quite frequently a patient is admitted with only a slight headache and slightly elevated temperature. These patients are admitted to another floor for the initial lumbar puncture. If this is negative, the patient is kept in this department until the puncture is repeated twentyfour hours later. If it is again negative, the patient is sent home. If it is positive, the patient is transported to the encephalitis division. In these instances the lumbar puncture is the only diagnostic measure. Since there is no serum the medical care consists chiefly of symptomatic treatment to give the patient comfort. Lumbar punctures are done when severe headaches are not relieved by aspirin or pyramidon 0.6 gram every four hours, or when elevation of temperature or rigidity of neck persists. Drawing off spinal fluid relieves pressure thereby relieving the above symptoms. Fifty per cent glucose is given intravenously to reduce the edema and pressure of the brain as well as for food value. Subcutaneous saline is given when patients are dehydrated due to inability to force fluid by mouth because of drowsiness. The nursing care in most instances consists of forcing fluids, especially fruit juices to build up a glycogen reserve to combat complicating infections by keeping up a high resistance.",

      "abstract": "Patients with hyponatremia are exposed to major neurological complications. On the one hand hyponatremia itself produces brain edema, increased intracranial pressure which potentially leads to subsequent neuropathological sequelae or death. On the other hand excessive correction could be followed by development of brain demyelinating lesions (central pontine or extrapontine myelinolysis) with major disability or fatal outcome. Understanding of brain adaptative mechanisms to changes in osmolality largely contributes to explain these neurological events. When serum sodium decreases, the brain prevents swelling by extruding electrolytes and organic osmolytes, a process almost fully achieved after 48 h. Conversely, during subsequent increase in serum sodium, reestablishment of intracerebral osmolytes occurs but their reuptake is more delayed (+/- 5 days). In both circumstances, these mechanisms can be overwhelmed, leading to brain damage. Acute hyponatremia (< 48 h) is generally hospital-acquired, mainly in the postoperative state and/or after excessive fluid administration. After abrupt fall in serum sodium, seizure, respiratory arrest and coma may develop and these manifestations are sometimes explosive in nature. Recognition of even minor symptoms is crucial and implies prompt correction. There is generally no risk of brain myelinolysis in acute hyponatremia. Some factors are suspected to aggravate the prognosis of hyponatremic encephalopathy, including female gender (menstruant women), hypoxia and young age. Chronic hyponatremia (> 48 h) usually develops outside the hospital and is generally better tolerated. The risks of brain myelinolysis can be largely reduced by limiting the correction level to < or = 15 mEq/1/24 h. However, if necessary, the initial rate of correction can be rapid provided that the final correction remains < 15 mEq/1/24 h. However, when other recognized risk factors for myelinolysis (hypokalemia, liver disease, poor nutritional state, burns) are present, correction should not exceed 10 mEq/1/24 h. Demyelinization is also observed in hypernatremia but it follows greater (50%) increase in serum sodium than from hyponatremic baseline. For symptomatic hyponatremia, rapid correction is usually obtained by hypertonic saline (3%) infusion. Another option consists in administration of intravenous or oral urea. Urea allows a rapid reduction of brain edema and intracranial pressure which is followed by subsequent correction of hyponatremia. Experimental data also suggest that treatment of hyponatremia with urea is associated with a lower incidence of myelinolysis. In hyponatremic patients without symptoms, there is no need for rapid correction and the treatment should be more conservative. Close monitoring of the serum sodium is indicated initially and if necessary, correction must be stopped and diuresis interrupted with dDAVP. Given recent experimental data, in patients overly corrected (delta SNa > 15 mEq/1/24 h), the risk of myelinolysis could be greatly reduced by rapidly decreasing the serum sodium through hypotonic fluids administration and dDAVP.",

      "title": "Treatment of Mental Health in Patients With Chronic Liver Disease",
      "abstract": "Answer questions and earn CME Content available: Author Interview and Audio Recording The term depression represents a constellation of symptoms that are largely nonspecific in respect to diagnosis. At one extreme is an \"everyday depression,\" a person's experience in the face of a specific challenge, such as paying one's taxes. At the opposite extreme is major depressive disorder (MDD) described by profound subjective hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness. Biological symptoms occur, including sleep continuity disorder with early-morning awakening, a diurnal variation of mood, and anhedonia. Because of their nonspecificity, other conditions may easily mimic depression, including symptoms of chronic liver disease (CLD), such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and delirium. The key therefore is to apply careful, psychiatric differential diagnoses, especially in CLD. Notably, this article focuses on depression and anxiety, while important coexisting or independent mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse, are not discussed. In any evaluation of a patient with depression and/or anxiety, the aforementioned mental health disorders should be evaluated for and managed appropriately. Patients with CLD can have profoundly altered pharmacokinetics resulting in higher systemic drug levels. Portosystemic shunting in cirrhosis reduces the first-pass metabolism of high-extraction medications.1 The volume of distribution (Vd) is further impacted by decreased transport proteins and ascites and peripheral edema. In addition, drugs eliminated by hepatic metabolism or biliary excretion can have dramatically reduced clearance. The stage of cirrhosis and location of pathology also affect drug metabolism, with glucuronidation often preserved in early cirrhosis compared with cytochrome P450 enzymatic activity, while entities affecting the centrilobular region, such as alcohol-related liver disease, where oxidative functions are focused, impact enzymatic activity to a different degree to a disease affecting the portal region.1 There are additional complexities to consider in CLD, including HE and benzodiazepine sensitivity. In patients with severe MDD (9-item patient health questionnaire [PHQ-9] ≥ 20), the preferred initial treatment is pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, which is more efficacious than either treatment modality alone (Fig. 1).2 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered for severe suicidality. For mild-to-moderate MDD (PHQ-9 < 20), initial monotherapy with either second-generation antidepressants (SGAs), such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (Table 1), or psychotherapy is reasonable.3 SGAs and psychotherapy have each shown efficacy as monotherapies and have comparable efficacy and tolerability.3 SGAs are the first-line pharmacological agents due to their efficacy and safety (remission rate of 43% versus 29% in placebo)4 and are comparable across and within respective categories.5 The seminal STAR*D study, which captured a broadly \"real-world\" representative patient sample with both medical and psychiatric comorbidities, reported a 37% remission rate with citalopram as first-line therapy.6 Given the comparable efficacy among SGAs, drug selection is based on symptoms, adverse effects, comorbidities, patient preference, affordability, and prior medication experiences. Importantly, SGAs are low-risk hepatotoxic medications with only rare asymptomatic mild elevation of serum aminotransferases (0.5-1%). A specific concern for SSRIs in CLD is their association with gastrointestinal bleeding partly attributed to serotonin transporter inhibition on platelets affecting platelet aggregation after vascular injury.1 Although the clinical evidence is mixed, caution should still be used with coprescribing of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antiplatelets.1 Concomitant proton pump inhibitors can be considered to mitigate the risk for bleeding in the more vulnerable patients who have thrombocytopenia or additional risk factors for bleeding. The atypical antidepressant, bupropion, is useful in mitigating sexual dysfunction given the lower rate versus SSRIs/SNRIs (6% versus 16%) or for treating comorbid tobacco dependence, whereas mirtazapine should be avoided in patients with features of metabolic syndrome (~3 kg weight gain after 8 weeks).7 Trazodone is useful for insomnia given its higher rate of somnolence versus SGAs, including mirtazapine (42% versus 25%), and can be considered as first-line therapy if insomnia is a large component of the somatic symptoms, with mirtazapine as an alternative.7 The adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors limit their routine use. Antidepressants should be initiated with low doses.1 In CLD, no change is required in the initial dose for SSRIs/SNRIs; however, a target maintenance dose of half of standard dosing is recommended.1 Subsequent titration is based on the balance of response and adverse effects. The dosing principles of SSRIs/SNRIs are the same for TCA use in CLD; however, the risk for HE precipitation needs consideration. It is also recommended to reduce the bupropion and mirtazapine dose by 50%.1 Time to improvement is around 2 weeks; however, most patients do not achieve remission after initial treatment,7 necessitating therapy switch or augmentation with additional interventions. Should patients display minimal improvement after 4 to 6 weeks, the next treatment step is titration to the maximum tolerated dose, an early switch to an alternative SGA,8 or augmentation with psychotherapy.9 The previously referenced STAR*D experience reported 31%, 14%, and 13% remission rates for second, third, and fourth acute pharmacotherapy treatment steps, respectively.6 No one psychotherapy is clearly superior in MDD; however, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal psychotherapy are first line because they have been more widely studied.10 CBT involves identifying and changing maladaptive beliefs, improving emotional regulation, and developing personal coping strategies. CBT is effective as monotherapy with higher remission rates achieved versus controls (waiting list or usual care) (41% versus 21%).10 Interpersonal psychotherapy is an attachment-focused psychotherapy that centers on resolving interpersonal problems and symptomatic recovery.10 An important consideration is a patient's willingness to engage fully in psychotherapy, which is crucial in optimizing behavioral intervention efficacy. There are additional behavioral therapies that can be considered, including family therapy, problem-solving therapy, and relaxation techniques. Exercise programs can also be considered depending on tolerability and illness extent.11 Anxiety symptoms are likewise nonspecific and require careful differential diagnosis. Treatment can be deferred with clinical follow-up in mild generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; GAD-7 < 10) if symptoms do not interfere significantly with functioning. For patients who warrant treatment, SSRIs/SNRIs and/or CBT are the established first-line interventions (Fig. 1).12 The benefit of medication and CBT are similar, and the choice of which to use, if not using both, is determined by patient preference, availability, affordability, and adverse effects. There are no differences in the efficacy between SSRIs/SNRIs, and their dosing in CLD is the same as for MDD.12 Patients who have a suboptimal response to a SSRI/SNRI after 4 to 6 weeks should be reassessed for co-occurring untreated conditions or ongoing stressors requiring greater problem-solving focus. If no co-occurring exacerbating factors are elicited, then a different SSRI/SNRI should be initiated. If no response occurs after two SSRI/SNRI trials, then augmentation with either a nonaddictive second-line medication (e.g., buspirone, pregabalin, or hydroxyzine) or CBT should be initiated. Hydroxyzine is useful for short-term control of anxiety symptoms, in lieu of benzodiazepines. If benzodiazepines are being considered in CLD, then short-acting benzodiazepines such as lorazepam (which has no active metabolites) should be prescribed to mitigate the risk for drug accumulation. However, the risk for benzodiazepine dependence, whereby patients develop various behavioral and physical symptoms, including tolerance (loss of efficacy over time) and a withdrawal syndrome with medication cessation, limits their utility. Moreover, patients with CLD treated with at least 3 days of benzodiazepines are at a high risk for developing first-time HE possibly related to increased cerebral benzodiazepine receptor availability in CLD, particularly among patients with alcohol use disorder. Notably, pregabalin (through its agonism of GABA) and hydroxyzine (via its anticholinergic effects) can also increase the risk for HE, and thus patients with CLD who are taking these medications should be monitored carefully. Aerobic exercise, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and yoga may also be worthwhile adjunctive treatments.13 In addition, web-based and telehealth interventions will continue to be incorporated into patient management in the near future.14 If effective, medication for GAD should be continued for at least 12 months given the lower relapse rate versus 6 months of therapy (8.8% versus 53.7%).15 If the patient relapses after cessation of an effective medication, the same medication can be restarted and the treatment course extended.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Functional dyspepsia (FD) is characterized by upper gastrointestinal symptoms such as early satiety, postprandial fullness, and epigastric pain or burning sensations. FD is commonly reported in women. According to the Rome III criteria, FD has two subtypes: postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) and epigastric pain syndrome (EPS). In current clinical practice, the two subtypes often overlap in their presentation. Here, we present the case of a female patient who presented with symptoms of epigastric pain syndrome and achieved symptom relief with the anxiolytic gastric fundus relaxing agent buspirone. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: A 71-year-old female with PMH of GERD, IBS, and anxiety that was well controlled with medications presented to the ED with complaints of non-radiating epigastric pain at a 7/10 intensity level intermittent since many months, and she reported no known aggravating or relieving factors. She denied any associated symptoms of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. In the past, she had been prescribed multiple medications such as antacids, PPI, and an anti-spasmodic agent for epigastric pain, and was also given antibiotics for possible SIBO. EGD revealed completely normal findings and no evidence of an ulcer or visible bleeding. The patient tested negative for H. pylori. After admission, she was started on a trial of 10 mg buspirone twice daily. She reported partial relief in the hospital and was discharged home. At the 1-month follow up at the GI clinic, the patient reported complete improvement in symptoms. DISCUSSION: EPS is characterized by symptoms such as an intermittent, non-generalized epigastric burning sensation, and a lack of relief with defecation or passage of flatus. Diagnosis of EPS remains exclusionary after all structural causes have been ruled out and according to the Rome III criteria, patients should have had symptoms for the past 3 months, and symptom onset should have occurred at least 6 months before the diagnosis. Reassurance and counseling have major roles. Other available agents such as antacids, PPIs, and prokinetics were reported in the treatment of EPS. Buspirone use for EPS has rarely been reported in the literature. Buspirone acts by activating 5 HT1A receptors on the presynaptic nerve endings of cholinergic neurons, thus inducing smooth muscle relaxation. Limited data are currently available on the efficacy of buspirone compared with other drugs used in the treatment of EPS. In the future, more research is needed to validate this use of buspirone.",

Physicians may initiate treatment of insomnia at an initial visit; for patients with a clear acute stressor such as grief, no further evaluation may be indicated. However, if insomnia is severe or long-lasting, a thorough evaluation to uncover coexisting medical, neurologic, or psychiatric illness is warranted. Treatment should begin with nonpharmacologic therapy, addressing sleep hygiene issues and exercise. There is good evidence supporting the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy. Exercise improves sleep as effectively as benzodiazepines in some studies and, given its other health benefits, is recommended for patients with insomnia. Hypnotics generally should be prescribed for short periods only, with the frequency and duration of use customized to each patient's circumstances. Routine use of over-the-counter drugs containing antihistamines should be discouraged. Alcohol has the potential for abuse and should not be used as a sleep aid. Opiates are valuable in pain-associated insomnia. Benzodiazepines are most useful for short-term treatment; however, long-term use may lead to adverse effects and withdrawal phenomena. The better safety profile of the newer-generation nonbenzodiazepines (i.e., zolpidem, zaleplon, eszopidone, and ramelteon) makes them better first-line choices for long-term treatment of chronic insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) is a chronic and debilitating illness characterized by episodic mood disturbance (e.g., extreme irritability, euphoria, and/or depression), accompanying symptoms (e.g., energy shifts, sleep disruption, cognitive disturbance of self/abilities, suicidality), high rates of comorbidities, and considerable functional impairment. Although PBD has biological underpinnings, cognitive, behavioral, and environmental stressors can trigger or exacerbate depressive and manic symptoms. Thus, while pharmacotherapy is effective for controlling biological contributions to mood episodes, psychotherapy is also necessary to target psychosocial factors that may activate or worsen symptoms in PBD, and to address associated academic, interpersonal, and functional impairment.",

Because of the potential for serious adverse effects, opioids should be prescribed only if the clinician is familiar with their use and associated risks. If pain is not controlled, consider pharmacogenetic effects or the addition of adjuvant therapy. In states with prescription drug monitoring programs, clinicians must access these programs regularly when prescribing a controlled substance.

      "title": "REVIEW: Behavioural assessment of drug reinforcement and addictive features in rodents: an overview",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Some psychoactive drugs are abused because of their ability to act as reinforcers. As a consequence behavioural patterns (such as drug‐seeking/drug‐taking behaviours) are promoted that ensure further drug consumption. After prolonged drug self‐administration, some individuals lose control over their behaviour so that these drug‐seeking/taking behaviours become compulsive, pervading almost all life activities and precipitating the loss of social compatibility. Thus, the syndrome of addictive behaviour is qualitatively different from controlled drug consumption. Drug‐induced reinforcement can be assessed directly in laboratory animals by either operant or non‐operant self‐administration methods, by classical conditioning‐based paradigms such as conditioned place preference or sign tracking, by facilitation of intracranial electric self‐stimulation, or, alternatively by drug‐induced memory enhancement. In contrast, addiction cannot be modelled in animals, at least as a whole, within the constraints of the laboratory. However, various procedures have been proposed as possible rodent analogues of addiction’s major elements including compulsive drug seeking, relapse, loss of control/impulsivity, and continued drug consumption despite negative consequences. This review provides an extensive overview and a critical evaluation of the methods currently used for studying drug‐induced reinforcement as well as specific features of addictive behaviour.

Residual cognitive effects were observed in some but not in all tests after prolonged heavy cannabis use. The effects were mostly mild. The relationship of cannabis use, psychotic effects and schizophrenia was unclear; the cannabis conceivably gave relief, but it also appeared that cannabis caused schizophrenia in young people and (or) enhanced the symptoms, especially in young people poorly able to cope with stress or in whom the antipsychotic therapy was unsuccessful.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation training for adults diagnosed with schizophrenia: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this review is to systematically search, appraise and synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) in the human responses of adults with schizophrenia and no positive symptoms of disease, in any setting, regarding anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, sadness, conversation, and well-being. More specifically, the review will focus on the following question: What is the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation training on anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being in adults with schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is often characterized by a long prodromal phase and a gradual change in psychosocial functioning, with symptoms that could include changes in affect (such as anxiety, irritability and depression), cognition (such as difficulty in concentration or memory), thought content (such as preoccupation with new ideas), physical changes (such as sleep disturbance and loss of energy), social withdrawal and impairment of role functioning.1,2 Anxiety is a prominent symptom, early in the course of schizophrenia, and is viewed both as a co-morbidity and a clinical expression of schizophrenia.3 Anxiety can be a stress factor that worsens existing prodromes or symptoms, leading to a vicious circle of growing stress and increased symptoms.4 Overall, the consequences alone or in combination of these components of anxiety generate a reduced efficiency of behaviour. The anxious individual, in addition to avoiding or escaping from situations, also shows inhibition in many other activities such as establishing contact and performing professional activities outside his/her routine.5,6 The physiological and cognitive aspects can create a vicious circle with negative thoughts leading to sympathetic changes, which are themselves interpreted in a negative way. The result can be a spiraling of anxiety.6 “Stress is an everyday fact of life, and we can't avoid it”.8(p.1) “Nervous tension is a more frequent ailment than the common cold. It is a greater danger because tension can reduce your efficiency, destroy your health and shorten your life”.7(p.1) We consider that day-to-day living confronts the person with a continuous stream of potentially stressful situations. If stress is acknowledged as reasonable, it becomes propulsive, constituting an impulse that causes the individual to make decisions, solve problems, and improve his/her functioning and abilities. In this sense, stress will help motivate the individual to achieve desirable goals, giving some flavor to life and providing an incentive for personal and professional achievement.8,9 We can experience stress from four basic sources: the Environment (the environment besieges you with demands to adjust); Social Stressors (the demands of the different social roles we play); Physiological Sources (transitions affecting our body); and Thoughts (our brain interprets and perceives complex changes in our environment and body, and determines whether they are a problem for us and when to turn to “emergency responses”).8 The anxiety experienced in day-to-day life situations is, therefore, interpreted as a complex set of emotions, and a personality trait or a state of the individual which combines three components: cognitive, vegetative, and motor. The cognitive component relates to all thoughts and feelings developed by someone who is anxious, and relates to what the person states that he/she feels. The vegetative component translates the physiological arousal of the individual when he/she is anxious. This activation is specific to each person so it may present great variability of responses such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, changes in gastric motility, urinary emergency, sweating, and increased muscle tension. The motor component refers to the previously addressed avoidance and escape responses determined by anxiety, limiting the individual's purview expressed through tense postures and different types of unrelaxed activities.5 One way of breaking the anxiety circle would be to reinterpret bodily changes in a positive thoughts form (cognitive approach). Another way would be to use relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation (physiological theory). A third way would be to introduce graded exposure to the feared situation (behavioural approach).6 Relaxation is conceptualized as a complex response class involving motor, visceral, observational responses and verbal behaviour. Motor behaviour involves action of the skeletal muscles. Visceral responding is concerned with homeostatic functions including breathing, temperature, and muscle tension. Observational responses seek out stimuli in the environment (e.g. a quiet park setting) or generate discriminative stimuli (e.g. “seeing” a quiet park setting). Verbal behaviour is concerned with overt or covert vocal behaviour (e.g. “I am tense”) in relation to relaxed behaviour.10 Many relaxation techniques aim to increase awareness of areas of chronic unconscious muscle tension. They often involve a conscious attempt to release and relax during exhalation. Frequently, habituation occurs with repeated exposure, but some people continue to react as if they were seeing this particular stressor for the first time. Mental escape techniques, such as imagery or relaxation therapy, can help decrease arousal, but learning is essential to adaptation. Most relaxation techniques are enjoyable, and many healthy individuals practice them without having particular health problems.11,12 There are two general purposes of tension control: prophylactic and therapeutic. By learning to relax differentially 24 hours a day, a person can increase the likelihood of preventing a stress or tension disorder. For a person already thus victimized, clinical PMR can often ease or eliminate the condition.11 Most relaxation techniques need to be practiced daily. Typically, patients learn a relaxation technique over the course of eight weekly classes, each lasting an hour or so. Between classes, they practice by themselves for 15 to 30 minutes a day. After the course is over, patients are encouraged to continue on their own, though they may take further classes to learn advanced techniques or to maintain group support.12 PMR was originally developed by Edmund Jacobson, and his original method required dozens of sessions where the participant was taught to relax 30 different muscle groups. Training consisted of successive tensing and relaxing of muscle groups, beginning with the upper body and proceeding to the lower parts.13 Based on different sources, we can state that recently there has been a growing interest in relaxation techniques in the multidisciplinary treatment of patient's response to schizophrenia symptomatology. The only existing revision, within this topic, “Progressive muscle relaxation in persons with schizophrenia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials”, aims to assess the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) on psychological distress and anxiety symptoms and on response/remission for people with schizophrenia. The three selected randomized controlled trials (RCT) involved 146 patients, and authors concluded that PMR can acutely reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being. No studies investigated the evidence for PMR as an add-on treatment for psychopathology, or for positive or negative symptoms, or for relapse prevention. This review demonstrates that PMR might be a useful add-on treatment to reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being in persons with schizophrenia. It further demonstrates that PMR may be offered in both acute and chronic inpatient treatment settings.6 The recent research “Acute effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety and subjective well-being in chronic Bulgarian patients with schizophrenia” aimed to provide evidence on the effectiveness of PMR as means of alleviating the state anxiety and psychological distress and a way to increase subjective well-being in chronic patients with schizophrenia. Sixty-four schizophrenia patients underwent two PMR sessions which were offered once a week and lasted approximately 25 minutes13 Results revealed significant decreased state anxiety and psychological stress, and increased subjective well-being within the experimental group, and it is noteworthy that both groups differed significantly in all post-measures. Therefore, this study provides scientific evidence for the use of PMR in patients with schizophrenia in chronic psychiatric settings, offering an easy method to learn healthy alternatives to cope with subjective stress and state anxiety. A recent RCT on effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety aimed to examine the efficacy of a single progressive muscle relaxation session compared with a control condition on state anxiety, psychological stress, fatigue and subjective well-being in patients with acute inpatient schizophrenia. Sixty-four patients were randomly assigned to either a single progressive muscle relaxation session of 25 minutes or a resting control condition with the opportunity to read for an equal amount of time.14 The results show that the 27 PMR group participants showed decreased state anxiety, psychological stress and fatigue and increased subjective well-being. Between-group differences in post scores were found for state anxiety, subjective well-being and psychological stress, but not for fatigue. The authors state that PMR is highly effective in reducing acute feelings of stress and anxiety in patients with schizophrenia. A reduction in stress and state anxiety is associated with an increase in subjective well-being.14 Another recent RCT on efficacy of progressive muscle relaxation training in reducing anxiety assigned 18 randomized patients to experimental and control groups. The experimental group received PMR training and the control group received a placebo intervention. Results show that the anxiety level improvement was significantly higher in the PMR training group after intervention and at follow-up, and the mean Beck Anxiety Inventory score fell from moderate anxiety on the pre-test to normal anxiety on the post-test.15 Therefore, the authors state that PMR training is a potentially effective nursing intervention to reduce anxiety in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, depending on the quality of their mental status at the time of intervention.15 The recent research about development of self-control strategies and stress management aimed to verify the impact of self-control skills and a stress management programme. During nine months, 14 participants with schizophrenia took part in a psycho-educative programme based on the relaxation principles of Jacobson, Shultz, and Desoille.16 Significant differences were found between pre- and post-test evaluations, revealing a decrease in stress levels and an increase in coping strategies, especially related with “self-control”, “assuming responsibility”, and “positive re-evaluation”. Furthermore, it is relevant to comprise all possible limitations of this therapy. Despite the fact that PMR sessions were experienced with satisfaction and wellness, a certain degree of motivation is necessary to embrace the regular use of this technique on a daily or weekly basis. Most publications indicate that adverse events resulting from relaxation techniques seem to be extremely uncommon; however, patients with heart and cardiovascular diseases, as well as patients with psychiatric disorders who present positive symptoms and risk of disorientation or confusion should be treated carefully. Although there already exists a systematic review on this topic, it only includes RCT design studies, and the outcomes of psychological distress and anxiety. In this JBI protocol for Systematic Review, we intend to go beyond that, as defined in the inclusion criteria, and consider any quantitative study design, setting, and outcome that will include all scientific/standardized assessments (questionnaires or scales) of anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being. Thus, this systematic literature review is considered to be timely and relevant.",

Orthostatic tachycardia is typically accompanied by symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion, such as light-headedness and, blurred vision, and manifestations of sympathetic hyperactivity such as palpitations, chest pain, and tremulousness. The pathophysiology of POTS is heterogeneous and includes hypovolemia, venous pooling, hyperadrenergic states, and restricted adrenergic neuropathies in the lower limbs. Many POTS patients present multiple chronic symptoms, such as functional gastrointestinal or bladder disorders, chronic headache, and fibromyalgia, that are not attributable to orthostatic intolerance. The management of POTS includes patient education, volume restitution, physical countermaneuvers, graded exercise training, and pharmacotherapy (fludrocortisone, midodrine, beta blockers, and/or pyridostigmine). Cognitive-emotional factors have a key contributory role in POTS.",

      "title": "Depression in psychosis: where does it come from?",
      "abstract": "Introduction Many patients suffering from schizophrenia have symptoms suggesting depression during the course of their illness. It can appear both in the prodrome of a psychotic decompensation and in the acute phase, as well as after its resolution. But is it part of the disease itself? Is it an experiential reaction to the assumption of the sickness or is it an independent entity? Can it be produced or exacerbated by antipsychotics? Objectives This case study aims to analyze the clinical presentation of depressive symptoms in a patient with schizophrenia. Methods A review of the literature on affective symptomatology which may occur in psychosis. Results A 34-year-old male with a history in Mental Health since the age of 16, with diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. He has presented at least 5 depressive episodes and several severe self-harming attempts. He is on treatment with olanzapine, clonazepam, quetiapine and aripiprazole. During a follow-up, he reports intensification of low mood in the last few weeks due to sentimental break-up, clinophilia and social isolation. He spends the day in his room with the curtains lowered, he has neglected his personal hygiene, and verbalizes thoughts of death. He shows poor functioning, slowed thinking and lack of energy. His mother reports that he has had self-aggressive behaviors, such as hitting his face and eating his faeces. Sensory and perceptual disturbances are not excluded. Given the current depressive affective state and risk of commiting suicide, it is decided to admit him to the hospital and to start treatment with fluoxetine. A few weeks after hospital discharge, he continues with poor functioning and isolation, but his mood is better and his thoughts of death have disappeared. Conclusions Although clear differentiation between depressive and psychotic symptomatology has been classically described, both symptoms are often associated. Affective symptoms can be part of different stages of the disease, secondary to medication, due to insight phenomena or part of schizoaffective disorder and psychotic depressions. Depressive symptomatology can also be confused with the presentation of negative symptoms. They both share clinical manifestations such as anergy, social isolation and lack of interest; but while in depression there is a sad mood, in negative symptons there is emotional flattering. Also, positive symptomatology can simulate social withdrawal, usually seen in depression. Depression in an acute phase has historically been related to a better prognosis, although several studies indicate that depression in a chronic phase causes a higher risk of suicide and relapses. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are essential. In our case, the patient suffers from major affective symptoms regarding his life situation, which may be overlapped by isolation due to a likely positive symptomatology, without dismissing possible negative symptomatology as a result of many years of evolution of his disease.

In the adjustment to the diagnosis, each individual usually undergoes a process in which a variety of beliefs and emotions may arise that will have to be dealt with, in parallel to education about and acceptance of the disorder. It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

      "abstract": "Under the heading of “katatonia” are included certain peculiar states of stupor and excitement, which tend to alternate irregularly with one another. Thestuporose phase is characterised by increased muscular tension, or in some instances catalepsy, together with negativism, mutism, refusal of food, contrary acts, or not infrequently an increased suggestibility, as shown by echolalia or echopraxia. The prominent features of katatonic excitement are increased psycho-motor activity, attitudinizing, stereotyped movements and phrases, verbigeration, and senseless impulses. Various forms of convulsive attacks are motor phenomena which frequently occur during the course of the psychosis.",

      "title": "Delayed post-hypoxic parkinsonism with leukoencephalopathy associated with carbon monoxide poisoning",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy is a rare disorder that occurs following any event that causes prolonged cerebral hypo-oxygenation.[1] The earliest cases of this condition were associated with carbon monoxide (CO) exposure, which continues to be the most common inciting agent.[2] However, delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy is also associated with cardiac arrest, strangulation, anesthetic or surgical complications, benzodiazepine or opiate overdose, and hemorrhagic shock.[3-7] Although its exact incidence is unknown, it is likely to increase due to the decreased fatality rate resulting from improved medical care of the aforementioned causes; for example, the mortality rate with CO poisoning has decreased from 33% to 3% since the early 19th century.[8] Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy characteristically presents in two phases: altered sensorium followed by complete recovery and a subsequent acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome with or without associated features such as parkinsonism, mutism, hyperreflexia, and frontal release signs. The lucid interval typically lasts 1–3 weeks (with a range of 2–40 days).[2] Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain reveals diffuse symmetrical anterior predominant cerebral white matter demyelination. A typical history with MRI findings that exclude alternative possibilities is sufficient for diagnosis. Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent unnecessary and unwarranted investigations and treatment. We present a case of delayed post-hypoxic parkinsonism and leukoencephalopathy following CO poisoning to emphasize the importance of early diagnosis. A 39-year-old man, with no prior comorbidities or addictions, was discovered unconscious in his room by his brother. The patient had not experienced any previous symptoms of fever, headache, or seizures but had slept in his room with burning logs of coal for warmth the previous night. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he received a Glasgow coma scale score of E3V1M5 (9/15) and was intubated for airway protection. There were no signs of meningeal involvement. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed nonspecific changes [Figure 1], and his cerebrospinal fluid examination and routine investigations were within normal ranges. He was treated with high-flow oxygen and showed improvement over the next five days, following which he was extubated. He gradually regained near baseline status and was discharged after ten days. However, one week after his discharge, he developed a sudden onset of worsening behavioral symptoms (aggression and verbal abuse), generalized stiffness, and slowed activities (required more time to do tasks such as washing, eating, and conducting daily living activities). He also exhibited intellectual abnormalities (inability to understand spoken words, producing incomprehensible sounds, and forgetfulness regarding navigating around the house). Therefore, he was referred to our facility for further management. Upon examination, he appeared drowsy with mask-like facies and displayed cog-wheel rigidity, bradykinesia, and hyperreflexia in all limbs (without asymmetry). He did not exhibit tremors, his extra-ocular movements were normal, and he did not experience postural instability. A detailed cognitive and sensory assessment was not possible, and he did not present with any focal neurological deficits.Figure 1: Axial T2-WI (a, c) images show nonspecific multiple hyperintense foci in the deep frontal white matter (arrows in a) and bilateral centrum semiovale (c). These lesions are hyperintense on DWI (arrows in b and d) without any diffusion restriction in the ADC maps (not shown)The routine blood investigations were normal. The MRI brain revealed widespread bilateral white matter hyperintensities, without any restriction in diffusion and with patchy contrast enhancement [Figure 2]. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed a slightly increased protein level (83 mg/dl) with no presence of cells and normal sugar levels. Viral markers for HIV, hepatitis B and C, serum and CSF autoimmune and paraneoplastic panel, extractable nuclear antigen panel, blood and urine toxicology screen, and CSF-venereal disease research laboratory all yielded negative results. The electroencephalogram revealed a diffuse delta slowing of brain waves.Figure 2: Follow-up MRI displays diffuse confluent symmetrical white matter hyperintensity T2-WI (a, b) and diffusion-weighted images (c, d) without any diffusion restriction in the ADC maps (e, f). Multiple foci of hyperintensities (arrows in b) are observed within the bilateral centrum semiovale, Following gadolinium administration, no enhancement is seen except for a few enhancing foci in the left centrum semiovaleBased on the patient's clinical presentation and the results of the investigations, a diagnosis of delayed post-hypoxic neurological deterioration was established. The patient was managed conservatively with the administration of atypical antipsychotics (quetiapine), levodopa-carbidopa, and baclofen. He continued to improve gradually and approached the baseline status over 6 months. Our patient developed delayed post-hypoxic neurological deterioration caused by CO poisoning resulting from sleeping in a closed room with biofuel combustion. CO binds tightly and preferentially to hemoglobin, thereby preventing oxygen binding and causing anemic hypoxia.[1] In addition, it inhibits cytochrome oxidase activity, inhibiting aerobic respiration.[1] Hypo-oxygenation and associated energy depletion of cerebral white matter lead to delayed apoptosis of oligodendrocytes due to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity.[9] CO poisoning can also occur from the use of gas geysers in domestic settings.[10] Correia et al.[10] reported cases of 26 patients developing unexplained neurodeficits while bathing in ill-ventilated bathrooms with gas geysers. Thirteen of these patients presented with acute CO intoxication, and two of them later developed parkinsonian features. Lee and Marsden reported cases of delayed post-hypoxic neurological manifestations as typically conforming to either parkinsonism or akinetic mutism along with the neuro-behavioral syndrome.[11] The patients who develop parkinsonism develop varying combinations of short-steppage gait, decreased arm swing, rigidity, bradykinesia, mask-like facies, and a stooped posture.[11] Certain patients even develop concomitant dystonic posturing of the limbs. Approximately 60% of the patients improve with supportive treatment and recover independent ambulation within 10–148 days after sequelae onset.[11] In our case, the patient had developed typical parkinsonian features (i.e., rigidity, bradykinesia, mask-like facies with hypokinetic dysarthria) and responded well to conservative management with levodopa and low doses of antipsychotics. The patient recovered his baseline status at the 6-month follow-up visit. Alternative diagnoses were ruled out through imaging, blood tests, and CSF testing. The prompt diagnosis and treatment prevented unnecessary resource utilization, such as brain biopsy or other invasive procedures, and provided symptomatic relief. Acknowledgment None.

      "abstract": "TCA are used for the treatment of major depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, chronic pain syndromes, and peripheral neuropathies associated with psychiatric and medical conditions that call for a higher rate of prescription drugs. Frequently observed toxic symptoms are sinus tachycardia and altered mental status. Severe toxic symptoms include altered mental status, dysrhythmia, seizure, and secondary complications. Serious cardiotoxicity can lead to ventricular dysrhythmia and a classic TCA electrocardiogram. Gluteal myonecrosis is reported in postoperative alcoholic states, unconscious conditions where patients remain in one position over a long period of time, strenuous physical training, or in crushing injuries. We report a case of gluteal myonecrosis after treatment with several drugs including TCA resulted in intoxication. The patient was mentally drowsy and had been lying down for 20 hours upon discovery. The patient presented on arrival to the ER with cardiotoxicity secondary to TCA intoxication and was treated. Two weeks following the incident, she complained of pain in the gluteal area. Subsequent management and investigation revealed that her gluteal myonecrosis was a result of delayed complication from a prolonged recumbent position and hemolysis due to drug interactions. She eventually recovered without the need for surgery (fasciotomy).",

La presencia de una patología dual puede conducir a que algunos síntomas somáticos sean desestimados y no se consideren como manifestación de una posible patología grave subyacente. Se reporta el caso de una paciente que, durante su hospitalización debida a un episodio depresivo, presentó una sobredosis incidental de opioides. Al recuperarse de ella, sin embargo, presentó comportamiento desorganizado e ideas delirantes, inicialmente atribuidas a la depresión. Estudios ulteriores demostraron una causa orgánica grave subyacente: lesión isquémica bilateral del globo pálido. Se analiza el cuadro clínico a la luz de la literatura pertinente, abordando los temas de delirium, espectro clínico debido a las lesiones del globo pálido y finalizando con una breve descripción sobre la sobredosis y neurotoxicidad por opioides. Frente a síntomas no concordantes con la evolución usual de una descompensación psicopatológica o una intoxicación por drogas, debe ahondarse en la exploración de posibles causas orgánicas, objetivo para el cual se sugiere considerar estudios de neuroimágenes en todo paciente que experimente una sobredosis de opioides y que posteriormente presente graves manifestaciones de una alteración cognitiva.",

      "abstract": "Migraine-like cerebral transient ischemic attacks (MIAs) and ocular ischemic manifestations were the main presenting features in 10 JAK2&lt;sup&gt;V617F&lt;/sup&gt;-positive patients studied, with essential thrombocythemia (ET) in 6 and polycythemia vera (PV) in 4. Symptoms varied and included cerebral ischemic attacks, mental concentration disturbances followed by throbbing headaches, nausea, vomiting, syncope or even seizures. MIAs were frequently preceded or followed by ocular ischemic events of blurred vision, scotomas, transient flashing of the eyes, and sudden transient partial blindness preceded or followed erythromelalgia in the toes or fingers. The time lapse between the first symptoms of aspirin-responsive MIAs and the diagnosis of ET in 5 patients ranged from 4 to 12 years. At the time of erythromelalgia and MIAs, shortened platelet survival, an increase in the levels of the platelet activation markers β-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 and also in urinary thromboxane B2 were clearly indicative of the spontaneous in vivo platelet activation of constitutively JAK2&lt;sup&gt;V617F&lt;/sup&gt;-activated thrombocythemic platelets. Aspirin relieves the peripheral, cerebral and ocular ischemic disturbances by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclo-oxygenase (COX-1) activity and aggregation ex vivo. Vitamin K antagonist, dipyridamole, ticlopidine, sulfinpyrazone and sodium salicylate have no effect on platelet COX-1 activity and are ineffective in the treatment of thrombocythemia-specific manifestations of erythromelalgia and atypical MIAs. If not treated with aspirin, ET and PV patients are at a high risk of major arterial thrombosis including stroke, myocardial infarction and digital gangrene.",

      "abstract": "Tendon disorders include tenosynovitis or tendonitis, tendinosis, and tendon rupture. Tendinopathy associated with drug administration has been associated with the systemic or local administration of several medications. A 90-year-old man who developed toxic tendinopathy after receiving cephalexin 500 mg twice daily has been described. Unilateral pain of his left Achilles tendon pain during walking appeared three weeks after starting the antibiotic. The drug was stopped after four weeks of treatment; within one week after discontinuing the cephalexin, all tendonitis symptoms spontaneously resolved. Drug-induced tendinopathy has most commonly been associated with fluoroquinolones, statins, glucocorticoids, and aromatase inhibitors. In addition, other systemic agents have caused tendinopathy; they include amlodipine, anabolic steroids, antiretrovirals, isotretinoin, renin-angiotensin II receptor antagonists, rituximab, and sitagliptin. Albeit less frequent, other oral antibiotics, including cephalosporins, azithromycin, and sulfonamides, have also been associated with toxic tendinopathy. Also, injections of collagenase Clostridiumhistolyticum, corticosteroids, and polidocanol have been followed by tendon rupture. The features of tendinopathy associated with drug treatment are summarized and their postulated mechanisms of pathogenesis are reviewed. The onset of tendon pain following the initiation of treatment with a new medication, especially if the agent has previously been associated with drug-induced tendonitis, tendinosis, or tendon rupture, should prompt the consideration of drug-associated toxic tendinopathy.",

      "title": "A PRISONER OF WAR SYNDROME: APATHY AS A REACTION TO SEVERE STRESS",
      "abstract": "We have pointed out that one defensive adjustment of POW's to stress is withdrawal. If the stresses are not too severe the person will withdraw physically if possible, or in any case will refuse to allow himself to become involved with the environment to as great an extent as possible. Certain kinds of overt behavior will be inhibited and most emotional responses will be suppressed. If the environment is severely stressful and physically depriving as well, the individual may regress into a more complete withdrawal and adopt a maladaptive state of dependency in which he ceases to take care of himself even to the point of death. We have labelled this type of defense \"apathy\" and distinguish it from states like catatonic stupor, or depression. \"Apathy\" appears not to be a single absolute reaction, but a syndrome which can vary markedly in degree. One major symptom in the syndrome is reduced or modulated affect, but only in extreme cases can one speak of true apathy or affectlessness. Other symptoms are listlessness, uncommunicativeness, lack of spontaneity, indifference, slowed reactions, lack of enthusiasm, and lack of initiative. It is important to note that underlying the overt lack of emotional spontaneity may lie great quantities of pent-up feelings, and that these will continue to be a problem to the individual when he is no longer in the environment that produced the \"apathy syndrome.\" The apathy syndrome serves to maintain personality integration in the face of severe reality and psychological stresses.",

      "title": "Psychological Inflexibility in Depression with Psychotic Features: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Introduction Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mood disorder that can last for weeks or even months, in which there is a depressed mood accompanied by anxiety, in addition to negative changes in cognitive functions, psychomotor movement and vegetative functions. Depression with psychotic features is a psychiatric syndrome that progresses with delusions as well as severe symptoms such as psychomotor retardation or agitation, depressive ruminations, deterioration in cognitive functions, and confusion. Compared to the subtypes without psychotic features, the symptoms are more severe, the age of onset is earlier, and the duration of the disease is longer. Feelings of guilt, worthlessness and suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide are more common. The risk of exacerbation is greater. Diagnosis of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia is more common in first-degree relatives of these patients. Objectives An 18-year-old female patient with somatic delusions and psychotic persistence that started after a sexual trauma and persisted for 1 month was consulted after organic exclusions were made. It is understood from the anamnesis that the patient had a manic episode about 6 months ago and that his mother was followed up with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The patient’s current clinical picture was evaluated as depression with psychotic features, and after hospitalization, the treatment was adjusted as fluoxetine 20 mg/g, olanzapine 5 mg/g, and lithium 900 mg/g. Self as context, cognitive defusion and acceptance interventions were applied to the patient. Methods When the Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire(CFQ), Self-as-Context Scale(SACS), Acceptance and Action Questionnaire(AAQ-II) completed by the patient during hospitalization and in remission periods were compared, it was observed that there was a significant regression in the patient’s psychological inflexibility during the period of remission. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient whose clinical picture was presented in order to contribute to the scientific literature. Results Depression with psychotic features is another clinical picture in which psychological inflexibility increases, and it has been observed that interviews to increase psychological flexibility during the treatment process contribute positively to the treatment process. For this reason, the contribution to the healing process can be better clarified in further studies on interventions to increase psychological flexibility applied in addition to pharmacological treatments. Image: Conclusions Psychological inflexibility is an effort to control a person’s emotion, thought, behavior or experience in a dysfunctional way in the face of an undesired experience. It has been seen in studies conducted in recent years that; There is a significant positive correlation between high psychological inflexibility and somatization, depression, anxiety and other psychological disorders.

      "abstract": "Delirium may present with hyperactive, hypoactive or mixed clinical pictures. The signs of hypoactive delirium are lethargy, confusion, apathy, hypersomnia, muttering, difficulty in maintaining attention, and difficulty in understanding and performing commands. Valproate is commonly used for the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorders. It is also used for the management of alcohol withdrawal delirium and agitative-aggressive deliriums. However, few reports are available about the valproate-induced delirium. In this report, we present a 46 years-old woman with bipolar disorder for 14 years. During her last two hospital admissions, she had been diagnosed with manic episode with psychotic features and she had received valproate. She experienced three hypoactive delirium episodes lasting 2-3 days throughout the treatment period of first week. The patient predominantly had the following signs; vomiting, hypersalivation, confusion, drowsiness, dysphasia, and hypoactivity. At the first day of delirium episode, serum valproate level was found to be within the therapeutic range (98.4, 117.1, and 65.6 mug/ml; respectively). In addition, she had normal results of cranial MRI, complete blood count, urine analysis, electrocardiogram, ALT, AST, albumin, bilirubin, BUN, creatinine and electrolytes. The serum ammonia level of the patient could not been measured due to limitations of laboratory facilities. The patient's consciousness improved dramatically 2-3 days after cessation of valproate. In conclusion, valproate can induce delirium at therapeutic blood levels in some patients via various mechanisms and this side effect has to be considered during valproate use.",

Anti‐parkinsonian treatment is likely to increase psychiatric comorbidity. Indeed treatment‐linked prolonged cognitive processing may be a harbinger of more disabling morbidity, like deficits in attention, multitasking and difficulties in sequencing and planning.

      "title": "Neurology and psychiatry in Babylon",
      "abstract": "We here review Babylonian descriptions of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including epilepsy, stroke, psychoses, obsessive compulsive disorder, phobias, psychopathic behaviour, depression and anxiety. Most of these accounts date from the first Babylonian dynasty of the first half of the second millennium BC, within a millennium and a half of the origin of writing. The Babylonians were remarkably acute and objective observers of medical disorders and human behaviour. Their detailed descriptions are surprisingly similar to modern 19th and 20th century AD textbook accounts, with the exception of subjective thoughts and feelings which are more modern fields of enquiry. They had no knowledge of brain or psychological function. Some neuropsychiatric disorders, e.g. stroke or facial palsy, had a physical basis requiring the attention of a physician or asû, using a plant and mineral based pharmacology; some disorders such as epilepsy, psychoses, depression and anxiety were regarded as supernatural due to evil demons or spirits, or the anger of personal gods, and thus required the intervention of the priest or ašipu; other disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder and psychopathic behaviour were regarded as a mystery. The Babylonians were the first to describe the clinical foundations of neurology and psychiatry. We discuss these accounts in relation to subsequent and more modern clinical descriptions.",

      "abstract": "Almost all working adults, more than half in any given year, experience low back pain. Although the differential diagnosis is extensive, most symptoms have biomechanical causes and resolve promptly with little intervention, although recurrence is common. History and physical examination are important in distinguishing potential causes and identifying \"red flags\" for more serious conditions. Diagnostic imaging should be ordered only when necessary because of the high incidence of radiologic abnormalities in asymptomatic persons. Once serious illness is ruled unlikely, first-line drug therapy with acetaminophen, a cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug is recommended. Short-term use of muscle relaxants may be considered, but they can be sedating. Patients should stay as active as possible. Comorbid conditions such as sleep disorders, anxiety, or depression should be treated, and psychosocial issues should be addressed. Opioids should be prescribed if other treatments have been insufficiently effective and if there is evidence of improved function with opioid treatment that outweighs adverse effects. Adjuvant antidepressants and anticonvulsants should be considered, especially in chronic or neuropathic pain. If a structural defect is identified and a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure is available, consider referral. If symptoms have not improved within 4 to 6 weeks, re-evaluation and additional diagnostic workup should be considered.",

Also challenging for clinicians are consensus definitions for opioid pharmacology which are poorly chosen, changing, or euphemistic. This paper collects opioid consensus definitions for addiction, physical dependence, tolerance, and withdrawal, and offers practical discussion of the concepts they address. Addiction is a short-circuiting or overdrive of the mesocorticolimbic system of the brain. Physical dependence on opioids means that after chronic opioid dosing an abrupt cessation or marked dose decrease causes an opioid withdrawal syndrome. Physical dependence and addiction are unrelated neuroplastic phenomena which occur in different parts of the brain. Tolerance means a decreasing drug effect for a given dose over time. This applies to desired drug effects and to drug side-effects.",

      "abstract": "ISOLATED ADRENOCORTICOTROPIC HORMONE (ACTH) deficiency is a rare pituitary disorder characterized by decreased secretion of ACTH, but not of the other hormones of the anterior pituitary and causes secondary adrenal insufficiency.1 Since isolated ACTH deficiency gradually and latently develops and shows non-specific symptoms, it is easily misdiagnosed. We report a case of middle-aged-onset isolated ACTH deficiency that showed a severe major depressive episode. A 62-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to suicidal behavior. He did not have any previous history of neuropsychiatric or endocrine disorders. From 6 months before the admission, he complained of mild general fatigue, depressed mood, loss of pleasure, psychomotor retardation, insomnia, decrease in appetite, and weight loss. He was diagnosed as having major depressive disorder. A dose of 100 mg/day of sertraline did not relieve him of his depressive symptoms at all. At the time of admission, he was fully conscious and showed a severe major depressive episode with suicidal ideas. He did not show any symptoms suggestive of atypical depression or chronic fatigue syndrome, such as hypersomnia, lead paralysis, mood reactivity, rejection sensitivity, muscle pain, lymph node swelling, and fever. Magnetic resonance imaging of his brain did not show any structural abnormality, including an empty sella. Blood test revealed anemia (red blood cell count, 3.24 × 106/µL; hemoglobin, 10.0 mg/dL) and hyponatremia (117 mEq/L). Thyroid function studies were consistent with hypothyroidism: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 49.8 µIU/mL (normal range, 0.6–5.1); fT3, 2.45 pg/mL (2.47–4.34); and fT4, 0.71 ng/dL (0.97–1.79). Rheumatoid factor and antinuclear, antithyroglobulin, anti-thyroid peroxidase, TSH-receptor, and antipituitary antibodies were negative. Both serum ACTH (<2.0 pg/mL; normal range, 7.2–63.3) and cortisol (0.2 µg; 3.7–19.4) were extremely low, whereas aldosterone (61.6 pg/mL; 38.9–307.0) was within normal range. Neither ACTH nor cortisol responded to corticotrophin-releasing hormone stimulation test, showing that he suffered from secondary adrenocortical insufficiency. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone test, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone test, and growth hormone-releasing hormone test showed normal responses, revealing that his secondary adrenocortical insufficiency was caused by isolated ACTH insufficiency. We discontinued sertraline and started to administer him 5 mg/day of hydrocortisone. Three days later, his symptoms mimicking major depressive episode were dramatically resolved. As in our case, isolated ACTH deficiency may be comorbid with primary hypothyroidism although the mechanism of the coexistence is unknown.2 However, the comorbid hypothyroidism did not seem to induce his depressive state as hypothyroidism was recovered 4 months after rapid relief of his psychiatric state. Relationships between glucocorticoid function and symptoms mimicking major depressive episodes are complex but might reflect insufficient glucocorticoid signaling. Some major depressive episodes might be associated with the insufficient glucocorticoid signaling by decrease of glucocorticoid production or decrease of sensitivity of glucocorticoid receptors.3 Our case suggests that isolated ACTH deficiency should be added into a differential diagnostic list of major depressive disorder. The patient gave the authors informed consent to publish this letter.",

      "abstract": "The consequences of high training loads in combination with poor regeneration are characterised by performance decrements and fatigue in combination with other complaints as concentration problems, altered sleeping and eating patterns and negative moods. The consequences are divided into three categories: Functional overreaching (FO), non-functional overreaching (NFO) and overtraining syndrome (OTS). FO has no negative consequences for the athlete on the long term, supercompensation might even occur in some cases after a period of relative rest. The athlete suffers from NFO if recovery does not occur within some weeks. The term-OTS is used only in the most severe cases, cases in which recovery takes months up to years. Athletes can be prevented from NFO and OTS by using an objective, not manipulable, not too demanding and inexpensive marker which is practical for use in training practice. Reaction time might be such a marker. Some support for the use of reaction time as an early marker for NFO and OTS has already been found, in the sports practice as well as in sport science. More research is necessary before it can be used in practice. Until then, keeping training load and perceptions of that load in a training diary will remain the method of choice for prevention of NPO and OTS.",

In exposure therapy, the patient is persuaded to re-enter the phobia- or ritual-evoking situation and to stay there despite the ensuing panic until it starts to subside, which may take 1 h or more. The patient does this repeatedly and systematically, noting outcome in an exposure-homework diary which the clinician reviews. Controlled studies show that such self-exposure treatment (requiring little time from the clinician) has lasting value. Only a minority of cases need additional therapist-aided exposure. Antidepressants are useful adjuvants to exposure in dysphoric phobics and ritualisers. No antidepressant is clearly superior to any other. Relapse on stopping medication is a problem. Neither beta-blockers nor benzodiazepines are yet of proven lasting value for these syndromes. It is too easy to forget that drugs have unpleasant side-effects which are not seen with exposure therapy.",

      "title": "Syncope in Athletes of Cardiac Origin",
      "abstract": "Personal History: Have You Ever Nearly Lost or Actualy Lost Consciousness? The History To determine the importance of a positive answer to this question, the following questions should be asked: Did the syncopal event occur during or immediately after exercise; if the latter, was the patient standing still or moving around? Prior to the syncopal event, were there any prodromal symptoms such as the following: chest pain, palpitations, visual changes, wheezing/shortness of breath, nausea, or itching? After the syncopal event, what was the patient’s postevent clinical status? Did they wake quickly, or was there a prolonged period of unresponsiveness? Was there any observed seizure activity or loss of urine, stool, or tongue bite marks? Were there vital signs recorded on site, particularly the immediate postsyncope measurements? What medications and supplements were being utilized prior to the event? Is there a prior personal or family history of syncope or of sudden cardiac arrest/death? The evaluating physician’s first priority is to use the clinical history to distinguish between true syncope involving a loss of consciousness with presumed hemodynamic compromise and exercise-associated collapse associated with exhaustive effort or postexercise hypotension. In true syncope from hemodynamic causes, the athlete typically recovers quickly with restoration of arterial pressure, unless resuscitation is required. After collapse associated with an exhaustive effort, however, athletes usually will have prolonged periods of “being out of it,” even in the supine position with normal heart rate and BP. This picture is in contrast to patients with syncope due to heat stress who are universally hypotensive and tachycardic. Athletes who are impaired, seeming “unconscious,” but able to assist in their own evacuation are unlikely to be in the throes of a life-threatening arrhythmia, although other metabolic or catastrophic abnormalities are possible (e.g., hyponatremia, exertional heat stroke). The postevent state provides important clues such as seizure activity, incontinence, and immediate vital signs (including body temperature). It must be emphasized however, that a seizure-like activity can be the result of reduced cerebral perfusion and therefore does not always imply epilepsy or neurologic problems. Reports from witnesses can be invaluable. Too often, syncope is assumed to be neurologic and the cardiac evaluation is not done, resulting in fatal outcomes. The second critical distinction is whether the event occurred during or immediately after exercise. Orthostatic hypotension occurring after exercise, usually associated with sudden cessation of activity, is much less ominous than the sudden loss of consciousness that occurs during exercise, which suggests cardiac arrhythmia with loss of blood flow to the brain. Syncope prompted by an abrupt loud noise such as a starting gun or immersion in cold water may provide a clinical clue to prolonged QT syndrome (LQTS). The third component of the history that provides clinical clues is a detailed assessment of events prior to the collapse. Prodromal symptoms such as palpitations (suggesting arrhythmia), chest pain (ischemia, aortic dissection), nausea (ischemia, high levels of vagal activity, or hyponatremia), wheezing, and pruritus (anaphylaxis) are significant, along with precipitating events like “only during exercise.” It is important to identify whether syncope occurs in the upright position (orthostatic hypotension) alone or also when sitting or supine (arrhythmia or nonhemodynamic cause). The fourth component of the evaluation requires assessment of the medication and supplement history. A comprehensive medication list, including over-the-counter medications and ergogenic aids is necessary; the practice of high-risk behaviors, such as recreational drug use should be carefully investigated. Finally, a personal and family history of sudden death is critical and, if present, may identify very high-risk subgroups with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), LQTS, or right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Delineating a family tree will give a complete snapshot of the family history. The Physical Examination Vital signs (including orthostatic measurements) should be included. Blood pressure (BP) should be measured in both arms and legs as well as after 5 min of moving to a standing position. Special Tests/Referral The three tests that are core to the diagnostic evaluation of the athlete with syncope include the electrocardiogram (ECG), the echocardiogram, and the exercise stress test. Echocardiography should precede the exercise test, allowing the assessment of ventricular size and function, pulmonary pressures, and valve function/integrity. Rather than a standard Bruce protocol, a maximal symptom-limited exercise test should be used to reproduce the conditions that provoked the syncopal event. For example, a stuttering start-stop test for a basketball or soccer player or a prolonged high-intensity race pace test for a runner. The exercise ECG also should be examined for appropriate shortening of the QT interval. Further testing should be ordered only as indicated and in consultation with the appropriate specialist. A complete review of all the advanced diagnostic tests is beyond the focus of this article. Tilt table testing should not be used in the syncope evaluation because of the high rate of false positive tests due to the steep Starling curve in athletes. The clinician is additionally reminded that not all syncope is cardiogenic. Athletes whose history suggests seizure activity may require an electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to exclude a structural lesion, and seizures can be related to hyponatremia or heat stroke. Hematologic and metabolic abnormalities require testing as indicated, e.g., hypoglycemia in those with diabetes, athletes with eating disorders, or patients on beta-blockers. CASE EXAMPLES Case 1: Cross-Country Runner with Collapse at the Finish Line A 17-year-old female track star was competing in the district championships in the 5,000 m. She was having an excellent race and was part of the final pack that was in contention for a medal. Just after crossing the finish line (in 17 min 55 s), she collapsed to the ground and, according to bystanders, remained “unconscious” for about an hour. ECG, echocardiogram, and Holter monitor testing results were normal, although she did not faint during the period of recording. An athlete-specific exercise test was performed on a large treadmill at 10 mph; after 10 min, the patient started to cry and then slumped in the safety harness. At the moment of fainting, her rhythm was normal, pulse was 185 bpm, and BP was 140/70. The final impression was exercise-associated collapse, and the recommendation was better training and pacing to match demands of her sport. Key Point: History pointed away from life-threatening arrhythmia; athlete-specific exercise testing reproduced the problem during direct electrical and hemodynamic monitoring, allowing an accurate diagnosis. Case 2: Basketball Player with Collapse on the Free Throw Line A 21-year-old male college basketball star led a 12-point run, mostly by a series of impressive fast breaks, in the middle of the first half of an early round of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. After the last jam, he was fouled and walked to the foul line. While standing waiting to shoot, he slumped to the ground. Witnesses observed generalized seizure activity. ECG showed LVH and unusual T waves in the right precordial leads, but his echocardiogram result was normal and short-term Holter monitoring did not identify any arrhythmias, although no symptoms occurred during the monitoring period. A stuttering exercise test was performed at high speed (15 mph) followed by sudden stops. After the fifth repeat, while standing quietly, there was a sudden drop in pulse to 45 bpm, BP was 60/40, and the patient fainted on the treadmill. The final diagnosis was postexercise hypotension (neurally mediated syncope). The recommendation was behavioral modification (avoid standing still if possible, learn leg crossing/butt clenching and toe bouncing maneuvers, stay well hydrated, and wear compression socks). Key Point: Standing still after intense exercise can lead to hypotension due to loss of the muscle pump and lead to neurally mediated syncope with bradycardia and hypotension. Athlete-specific exercise testing elicited the problem and led to simple, effective, nonpharmacologic therapy. Case 3: Football Player with Collapse while Running out for a Pass A 19-year-old male wide receiver for a junior college football team was running a crossing pattern during practice when witnesses observed him to weave, stumble, and fall to the ground. The trainer arrived at the scene to find him alert and oriented. His BP was 135/80; pulse was 110 bpm and regular. Physical examination result was normal; however, ECG results showed septal Q waves, LVH, and deep T wave inversions. Echocardiogram results showed a septal thickness of 1.8 cm, although without systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Holter monitoring revealed multiple runs of NSVT, and cardiac MRI showed multiple areas of delayed enhancement. The diagnosis was HCM; he was held from competition, and family members were screened for HCM. Key Point: Syncope during exercise is very concerning for an arrhythmia and underlying structural heart disease. Case 4: Lacrosse Player with Syncope during Exercise A lacrosse player had syncope while running wind sprints. Careful history examination documented that the syncope occurred during a sprint and not between sprints. ECG results showed nonspecific ECG changes, but the echocardiogram result was normal. The exercise test result was normal; cardiac MRI was performed and showed patchy areas of delayed enhancement indicating potential myocarditis. An electrophysiology (EP) study induced atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) but no ventricular arrhythmias. A 24-h Holter monitor showed no arrhythmias. The athlete had a major game coming up, and there was pressure to allow him to play. The patient had ablation of the AVNRT and was allowed to return to sports. He died in practice the following week. Key Point: The worrisome history plus noncoronary distribution of delayed enhancement on MRI are concerning for myocarditis. The conservative approach would have been to treat with a beta-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, hold out of sports for at least 3 to 6 months, perhaps implant an implantable loop recorder so that a specific diagnosis could be made if another episode of syncope occurred, and then repeat the MRI looking for resolution of delayed enhancement. Pressure to play (athlete, coach, and parent) can influence medical decision making and steer the decision away from the athlete’s best interest. Case 5: A 23-year-old male second-year medical student completed a maximal-effort Wingate test as part of a research project; prior V˙O2max testing demonstrated a maximum of 55 mL·kg−1·min−1. Immediately after the 30-s test, the student was extremely nauseous and rapidly exited the bike to move to a trash can to vomit; after two short wobbly steps, he collapsed to the ground. He was attended to immediately by the exercise staff in attendance; he had an estimated loss of consciousness for less than 30 s and had a first set of vital signs of heart rate of 140 bpm and BP of 110/60. There was no observed seizure activity and no prior complaint of chest pain. A subsequent evaluation in the sports medicine clinic demonstrated normal clinical examination results with no history of syncope; ECG results demonstrated early repolarization variation in the precordial leads. As the syncopal event occurred immediately after exercise, a treadmill stress test and echocardiogram were performed; the student completed 17 min of Bruce protocol and had a normal echocardiogram results. The diagnosis was postexertional syncope secondary to orthostatic hypotension. Key Point: Syncope during or immediately after exercise is always concerning and warrants conscientious examination to rule out structural cardiovascular disease. Intense anaerobic exercise, which can be seen in maximal efforts like the Wingate test or weightlifting, can precipitate syncope through orthostatic hypotension and a central effect of hypocapnia leading to, or aggravating, cerebral hypoperfusion. The history of the event provides not only insight into the diagnosis but also important opportunities for prudent recommendations for prevention.",

      "title": "Avoid Postoperative Pain To Prevent Its Chronification: A Narrative Review",
      "abstract": "Acute postoperative pain is a normal and expected part of the patient's postsurgical trajectory, and its intensity, severity, and duration vary with surgery-related and patient factors. In a subset of patients, postoperative pain does not resolve as the tissue heals but instead transitions to chronic postoperative pain, a challenging condition to treat and one associated with decreased quality of life, sleep and mood disorders, and neuropathy. Promptly and adequately treating acute postoperative pain can reduce the risk that it will transition into chronic postoperative pain. Numerous agents are available that may help treat postoperative pain, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and others. In this connection, it is also important to consider patient factors, such as mental health status and comorbidities, as well as the type and duration of surgery. A multimodal approach is recommended, which uses two or more agents with complementary mechanisms of action, working at different targets. Multimodal analgesia may also reduce adverse events and lessen opioid consumption after surgery. A particularly useful fixed-dose combination product is dexketoprofen/tramadol (DEX-TRA), which is safe and effective in numerous clinical trials. This review is based on a presentation from the Roma Pain Days scientific sessions of 2021.",

      "abstract": "Tapering medication is difficult for many patients using chronic medication. Physicians must be aware of why patients experience difficulties in discontinuation. Important are the cognitions of patients about why the medication is necessary, for example because of the deficit of a certain substance that is supplemented by the medication. Or a too favourable expectation of the effect while time-to-benefit has passed. The experience of withdrawal effects during earlier attempts or the experience of dependency hamper new attempts to stop. This is important in medication that induces physical dependency: antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or proton pump inhibitors. Fear for relapse is also hampering discontinuation; this is at stake in patients with psychosis, depression and epilepsy. Finally, poor communication and not having a trusted professional are impediments for discontinuation. To be successful in helping patients discontinue their medication professionals must communicate well about the patient's personal attitude, experience, emotions, and life circumstances as well as to possess expertise about the technical aspects of the procedure of stopping medication.",

Refractory delirium, dyspnoea or pain are the most common indications. If deep palliative sedation is used, the estimated life expectancy should be a few days to at most one week. Midazolam is used most often for continuous sedation, usually by subcutaneous infusion; if the response is insufficient, a combination of midazolam with levomepromazine or phenobarbital or monotreatment with propofol may be used. If continuous infusion is not desired or feasible, intermittent administration of midazolam, diazepam, lorazepam or chlorpromazine may be considered.

One of the most important factors is neurotic depression. The most prominent symptom of neurotic depression is sleep disturbance, especially waking up many times at night. When you diagnose a vertigo patient as having neurotic depression, I recommend prescribing the antidepressant amitriptyline (10 mg at night). If this is not effective, you may use a dose of 20 mg to 75 mg. The case of symptoms such as vertigo or general fatigue, you may prescribe maprotiline (10 mg after breakfast); if this not effective, increase the dose to 30 mg every morning, afternoon, and night. If the case is especially severe, change maprotiline to dosulepin (75 mg). In the most severe cases try lofepramine (30 mg to 90 mg).If the patients are not in a depressive state, or take an overdose of the antidepressant, they often have nightmares or have resting tremors in their hands. When you observe such symptoms, stop the antidepressant therapy immediately.",

Vomiting is the forceful expulsion of the gastric contents through the mouth. Nausea is under the physiological control of the vomiting centre in the medulla. Oral medication may be adequate to control nausea, but the rectal or subcutaneous route may be better for persistent nausea. The patient's nausea may be caused by more than one stimulus activating more than one site in the brain. Corticosteroids are not anti-emetics as such, but sometimes have a non-specific action in reducing nausea and vomiting and, of course, have a role in reducing raised intracranial pressure or reducing the size of an enlarging liver pressing on the stomach.",

      "title": "The Effect of Insomnia Definitions, Terminology, and Classifications on Clinical Practice",
      "abstract": "There is a need for newer, more clinically useful classifications for insomnia. Identification of specific subtypes of insomnia helps anchor research, allows for prediction of prognosis/course of the condition, and may allow for individualization of treatment. Existing classifications differ, and many terms remain inadequately defined, which leads to diagnostic confusion. Historically, insomnia has been classified according to symptom type, symptom duration, and underlying cause, but these classifications have not been based on evidence of their utility, and newer research suggests the need for change. Symptoms may include difficulty falling asleep, trouble staying asleep, and not feeling restored by sleep, although it has not been clear that it is possible to identify distinct subtypes of patients by symptom or that distinguishing symptom type affects the course of clinical treatment. Classification of insomnia by duration most commonly involves three categories: transient (no more than a few days), short‐term (up to 3 weeks), and long‐term (more than 3 weeks). This categorization is of uncertain utility and has been primarily based on nonempiric concerns about treatment with sedative‐hypnotic medications for periods longer than several weeks. The subtyping of insomnia in terms of whether there is an identifiable underlying cause such as a psychiatric or medical illness was based on an unproven assumption that in most instances other disorders caused insomnia. Recent studies suggest the need to revisit these classification strategies. Evidence that symptom types typically overlap and change over time complicates the categorization of subjects by whether they have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep or have nonrestorative sleep. New studies of the treatment of chronic insomnia change the perspective on duration of treatment and, as a result, classification of duration of disease. Two studies of nightly pharmacotherapy for insomnia including more than 800 insomnia patients have not identified any increase in the risks after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment. In addition, nonpharmacological treatments demonstrate long‐lasting efficacy in patients with chronic insomnia, and the development of abbreviated cognitive‐behavioral therapies, which are particularly well suited to primary care practice, have improved their applicability. Newer studies of the relationships between insomnia and associated medical and psychiatric conditions undermine the notion that insomnia is always a symptom and caused by an underlying condition. They suggest that, although it is important to identify and treat these conditions, this may not be sufficient to alleviate the insomnia, which may adversely affect the course of the associated disorder. As a result, treatment targeted specifically to the insomnia should be considered. All of these developments point to an increasing ability to tailor therapy to the particular needs of patients and to optimize the clinical management of insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Millions of patients continue to require opioid analgesics for control of moderate to severe chronic pain, which is a disease that affects more Americans than cancer, heart disease, and diabetes combined. Common opioid adverse effects include constipation, sedation, and nausea. A lesser-known sequelae is opioid induced androgen deficiency (OPIAD). The objective of this review was to better characterize the effects of opioids on the endocrine system. Published data were evaluated to identify links between opioid use and hypogonadism, as well as to describe proposed physiological mechanisms. Chronic opioid use may predispose to hypogonadism through alteration of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis as well as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis. The resulting hypogonadism and hypotestosteronism may contribute to impaired sexual function, decreased libido, infertility, and osteoporosis- none of which may be clinically recognized as opioid related. OPIAD is a recognized consequence of long-term opioid therapy. Patients initiated or maintained on opioids should be queried about symptoms that might suggest hypogonadism including irregular menses, reduced libido, depression, fatigue, and hot flashes or night sweats. Some clinicians recommend assessment of baseline testosterone levels prior to initiating therapy. Additional data appear necessary to formulate guidelines regarding the diagnosis and management of OPIAD. Options include, rotating, reducing the dose or type, or cessation of opioid therapy or adding hormonal supplementation in the form of androgen replacement therapy. There are multiple formulations of testosterone available for replacement therapy, which is usually guided by laboratory measurements.",

The comorbidity of different psychiatric disorders with OCD is known, such as impulse control disorder and tic disorder. Objectives The objective of this study is to describe the clinical characteristics, comorbidities and the treatment used in a patient with an OCD diagnosis and motor tics. Methods Description of a clinical case of motor tics associated with OCD in an adult patient. Results A 29-year-old man begins mental health follow-up for presenting, as a result of a choking episode, obsessive thoughts with significant emotional and behavioral repercussions, to the point of restricting his diet and losing several kilos of weight. He also manifested checks and rituals in order to avoid possible choking.Treatment with sertraline and clonazepam was started, without evidence of improvement in symptoms. Months later, bucolingual and guttural tics, difficult to control by the patient and which caused bite lesions in the mouth and tongue, were added to the described clinic. Oral aripiprazole was associated to the treatment and then prolonged- release intramuscular administration was used, achieving improvement in obsessive symptoms and motor tics. Conclusions The usefulness of adjuvant treatment with atypical antipsychotics has been demonstrated in adults with OCD who present an insufficient response to an SSRI. Injectable prolonged-release antipsychotics can help improve long-term prognosis by ensuring adherence. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "title": "Substance Use Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Addiction occurs when repeated use of drugs changes how a person’s brain functions over time. The transition from voluntary to compulsive drug use reflects changes in the brain’s natural inhibition and reward centers that keep a person from exerting control over the impulse to use drugs even when there are negative consequences—the defining characteristic of addiction. Many adolescent risk factors, including genetic vulnerability, prenatal exposure to alcohol or other drugs, lack of parental supervision or monitoring, a history of physical and/or sexual abuse, and an association with drug-using peers are risk factors that contribute to a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with a substance use disorder. On average, adolescents tend to show a reduction in use following treatment, but post-treatment course is variable. Aftercare helps to maintain treatment gains, and more than one episode of treatment may be needed for some adolescents with more severe substance involvement.",

      "title": "Estrés y conducta adictiva",
      "abstract": "As it is well known, all living humans are subject to daily effects of stress; the stress response varies among individuals depending on the experience that has endowed each person to learn how to deal with stress. Stress relief may be obtained by procedures that lead the subject to “forget” the bad situation or to relax, for instance physical exercise, talking the problem to someone else, drinking alcoholic beverages or using drugs of abuse. Drug addiction develops in persons voluntarily seeking relief from a depressive situation, usually linked to personal catastrophic event, death of a dear family member or a valuable loss of personal belonging, or else also voluntarily aiming to a novel mood enhancing experience, in spite of being conscious of the unwanted effects – dependence – arising from repetitive drug taking, the most serious being addiction, a persistent state in which compulsive drug use escapes control. Addictive drugs besides providing a pleasant rewarding experience also generate reinforcing behaviors of the drug effects leading to tolerance, dependency compulsion, persistence, chronicity with multiple relapses and withdrawal syndrome. The compulsion and persistence are based on pathological molecular mechanisms similar to those involved in memory. Studies done both in humans and rodent models of addiction indicate that key behavior abnormalities associated with addiction are related to changes in the brain, both at molecular and cellular levels. The plastic changes in the dopaminergic VTA NAc pathway and the interconnected structures, also include changes in the gene transcription, RNA and protein processing and in synaptic structure. All the specific changes so far identified are not sufficiently long lasting to account for the behaviors associated with addiction.",

      "abstract": "For the clinician, insomnia is a symptom which is difficult to understand as it is a predominantly subjective variable: in clinical practice, it is the patient's complaint which guides the doctor in his diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Insomnia is commonly classified according to different criteria including the time of onset during the night (beginning, middle or end), its course of evolution (occasional, short term or chronic) and the severity of the complaint. The presence of associated signs is a decisive feature in characterising insomnia: it may be isolated or associated with other symptoms. Thus insomnia may evolve in its own right or be part of the framework of a somatic disorder (algic or dyspnoeic, for example) or psychiatric (anxiety disorder, mood disorder, psychose, state of confusion or dementia).",

The occurrence of AID subjects the patient to another medical condition and may prompt an extensive work-up. Similarities with other drug-induced dyskinesias and some animal studies suggest that dopaminergic dysfunction in the basal ganglia is pivotal in the occurrence of dyskinesia. Clinical presentation and outcomes are variable; however, in most cases, dyskinesias respond well to anticonvulsant withdrawal.

This consumption is generally aimed at coping with very common hardships, such as anxiety, depression, various daily difficulties, etc. Doctors tend to give psychotropic drugs rather easily, which can lead to addiction and/or to a ritual use.

We investigate the case of a 34-year-old woman with bulimia nervosa where acute dystonia was induced by bupropion in 8 months. Following this diagnosis and after normal tests and MRI results, the patient was advised to discontinue bupropion intake. In the follow-up done 2 weeks later, 3 months later, and 6 months later, no signs of acute dystonia was observed.

More than 25 years have passed since the term “psychiatric intensive care unit” (PICU) was introduced in the United Kingdom. This system is comprised of security units for psychiatric patients with suicidal or violent behaviour, providing a locked environment with more resources regarding personnel and care. The PICU concept at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy in Vienna, Austria, represents a progress towards optimal care of patients with serious psychiatric illnesses who also have critical somatic illnesses. One third of the patients are transferred from inpatient facilities of medical departments such as internal medicine, emergency medicine, trauma surgery or anesthesiology. Our PICU is dedicated to somatically, critically ill patients who have psychiatric symptoms (e.g., agition, aggression, impulsivity, delusions, catatonia, confusion, reduced consciousness, impaired self-reliance) complicating recovery from their critical, somatic condition. Generally, the dosages for antipsychotics are not higher than those at normal psychiatric wards. Benzodiazepine dosages of about 30mg diazepam equivalents per day are frequently used. In the years 2008 and 2009, 10% of all patients at the Viennese PICU were treated with electroconvulsive therapy. Delirium requires immediate therapy of underlying intracerebral pathologies, extracerebral illnesses or toxic features. Involuntary commitment, physical restraints and urinary catheterization were applied in approximately 50% of the patients, nasogastric tube or central venous catheter in 20%. In every case, intensive care nursing, monitoring of vital functions and specific experience at the interface between psychiatry and somatic medicine are required.",

      "title": "Chronic Psychosis in Dual Disorder Heroin Use Disorder Patients",
      "abstract": "In bipolar disorder, manic or depressive episodes and mixed states are frequently marked by psychotic symptoms. Moreover, psychosis may occur after substance use disorder, often intervening with the effect of making the clinical picture indistinguishable from that of a primary psychosis. Cannabinoids, stimulants, hallucinogens, alcohol and poly-use most commonly develop psychosis induced by the non-medical use of substances. Among substance use disorder users, it has not yet been ascertained whether opioids exert a psychotic effect. Still, some authors have supported the view that opioids have antidepressant, antipanic and antipsychotic effects. It has also been hypothesized that affective disorders, coupled with genetic disposition rather than affective disturbance or psychosis, result in bipolar psychosis or schizoaffective disorder, respectively. In the history of chronic psychotics, heroin use is relatively infrequent. Chronic use of psychotogenic substances and autonomous chronicity of psychotic symptoms may root in a bipolar substrate. Substance use among people with schizophrenia cannot always be justified in terms of dysphoria. Still, the number of depressive symptoms can significantly influence the risk rate for alcohol, cannabinoid use or poly-use. Dual disorder psychotic heroin-addicted patients usually enter treatment with more severe psychopathological aspects and a shorter, less severe addiction history than their non-psychotic peers suggesting that these patients are likely to benefit from opioid medication. These data indirectly confirm the antipsychotic effects of opioids and Khantzian's self-medication hypothesis. For further confirmation, patients affected by chronic psychosis and anxiety disorders tend to progress from a psychiatric disorder to a substance use disorder. In contrast, patients with mood disorders are initially affected by drug addiction. As far as dual disorder is concerned, it is advisable to employ agents that do not heavily affect dopamine metabolism in an inhibitory way since the worsening of use hampers the effectiveness upon psychotic symptoms. On the other hand, when the tie with substances is more robust, their use may amplify as a direct consequence of dopamine antagonism, as a compensatory mechanism effective throughout the reward pathway. Novel antipsychotics seem to permit equivalent effectiveness on psychotic symptoms without promoting drug use, at least to the same extent, and might have anticraving properties.",

It is important to distinguish between addiction to and normal physical dependence on benzodiazepines. Intentional abusers of benzodiazepines usually have other substance abuse problems. Benzodiazepines are usually a secondary drug of abuse-used mainly to augment the high received from another drug or to offset the adverse effects of other drugs. Few cases of addiction arise from legitimate use of benzodiazepines. Pharmacologic dependence, a predictable and natural adaptation of a body system long accustomed to the presence of a drug, may occur in patients taking therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines. However, this dependence, which generally manifests itself in withdrawal symptoms upon the abrupt discontinuation of the medication, may be controlled and ended through dose tapering, medication switching, and/or medication augmentation. Due to the chronic nature of anxiety, long-term low-dose benzodiazepine treatment may be necessary for some patients; this continuation of treatment should not be considered abuse or addiction.",

L’enuresie nocturne (plus de 2 fois par semaine) toucherait 8 % des enfants de moins de 4 ans et demi et 1,5 % des enfants de moins de 9 ans et demi. Elle peut persister jusqu’a 19 ans… Le NICE rappelle qu’il ne s’agit pas d’une « faute» et que les « punitions » n’ont aucun role therapeutique… Il faut donc d’abord informer les enfants et leurs familles et leur donner des conseils pratiques immediats pour limiter l’impact (protections et vetements de nuit adaptes). Une enuresie recente doit faire rechercher une infection urinaire ou un diabete ; apres quelques mois de possibles facteurs declenchants (maladie recente, trouble emotionnel…) qui peuvent necessiter une prise en charge specifique. L’evaluation est multifactorielle (symptomes de jour, autres problemes, notamment de constipation, troubles du developpement, du comportement, de l’attention ou de l’apprentissage, problemes familiaux…). Une evaluation en milieu specialise peut etre indispensable en cas d’incontinence diurne, d’antecedents d’infection urinaire, d’anomalies congenitales ou de troubles comportementaux majeurs, notamment en cas de suspicion de maltraitance. Le NICE recommande de ne pas restreindre les apports hydriques de la journee, ne pas reveiller l’enfant la nuit, sauf circonstances exceptionnelles, de lui rappeler d’utiliser les toilettes a heures regulieres durant la journee. La place des differents traitements alarmes, desmopressine en premiere intention, recours a un avis specialise en cas d’echec avant utilisation d’anticholinergiques ou d’imipramine, est bien precisee.

Para poder realizar un adecuado diagnostico y diagnostico diferencial de los trastornos de ansiedad primarios o de los inducidos es necesario que transcurra un tiempo de abstinencia. El DSM-IV-TR senala la necesidad de que transcurran 4 semanas desde el ultimo consumo. Cuando el paciente toma benzodiacepinas de semivida corta o sustancias como la heroina, este tiempo es adecuado, pero cuando consume benzodiacepinas de semivida larga o metadona pueden ser necesarias varias semanas para poder realizar el diagnostico, lo cual no siempre es posible en la practica clinica. Por ello, para establecer un diagnostico diferencial adecuado es necesario realizar una historia clinica completa y valorar los posibles antecedentes personales o familiares de trastornos de ansiedad,indicadores de la existencia de una ansiedad primaria. El trastorno de ansiedad inducido por sustancias incluye aquellas entidades clinicas en las que la ansiedad es de caracter prominente, es decir, las crisis de angustia o las obsesiones o compulsiones predominan en el cuadro clinico. Ademas se debe demostrar que los sintomas aparecen durante la intoxicacion o tras el primer mes de abstinencia y/o que son secundarios al consumo de la sustancia. Los sintomas no deben aparecer en el transcurso de un delirium y deben provocar malestar clinicamente significativo o deterioro social, laboral o de otras areas importantes en la actividad. diagnosticos se cumplen en el curso de una intoxicacion, especificando entonces de inicio durante la intoxicacion, o si se cumplen durante o poco despues de la abstinencia, especificando en este caso de inicio durante la abstinencia. En el DSM-IV-TR no se acepta la existencia del trastorno de ansiedad inducido por nicotina ni por opiaceos. Etiopatogenia Se ha planteado que tanto el uso de sustancias como los trastornos de ansiedad pueden ser primarios o secundarios (inducidos) por lo que la relacion entre el consumo de sustancias y la ansiedad es controvertida. En muchos trabajos esta documentada la coexistencia de ambos pero en ocasiones es muy dificil dilucidar cual de ellos es el primario. Se han propuesto tres hipotesis explicativas sobre la relacion entre ambos trastornos3,4: 1. Los trastornos de ansiedad promueven el uso patologico de alcohol u otras sustancias. Algunos autores proponen que el alcohol u otras sustancias, por sus posibles efectos ansioliticos, pueden ser utilizados por los pacientes como autotratamiento de su ansiedad. En este sentido, tambien es posible que la ansiedad empeore o reactive un consumo de sustancias preexistente. Las evidencias de algunos estudios sugieren que la ansiedad social es un motivo importante para el consumo de alcohol5, ya que mejoraria las expectativas y la creencia de mayor autoeficacia en situaciones de ansiedad social.",

      "abstract": "Abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating, need to rush to the toilet, straining, feeling of incomplete bowel emptying and alternating periods of diarrhea and constipation is the clinical definition of the irritable bowel syndrome. The internationally used syndrome definition is based on expert opinions and answers to patient questionnaires. When symptoms are registered prospectively, abdominal pain starts or worsens after meals and is not relieved by defecation. As in the general population patients with the syndrome define diarrhea as loose stools and constipation as hard stools regardless of stool frequencies. Variation in defecatory symptoms and discrepancies between these symptoms and stool consistency are the hallmarks of the syndrome, and the degree of variation per fortnight is relatively stable in the individual patient. Fermentation of carbohydrates by colonic bacteria, increased sensitivity to bowel distention by gas, gas-producing food, increased secretion of cholecystokinin after fatty meals and/or increased sympathetic nerve tone at stress can give rise to symptoms. Symptoms can start after a single period of bacterial gastroenteritis. Although patients seeking medical care for the syndrome are more often anxious, the syndrome itself is not psychosomatic. Symptoms are possibly mediated through partial degranulation of mast cells in bowel mucosa, but this does not make it an allergic disease. If bowel dysmotility can be measured, early stage or a mild case of intestinal pseudoobstruction should be considered. Hyperreactivity in the enteric nervous system and/or in the brain is the likely main cause of the symptoms. More widespread activity in the brain after exposure to stimuli originating from bowel nerves or less inhibition of this stimulation in the brain are possible mechanisms.",

Migraines are often characterized by throbbing pain in one area of the head that lasts 4 to 72 hours and is accompanied by symptoms such as sensitivity to light or sound, nausea, and vomiting. Some people experience visual disturbances (auras), which may appear as zigzag lines or flashing lights before or during a migraine. Migraines are estimated to affect more than 10% of the population worldwide, occur most often in people between the ages of 20 and 50, and are about 3 times more common in women than men. Having migraines can be debilitating and lead to missed days of school or work, inability to perform household responsibilities. There is no definitive cure for migraines, but treatments and lifestyle can help reduce the number of attacks in a person and shorten or reduce the severity of the attacks. Hormonal changes in women act as a stimulus. It seems that fluctuations in estrogen levels due to menstrual periods, pregnancy or menopause cause acute headaches. Certain foods and beverages such as salty processed food, caffeine etc... can trigger this disease in both men and women. But one of the most important causes of migraine is stress. Migraine attacks usually develops over hours, increases with normal physical activity. Sometimes this disease can be relieved simply by changes in lifestyle and daily habits, but sometimes it may be necessary to consult a doctor and diagnose it for improvement. Medical treatment and lifestyle modification together can help in getting rid of this disease.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Withdrawal-emergent adverse effects of antipsychotics are an infrequently identified condition which can appear during antipsychotic dose reduction and medication change. In this paper, we present the case of severe extrapyramidal symptoms after a dose reduction of risperidone is presented. A patient, 23 years of age, was admitted to a health care facility due to an unexpected change in his behavior, with paranoid delusions, incoherent thinking, and significant anxiety. An initial risperidone treatment was soon changed to zuclopenhixol. Subsequently, severe extrapyramidal symptoms appeared, after which the medication was switched back to resperidone. Following this treatment, the patient left the health care facility and stopped the medication of his own volition. Psychotic symptoms and massive extrapyramidal symptoms again occurred. These symptoms subsided only slowly during a subsequent treatment with olanzapine. The development of adverse neurological effects together with a worsening of productive psychotic symptomatology may be explained by withdrawal of antipsychotic medication. These symptoms are often attributed to new medications, which are prematurely discontinued after the appearance of an adverse effect, but which are potentially beneficial to a patient, provided that enough time for a spontaneous subsidence of withdrawal-emergent effects is given. Any change in antipsychotic treatment should be carefully considered and thoroughly planned.",

      "abstract": "Placebo effect is an example of ‘contextual’ effect and is the symptomatic improvement experienced by patients who have unknowingly received a placebo (inactive treatment) instead of an active drug. It occurs due to patient-specific factors such as expectation of improvement and is influenced by the context in which the treatment is delivered. Nocebo effect is the opposite of placebo effect and includes worsening of symptoms or incident adverse effects due to expectancy or negative contextual or practitioner influence. Placebo effect has been demonstrated in a range of musculoskeletal conditions, including osteoarthritis (OA), as well as other conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and asthma. In OA, the placebo effect is strongest for subjective outcomes like pain. In fact, the effect size (ES) of placebo analgesia in OA clinical trials (0.51) is clinically significant and higher than the ES (defined by the additional improvement above placebo) obtained from non-pharmacological (0.25) and pharmacological (0.39) treatments. A number of patient- and intervention-specific and contextual factors influence the magnitude of placebo-induced improvements. Placebo analgesia is real, not a ‘trick of the mind’, and results from central mechanisms that increase descending inhibition of pain. Contextual effects are an integral part of everyday clinical practice. While patient- and intervention-specific determinants cannot be changed easily, healthcare practitioners should optimize the physician-specific factors that enhance positive contextual response and minimize nocebo response. Such a strategy that will increase the overall improvement is particularly relevant for OA where there is no ‘cure’ and a predominance of negative beliefs.",

      "abstract": "This manuscript presents working definitions for key clinical course indicators for bipolar disorder, including response, remission, relapse, recurrence, and roughening.A work group of experts in bipolar disorder reviewed prior efforts to define clinical course indicators for unipolar depression and for schizophrenia. Using these efforts as templates, the work group developed consensus operational definitions. The rationale for each of the definitions was a point of time when a treatment decision needed to be made.The group defined response as a 50% reduction in a score from a standard rating scale of symptomatology from an appropriate baseline, regardless of index episode type (manic, depressed, or mixed). In addition, the other pole cannot be significantly worsened during response. Remission was defined as absence or minimal symptoms of both mania and depression for at least 1 week. Sustained remission requires at least eight consecutive weeks of remission, and perhaps as many as 12 weeks. A relapse/recurrence was defined as a return to the full syndrome criteria of an episode of mania, mixed episode, or depression following a remission of any duration. Roughening was defined as a return of symptoms at a subsyndromal level, perhaps representing a prodrome of an impending episode.The work group recommends that all reports of clinical trials in bipolar disorder include results using these definitions. This will introduce standards for such reports. Hopefully, the definitions will be revised and improved over time.",

      "title": "What Do Patients Want in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder? Taiwan’s TAILOR Survey",
      "abstract": "In Taiwan, the number of patients being treated for depression has been increasing over recent decades, but there remain some key unmet needs for these patients. One issue is the low rate of help-seeking, which may be at least partially attributable to the stigma of depression in Asian societies. Stigma also contributes to underdiagnosis, because stigmatised patients may emphasise somatic symptoms (e.g. lethargy/fatigue, sleep disorders or changes in appetite), fearing how they will be perceived if they discuss psychological symptoms with their physician. Underdiagnosis may also result from cross-cultural differences, because assessment scales and screening tools are usually developed in Western populations and may not have the same validity in Asian patients. Depression in Taiwan appears to be undertreated, with a high rate of suboptimal antidepressant dosages and inadequate duration of therapy. Patients may discontinue treatment earlier than recommended for a number of reasons related to their own beliefs about treatment, their relationship with their physicians, or the effects of the medication (adverse effects, slow onset of effect, or lack of effect on comorbid symptoms). Moreover, frequently there is discordance between how patients and physicians define treatment success in depression. Patients are more likely to achieve a benefit from treatment which remains persistent when physicians and patients are closely aligned on treatment goals. To better understand the experiences, preferences and attitudes of patients with depression in Taiwan, the Target Antidepressant Initiation choice to unLock positive patient Outcomes and Response (TAILOR) survey was conducted in 340 adult outpatients receiving treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). The results of the TAILOR survey highlight the personal and perceived stigma of depression, current barriers to seeking help and maintaining treatment, and opportunities to improve shared decision-making, medication adherence and clinical outcomes for Taiwanese patients with MDD.",

      "abstract": "Many symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) are the consequence of motor disability. However, there are clinical features that appear to be independent of motor impairment. For example, depression is a common problem, and patients tend to become passive and show little interest in daily activities. Sleep difficulties are also common in patients with PD, and sleep disruption appears to be related to disease progression. Other symptoms, such as some degree of orthostatic hypotension or constipation, may depend on autonomic dysfunction. Most patients receive treatment with drugs that improve symptoms but also produce side effects; therefore, it is difficult to separate problems associated with the progression of the disease from those caused by medication. For example, when used long term, the most widely used drug therapy, l-dopa, leads to a variety of severe complications, including dyskinesias, “on-off” fluctuations in drug effectiveness, and a number of psychiatric manifestations. Moreover, l-dopa efficacy generally decreases as the disease progresses.\n\nThe ideal new drug would arrest or even reverse the progression of the disease without the complications associated with existing medications. With this aim in mind, it is crucial to assess the potential of the emerging A2A receptor blockers with respect to all features of PD, not just those related to the impairment of the motor system.

      "title": "A Case of Interdose Discontinuation Symptoms With Venlafaxine Extended Release",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Venlafaxine extended release (XR) is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that, like many other antidepressants, may be associated with a discontinuation syndrome. Discontinuation syndromes are, in part, related to drugs with short half-lives1 (eg, for venlafaxine and its metabolite, 5 and 11 hours, respectively). Venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms have been clinically reported as soon as 6 hours2 and as long as 9 days3 after discontinuation of the drug, but typically emerge in 1–4 days.4 In one study, the prevalence of typical discontinuation symptoms with venlafaxine XR (eg, dysphoria, headaches, nausea, irritability, emotional lability, sleep disturbance) was 27%.5 However, discontinuation symptoms may be severe6,7 in up to 5% of cases.8 In addition, unexpected symptoms may emerge such as “shock-like sensations,”9 gait difficulties,10 palinopsia (persistent visual images),11 delirium,12 suicidal ideation,13 and hypomania14 or mania.14,15 In the following case, we describe a patient who experienced routine venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms within hours of daily dosing.\r\n\r\nCase report. In December 2009, Ms A, a 41-year-old white woman with a history of hypertension and palpitations, was prescribed venlafaxine XR 37.5 mg/d by another primary care provider for the treatment of depression. With a change in primary care providers in January 2011, Ms A promptly discussed her concerns with venlafaxine XR. According to the patient, approximately 2 months after the onset of the venlafaxine XR trial, she began to experience a number of side effects in the absence of any other changes in medication, including nausea, irritability, emotional lability, and, most troublesome, “electrical brain shocks.” Oddly, all of these symptoms occurred on a daily basis, and they consistently emerged approximately 8–10 hours after the administration of the daily dose of venlafaxine XR. Symptoms would then promptly resolve after Ms A took the next dose of venlafaxine XR.\r\n\r\nBecause the patient seemed to be experiencing discontinuation symptoms, she was switched to regular-release venlafaxine 37.5 mg in January 2011, which was dosed twice per day. The regular-release venlafaxine was well tolerated. Within 2 weeks, the patient confirmed that most, if not all, of her symptoms had subsided.\r\n\r\nAlthough discontinuation symptoms from venlafaxine XR have been clinically described by one author in as few as 6 hours after the last dose,2 we are unaware of any actual case reports of venlafaxine XR interdose discontinuation symptoms. This phenomenon may be related to individual genetics and the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system. Specifically, venlafaxine XR is metabolized by the 2D6 isoenzyme, which is subject to broad genetic polymorphism. In this regard, Zhou16 has described 4 genetic variants: ultrarapid metabolizers, extensive metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, and poor metabolizers, which constitute 3%–5%, 70%–80%, 10%–17%, and 5%–10% of white individuals, respectively.

Evidence suggests that all classes of psychotropic medication may have some deleterious effect on memory. However, the clinician must weigh the risk of memory loss due to psychotropic drugs against the risk that certain emotional illnesses, such as depression and severe anxiety, may themselves impair memory function if not treated. Clinically significant effects on memory are most often seen when using drugs or combinations of drugs with high anticholinergic activity and when using short-acting benzodiazepines. Clinical evidence and some research suggest that geriatric patients are more sensitive to the potential memory impairment caused by psychotropic drugs, but more research data are needed.",

Patients were divided into two groups depending on the form of alcohol abuse: 1) periodic (drunk), 2) permanent. Alcohol dependence with a drunken form of alcohol abuse was characterized by the presence of more than one spontaneous or socially conditioned remission (more than one month of sobriety) for a year, a short period of hard consumption of alcohol before the development of a psychotic disorder, a shorter period or no control period of consumption alcohol. On the contrary, in patients with permanent drinking, in some cases, up to the development of a psychotic episode, patients could independently stop drinking. Psychotic disorders were more often observed in patients with the periodic (drunk) form of alcohol abuse. A provoking factor in the development of psychotic disorders (the presence of somatoneurological) disease, was more often more signifi cant in the group of patients with permanent form of alcohol abuse. In the case of a drunken form of alcohol abuse, more expressive vegetative signs of withdrawal syndrome (tachycardia, arterial hypertension, hyperhidrosis) were noted in the structure of the of alcoholic delirium. These patients had more expressive aff ective (mostly anxiety) and psychomotor agitation. Productive psychotic symptomatology (delusion, hallucinations) had a more signifi cant eff ect on the behavior of patients with a drunken form of alcohol abuse. In patients with permanent alcohol abuse, visual hallucinations were more often associated with tactile hallucinations. In this group, a prolongation of the psychotic disorder occurred more frequently due to the exacerbation of somatoneurological diseases, which often had at these patients.",

As possible comorbidities or triggers we could count on a tonsillitis and/or a depressive reaction a few days before. Serious consideration must be given to a differential diagnosis with an encephalitis but, despite the presence of an intermittent febricula, it was rejected by both units: internal medicine and neurology, after performing some complementary tests, albeit some more specific tests are still pending. His psychiatric background was also checked, which initially was orientated as a questionable bipolar disorder. At all events, symptoms stopped progressively until, almost complete remittance in the moment he was discharged from the hospital. He recovered his normal functionality. The treatment given was risperidon 2 mL/day, quetiapin 50 mg/8 h and baclofen 10 mg/12 h. This can be used as an example of how many difficulties we usually found to catalogue an acute disorder in first phases, even to encompass the clinical profile within the limits of psychiatry or neurology.

      "title": "Prolonged coma after anesthesia",
      "abstract": "Anesthesiologists are pretty much the only doctors who induce controlled and reversible coma medically in their daily practice. The word “coma” derived from a Greek word “Koma” signifies a state of sleep. In medical terms it is defined as a state of unresponsiveness from which the patient cannot be aroused.[1] Therefore any delayed recovery is viewed as anesthetic problem. Delayed recovery from anesthesia or coma after anesthesia is a major anesthetic complication. The causes for delayed recovery from anesthesia are many. They are patient, surgical, anesthetic, and pharmacological factors. The pharmacological factors include the use of various anesthetic and adjuvant drugs, and their interactions with other drugs, known or unknown. This depends upon the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, context sensitive half-lives, amount of drug administered, accidental administration, co-administration with other drugs etc. The patient factors such as the extremes of age, obesity, and various co-morbidities like the cardiovascular, renal, liver or other major organ dysfunction can potentiate the effects of the drug used. Some of the rare causes are myxoedema coma, drug toxicity and Addison's disease. However the delayed recovery due to anesthetic causes, excluding hypoxia, usually lasts for a few hours to days.[1] In the case report published in this issue, the coma lasted for >4 weeks. The authors have eliminated most of the causes of delayed recovery from anesthesia. However the hypoglycemia was detected in the postoperative period when the patient did not recover from anesthesia. The history obtained later revealed that the patient had taken long acting insulin in the preoperative period. The blood sugar level on the morning of surgery was borderline. No blood sugar was estimated during the entire surgical procedure. These factors could have led to profound and prolonged undetected hypoglycemia, which could have led to delayed recovery. Hypoglycemia of prolonged duration (>30 min) leads to neuroglycopenia and brain damage.[2] The symptoms depend on level of blood glucose and also on time taken to detect and correct hypoglycemia. Even after correcting hypoglycemia, prolonged coma is observed in critical care units. It can produce a variety of symptoms and effects, but the principal problem arising from an inadequate supply of glucose to the brain is impairment of function (neuroglycopenia). Effects can range from mild dysphoria to more serious issues such as seizures, unconsciousness, and (rarely) permanent brain damage and death.[3] Plasma glucose levels are maintained between 4 and 8 mmol/L (72–144 mg/dl) throughout the 24 hours. 3.3-3.9 mmol/L (60-70 mg/dl) is cited as lower limit of blood glucose. However hypoglycemic symptoms do not occur till 2.8-3.0 mmol/L (50-54 mg/dl) of plasma glucose. Under anesthesia hypoglycemic symptoms are not detected. In the case presented the blood glucose level 5 h after preoperative value was 2.2 mmol/L (40 mg/dl). To detect hypoglycemia causing brain damage electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion-weighted imaging of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are useful, both in detection and prognostication. EEG shows theta waves and lambda waves with definite slowing, flat and burst suppression patterns. In this case the EEG changes observed point to hypoglycemia as the factor leading to delayed recovery. There have been reports of hyper-intense signal intensities in diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI in hypoglycemia.[4] Recently different patterns of DW MRI findings involving the internal capsules, corona radiata and frontoparietal cortex in a patient who recovered from prolonged hypoglycemic coma without neurological deficit have been observed. Therefore, this particular modality might have been useful in diagnosis and prognostication.[5] Volatile anesthetics have been found to produce neuroprotection in various paradigms. The preconditioning by these agents partially protects perirhinal cortex and striatal dependent functions against moderate to severe neonatal hypoxia-ischemia.[6] Although previous morphological data have suggested that cells die by necrosis, experimental research showed neuronal damage after hypoglycemia has features of apoptosis.[7] After exclusion of organic and pharmacological causes, coma may be attributed to a dissociative stupor. Reported delays in return to consciousness span time periods from 2 to 30 h, and longer periods of amnesia thereafter. There are four reports in the literature; each excluded other pathology with extensive examination, laboratory tests and radiological imaging. One individual experienced this phenomenon on three separate occasions after tracheal stenosis repairs.[89] Conclusion Delayed recovery is usually multifactorial. In the present case report, it looks more like prolonged hypoglycemia leading to delayed recovery. A differential diagnosis of dissociative stupor can be considered when other causes are excluded. The lesson one has to learn as a perioperative physician is to assess the patient thoroughly and investigate according to the need and evidence. An arterial blood gas and blood sugar estimation are needed in prolonged surgeries with multiple co-morbidities particularly in obese individuals.

      "title": "Rebound effects of modern drugs: serious adverse events unknown by health professionals",
      "abstract": "Supported in the Hippocratic aphorism primum non nocere, the bioethical principle of non-maleficence pray that the medical act cause the least damage or injury to the health of the patient, leaving it to the doctor to assess the risks of a particular therapy through knowledge of possible adverse events of drugs. Among these, the rebound effect represents a common side effect to numerous classes of modern drugs, may cause serious and fatal disorders in patients. This review aims to clarify the health professionals on clinical and epidemiological aspects of rebound phenomenon. A qualitative, exploratory and bibliographic review was held in the PubMed database using the keywords ‘rebound’, ‘withdrawal’, ‘paradoxical’, ‘acetylsalicylic acid’, ‘anti-inflammatory’, ‘bronchodilator’, ‘antidepressant’, ‘statin’, ‘proton pump inhibitor’ and ‘bisphosphonate’. The rebound effect occurs after discontinuation of numerous classes of drugs that act contrary to the disease disorders, exacerbating them at levels above those prior to treatment. Regardless of the disease, the drug and duration of treatment, the phenomenon manifests itself in a small proportion of susceptible individuals. However, it may cause serious and fatal adverse events should be considered a public health problem in view of the enormous consumption of drugs by population. Bringing together a growing and unquestionable body of evidence, the physician needs to have knowledge of the consequences of the rebound effect and how to minimize it, increasing safety in the management of modern drugs. On the other hand, this rebound effect can be used in a curative way, broadening the spectrum of the modern therapeutics. Apoiado no aforismo hipocrático primum non nocere, o princípio bioético da não maleficência roga que o ato médico cause o menor dano ou agravo à saúde do paciente, incumbindo ao médico avaliar os riscos de determinada terapêutica por meio do conhecimento dos possíveis eventos adversos das drogas. Dentre esses, o efeito rebote representa um efeito colateral comum a inúmeras classes de fármacos modernos, podendo causar transtornos graves e fatais nos pacientes. Esta revisão tem o objetivo de esclarecer os profissionais da saúde sobre os aspectos clínicos e epidemiológicos do fenômeno rebote. Uma revisão qualitativa, exploratória e bibliográfica foi realizada na base de dados PubMed utilizando os unitermos ‘rebound’, ‘withdrawal’, ‘paradoxical’, ‘acetylsalicylic acid’, ‘anti-inflammatory’, ‘bronchodilator’, ‘antidepressant’, ‘statin’, ‘proton pump inhibitor’ and ‘bisphosphonate’. O efeito rebote ocorre após a descontinuação de inúmeras classes de fármacos com ação contrária aos distúrbios da doença, exacerbando-os a níveis superiores aos anteriores do tratamento. Independente da doença, da droga e da duração do tratamento, o fenômeno se manifesta numa pequena proporção de indivíduos suscetíveis. No entanto, pode causar eventos adversos graves e fatais, devendo ser considerado um problema de saúde pública em vista do enorme consumo de fármacos pela população. Reunindo um corpo de evidências crescente e inquestionável, o médico precisa ter conhecimento das consequências do efeito rebote e de como minimizá-lo, desse modo aumentando a segurança no manejo das drogas modernas. Por outro lado, este efeito rebote pode ser utilizado de forma curativa, ampliando o espectro da terapêutica moderna.",

      "title": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea",
      "abstract": "The word “apnea” means literally \"without breath\", and thus “sleep apnea” means not breathing while sleeping. Normally, during sleep we do not have pauses in-between breaths. Individuals with sleep apnea often stop breathing completely (apnea) or partially (hypopnea) during sleep for 10 seconds or more and sometimes for more than one minute, which leads to low oxygen in the brain and other organs. Sleep apnea is, therefore, a chronic condition where the normal sleep respiratory cycle is disrupted. Approximately 25% of adults seem to have sleep apnea of some degree. Men seem to be more commonly affected than women (especially pre-menopausal women). Other risk factors include: older age, overweight or obesity, and having a small mouth, jaw or throat, large tongue or retro-position of the lower jaw. Smoking, alcohol, ingestion of sedative medications, chronic nasal inflammation (rhinitis) with obstruction, large neck girth, etc represent risk factors for this disorder. Sleep apnea can be treated by applying continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), dental appliances or surgery. The decision to treat and with what specific modality is dependent on a complex interplay of symptoms, co-existent disorders and disease severity. This decision should be made by the patient in conjunction with the healthcare provider, preferably a specialist in Sleep Medicine who has enough experience in diagnosing and treating this condition.",

MHP isclassified as a somatic type of delusional disorder in DSM-IV and is defined as an erroneous conviction of bodily disease, abnormality or alteration. It includes delusional beliefs about bodily sensations or functions; such as feeling malodorous, being infected by parasites, having dysmorphic features, or that a certain organ is no longer functioning. MHP has been divided into 4 main categories: Delusions of infestation (including parasitosis); delusions of dysmorphophobia, such as of misshapenness, personal ugliness, or exaggerated size of body parts (this seems closest to that of body dysmorphic disorder); delusions of foul body odours or halitosis or delusional bromosis (also known as olfactory reference syndrome); and a miscellaneous group.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Akathisia is a common adverse effect of antipsychotics and, less commonly, antidepressants. Akathisia can cause great discomfort and is often described by the patient as a most distressing sensation; however, the condition is often underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. In oncological settings, neuroleptics and antidepressants that induce akathisia are also administered. However, reports of akathisia in oncology settings are few and a case of akathisia in a bedridden patient has not been reported as far as we know. Case report: A 72-year-old man with esophageal cancer who could not sit down or stand up was administered 5 mg/day haloperidol to relieve agitation as a symptom of major depressive disorder. Three days after the administration of haloperidol, the agitation had become worse. Careful observation revealed that the patient sometimes showed slight rubbing movement of the lower extremities and slight twisting movements of the body, which were not observed before the administration of haloperidol. The patient moved his body and lower extremities to relieve restlessness, which had developed after the administration of haloperidol. Although symptoms were atypical, akathisia was suspected and discontinuation of haloperidol resolved the symptoms. Results and significance of results: In patients with poor performance status, clues leading to the correct diagnosis of akathisia might be absent, which would not be the case in patients who were able to walk, stand up, or sit down. Careful observations of patients before and after the administration of drugs that may cause akathisia may be required to ensure correct diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Summary Depression is still underestimated, despite its high incidence, and its impact on subjective quality of life. To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

The authors review certain exogenous factors that seem capable of triggering attacks and/or increasing their frequency and intensity: self-administered pharmacologic agents (caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, over-the-counter cold preparations, cannabis, cocaine); habits (sleep deprivation, diet, exercise, relaxation, hyperventilation); and aspects of the environment (fluorescent lighting, life stressors). There may be a specificity to the action of some of these factors, because certain factors previously thought to trigger panic attacks (e.g., pain, hypoglycemia) have been proved not to have this effect. Although the clinical significance of many of the exogenous factors discussed still awaits empirical confirmation, attention to such factors during the initial evaluation of a patient with panic disorder may be helpful in formulating a successful treatment plan.",

      "abstract": "Any long journey gives rise to travel fatigue, regardless of the number of time zones that are crossed.10-12 The main symptoms are a sense of disorientation and increases in weariness and the likelihood of suffering from a headache. These difficulties are due to spending time in a cramped environment with little opportunity for exercise, altered (and often unpalatable) food, and dehydration. Delays and detours during the journey, and possible difficulties after reaching one's final destination after the journey, are likely to exacerbate the problem, as is the dry and slightly hypoxic air in the cabin when the journey is by plane. It has been suggested that the risk of deep-vein thrombosis is also increased in these circumstances, although the extent to which dehydration, lack of activity, and hypoxia are individually or collectively responsible is unclear.13-22If the number of time zones that has been crossed is small (less than three), travel fatigue is the only problem, jet lag (see below) being absent. The symptomsare transitory and can quickly be remedied on arrival at the final destination. Important measures include rehydration (water and fruit juices, not tea or alcohol which promote urine loss), a rest or short nap, some light physical activity, and a shower. Some of these measures (brief bouts of exercise and drinking to minimize dehydration) can be practised also during the journey. Any nap that is taken on arrival should not be too long, so that a full sleep can be taken when it is night; such a nocturnal sleep can be taken as easily as in the departure zone, since night at the destination and place of departure coincide.",

      "abstract": "Cytokines, signaling molecules of the immune system, have been implicated as a contributing factor for mood disorders such as depression. Several lines of evidence supporting this contention are briefly reviewed and caveats are introduced. Essentially, a relationship between cytokines and depression is based on the findings that: 1) proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin‐1, interleukin‐6, tumor necrosis factor‐α) and bacterial endotoxins elicit sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, soporific effects) and symptoms of anxiety/depression that may be attenuated by chronic antidepressant treatment, 2) cytokines induce neuroendocrine and central neurotransmitter changes reminiscent of those implicated in depression, and these effects are exacerbated by stressors, 3) severe depressive illness is accompanied by signs of immune activation and by elevations of cytokine production or levels, and 4) immunotherapy, using interleukin‐2 or interferon‐α, promotes depressive symptoms that are attenuated by antidepressant treatment. It is argued that cytokine synthesis and release, elicited upon activation of the inflammatory response system, provoke neuroendocrine and brain neurotransmitter changes that are interpreted by the brain as being stressors, and contribute to the development of depression. Furthermore, such effects are subject to a sensitization effect so that a history of stressful experiences or cytokine activation augment the response to later challenges and hence the evolution of depression",

In this short review, we will focus on the latter, i.e., the mathematical description of the ventilatory controller and some techniques to measure the ventilatory drive. Note that the model(s) we will discuss can be applied to “chemical control of breathing” only. Chemical control of breathing is control dependent on arterial blood gasses (e.g., PaCO 2 , PaO 2 , and pH), and it is active during states of mental relaxation, such as non‐REM sleep, anesthesia, and possibly physical relaxation. The models do not apply to the respiratory effects of exercise or behavioral/emotional activities such as eating, speaking, and playing a musical instrument.",

The Rome III consensus committee suggests that FD is subdivided into an epigastric pain syndrome and a postprandial distress syndrome based on symptom patterns.1 These terms have replaced the previous categories of ‘ulcer-like’ and ‘dysmotility-like’ dyspepsia. Dyspeptic symptoms are very common in the general population with prevalence rates of 20–40%, and although FD is not associated with increased mortality or morbidity the symptoms have a major impact on health-related quality of life, utilisation of healthcare resources and work productivity.2\n\nFD is probably a multifactorial disorder. Acid, Helicobacter pylori infection, visceral hypersensitivity, disturbances in gastric motility or accommodation and various psychosocial factors have all been implicated. Empiric antisecretory therapy, H pylori eradication or prokinetics remain the mainstay of treatment for FD, even though meta-analyses have shown limited or no symptomatic effects,3 4 and to date, …",

Known as \"new generation antidepressants\", they belong either to classical families of anti-depressants (tricyclics or MAOIs) or to new pharmacological groups. The first ones differ from classical tricyclics or classical MAOIs for the absence of major contraindications for their use (mostly few or no anticholinergic properties for new tricyclics and no dietary restriction rules for new MAOIs). The nontricyclics-non MAOIs antidepressants are, for most of them, particularly well tolerated and safe. The clinical potency of such compounds seems to reach conditions beyond depressive states and they have indeed some specific effects in obsessive-compulsive disorders or other anxiety disorders. In this group, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors seem to represent a major progress in antidepressive therapy. All these advantages invite now the practitioners to use these \"new generation antidepressants\" as the first choice medication, when treating uncomplicated depressive disorders.",

      "abstract": "The psychotropic drugs responsible for side effects on the gastrointestinal tract are essentially those that develop the most effective anticholinergic actions. But also to be taken into account are the depression of the central nervous system, the alpha adrenergic effects and the indirect results of the relief of the anxiety and depression symptoms. In spite of the anti-emetic properties of the antipsychotic drugs, nauseas and vomiting appear as frequently as with placebos. The antipsychotic and antidepressive drugs provoke dysphagia and achalasia, because of a loss of tonus. Some cases of hiatal hernia are attributed to tricyclic antidepressants. The latter drugs, as well as IMOA and aliphatic and piperidinated phenothiazines, induce constipation in psychiatric patients, who are already prone to it. Even ileus may occur, or dilatation of the bowel or the stomach. Diarrhea is rare. Patients treated with psychotropics often complain of a dry mouth (xerostomy). This unpleasant sensation is succesfully treated with betanechol (75 mg/d) which does not impair - as pilocarpine does - the therapeutic effects. Dental caries, moniliasis and parotidites have been attributed to neuroleptic drugs or tricyclic antidepressants, on account of the inhibition of the salivary flow. Vomiting, diarrhea and epigastric burning appear in 10% of the patients treated with lithium (even when the posology is correct).",

      "title": "Risperidone's 2 New Pediatric Indications: Approval Supports Antipsychotic Use in Children with Schizophrenia or Bipolar Disorder",
      "abstract": "Risperidone is the first second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) to receive FDA approval for treating children and adolescents with bipolar mania or schizophrenia. Specifically, the SGA is indicated for treating schizophrenia in patients age 13 to 17 and as monotherapy in short-term treatment of manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder in patients age 10 to 17 (Table 1). Risperidone also is approved for: * schizophrenia in adults * acute mania or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adults, alone or in combination with lithium or valproate * irritability associated with autistic disorder in patients age 5 to 16. Clinical implications Risperidone is widely used off-label to treat irritability in children with pervasive developmental disorders, (1,2) aggressive behaviors associated with conduct disorder, (3) psychotic disorders, (4) and bipolar disorder. (5) It also has been used off-label to treat pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar disorder for many years. These 2 new indications give clinicians additional support for using SGAs in children and adolescents with these serious psychiatric disorders. How it works Risperidone's therapeutic activity in schizophrenia seems to be mediated through a combination of dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin type 2 (5HT2) receptor antagonism. Antagonism at receptors other than D2 and 5HT2 may explain some of risperidone's other therapeutic effects. Pharmacokinetics In children, the half-lives of risperidone and its major active metabolite 9-hydroxyrisperidone are 3 [+ or -] 2.3 hours and 22 [+ or -] 46 hours, respectively. (6) The pharmacologic activity of 9-hydroxyrisperidone is similar to that of risperidone. Risperidone is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 2D6 enzyme system. The main metabolic pathway is through hydroxylation of risperidone to 9-hydroxyrisperidone by CYP 2D6. Food does not affect the rate or extent of the drug's absorption. (6) Efficacy studies In schizophrenia. Approval of the indication for pediatric schizophrenia was based on data from 2 short-term (6 and 8 weeks) randomized, double-blind, controlled trials involving a total of 416 patients age 13 to 17 who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for schizophrenia and were experiencing an acute episode at enrollment. (7) In one study, patients received risperidone, 1 to 3 mg/d, 4 to 6 mg/d, or placebo. In the other study, dosages were 0.15 to 0.6 mg/d or 1.5 to 6 mg/d. Except for patients in the 0.15 to 0.6 mg group (who initially received 0.05 mg/d), most patients started risperidone at 0.5 mg/d. In both trials, starting dosages were titrated to the target range in approximately 7 days. Outcomes were measured as changes in total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale scores. The multi-item PANSS inventory measures positive and negative schizophrenia symptoms, disorganized thoughts, uncontrolled hostility / excitement, and anxiety / depression. The PSP gauges personal and social functioning in socially useful activities (work and study), personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing/aggressive behaviors. Risperidone, 1 to 6 mg/d, improved schizophrenia symptoms significantly more than placebo, as measured by PANSS scores. Doses >3 mg/d did not show greater efficacy than lower doses, as evaluated by PANSS and PSP scores. Adverse reactions experienced by >5% of patients treated with risperidone included somnolence, parkinsonism, tremor, dystonia, dizziness, akathisia, increased salivation, and anxiety. (7) In bipolar I disorder. Risperidone's efficacy for short-term treatment of mania in children and adolescents was demonstrated in a 3-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study of 169 patients age 10 to 17 who were experiencing a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder. …",

Postural hypotension may be a presenting feature in certain autonomic disorders (such as pure autonomic failure), it may be a pointer towards an alternative diagnosis (as in multiple system atrophy presenting with parkinsonian features), and it may complicate drug therapy (as with levodopa). Postural hypotension is associated with increased morbidity and also mortality, especially in elderly people, in whom falls result in injuries. Advances have resulted in a better understanding of the pathophysiological processes, and in the treatment of postural hypotension.\n\nPostural hypotension usually is considered when there are characteristic features resulting from cerebral ischaemia such as loss of consciousness (fainting, syncope). Other symptoms may occur (table1).2 Measuring blood pressure while lying and after 2 minutes of standing often confirms a postural fall. However, the lack of a fall, in the presence of suggestive symptoms, should warrant further investigation. There are various disorders, including the chronic fatigue syndrome and the postural tachycardia syndrome, in which postural intolerance may not be accompanied by hypotension. Additional factors may be needed to unmask postural hypotension (table2), especially in mild to moderate autonomic failure.\n\nView this table:\n\nTable 1 \nSome of the symptoms resulting from postural hypotension, and impaired perfusion of various organs\n\n\n\nView this table:\n\nTable 2 \nFactors that may influence postural hypotension\n\n\n\nFurther evaluation is best undertaken in an autonomic laboratory.

The patient has been seizure-free and asymptomatic for more than 5 years after resection. There were no operative complications. The patient’s behavior and neurocognitive performance have improved markedly, and he is now employed and does not require supervision. Also, there has been a pronounced reduction in the adverse effects of antiepileptic drug medication. Partial or localization-related epilepsy is the most common seizure disorder. Approximately 90% of the adult incident cases of epilepsy have recurrent and unprovoked partial seizures. An estimated 20% of patients with epilepsy have an intractable seizure disorder, that is, pharmacoresistant seizures that are physically and socially disabling. Coexisting comorbid conditions associated with an intractable seizure disorder often include cognitive impairment, behavioral problems, psychosocial isolation, and the inability to operate a motor vehicle or to be gainfully employed. Patients with medically refractory seizures may also require a supervised living situation or caregiver. A prognostic indicator for an unfavorable response to antiepileptic drug therapy is the identification of a structural lesion as the cause of the seizure disorder. Potential alternative forms of therapy for patients with intractable epilepsy include the use of newer antiepileptic drug medications, surgical treatment, and vagus nerve stimulation.",

Acute versus chronic pain is important to clearly differentiate. Acute pain is rapid in onset, self-limiting, a symptom of the disease, and the patient often presents in acute distress. Examples of acute pain include postoperative pain, obstetrical labor pain, and trauma or injury-related pain and characteristically is described as sudden, sharp, and localized pain. It is usually self-limited and may be associated with physiologic changes such as diaphoresis and increases in heart rate and blood pressure (Mirchandani et al 2011). Chronic pain; chronic pain is long-term pain classified as acute, moderate, and severe. It is often differentiated as malignant or non-malignant pain. Chronic pain is often described as gnawing, aching, and diffuse and is more gradual in onset and cessation than acute pain, which can also be simultaneously superimposed on top of the former. It can vary in intensity, may remit briefly, and has definite impact psychologically and socially. Pain characteristics: Acute and chronic was given Table 1. The treatment for such pain is often successful with traditional pharmacologic measures; however, often less traditional drugs and even non-pharmacologic therapies are necessary to achieve relief (Mirchandani et al., 2011).",

This ‘extra’ which complements the infantilism of hysteria, are determined by the following constellation of factors: (1) an immature, underdeveloped, emotional personality with a feeble identity; (2) due to the relatively great need for warding off emotional influences, the personality is more vulnerable to emotional stress; (3) a predisposition to deficient repression, leading to insufficient mental defence; (4) an auxiliary auto-regulation in the form of states of lowered consciousness and convulsions or fits, to keep the overwhelming emotional influences outside his awareness. Freud elucidated the dynamic relationships in an impressive way; he described all that can be called neurotic in hysteria. But we know that hysteria encompasses more than various types of neurosis, and can also manifest itself in psychotic and psychopathic-like patterns of behaviour.",

      "abstract": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex disease that affects children and adolescents as well as adults. The etiology has not been established. While many pediatricians and other healthcare providers are aware of ME/CFS, they often lack essential knowledge that is necessary for diagnosis and treatment. Many young patients experience symptoms for years before receiving a diagnosis. This Primer, written by the International Writing Group for Pediatric ME/CFS provides information necessary to understand, diagnose, and man-age the symptoms of ME/CFS in children and adolescents. ME/CFS is characterized by overwhelming fatigue with a substantial loss of physical and mental stamina. Cardinal features are malaise and a worsening of symptoms following minimal physical or mental exertion. These post-exertional symptoms can persist for hours, days, or weeks and are not relieved by rest or sleep. Other symptoms include cognitive problems, unrefreshing or disturbed sleep, generalized or localized pain, light-headedness and additional symptoms in multiple organ systems. While some young patients can attend school, on a full or part-time basis, many others are wheelchair dependent, housebound, or bedbound. Prevalence estimates for pediatric ME/CFS vary from 0.1%-0.5%. Because there is no diagnostic test for ME/CFS, diagnosis is purely clinical, based on the history and the exclusion of other fatiguing illnesses by physical examination and medical testing. Co-existing medical conditions including orthostatic intolerance are common. Successful management is based on determining the optimum balance of rest and activity to help prevent post-exertional symptom worsening. Medications are helpful to treat pain, insomnia, orthostatic intolerance and other symptoms. The published literature on ME/CFS and specifically that describing the diagnosis and management of pediatric ME/CFS is very limited. Where published studies are lacking, recommendations are based on the clinical observations and practices of the authors.",

      "title": "Depression and resilience: insights from cognitive, neuroimaging, and psychopharmacological studies",
      "abstract": "Abstract The symptoms of depression include persistent low mood, feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, and anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure. Mood is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic, social, environmental, and other factors, such as substance abuse. Depression is further characterized by dysfunctional attitudes and negative automatic thoughts or ruminations. Psychiatric diagnostic criteria distinguish patients who experience only depressive episodes (unipolar depression or major depressive disorder, MDD) from patients who experience depressive episodes but also manic ones (bipolar disorder, BD). The symptoms of mania, on the other hand, include euphoria, over-activity, distractibility, socially inappropriate behaviour, increased appetite, and impaired insight. Thus, the emotional states of patients with depression and mania can be considered to represent two polar extremes on a mood spectrum. The states manifested in depression and mania are pathological in that they are extreme, disrupt quality of life, and are persistent and often recurrent. This chapter examines not only depression in MDD, but contrasts it with the, at times similar but at times diametrically opposed, symptoms of other disorders, such as BD, to achieve better insight. It also examines resilience in healthy individuals, i.e., how can mood remain normal despite factors such as adverse life events. Research on resilience has focused on determining the protective factors that allow some individuals to have more positive outcomes, despite being exposed to a variety of stressors.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review To review the recent literature on predictors and personal motives of polydrug use in opioid users with a focus on combined use of opioids with stimulants, benzodiazepines and gabapentinoids. Recent findings In North America, methamphetamine is now the most prevalent co-drug in opioid users and is responsible for high mortality rates. In Europe, opioids are rather combined with either cocaine, benzodiazepines or gabapentionoids, but recent data are lacking. Main personal motives of opioid users to combine opioids with methamphetamine or cocaine is to boost the opioid high, inhibit the withdrawal effects of heroin and have a cheaper alternative to maintain the opioid high. Risk factors of polydrug use by opioid users included being male, younger age, homelessness, high-risk sexual behavior, needle sharing, incarceration, poor mental health and recent use of cocaine or prescription opioids. The motives for co-use of opioids and gabapentinoids also include seeking a better high, lower price and to self-medicate pain/physical symptoms, including those resulting from withdrawal. Summary When treating opioid users with polydrug drug use, special attention should be paid to dosing when in opioid agonist methadone/buprenorphine treatment and to the presence of physical pain. The validity of part of the personal motives seems questionable which deserves attention when counselling opioid users with polydrug use.",

      "title": "The Role of NMDA Receptors in Opiate Tolerance, Sensitization, and Physical Dependence A Review of the Research, A Cellular Model, and Implications for the Treatment of Pain and Addiction",
      "abstract": "When administered acutely, opiates such as morphine produce characteristic behavioral effects, including a decrease in pain responsiveness (analgesia) and an increase in pleasure (euphoria). Because of their profound ability to produce analgesia, opiates are the drugs of choice for the treatment of severe or chronic pain. Because of their ability to produce positive reinforcement and pleasure, these drugs are widely self-administered and, therefore, represent an important class of abused drugs. Long-term treatment with opiates, as well as other drugs of abuse, leads to three well-known consequences: tolerance, which is a decrease in an effect of a drug with chronic use; sensitization, which is an increase in an effect of drug with chronic use; and physical dependence, which is a physiological change produced by chronic use, such that the absence of the drug results in an unpleasant withdrawal syndrome* (1–3). Tolerance, sensitization, and physical dependence are important in both the clinical use of opiates and in their self-administration. For example, the development of tolerance to the analgesic effect of opiates may lead to the need to escalate the dose during the treatment of chronic pain, whereas tolerance to the euphorigenic effect may be a factor in the escalation of drug use in addicts (4). Conversely, tolerance to dose-limiting side effects may allow addicts to escalate drug intake and achieve greater euphorigenic effects. The development of sensitization is thought to be involved in the craving that occurs following chronic use of drugs of abuse and, therefore, critical to addiction (5,6). Finally, the avoidance of withdrawal in physically dependent individuals is considered to be an important factor in maintaining self-administration (2,4). Although tolerance, sensitization, and physical dependence have been widely studied, there is still an incomplete understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in their development and expression. Recent experiments suggest that excitatory amino acid systems and, in particular, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors may have an important role in these phenomena. This review will explore the role of NMDA receptors in the behavioral changes that occur following long-term opiate administration, including tolerance, sensitization, and physical dependence. I will focus on opiates that act at the",

Its symptoms are manifested as pain (burning or not) in the upper abdomen and early satiety, postprandial fullness, bloating, nausea and belching. For its study and treatment, it is divided into 2 syndromes: epigastric pain, which is meal unrelated, and postprandial distress, which as the name suggests, are meal related symptoms. these 2 syndromes frequently overlap.1 the term functional dyspepsia implies a patient with upper digestive symptoms whose endoscopy reveals a normal stomach and duodenum or with minimum changes, the Rome III criteria diagnoses this disease; nevertheless, recent studies suggest the need to modify the temporality criteria. categorizing patients into 2 syndromes has therapeutic implications, which are based on pathophysiological mechanisms, considering that patients with epigastric pain may have hypersensitivity or a Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, while patients with postprandial distress may suffer fundic-relaxation or gastric emptying issues. Within the therapeutic approach of functional dyspepsia, there are important pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures, including:",

      "abstract": "Background: Serotonin syndrome results from the use of serotonergic agents that elevate intrasynaptic serotonin level or excessively activate serotonin postsynaptic receptors. Common serotonergic agents used for pain management include opioids, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants.Case: A 24-year old woman diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome underwent multidrug therapy for pain management over approximately five years. During this period, changes in diaphoresis severity were noted following adjustments to pain medications. The concurrent use of multiple serotonergic agents, exacerbation of diaphoresis after the addition or dose escalation of opioids, and resolution of symptoms upon discontinuation of duloxetine (Cymbalta®, Lily S.A.) strongly suggest the development of serotonin syndrome.Conclusions: Diagnosing serotonin syndrome without neuromuscular symptoms can be challenging. Careful monitoring of changes in symptoms and signs following medication use is essential in such cases.",

After an intercurrent illness with profound malnutrition, she developed a paranoid delirium and some behavioural disorders; concomitant diarrhoea and a skin rash were noted. Parenteral nicotinamide (500 mg/day) resulted in a complete recovery from the mental disorders after five days. Other causes of mental disturbance as a result of dialysis could be ruled out. However an asymptomatic underlying hypothyroidism may have been one of the conditioning factors as well as the failure to administer nicotinamide supplements during an acute illness. Neurological pellagra could thus be considered as a rare but reversible cause of mental disorders in patients on maintenance haemodialysis.",

      "title": "Benzodiazepine dependence: a shadowy diagnosis.",
      "abstract": "When benzodiazepines were introduced into clinical practice in the 1950s they were hailed as efficacious minor tranquillizers, largely devoid of unwanted side effects, in contrast to the barbiturates and similar drugs that they largely superseded. It was 30 years before the phenomenon of low-dose dependence on benzodiazepines was recognized. Benzodiazepine dependence differs from other psychotropic drug addictions because the benzodiazepines do not produce either euphoria or drug-seeking behaviour (except in those who are already addicted to other drugs). However, benzodiazepine use is associated in some individuals with a marked withdrawal (abstinence) syndrome that provides the best evidence of dependence. Just over half the people prescribed long-term benzodiazepines do not develop any sign of a withdrawal reaction (Fig. 1): this reflects factors including the type of benzodiazepine prescribed, the dosage and duration of treatment, as well as characteristics of the patient. Individuals with passive-dependent personalities appear to be more likely to experience withdrawal symptoms than other patients, although this remains a controversial issue. Therefore benzodiazepine use should follow certain guidelines, and if these are adhered to the benzodiazepines will continue to be valuable drugs in clinical practice.",

Any case of decline can be explained on one of four bases. 1. A tree may decline primarily as the result of chronic irritation by a single agent. 2. A tree may decline because of damage by secondary agents after an injurious event such as defoliation or major wounding. The same agents would not cause decline in an uninjured tree, and the injury alone would not cause decline. 3. Chronic irritation by one or more agents may diminish the tolerance or resistance of a tree to another agent that then incites decline. Various factors including those that predisposed the tree and incited decline may then contribute to further decline. 4. Trees of similar age growing in groups tend to display group behaviour including premature senescence (synchronous cohort senescence) in response to stress.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia-like presentations can be precipitated by multiple organic and medication-related causes. Psychiatric causes of catatonia are typically associated with underlying psychotic or mood disorders. Recurrent catatonia without other precipitating psychiatric diagnosis is rarely described. We present the case of a man in his early 30′s with idiopathic recurrent catatonia, presented with patient consent. Our case presented in a catatonic state, having recently stopped using cannabis. No organic cause for his presentation was identified following extensive investigation and he was admitted for psychiatric assessment. During admission he slowly improved with benzodiazepine and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatment, alongside psychological support. Despite near complete recovery, he significantly relapsed on 2 occasions requiring psychiatric re-admission over the subsequent 6 months. Thereafter, he had multiple relapsing episodes with decreasing severity during rehabilitative care. During admission we explored extensive differentials including mood disorders, schizophrenia or psychosis, drug abuse or poisoning, as underlying triggers for his catatonia. He had a finding of FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity) on his second electroencephalogram (EEG), with no clinical correlate of seizure or structural abnormality. We found no evidence of any underlying psychiatric or organic cause for his presentation. In contrast to classical descriptions of catatonia or recurrent catatonia, our case highlights the need for greater recognition of isolated idiopathic catatonia, as a diagnosis independent of mood disorder or schizophrenia. Furthermore, we evidence effective recovery with psychological support, benzodiazepines and ECT.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Acute psychotic states characterized by clinical lability and dream-like qualities are a staple of classic psychopatology. An excessive focus on diagnostic criteria for bipolar or schizophrenia-spectrum disorders risks missing this particular set of patients; defined through their dynamic presentation as much as by any cluster of symptoms or types of course. Objectives To explore the concept and relevance of oneroid-like cyclic psychosis through a clinical case and review. Methods We report the case of a 37 year old woman with bipolar disorder (three previous instances of manic episodes with psychotic symptoms) and various gynecological issues that required hormone therapy. After a couple of days having difficulty sleeping, the patient developed a clinical picture consisting of wide and sudden oscillations between hyperactive and inhibited psychomotor activity, moods of dread and ecstasy, and states of disorganized thought and childlike activities with perplexity and mutism. Frequent behaviors as if experiencing visual alucinations and repeated allusions to feeling as if in a dream. These symptoms lasted for 2-3 weeks, after treatment with risperidone and lithium. A narrative review concerning the case was also performed. Results Kleist’s ‘innate instability’ permeates much of the previous literature. Similar entities highlight different issues closely related to various biological rhythms: atypical psychosis and epilepsy, puerperal psychosis and estrogen dysregulation, cyclic psychosis and sleep disorders, delirious mania and effectiveness of electro-convulsive-therapy, etc. Conclusions Our findings point to the clinical relevance of oneiroid cyclic psychosis as innate instability. Further studies on the role of biological rhythms and its repercussions on daily practice are required. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is a common, under recognized, and poorly understood nonmotor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). Fatigue frequently presents early in PD, and its prevalence increases with disease progression, affecting up to 60% of patients. Fatigue has a negative impact on quality of life. Fatigue is often associated with other nonmotor symptoms, including sleep disturbance, excessive daytime sleepiness, and depression. Only a few reports have been published on the treatment of fatigue in PD (methylphenidate, levodopa, and pramipexole). Further well-designed studies, including physiotherapy, are necessary to develop more effective treatments for PD-associated fatigue. A number of patients with PD lose weight because of loss of fat. However, the evolution and determinants of weight loss are not well established. Possible determinants of weight loss in PD include loss of appetite, impaired hand-mouth coordination, difficulty in chewing and dysphagia, nausea, intestinal hypomotility, and increased energy requirements because of muscular rigidity and involuntary movements. Noticeable weight gain has repeatedly been reported after subthalamic or pallidal deep brain stimulation. Because low body weight is associated with negative health effects and a poor prognosis, monitoring weight and nutritional status should be part of PD management.",

Anti-anxiety drugs are one of the most effective treatment method for these problems. Benzodiazepines have various side-effects and the risk of overuse and abuse.

However, they should not be discouraged from prescribing benzodiazepines when they have a knowledge of the pharmacological characteristics of these drugs and there is a clear indication for their use. Generally speaking, problems of benzodiazepine use such as dependence withdrawal symptoms, and cognitive impairment are more likely to occur with high dose, long-term use(more than 4 months), in geriatric patients and patients with a history of alcohol or other sustance abuse. But long-term or high-dose use can be jusified for patients with panic disorder of agoraphobia, and medically-ill patients with persistent anxiety that cannot be otherwise treated.

      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorders have recently become treatable by newer psychological techniques. Compulsive rituals have responded to modeling with exposure in vivo coupled with response prevention (flooding). This procedure is significantly superior to relaxation. The method involves the therapist bringing the patient into prolonged contact with the stimuli which trigger his compulsive rituals and asking the patient to refrain from carrying out rituals thereafter. The therapist first demonstrates such contact before the patient undertakes it. Treatment may take but a few hours or many months. Full co-operation is essential by the patient and often the family also. Treatment frequently needs to be carried out at home as well as in hospital. Obsessive thoughts have been successfully treated by a variety of uncontrolled methods. In thought stopping, the patient is asked to induce his obsessive thought and then stop it by shouting \"stop\" first aloud and then subvocally. In flooding in fantasy (implosion) the patient is asked to imagine scenes concerning her obsessive thoughts for an hour or more while the therapist describes them at length. Active therapeutic ingredients of techniques still require to be worked out in more detail.",

      "abstract": "Non-specific arm pain is a special clinical condition that can occur in work-related activities that involve maintaining a static position for prolonged periods or repetitive and frequent movements of the hand or entire arm.Such activities include typing on a keyboard, maneuvering a computer mouse, playing musical instruments (such as piano and guitar) and many forms of manual labor.The pain is dull and diffuse; It is localized in the forearm or in the hand but quickly can expand to the entire extremity.Non-specific arm pain is the most frequent type of work-related pain after lower-back pain.It thus has important socio-economic significance as a major cause of absence from work.The designation of \"non-specific\" originates from the fact that it has no obvious signs of tissue damage, unlike the \"specific\" pain accompanying carpal tunnel syndrome, tenosinovitis de Quervain, or lateral epicondylitis.Suggested causes of the pain include microtrauma of soft tissue followed by an inflammatory reaction, ischemia, fatigue, hyper-sensitization of nociceptors, focal dystonia of the hand and/or psychological stress.Treatment consists of application of NSAIDs, physical modalities, stretching and aerobic exercises.Prevention focuses on ergonomic modification during manual labor or work on a computer.",

      "abstract": "Rebound insomnia and rebound anxiety are clinical conditions related to withdrawal of certain benzodiazepine drugs. Numerous studies of benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics conducted in our sleep laboratory demonstrated that rebound insomnia developed following withdrawal from benzodiazepines with a rapid or intermediate elimination rate. Several studies conducted by other investigators also indicated the development of rebound insomnia under similar conditions. Rebound insomnia and rebound anxiety are discussed in terms of their interrelationship, clinical implications, and receptor mechanisms. Evidence suggests that drugs producing rebound insomnia and rebound anxiety also show a more rapid development of tolerance and greater potential for drug dependence than benzodiazepines where the parent compound or its metabolites have a long elimination half-life.",

      "title": "Onabotulinum Toxin A (Botox) for Spasticity in Patients With Acquired Brain Injury [Internet]",
      "abstract": "Acquired brain injury is an umbrella term that encompasses traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) and non-traumatic brain injuries. Approximately 150,000 Canadians will sustain an ABI on an annual basis. An ABI is damage to the brain that is not due to a congenital or degenerative disorder. Occurring after birth, ABI can be caused by a traumatic event or external force (e.g., motor vehicle accident, sports injury), or a non-traumatic event or internal factor (e.g., infection, tumour). Injury to the brain can result in temporary or permanent physical (e.g., movement issues, spasticity, chronic pain), cognitive (e.g., impaired speech, memory loss), and/or emotional (e.g., depression, anger issues) impairments.As 1 of the major physical impairments resulting from an ABI, muscle spasticity is often described as muscle over-activity and is characterized by ongoing muscle contractions that are partly due to a decrease in skeletal stretch reflex threshold. Occurring spontaneously or continuously, spasticity typically affects muscles in the neck and upper and lower limbs. Spasticity can result in a variety of musculoskeletal issues such as involuntary shaking, joint stiffness, muscle contracture, and limited range of movement. This debilitating condition may limit one’s ability to perform the activities of daily living, impact one’s quality of life, and require additional assistance from caregivers.The treatment of ABI-related spasticity can involve a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Non-pharmacological options may include casting and splinting to maintain positioning, stretching and strengthening to improve control of spastic muscles, and/or transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation to help reduce pain. Pharmacological options can be administered systemically (e.g., oral baclofen, tizanidine, clonidine, dantrolene sodium) or locally (e.g., injection of botulinum toxin type A [BoNT-A], phenol, baclofen). Botulinum toxin (BoNT), a neurotoxic protein produced by Clostridium botulinum bacteria, exists in multiple subtypes (i.e., A to G) and formulations.BoNT-A intramuscular injection is used to treat spasticity by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in activating skeletal muscles. BoNT-A injections result in temporary local paresis (i.e., partial paralysis) and may help to improve pain. BoNT-A is approved for various indications (i.e., not exclusive to spasticity), and is available as 3 formulations in North America: onabotulinum toxin A (Botox), abobotulinum toxin A (Dysport), and incobotulinum toxin A (Xeomin). Due to different manufacturing processes and pharmacological activities, these 3 formulations are not considered interchangeable products. This report focuses on onabotulinum toxin A, which will be referred to herein as Botox — its brand name.The body of evidence evaluating treatment options for spasticity after brain injury is limited in quality and quantity, and there is uncertainty regarding the clinical effectiveness of Botox for this population. Another 2021 CADTH rapid review report focused on the use of Botox for the treatment of spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis. The aim of this rapid review report is to summarize and critically appraise the relevant evidence on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and evidence-based guidelines regarding the use of Botox for the treatment of ABI-associated spasticity.",

In more severe cases, the child may be in a coma and family members may spend long, uncertain hours at the child’s bedside, disrupting family routines. If and when the child emerges from the coma he may, for example, be unable to walk or talk. A lengthy rehabilitation process may then begin, again requiring family members to spend long periods of time in the hospital and suspend or defer other activities.",

      "abstract": "The present author has studied from various viewpoint 14 patients who had epileptiform convulsive disorders under choronic Meprobamate intoxication and 47 additional cases which were already reported in Japanese and other languages.1) There were no specific convulsive predi sposition and family history in the author's cases. Remarkable personality disorder of these cases were often seen in the peoples who addicted any drugs and others. They had no intellectual defect.2) Generally, convulsive seizure broke out when one took Meprobamate more than 3g daily over one to several years.3) In the literature, ev ery other author understood that these convulsive seizures had occured only as abstinence syndrom. It is certain that the majorities of these convulsions occur as abstinence syndrom but others occur during the intake of this drug. Delirium or disturbance of alertness also would develop likeweise. The present author differentiated four types regardig to the occurrence of convulsive seizure as well as the intake of this drug. A: Convulsion precipitated by abrupt withdrawal. B: Convulsion which occured during intake of this drug. C: Convulsion which occured under marked consciousness disturbance. D: Convulsion which occured particularly during the treatment of marked consiousness disturbance. Clinical types mentioned above were not always same in one patient.4) A lmost all the convulsive seizures appeared to be of epileptic nature but they often came out in the form of status epilepticus.5) Neurological signs and s ymptoms such as fever, nausea, vomiting, shaking and ataxia would frequently accompanied convulsions.6) Before and after convulsion, the r e was stormy consciousness disturbance which was certainly different from initial and postical twilight state. Convulsive seizures associated with fever and neurological symptoms and severe consciousness disturbance tend to have the form of status epilepticus. Therefore these signs and symtoms suggest some serious oragnic brain damage. In this regard, the present author discovered in the literatures three cases, of whom two died during status epilepticus and the other got into comatose with fever from delirium.7) EEG finding s showed convulsive readiness under Meprobamate abuse, so it is quite natural that the convulsive seizure appears even under its abuse. Moreover, some focal signs in EEG suggest localized damage.8) It was not effective to gi ve Meprobamate for the treatment of abstinence syndrome. When, once convulsion and related disorder happened to occur, such disorders would reoccur short after re-use of Meprobamate. However, if a patient does not fall in abuse again, another convulsive disorder does not occur and clinical outcome is very favourable, so that it is not necessary to prolong anticonvulsant medication. These convulsive disorders do not look over as accidental outbursts in the patient with convulsive predisposition or as rebound phenomena after long abuse of Meprobamate that has mild anticonvulsant action.",

POIS can occur either after intercourse or masturbation, starting seconds to hours after having an orgasm, and can be lasted to 2 - 7 days. The prevalence and incidence of POIS itself are not certainly known.&#x0D; Reviews: Waldinger and colleagues were the first to report cases of POIS and later in establishing the diagnosis, they proposed 5 preliminary diagnostic criteria, also known as Waldinger's Preliminary Diagnostic Criteria (WPDC). Symptoms can vary from somatic to psychological complaints. The mechanism underlying this disease are not clear. Immune modulated mechanism is one of the hypothesis that is widely believed to be the cause of this syndrome apart from opioid withdrawal and disordered cytokine or neuroendocrine responses. POIS treatment is also not standardized. Treatments includeintra lymphatic hyposensitization of autologous semen, non-steroid anti-inflamation drugs (NSAIDs), steroids such as Prednisone, antihistamines, benzodiazepines, hormones (hCG and Testosterone), alpha-blockers, and other adjuvant medications.&#x0D; Summary: This syndrome still needs more research to understand its mechanisms to obtainclearer treatment. Besides that, the clinician's awareness is needed to recognize this syndrome so that it is not misdiagnosed.",

      "title": "Bedside Perspectives On The Use Of Opioids: Transferring Results Of Clinical Research Into Practice",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY 1. Transference of research findings to clinical practice has been a challenge for those managing chronic pain. Generally, pain is not well controlled in hospitals and steps need to be taken to make pain control more effective. 2. Clinical trials of opioids have shown that pain can be controlled in the great majority of patients. Apart from the use of the World Health Organization Analgesic Ladder, a ‘pain diagnosis’ should be made and a comprehensive view of pain needs to be considered by the clinician. This would include pain and other physical symptoms, psychological issues and social and spiritual stresses. 3. Respiratory depression and tolerance for opioids are often seen as negative aspects of opioids and, therefore, may lead to inadequate control of pain. The evidence cited suggests that, in the long‐term treatment of cancer pain, respiratory depression almost never occurs. The only situation that warrants caution is when an anaesthetic block or similar procedure relieves pain treated by opioids, when that patient has been receiving large doses of opioids. Long‐term studies with opioids show that tolerance may occur, but is not a clinical problem and should not impair their use in adequate doses to relieve the patient’s pain. 4. The active morphine metabolites, morphine‐3‐glucuronide (M3G) and morphine‐6‐glucuronide (M6G) do need to be considered when administering morphine. There seems to be considerable interindividual variation in the production and elimination of metabolites. In cases of renal failure or in the elderly, the ratios of M3G and M6G to morphine accumulate exponentially, making opioid toxicity more likely. Even different routes of administration seem to be associated with different ratios of metabolites. A knowledge of these sources of pharmacokinetic variability may lead to more effective use of the opioids in clinical practice.",

Pain was assessed regularly in relation to the fact that is considered the ‘fifth vital sign’. These patients had developed nociceptive painful syndromes that responded poorly to opioid and/or non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs therapy. They had no symptoms related to non-nociceptive (neurological) pain. With reference to pain and psychology, patients showed a moderate improvement after 2 weeks of treatment and a significant improvement after 4 weeks, as demonstrated by CGI (Clinical Global Impression for severity and improvement scales with endpoints labelled 1 ‘normal, not at all ill’ to 7 ‘among the most extremely ill patients’ and 1 ‘very much improved’ to 7 ‘very much worse’, respectively) and NRS-o (0–10 oral Numeric Rating Scale: visual scale anchored with the endpoints labelled ‘no pain’ near the ‘0’ number and ‘extreme pain’ near the ‘10’ number) scales’ scores used for the assessment of psychopathological state and pain level, respectively (Table 1). No changes in the internal condition, which could account for the improvements concerning pain, were observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1.\r\n\r\nSample features\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese clinical observations suggest the involvement of brain dopamine (DA) transmission in nociceptive pain pathways as a result of the ‘modulation’ of the dopaminergic system by ARP, although ARP-mediated antagonism on 5HT2A receptors [DeLeon et al. 2004] known as facilitating spinal nociception [Oyama et al. 1996], is possible. The activation of nigrostriatal (dorsal nucleus caudate and putamen) DA D2 receptor-mediated neurotransmission is positively associated with individual variations in subjective ratings of sensory and affective qualities of pain with an increased threshold as outcome [Scott et al. 2006]. In contrast, mesolimbic (nucleus accumbens) DA activation, which may have an impact on both D2 and D3 receptors, is exclusively associated with variations in the emotional responses of the individual during pain challenge (increases in negative affect and fear ratings) [Stahl, 2002]. The ARP antipsychotic mechanism is based on the blockade of mesolimbic D3 receptors, whereas nigrostriatal D2 receptor-mediated activity is not changed by it [Oyama et al. 1996]. So its effect could result in a direct involvement on reduction of pain perception even if a positive unspecific role on pain threshold psychological-mediated is possible. However, these effects on pain perception could be particularly evident owing to the poor effectiveness of common pain treatments in our sample. This is the first report about the relationship between aripiprazole and subjective experience of pain.",

      "abstract": "Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is a medical emergency, which is diagnosed most frequently with the routine use of EEG in the pediatric emergency and intensive care units. Data from eight patients, ranging from 2.8-15 years old (median 8.7 years), treated with the diagnosis of NCSE were evaluated on clinical basis. The patients attended the hospital with acute confusional state ranging from sudden onset of verbal cooperation insufficiency to aimless-meaningless behavior and confusion without any motor component of seizure. While five of the cases were diagnosed and followed up with epilepsy, the other three had no history of epilepsy. No reason was detected that could cause acute encephalopathy. EEG examinations during acute confusional state showed partial or generalized continuous electrographic seizure activity lasting at least 30 minutes without clinical seizure activity. After administration of intravenous antiepileptic medication, the confusional states of the patients recovered, and the EEG examinations showed normal baseline activity with significantly diminished discharges or complete normal waveform. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus should be considered in all children admitted to the hospital with acute unexplained encephalopathy, whether they have a history of epilepsy or not. Emergent EEG examination should be a routine part of evaluation in these children for the diagnosis and treatment of NCSE.",

Its main symptoms are tremor at rest muscle stiffness and bradykinesia, i.e. slowness of movement (the so-called parkinsonian triad). Atrophic lessons of substantia nigra, located in the midbrain, responsible for the production of dopamine, contribute to the onset of symptoms of the disease. Patients with Parkinson’s diseases suffer from a variety of extra-motor symptoms often psychiatric disorders, especially panic or generalized anxiety. The author presents the case of 63 years old man diagnosed with Parkinson’s diseases 4 years ago, with quite a significant severity in the last 2 years. Left limb weakness (upper and lower) deepened and general slowing of movement developed then restless legs syndrome developed fully (specific sensations in the area of the feet and lower legs in the evening and night hours, temporarily decreasing when moving, walking, stretching the muscles). For about 6 months he have had attacks of anxiety and anxiety as well as a fully developed generalized anxiety disorder. The combination of levodopa and carbidopa and pregabalin was used, resulting in a reduction of slowness and stiffness as well as a significant reduction in anxiety and anxiety after approximately 8 weeks.",

      "title": "Managing drug-induced psychosis",
      "abstract": "AbstractSubstance-induced psychosis is a secondary psychotic disorder resulting from drug abuse, characterized by one or more psychotic episodes. Drug-induced psychosis is expected to resolve after a 30-day period of sobriety, however, individuals with this condition are more likely to develop severe drug addiction. Compared to primary psychosis, participants with drug-induced psychosis exhibit poorer family history of psychotic diseases, higher insight, fewer positive and negative symptoms, more depressive symptoms, and greater anxiety. Substance-induced psychosis is strongly associated with the emergence of bipolar illness or schizophrenia spectrum disorder, with an increased chance of developing schizophrenia at a younger age. Episodes of self-harm after substance-induced psychosis are strongly linked to an elevated likelihood of developing schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Effective treatment involves ruling out emergencies, investigating underlying causes, and addressing acute intoxication and withdrawal. Management includes dynamic assessment, intervention, and vigilant monitoring in cases of suicidal behaviour. Antipsychotics may be used for short term, with gradual discontinuation when a person is in a stable condition. Relapse prevention strategies, both medication and non-medication-based, are crucial in long-term management. Conversion rates to schizophrenia or bipolar disorder can be as high as one in three individuals, with cannabis users and those with early-onset substance abuse at the highest risk.Keywords: Drug-induced psychosispsychotic disordersbipolar disorderschizophreniarisk Authors' contributionAll authors participated in all stages of the review.Disclosure statementLB worked as a scientific consultant for Libbs and Jansen.

      "title": "Forensic psychiatry approach to mental disorders resulting from substance abuse",
      "abstract": "In the last few decades, mental disorders resulting from substance abuse have become a frequent phenomenon, which features diverse forms and degrees of severity. In addition to being a medical and extremely harmful social phenomenon, substance abuse (commonly known as drug or narcotics abuse) is frequently a subject matter of research in many sciences or scientific disciplines, such as medicine, psychology, sociology, legal science, etc. Drug abusers may develop diverse mental disorders, which largely depends on the type of psychoactive substance which is being abused and the method of taking narcotics (including frequency, daily dose, mode of administration, etc.). In this paper, the author provides an overview of different types of mental disorders according to the applicable International Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders. The disturbance of mental functions due to drug abuse (which may or may not result in the development of a mental disorder) changes the perception and behaviour of drug users. The disturbance of mental functions becomes particularly prominent in the circumstances where substance abuse has turned into a drug addiction; the basic characteristic of the dependence syndrome is an irresistible urge (craving or even compulsion) to take the substance in order to enjoy its effects again or to avoid/relieve the drug addiction crisis or the abstinence syndrome, which may be extremely painful and agonizing. As a consequence of these mental disturbances and other disorders arising from drug addiction, human behaviour may be disrupted to such an extent that a person may demonstrate some criminal conduct, which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant in the field of criminal law. Given the fact that the criminal offender is a drug abuser who may have different forms of mental disorders, there is a need to consider the offender's mental capacity (sanity), which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant from the point of view of forensic psychiatry. The author's primary goal in this paper is to present the basic postulates underlying the perception of drug abuse and drug addiction in forensic psychiatry, both from the theoretical and practical point of view. In exploring the practical aspect of this issue, the author focuses on presenting the basic principles of forensic-psychiatric expertise of criminal offenders who have been diagnosed as having mental disorders caused by drug abuse. The expertise includes different aspects of assessing mental disorders: giving professional opinions on the offender's mental capacity (sanity), assessing the potential danger of recidivism or commission of a more serious criminal act, and giving proposals for relevant of security measures concerning the mandatory treatment of drug addicts both in outpatient clinics and in other relevant in-patient medical institutions. Given the fact that mental disorders stemming from drug abuse frequently have numerous financial, family and professional implications, the author presents some forensic psychiatric attitudes pertaining to the assessment of contractual capacity of these persons, the assessment of their working capacity (including the remaining working ability or temporary inability to work), the assessment of mental capacity for exercising the parental right or custodianship rights. In that context, the author provides the forensic psychiatric aspects of these mental disorders from the aspect of civil law. Drug abuse and drug addiction involve serious and complex socio-pathological problems which are difficult to treat/cure. This paper is the author's contribution to casting light on these issues, primarily from the aspect of forensic psychiatry.",

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) introduced substance-induced depression to recognize the existence of syndromes of depression that cannot be established to be independent, but that nonetheless appear to exceed the usual effects of substance intoxication or withdrawal and require clinical attention. A number of other psychiatric disorders e.g. bipolar disorder, ADHD, PTSD, and some other anxiety disorders, antisocial and borderline personality, co-occur with substance-use disorders and may account for some of the association between depression and substance abuse.

It is possible that some stupors are essentially states of extreme preoccupation with the frightening experiences (cf.Hoch's (1921) Benign Stupors and the preoccupation with death).4. Other stupors are presumably hysterical (avoidance) methods of dealing with the same kind of experience.5. The long persistence of conditioned responses after traurna, up to two years ln some R.A.F.cases, and probably indefinitely longer, has its parallel (Anderson and Parmenter, 1941) in sheep with experimental neuroses.6.

      "title": "DB02-01 - Drug treatment is not necessary for maintenance treatment of depression",
      "abstract": "Prolongation or lifelong pharmacotherapy has emerged as the main therapeutic tool for preventing relapse in depression. However, outcome after discontinuation of antidepressants is unfavourably affected by the duration of their administration. Loss of clinical effects, despite adequate compliance, has also emerged as a vexing clinical problem. Use of intermittent pharmacotherapy with follow-up visits is another therapeutic option, that, however, entails the problems of resistance and of discontinuation syndromes. In recent years, several controlled trials have suggested that a sequential use of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of the acute episode and psychotherapy in its residual phase may improve long-term outcome. Antidepressant drugs may be tapered and discontinued during the course of psychotherapy. The sequential treatment of depression not fall within the realm of maintenance strategies. It is an intensive, two-stage approach, which is based on the fact that one course of treatment with a specific tool (whether pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy) is unlikely to provide solution to the complex array of symptoms of patients with mood disorders.",

      "abstract": "In patients with consequences of a stroke, disturbances in motor, cognitive, and sensory functions are observed; cardiovascular, endocrine and other body systems, impairment of self-care and independent walking. Physical dependence, the inability to self-care in fulfilling urgent biological needs leads to a feeling of helplessness and is accompanied by depressive, neurotic reactions to the disease. Restoration of impaired functions after a stroke has a long period and the success of recovery depends, on the one hand, on the volume and location of the brain lesion, the severity of motor and cognitive impairments, on the other hand, on the position of the patient himself, the attitude of the patient’s personality to the disease and adherence to treatment. A patient’s stay in a hospital is associated with the social expectations of the staff for certain behavior of the patient: fulfilling the instructions of the attending physician, partnership with staff (physical therapy methodologist, speech therapist, occupational therapist, etc.), the patient’s activity, the formation of healthy lifestyle attitudes (giving up smoking, alcohol, fatty food, etc.), which can be called psychological conditions for rehabilitation. However, not all patients are ready to fulfill these rehabilitation conditions, which are targets for psychological correction. The tasks of psychological assistance should be focused on developing adherence to treatment, forming cooperative relationships with staff, and healthy lifestyle attitudes, which can contribute to restorative treatment and the prevention of recurrent stroke. Psychological assistance during individual and group work should be focused on providing emotional support, setting realistic and understandable goals for the patient, adequate to the patient’s capabilities, both in a hospital and clinic, which can ensure his active inclusion in the treatment process.",

The opioid receptor system or opioid effects have been identified in numerous animal species including ascarids, scallops, fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals. The primary effect site of opioids is the central nervous system (CNS) for analgesia, antitussive effects, and sedation. Three opioid receptor types have been definitively identified: mu (μ), kappa (κ), and delta (δ). The most common indication for opioid administration is pain management (i.e., hypoalgesia or analgesia). Opioids typically produce dose-dependent sedation when administered alone, but can produce more profound sedation when combined with other sedatives such as phenothiazines and α2-adrenergic receptor agonists. Opioids are capable of inhalant anesthetic Minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) reduction, a phenomenon that is species, dose, and opioid receptor dependent. Morphine elicits its effects primarily as a full μ opioid agonist, but higher doses can also result in κ receptor agonist effects.",

      "title": "Excitotoxicity, Synaptic Repair, and Functional Recovery in the Mammalian Cochlea: A Review of Recent Findings",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Besides its fast excitatory properties, glutamate is known to have neurotoxic properties when released in large amounts or when incompletely recycled. This so‐called excitotoxicity is involved in a number of acute and/or degenerative forms of neuropathology such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, stroke, and retinal ischemia. In the cochlea, excitotoxicity may occur in two pathological conditions: anoxia and noise trauma. It is characterized by a two‐step mechanism: (1) An acute swelling, which primarily depends on the AMPA/kainate type of receptors, together with a disruption of the postsynaptic structures (type I afferent dendrites) resulting in a loss of function. Within the next 5 days, synaptic repair may be observed with a full or a partial (acoustic trauma) recovery of cochlear potentials. (2) The second phase of excitotoxicity, which may develop after strong and/or repetitive injury, consists of a cascade of metabolic events triggered by the entry of Ca 2+ , which leads to neuronal death in the spiral ganglion. Ongoing experiments in animals, tracking the molecular basis of both these processes, presages the development of new pharmacological strategies to help neurites to regrow and reconnect properly to the IHCs, and to prevent or delay neuronal death in the spiral ganglion. Human applications should follow, and a local (transtympanic) strategy against cochlear excitotoxicity may, in the near future, prove to be helpful in ischemic‐ or noise‐induced sudden deafness, as well as in the related tinnitus.",

Serotonin is one common denominator in each of the neurochemical processes, and is one candidate that may explain the underlying pathophysiology. Perhaps the role of cognitive-behavioral treatments ought to be tested, as both depression and chronic pain tend to be responsive to cognitive and behavioral interventions.

Migraine attacks are also accompanied by at least one of nausea, vomiting, and photophobia and phonophobia.1 It is 25 years since triptans first became available on prescription. Although their safety and efficacy is well established, there is still a great deal of ongoing research into the nuances of their use in treating patients with specific needs. Frovatriptan, in common with other triptans, is a serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) 1B/1D receptor agonist.1 Frovatriptan also shows moderate affinity for 5-HT7 receptors,1 resulting in more potent contraction of cerebral arteries than coronary arteries, with the potential for good efficacy and low risk of unwanted effects.1 Frovatriptan is distinctive from other triptans due to its half-life of 26 hours, which confers a longer duration of action.1",

A ten-year-old male patient was admitted for auditive and visual hallucinations, anxiety, motor tics (blinking) and compulsive actions. The patient had been under treatment with sertraline and alprazolam for six months. He had been the victim of bullying for months, reporting being hit, teased and insulted by some classmates. Considering the neurotic symptoms, the dose of sertraline was increased. After a short period the auditive and visual hallucinations were exacerbated.\r\nDiscussion. The debut of the case was dominated by affective symptoms. Under treatment with sertraline the patient developed a psychotic disorder which gradually diminished after stopping sertraline and introducing risperidone.\r\nParticularities. Because the patient is a Hungarian native speaker, the parents acted as translators during the psychiatric interview, making it difficult to distinguish between intrusive images, flashbacks and hallucinations.",

Bipolar depression, i.e. depressive episode(s) as part of bipolar disorder, can be differentiated from unipolar depression only through the previous course of illness. A correct diagnosis therefore may be delayed. The pharmacotherapy of bipolar depression differs from that of unipolar depression due to a high risk of recurrence of either hypomanic/manic or depressive episodes or mood instability. Therefore, long periods of specialized treatment will often be required. Both bipolar and unipolar depression will often benefit from adjunctive social and psychological interventions.",

      "abstract": "‘If I can’t feel, if I can’t move, if I can’t think, and I can’t care, then what conceivable point is there in living?’ (Kay Redfield Jamison, An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness) Mood is a person’s subjective emotional state. According to the DSM-IV the term mood disorder is used for a group of diagnoses where the primary symptom is a disturbance in mood, or in other words the experience of an inappropriate, exaggerated or limited range of feelings. Mood disorders can mainly be divided into two groups: (1) depressive episode(s) characterised by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, helplessness, guilt, suicidal thoughts, fatigue, appetite changes, concentration problems and troubles engaging in daily living tasks; (2) manic or hypomanic episode(s) characterised by feelings of grandiosity, extreme energy and heightened arousal. Several treatment options are available for mood disorders – e.g. medication, cognitive and/or behavioural therapy – depending on the severity and the evaluation of the health-care provider. Several studies have shown that mood disorders are common in patients with cancer. In a meta-analysis, the point prevalence of major depression was about 16% and that of anxiety was 10% [1]. The exact causes of mood disorders are largely unknown, but it is hypothesised that an imbalance in neurotransmitters is likely to play a role. The mood disorder can be triggered by the cancer diagnosis on its own, or it can be treatment-induced in cases where the aetiology can be found in the physiological effect of a psychoactive drug or chemical substance. These articles provide an overview of the most common mood disorders among cancer patients. First, Dr. Dauchy will discuss the prevalence, predictive factors and treatment options of depression, one of the most under-diagnosed and inadequately treated mood disorders among cancer patients. Second, Professor Caraceni will introduce drug-associated delirium, an altered state of consciousness with reduced awareness of self and the environment, which may go hand in hand with the inability to think and talk clearly and rationally, hallucinations, disorientation and cognitive impairment. Third, Dr. Die Trill will discuss anxiety, one of the most frequently reported reactions to a cancer diagnosis, which may persist throughout the cancer continuum. In addition, she will shine her light on sleep disorders, which are frequently associated with psychological disorders. Finally, Dr. Schagen will describe the chemotherapy-related changes in cognitive functioning, which can result in diminished functional independence and can last throughout the survivorship period.",

      "title": "Care of the AIDS patient",
      "abstract": "Abstract Treatment of the person dying from AIDS requires attention to the biological, psychological, and social aspects of the patient. Diagnostic and therapeutic interventions must be appropriate for the stage of the illness, the wishes of the patient, and the risk-benefit ratio of each particular situation. Symptom management requires familiarity with the multiple problems seen in persons with AIDS (PWA). Optimal treatment of any symptom requires accurate diagnosis. Pain occurs in PWA in approximately 53% of patients. Common causes of pain include nonspecific muscle aches; headache due to lymphoma or, more often, to direct infection of the brain with HIV or parasites; localized or diffuse lymphade-nopathy; peripheral neuropathy; esophagitis; and skin problems. Treatment of the underlying etiology, if possible, is the first consideration. Symptomatic pain relief proceeds in a stepwise fashion, beginning with a peripherally acting analgesic (e.g., acetaminophen or NSAID) and adding, not substituting, a narcotic analgesic in increasing doses and/or potency until pain control is achieved. Breathlessness may be due to a treatabl infection. Other causes may not be amenable to specific intervention but do require symptom management, which involves the liberal use of oxygen, bronchodilator (if bronchospasm is present), and, at times, low doses of narcotics. Oropharyngeal lesions due to Candida respond to clotrimazole troches, nystatin, or ketoconozole. Candida esophagitis usually responds to ketoconozole but occasionally requires low-dose amphotericin B. Diarrhea is usually treated symptomatically with loperamide, Lomotil, oral morphine, or deodorized tincture of opium. Neuropsychiatric problems have become the dominant problem in the terminal care of PWA. Depression may be organic or may be a psychological reaction to the diagnosis or to disease progression. Antidepressant medications carefully titrated are often helpful. Dementia occurs in over 65% of patients. Early signs may be subtle. Many patients become severely impaired by dementia. Environmental change and social adaptation remain the mainstays of treatment, but pharmacologic interventions with low doses of haloperidol may improve some behaviors, such as restlessness, agitation, sleeplessness, emotional lability, and hallucinations. Delirium usually is a sign of superimposed metabolic or infectious insult. Treatment requires reversing the underlying cause, but haloperidol may provide symptomatic relief. Psychosocial issues for AIDS patients are similar to those for any dying patient. However, isolation is more common and often includes the biological family of origin. Certain risk groups of patients may be considered undesirable. Too often patients have no primary care providers, inadequate housing, inadequate financial resources, and no health insurance. This paper addressed these issues in greater detail and provides a framework for working with patients, families, and caregivers.",

      "title": "Is Favorable Outcome Possible After Prolonged Refractory Status Epilepticus?",
      "abstract": "Summary: When status epilepticus (SE) remains refractory to appropriate therapy, it is associated with high mortality and with substantial morbidity in survivors. Many outcome predictors such as age, seizure type, level of consciousness before treatment, and mostly, etiology, are well-established. A longer duration of SE is often associated with worse outcome, but duration may lose its prognostic value after several hours. Several terms and definitions have been used to describe prolonged, refractory SE, including “malignant SE,” “prolonged” SE, and more recently, “super refractory” SE, defined as “SE that has continued or recurred despite 24 hours of general anesthesia (or coma-inducing anticonvulsants).” There are few data available regarding the outcome of prolonged refractory SE, and even fewer for SE remaining refractory to anesthetic drugs. This article reviews reports of outcome after prolonged, refractory, and “super refractory” SE. Most information detailing the clinical outcome of patients surviving these severe illnesses, in which seizures can persist for days or weeks (and especially those concerning “super-refractory” SE) come from case reports and retrospective cohort studies. In many series, prolonged, refractory SE has a mortality of 30% to 50%, and several studies indicate that most survivors have a substantial decline in functional status. Nevertheless, several reports demonstrate that good functional outcome is possible even after several days of SE and coma induction. Treatment of refractory SE should not be withdrawn from younger patients without structural brain damage at presentation solely because of the duration of SE.",

Essa doença pode afetar pessoas de todas as faixas etárias, porém, os idosos requerem uma atenção especial quando comparados às pessoas mais jovens, pelos riscos que os avanços da idade podem trazer. No Brasil, o número de idosos terá um aumento significativo até 2025, tal fato é preocupante, uma vez que pessoas idosas estão mais suscetíveis a algumas doenças, entre elas, a depressão. A depressão é vista como uma das doenças mais impactantes das últimas décadas, podendo levar ao suicídio. As causas se apresentam de forma variada e podem estar ligadas a fatores biológicos, psicológicos ou sociais. Alguns tipos de doenças, como câncer ou doenças infecciosas, abuso de álcool, perdas de pessoas próximas ou bens materiais, bem como o uso de alguns medicamentos também podem causar sintomas depressivos. O tratamento pode ser feito através de psicoterapia e de medicamentos, os quais passaram por um processo significativo de evolução no decorrer dos anos. Cabe ao farmacêutico, realizar o acompanhamento farmacoterapêutico dos pacientes, garantindo a sua segurança e orientando-os quanto ao uso correto dos medicamentos. No presente trabalho, objetivou-se analisar dados referentes à depressão em pessoas idosas, tendo como foco principal, os tipos de tratamentos disponíveis, assim como os riscos que um antidepressivo pode oferecer à saúde de um idoso. Para o desenvolvimento do estudo, foi feita uma pesquisa bibliográfica qualitativa e descritiva na literatura disponível, acerca dos pontos de maior relevância dentro do tema. A partir das informações obtidas, foi possível concluir que a atenção e capacitação dos profissionais da saúde são imprescindíveis na qualidade do atendimento ao paciente, assim como o cuidado no momento da prescrição do medicamento, já que alguns destes podem causar danos à saúde.",

Only a few case reports from palliative medicine and anesthesia have highlighted the development of OWM. We report an unusual case of a 35 years old, opioid-dependent (smack) adult male who developed abnormal involuntary jerky movements of limbs and torso in the withdrawal phase. There was no change in the level of consciousness. The neurological examination as well as serum biochemistry was normal. The electroencephalogram showed no epileptiform activity. The patient was started on oral substitution therapy (tramadol 150 mg/day) after which abnormal movements subsided within 72 h. We conclude that myoclonus can be a part of opioid withdrawal.

A search was made through different databases for a mnemonic method regarding alarm criteria in emergency headaches, and methods in English and Spanish were found, but there was no mention of one written in Portuguese. Result With that in mind, the method “RISADA PEGA” (“laughter spreads”, in English) was created: Repentina / (Sudden) I - Início depois dos 50 anos / (onset in a patient older than 50) S - Sinais e/ou sintomas de doenças sistêmicas ou neurológicas / (Signs and/or symptoms of systemic or neurologic diseases) A - Anormalidades no exame neurológico/(abnormalities upon neurologic examination) D - Depressão da imunidade(AIDS, Câncer)/Depressed immunity (HIV or cancer) A - Antecedentes: doenças que podem acometer o SNC; número de vindas ao PShistória familiar de cefaleia)/(Prior conditions: diseases affecting the central nervous system; number of visits to the health center, history of headache in the family) P - Padrão alterado (mudança no padrão anterior da cefaleia)/(change in headache pattern) E - Esforço/exertion) G - Gravidez/(pregnancy) A - Autonomia (sinais autonômicos)/(autonomic signs) Conclusion In the emergency department, an acute headache is a symptom presented by 2%-4% of admitted patients. Secondary headaches are associated with high morbidity and mortality. A need exists for the quick identification of the alarm criteria and a correct stratification of the patient's risk, proper diagnosis and treatment. There are also time constraints in the emergency department. This shows the usefulness of a method for quick identification of the alarm criteria. We believe this is a useful tool for medical education and a clinical aid for clinical practitioners, it may also be a way to educate patients regarding the alarm criteria for emergency headaches.",

      "title": "Bipolar depression: the clinical characteristics and unmet needs of a complex disorder",
      "abstract": "Objective: We reviewed important clinical aspects of bipolar depression, a progressive psychiatric condition that is commonly treated in primary care. Bipolar depression is associated with considerable burden of illness, high suicide risk, and greater morbidity and mortality than bipolar mania.Methods: We identified articles relevant to our narrative review using a multistep search of the literature and applying terms that were relevant to bipolar depression or bipolar disorder.Results: Bipolar depression accounts for the majority of time spent unwell for patients with bipolar disorder; high rates of morbidity and mortality arise from full symptomatic episodes and interepisode subsyndromal symptoms. Bipolar depression is an important contributor to long-term dysfunction for patients with bipolar disorder due to psychosocial impairment, loss of work productivity and high rates of substance abuse. Missed and delayed diagnosis is prevalent due to overlapping symptoms with unipolar depression and other diagnoses. Medical comorbidities (i.e. cardiovascular disease, hypertension, obesity, metabolic syndrome) and psychiatric comorbidities (i.e. anxiety disorder, personality disorder, eating disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) are common. Currently, only three treatments are FDA-approved for bipolar depression; monotherapy antidepressants are not a recommended treatment option.Conclusions: Bipolar disorder is common among primary care patients presenting with depression; it is often treated exclusively in primary care. Clinicians should be alert for symptoms of bipolar disorder in undiagnosed patients, know what symptoms probabilistically suggest bipolar versus unipolar depression, have expertise in providing ongoing treatment to diagnosed patients, and be knowledgeable about managing common medication-related side effects and comorbidities. Prompt and accurate diagnosis is critical.",

If the child gives examples that are the result of another anxiety disorder, or elaboration of the response to Question 1b suggests that the child does not seem to understand Question 1a, then the interviewer may ask Question 1c to reassess presence of “unexpected” panic attacks. DSM-5 defines a panic attack as a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which at least four of the symptoms listed develop abruptly and reach a peak within minutes of onset. To meet the criteria for Panic Disorder, the child must report recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, at least one of which has been followed for a month by one or more symptoms.",

Evidence supporting these assumptions is scarce, although it has become clear that intestinal functions are influenced by the state of central nervous activation, i.e. by satiation, relaxation and sleep as well as hunger, tension and rage. Freud assumed that the accumulation of an unabreacted quota of affect induced defence or repression and a conversion of emotion into bodily symptoms. Subsequently, disorders such as globus sensation, diffuse oesophageal spasm and ‘cardiospasm’ were viewed as conversion symptoms. Other concepts claimed an aetiological role of specific conflicts, certain affective states and ‘inappropriate perpetuations of organ reactions adaptive to, or protective against, some stress in human life’. However, these and other psychosomatic concepts could not be verified. Conversely, an illness exacerbation may precipitate a disruption in a patient's adjustment to his/her environment and interfere with his/her ability to fight the disease. Psychotherapeutic interventions may help patients to cope with their illness and its consequences and possibly alter the course of disease. Psychosocial factors may determine a patient's reactions to, and handling of, a disease and thus should not escape the physician's attention.",

An addiction is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR) as (1) the use of a substance that has mood altering or psychoactive effects, (2) highly controlled or compulsive use of a substance, and (3) the used substance reinforces behavior (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Other criteria include tolerance and physical dependence. Food addiction specifically is typically characterized by a loss of control over eating certain foods, preoccupation with or craving of certain food or foods, failed attempts to overcome the eating problem despite negative consequences, and use of the food or foods to cope with negative emotions. Food addiction has been tied most often to highly palatable foods such as chocolate, confectionary foods, carbohydrate‐rich foods, and foods high in fat content.",

The most common symptoms include a trial of fatigue, deterioration in muscle strength and pain. Fatigue is one of the most frequent complaints of PPS and the majority of patients identify fatigue as their most troubling symptom. The aetiology of the symptom arouses great interest, mainly due to its multifactorial character, and can be divided into two components: peripheral (muscular) fatigue and central (general) or simultaneously-occurring fatigue. Considering the importance of the symptom and the limitations that can cause in PPS patients, it is important to consider a series of variables, so that it can be better understood, thus providing a more effective and specific treatment.",

      "title": "CLINICAL FINDINGS IN THE USE OF TOFRĀNIL IN DEPRESSIVE AND OTHER PSYCHIATRIC STATES",
      "abstract": "1. Preliminary observation would indicate that Tofrānil is a useful drug in the treatment of depressive states. It is not a tranquilizer and, therefore, is of little value in other conditions. It is a promising drug which can be used as an anti-depressant. However, its indication and scope must be studied for a longer period to determine what symptoms respond best to it. 2. The effect of Tofrānil in many patients can be increased by the concomitant use of a tranquilizer or a stimulant. In a number of patients Tofrānil, by removing the depressive elements, frees and exaggerates anxiety. 3. It can be used in combination with electric shock or after electric shock as a maintenance dose. 4. It is of little value in the treatment of schizophrenics and in paranoid types may often aggravate the condition and break down an unstable equilibrium to which the patient has become adjusted. 5. The combined use of Tofrānil and a tranquilizer is helpful in certain psychoneurotic states, associated with anxiety or with reactive depressions. 6. It is of value in the treatment of depressions occurring in the older age group. 7. High doses are unnecessary and the effective range is somewhere between 75 and 150 mgm. per day. 8. For the most part, side effects are minimal, particularly in the younger age group. As one approaches the older age group, the frequency of such side effects increases, but usually they are more uncomfortable than serious. In patients over 60 there may be a tendency to sudden falls which occur without warning. It is recommended that in older patients the dosage be limited to 75 mgm. or less. 9. Side effects can usually be reduced in frequency or intensity by a reduction in the dosage. 10. Long-term use of the drug is apparently necessary as patients may relapse, at least in the early stages when the drug is prematurely removed. Since the drug is rapidly excreted, it is necessary to give the medication 3 times a day.",

Sometimes it does present with typical symptoms like bloating, flatulence and altered bowel habits. At times there is mental illness like severe depression that comes in the way which is real challenge for the physicians to treat as mere reassurance doesn’t suffice. The longer the history of symptoms, more complicated it gets.

They have symptoms in relapsing and remitting manner. Post infectious IBS is more agonizing as the patient need antibiotics in an era of increasing resistance .3Failure of one antibiotic to resolve symptoms leads to usage of multiple ones at the same time .The cramping abdominal pain and the sleepless nights leading to daytime fatigue do have an enormous and disastrous impact on the activities of daily living.

      "title": "Iloperidone (Fanapt): An FDA-Approved Treatment Option for Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a debilitating and chronic mental illness that affects approximately 24 million people of all ages around the world. The usual onset is between 15 and 35 years of age,1 and about 1% of all Americans are affected.2 Approximately 25% of all beds in psychiatric hospitals are occupied by patients with schizophrenia, and 50% of psychiatric hospital admissions are a result of schizophrenia.3,4 This mental illness can be characterized by the presentation of psychosis, cognitive impairment, social withdrawal, and apathy, all of which lead to impaired functioning in school, self-care, recreational activities, work, parenting, and interpersonal relationships. Among the psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia is considered to be the most disabling illness.5 Symptoms can broadly be classified into three groups: \r\n\r\n\r\npositive: unusual perceptions or thoughts such as hallucinations and delusions\r\n\r\n\r\nnegative: a decrease or loss in the ability to speak, to find pleasure in everyday life, to express emotions, or to initiate plans. These symptoms are often mistaken for depression or amotivation; hence they are more difficult to recognize.\r\n\r\n\r\ncognitive: difficulty in organizing or planning, with impairments in executive functioning, working memory, and attention. These are considered the most disabling of the symptoms because they affect the patient’s ability to maintain a normal life.6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo general classes of medications are used to treat schizophrenia: first-generation (conventional) antipsychotic agents and second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic agents.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly used first-generation antipsychotic drugs are chlorpromazine (Thorazine, GlaxoSmithKline), haloperidol (Haldol, Ortho-McNeil), perphenazine (Trilafon, Schering), and fluphenazine (Prolixin, Apothecon). Although efficacious, these medications are associated with a high risk of causing extrapyramidal symptoms, including rigidity, tremors, dystonia, and restlessness.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, the first of the atypical agents, clozapine (Clozaril, Novartis), was approved in the U.S. Although clozapine is considered to have extrapyramidal symptoms as a rare side effect, it carries five black box warnings, the most serious being agranulocytosis. Many other atypical agents are known for their metabolic side effects such as weight gain and an increased risk of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Other atypical antipsychotic medications include risperidone (Risperdal, Janssen), olanzapine (Zyprexa, Eli Lilly), quetiapine (Seroquel, AstraZeneca), ziprasidone (Geodon, Pfizer), aripiprazole (Abilify, Bristol-Myers Squibb/Otsuka), paliperidone (Invega, Janssen), and asenapine (Saphris, Schering-Plough).6\r\n\r\nIn May 2009, the FDA approved iloperidone (Fanapt, Vanda) as an atypical antipsychotic agent for the acute treatment of patients with schizophrenia. In clinical trials, it was shown to be efficacious and safe. In this article, we review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of iloperidone in alleviating both the positive and negative symptoms of this disabling disease.",

The delirium disappeared completely after prednisone was stopped. The delirium led to a long hospital stay of 36 days, weight loss of 10 kg due to undernourishment and extension of home care on discharge. Conclusion This case illustrates that delirium is always lurking around the corner in patients with multiple vulnerabilities. The provoking factor can be slight, for example 15 or 5 mg of prednisone.

They are used therapeutically for anxiety and insomnia and are used nonmedically for their psychoactive effects. An estimated 1.8 million Americans are current nonmedical users of sedatives. Many sedatives act on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor, producing depressed cortical function and disinhibition. Toxicity is characterized by slurred speech, impaired judgment, and unsteady gait; overdose results in stupor, coma, respiratory depression, and vasomotor collapse and may be fatal. Withdrawal symptoms include agitation, restlessness, insomnia, anxiety, and seizures. Sedative use should be suspected in individuals with clinical signs of toxicity. Benzodiazepines and barbiturates can be detected in standard urine drug tests. Cognitive impairment and increased risk of accidental injury and falls are the most serious medical complications. Prescribed sedatives can be tapered slowly over weeks to months. Acute withdrawal can be treated with a taper of a long-acting benzodiazepine or phenobarbital. There are few data on long-term treatment of sedative use disorders.",

Psychiatric problems associated with withdrawal include anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance.

Mood disorders will cause changes in your behaviour and might have an effect on your ability to manage routine activities, like work or faculty. Two of the foremost declarative mood disorders square measure depression and manic depression.",

      "title": "Hypnodiagnostic and Hypnotherapeutic Fantasy-Evocation and Acting-out Techniques",
      "abstract": "Abstract During the past five years, we have been experimenting with a number of hypnotic techniques with which to reach patients who have little or no motivation, at least at first, for psychotherapy. For the most part, these techniques have been utilized with patients with real or apparent medical or surgical disease, who had been, so far as can be judged, medically or surgically sick for five, ten or more years. The more usual interviewing techniques frequently could give us no clues, even so far as differential diagnosis (of organic from emotional disease) was concerned. As a result, techniques were devised whereby these patients were hypnotized, sometimes without their knowledge or conscious consent, but nevertheless always with their consent implied, without at any time using the word “sleep” or suggesting eye-closure, so that, by the use of other techniques still under investigation, symptoms could be precipitated or intensified even to the point of having asthmatic or epileptic attacks reproduced, for instance, during the consultation session. By still other techniques, symptom-formation was then blocked and the inevitable, resultant anxiety reaction repressed, so that underlying fantasies could erupt into conscious awareness even to the point of being acted out. An asthmatic patient, for example, when his asthmatic attack was blocked, acted out the killing of his girl friend by knocking her to the floor and jumping over and over again on her abdomen. An adolescent, with what was thought to be probable extra-pyramidal disease, began to masturbate. Examples could be multiplied almost ad inftnitum In all cases, symptoms served more than one function, and several such functions would be acted out either concurrently or one after the other. Such reactions have been utilized for the purpose of differential diagnosis, but not in the more usual sense of the term. We cannot, for instance, say that these patients do not have asthma, epilepsy, etc. By means of these techniques, however, we have found it possible to determine, and to determine rapidly, the neurotic or psychotic functions which their symptoms serve, and, in addition, to state further that, irrespective of whether or not it be asthma, epilepsy, etc., specific patients with these diagnoses can be helped and even “cured,” after having been taken partly or completely off medication, by psychiatric treatment. This can proceed in two different ways: (a) With patients who are poorly motivated toward treatment, substitute symptoms may be set up, provided they serve the same neurotic needs, or other specifically hypnotherapeutic techniques utilized. (b) Patients who can come into a good therapeutic relationship, sometimes as a result of the hypnodiagnostic procedures listed above, can then be treated both (1) by the more usual psychotherapeutic techniques, either on non-hypnotic or hypnotic levels, and, in addition, (2) by techniques made possible only by the hypnotic interpersonal relationship. Some of these, again, are acting-out techniques. There is little in the whole field of hypnotherapy that is not controversial. This applies even to a definition of hypnosis. However, from the angle of approach of the material presented in this chapter, we tentatively incline to believe that whatever else, in addition, the hypnotic interpersonal relationship is, it seems to be a fantasy-evoking one in which the patient, on the basis of his own experiential background and with more ready access to his pre-conscious, thinks, feels, experiences, reacts and even acts-out exactly as he believes the hypnotist wishes him to, projecting his own impulses, desires and fantasies to the therapist. Or—and this is of course the same thing—his reaction may negativistically be the very opposite of this. For this reason, when techniques of this type are utilized, no direct suggestion at any time is given the patient. When treatment of this type is decided upon, calculated risks must at times be taken. These include those of suicide by the patient, of collaboration by the therapist in the fantasies of his patient, and of acting-out by the patient of the fantasies of the therapist. Such pitfalls, for the most part, so it is believed, can be avoided.",

Cerca de 50% de la poblacion lo padece, y es un problema que se asocia con una serie de alteraciones: disminucion de la capacidad fisica, problemas de concentracion y atencion, multiples patologias se exacerban, lo que acaba produciendo una disminucion de la calidad de vida de la personas. Asi mismo se interrelaciona con multiples problemas tanto fisicos, como psicologicos y sociales que pueden agravar o ser causa a su vez de las alteraciones del sueno. Reconocer los problemas del sueno y clasificarlos adecuadamente permite determinar la necesidad o no de estudios complementarios, seleccionar el manejo mas adecuado en forma individual, recomendar el manejo no farmacologico (terapia cognitivo conductual, manejo del ambiente), y si fuera necesario, determinar el tipo de farmaco mas adecuado en funcion de la asociacion existente con otras patologias (enfermedad pulmonar obstructiva cronica [EPOC], depresion, ansiedad, sindrome de piernas inquietas, etc.). La pequena revision que se presenta tiene como objetivo presentar al medico general las bases para enfrentarse al paciente adulto mayor que padece de alteraciones del sueno.

After strenuous workouts, it is physiological to experience fatigue, which relieves within two weeks, and then induce an improvement in motor capacities. An overtraining syndrome is diagnosed when fatigue is postponed beyond two weeks, and affects mainly endurance athletes. It is a condition of chronic fatigue, underperformance and an increased vulnerability to infection leading to recurrent infections. The whole observed spectrum of symptoms is physiological, psychological, endocrinogical and immunological. All play a role in the failure to recover.

      "title": "X-Ray, the Treatment of Choice for Toxic Goiter",
      "abstract": "MY argument for the treatment of toxic goiter by the X-ray is based upon twenty-two consecutive years' use of this procedure. In my hands and in the hands of my associates, it has given results which are nothing short of marvelous. I consider X-ray therapy the treatment of choice. When considering the treatment of such a broad and ill-defined class of patients one may easily be misunderstood, unless some definition or description of the cases is given. The cases which we class as suitable for this treatment must have a rapid pulse when resting and a definite increased basal metabolic rate of plus 12 or more, associated with some of. the other symptoms such as fine tremor not limited to the fingers, tachycardia, profuse perspiration as shown by warm, moist palms, and some marked nervous manifestations, as frequent winking, change of disposition or unusual energy without continuity of purpose. In a marked vagotonic case the pulse may be as low as 80, but this is unusual. Such cases must have other definite symptoms such as a marked increased basal metabolic rate or a definite von Graefe's sign, lacrimation, palpitation, severe sweating or diarrhea. The typical exophthalmic cases with en1arged thyroid gland are easily recognized, and are included. These usually respond quickly. The mild adenomata of adolescence are never included; they do not require treatment other than general medical care and time. If they become severe they are easily handled. No case has come to us too advanced to be included. I shall not trouble you with statistics, but shall try to convince you of the value of X-ray irradiation by affirming that the cases have not been selected except as I have stated. We have taken them all as they came. The results have been almost universally good. Until a few years since I was able to say that my results seemed to be 100 per cent successful. Since then we have had two deaths and one case which I believe was scared into an operation by a surgeon. These cases are briefly recorded below. Some cases have ceased treatment against advice. A few cases have returned for treatment because of some unusual emotion, such as that caused by death in the family or fright. Such cases are easily handled. These represent the only cases which have recurred. The number of our cases that could in any way be considered failures or have re-lapsed ever so slightly, is so small as to be almost negligible compared to the great number returned to full health, full weight, full earning power and full enjoyment of life. Nothing is more gratifying than to cure one of these patients, who has not only been miserable but who has turned a whole happy home into misery. The degree to which these patients may be cured is dependent only upon the amount of permanent damage which has been done to the heart, and upon other coincident diseases.",

      "title": "Course and outcome of schizophrenia and their prediction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Studies conducted over many decades consistently demonstrate that schizophrenia presents a broad spectrum of possible outcomes and course patterns, ranging from complete or nearly complete recovery after acute episodes of psychosis to continuous, unremitting illness leading to progressive deterioration of cognitive performance and social functioning. Between these extremes, a substantial proportion of patients show an episodic course with relapses of psychotic symptoms and partial remissions during which affective and cognitive impairments become increasingly conspicuous and may progress to gross deficits. Although no less than one-third of all patients with schizophrenia have relatively benign outcomes, in the majority the illness still has a profound, lifelong impact on personal growth and development. The initial symptoms of the disorder are not strongly predictive of the pattern of course but the mode of onset (acute or insidious), the duration of illness prior to diagnosis and treatment, the presence or absence of comorbid substance use, as well as background variables such as premorbid adjustment (especially during adolescence), educational and occupational achievement, marital status, and availability of a supportive social network allow a reasonable accuracy of prediction in the short- to medium-term (2–5 years). One of the most striking aspects of the longitudinal course of schizophrenia is the so-called ‘terminal improvement’. A relatively high proportion of patients tend to improve substantially with ageing. What determines this long-term outcome is far from clear but the stereotype view of schizophrenia as an invariably progressive, deteriorating disorder does not accord well with the evidence. Similarly, a model of schizophrenia as a static neurodevelopmental encephalopathy decompensating post-adolescence under the influence of a variety of stressors fits only part of the spectrum of course patterns. In a significant proportion of cases, the disorder exhibits the unmistakable features of a shift-like process with acute exacerbations and remissions which may progress to severe deterioration or come to a standstill at any stage. Whether a single underlying pathophysiology can explain the variety of clinical outcomes, or several different pathological processes are at work, remains obscure. It has been suggested that the longitudinal course of schizophrenia should be seen as an open-ended, dynamic life process with multiple, interacting biological and psychosocial determinants. Obviously, such issues cannot be resolved by clinical follow-up studies alone, and require a strong involvement of neurobiological research in prospective investigations of representative samples of cases spanning the entire spectrum of course and outcomes. No such studies have been possible until recently, both because of the technical complexity of such an undertaking and because of the tendency to selectively recruit for biological investigations patients from the severe, deteriorating part of the spectrum. Overcoming such limitations will be essential to the uncovering of the mechanisms driving the ‘natural history’ of schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Since many movement disorders are associated with schizophrenia, it is important to distinguish various motor manifestations of the disease itself from associated abnormal movements. Case Presentation: We present a 35-year-old single man with schizophrenia who was admitted for seizure-like tics. The disease started 7 years earlier with psychotic manifestations, including persecutory delusion, negative symptoms, and impaired function. About a year ago, movements in the limbs, abdomen, and spine (similar to those seen in tonic-clonic seizures) were added to the patient’s symptoms, lasting for a few seconds to a few minutes. After some time, these movements were accompanied by expressing words and phrases that had sexual content. Due to the exacerbation of these attacks, the patient was admitted to the hospital. He was unable to explain the cause of these movements, and differential diagnoses included stereotype, extrapyramidal effects of antipsychotic drugs (particularly tardive dyskinesia), and temporal lobe epilepsy. However, the patient had no history of epilepsy. Urine screening for illegal substances, electroencephalography (EEG), brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and neurological counseling were all normal. The adverse effects of medications were ruled out because the patient had taken antipsychotics very irregularly and in low doses. A short time after starting 4 mg of oral risperidone (as the main treatment), the patient showed better cooperation and was able to describe his symptoms in more detail. He explained that a stranger or a copy of himself occasionally compelled him to do the movements, and if he refused to do it, he would be punished by them. Ten days after continuing treatment and starting weekly flupentixol decanoate, the motor symptoms improved significantly, and the patient was discharged after 3 weeks. Conclusions: This case presentation emphasizes the importance of accurate clarification of the nature of signs and symptoms in patients with mental disorders, which seems to be crucial in making a diagnosis and appropriate treatment.",

Addiction or psychological dependence implies the compulsive self-administration of the drug, caused by both its reinforcing or rewarding effects and the unpleasant experience (i.e., abstinence syndrome) produced by the sudden interruption of its consumption. In contrast to tolerance or physical dependence, addiction is not simply a biological phenomenon. Psychological, environmental, and social factors can strongly influence its development. All these factors could explain the important variability of the clinical syndrome of addiction, and the various approaches that have been proposed to help addicts to stop their drug use.

      "abstract": "Transient epileptic amnesia is an adult onset form of temporal epilepsy which is characterised by recurrent acute seizure-induced amnesia often accompanied by ongoing memory disturbances of autobiographical, topographical amnesia and accelerated long-term forgetting. The first case report of transient epileptic amnesia was described more than a hundred years ago. However, more extensively investigations of this type of epilepsy were started not long ago. In 1998 diagnostic criteria were formulated: 1) history of recurrent witnessed episodes of transient amnesia; 2) cognitive functions other than memory are judged to be intact during typical episodes by a reliable witness; 3) evidence for a diagnosis of epilepsy, provided by one or more of the following: (a) wake or sleep electroencephalography; (b) the co-occurrence of other seizure types (if their roughly concurrent onset and/or close association with episodes of transient amnesia suggested a connection); (c) a clear-cut response to anticonvulsant therapy. From case reports that are analysed in literature it is not difficult to summarise clinical characteristics: transient epileptic amnesia usually starts later in life, more often in men than in women; amnestic episodes are brief, recurrent and often occur upon waking; memory loss is usually mixed type with anterograde and retrograde amnesia; in 65% of patients amnesia is associated with gustatory or olfactory hallucinations, déjà vu, a brief period of unresponsiveness, automatisms; epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalography were seen in 43% cases; although transient epileptic amnesia has an excellent response rate to anticonvulsant therapy, between episodes patients still suffer from accelerated long-term forgetting, remote memory impairment and topographical amnesia. Differential diagnostic of transient epileptic amnesia is diverse and diagnosis is usually inaccurate and overdue. Treatment with monotherapy often helps totally prevent recurrence of attacks. In the paper we review two case reports of patients with transient epileptic amnesia.",

      "title": "Presenting Symptoms of Pituitary Apoplexy",
      "abstract": "Abstract The classical term “pituitary apoplexy” (PA) describes a clinical syndrome usually characterized by abrupt onset of headache accompanied by neurologic and/or endocrinologic deterioration due to sudden expansion of a mass within the sella turcica as a result of hemorrhage or infarction within a pituitary tumor and adjacent pituitary gland. PA is a medical emergency and a difficult diagnosis to establish. Thus this article reviews the presenting symptoms of PA patients to help clinicians recognize or at least suspect this critical condition early on. PA commonly occurs in the setting of a preexisting adenoma, and several patients are unaware of its existence prior to the onset of apoplexy symptoms, which are mainly of a neurologic, ophthalmologic, and endocrinologic nature. Neurologic symptoms include sudden-onset severe headache and other symptoms of subarachnoid hemorrhage, symptoms from compression of the cavernous sinus contents, nausea/vomiting, impaired consciousness, and symptoms of meningeal irritation. Ophthalmologic symptoms include visual field defects, visual loss, diplopia, and ophthalmoplegia. Endocrinologic disturbances include pituitary adenoma symptoms, cortisol deficiency, panhypopituitarism, diabetes insipidus, and syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Magnetic resonance imaging is the imaging method of choice to aid the PA diagnosis. Its differential diagnoses include cerebrovascular accidents, infectious diseases, and other causes of endocrinologic imbalance. Transsphenoidal surgery is the treatment of choice, especially if there are associated visual abnormalities and ophthalmoplegia. Clinicians should be aware of the presenting symptoms because early diagnosis may reduce the morbidity and mortality of this neurosurgical emergency.",

      "abstract": "Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a mental disorder that is rare or studied because it becomes disabling for the woman who presents it in various areas of her life. At present, psychotherapeutic treatment is an essential part along with the pharmacological one and can be carried out intermittently during the menstrual period.This article aims to report some factors suffered by women with PMDD within their work performance, which must generate emotional, physical, and social strategies so that each menstrual cycle can cope with the various consequences of this condition. The findings made it possible to identify complications in women in physical conditions such as extreme pain, tachycardia, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, decrease in blood pressure, decrease or loss of appetite, sleep disorders, lack of libido, and fatigue, among others. Moreover, on an emotional level, it can present irritability, crying, social withdrawal, guilt and worthlessness, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation or intention, stress, or Burnout Syndrome.",

      "title": "Clinical Neuropharmacology of Sleep Disorders",
      "abstract": "Within the context of the comprehensive treatment of sleep disorders, which includes medical, neurologic, psychiatric, and social interventions, use of medication is often indicated. Among the three benzodiazepine hypnotics that are available in the United States for the treatment of insomnia, flurazepam is effective for both sleep induction and maintenance, and it retains most of its efficacy over a 4-week period of nightly administration; temazepam is effective only for sleep maintenance, and triazolam improves both sleep induction and maintenance with initial but not with continued administration. Rebound phenomena are more frequent and intense with the more rapidly eliminated drug, triazolam, and to a lesser degree with temazepam. Also, with triazolam, certain behavioral side effects, such as amnesia and psychotic-like symptoms, have been reported. With flurazepam, which is a slowly eliminated benzodiazepine, daytime sedation is more frequent than with the other two drugs. When insomnia is secondary to major depression, antidepressant medication should be administered. Methylphenidate, amphetamines, or other stimulant medications are used for the symptomatic treatment of the sleepiness and sleep attacks of narcolepsy and hypersomnia. For cataplexy and the other two auxiliary symptoms of narcolepsy, imipramine or other tricyclics are the drugs of choice. Protriptyline and medroxyprogesterone have been used in treating mild cases of obstructive sleep apnea, but their efficacy is limited. Similarly, for the treatment of central sleep apnea, medroxyprogesterone and acetazolamide have shown only limited effects. Medication for patients with sleepwalking, night terrors, or nightmares should be prescribed judiciously, and primarily when treatment of an underlying psychiatric condition is desired. The neuropharmacology of sleep should also consider drugs that may cause sleep disorders. Medications with sleep disturbing effects include various antihypertensives, bronchodilators, and the energizing antidepressants. Withdrawal of REM-suppressant drugs, such as the barbiturates, may cause nightmares in association with a REM rebound. Occasionally, a drug or a combination of drugs may produce somnambulistic-like activity in some patients.",

      "title": "The Analgesia Nociception Index: Tailoring Opioid Administration",
      "abstract": "Opioids remain a cornerstone for perioperative analgesia, albeit frequently associated with side effects, most of them are dose dependent. Intraoperative opioid administration aims to blunt sympathetic-mediated response to nociception and is usually based on surrogate parameters such as tachycardia, hypertension, sweating, or movement. These symptoms have low sensitivity and specificity in detecting nociceptive stimuli, which can result in underdosage or overdosage of opioids administered during anesthesia. Misadministration of opioids contributes to increasing the incidence of side effects such as nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, and opioid-induced hyperalgesia, the latter being of paramount importance, as it contributes to increasing postoperative pain and may initiate mechanisms responsible for chronic pain.1 These complications of nociception and its treatment lead to the need for additional information about nociception during surgery, which could help caregivers personalize the way they deliver opioid analgesia and hence increase the quality of care. Several monitoring solutions to assess intraoperative nociception have been developed in the past years, based on cortical-derived (electroencephalographic) or subcortical-derived (sympathetic–parasympathetic [pS] balance) signals responding to nociceptive stimuli; however, no system to date has demonstrated clinical benefit that would justify their routine use.2 Heart rate variability analysis has been widely used to assess the autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity in many clinical fields in awake and anesthetized patients.3 However, few studies focused on nociception measure and analgesia guidance in anesthetized patients for 2 reasons: the first is the complex interactions between hypnosis, nociception, and cardiovascular drugs during surgery, and the second is technical, because rapid changes of autonomous activation during surgery often lead to nonstationary signals on which classical heart rate variability measurement tools cannot be applied properly. Recently, the Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI) monitor (MDMS, Loos, France) has been commercialized by a spinoff of the University Hospital of Lille and its Center for Innovative Technologies (CIC IT 1403 INSERM, University Hospital of Lille, France). The method applied by the ANI monitor overcomes difficulties encountered by prior systems and produces a real-time reliable analysis of the pS activity of the ANS in a time window of 64 seconds. ANI computation relies on an algorithm that quantifies the relative amount of pS activity on a simple R-R series obtained noninvasively on a continuous electrocardiogram. Two electrodes placed on the chest of the patient enable staff to record a simplified electrocardiogram, detect R waves, and calculate the R-R interval. This series is then filtered using a fast wavelet transform to keep only the high-frequency band (0.15–0.4 Hz), where the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is expressed. The calculated index varies between 0 and 100 in relation to the relative pS activity: the higher the pS activity, the higher the RSA.4 Clinically, RSA can be felt by taking the pulse of a patient and feeling the brief increase in heart rate with each inspiratory movement, which is directly related to pS activity by a physiological reflex loop that links bronchial stretch receptors, the vagus node in the brainstem, and the sinus node in the heart. The first clinical trial exploring the antinociception/nociception balance with the ANI during surgery under controlled propofol anesthesia demonstrated that hemodynamic reactivity was systematically preceded by a drop in ANI to lower than 50, thus signaling an inhibition of the pS activity before significant sympathetic activation.5 Therefore, ANI values higher than 50 are considered to reflect an adequate balance between antinociception and nociception. Several studies in anesthetized adults and children have confirmed that ANI is more sensitive than heart rate and blood pressure in detecting noxious stimuli.6,7 Recently, our group demonstrated that the ANI allows adequate guidance of remifentanil in a large cohort of vascular surgery patients, resulting in low remifentanil consumption and low postoperative pain rates.8 In the current issue, Upton et al,9 examined postoperative pain scores in the recovery room from 0 to 90 minutes in patients receiving intraoperative ANI-guided fentanyl (ANI group) versus standard fentanyl administration (control group) for lumbar discectomy and laminectomy. Patients in the ANI group received intraoperative fentanyl boluses of 25 μg (patients <50 years old) or 50 μg (patients ≥50 years old) only if ANI scores decreased to lower than 50, repeating every 5 minutes until ANI scores increased to higher than 50, whereas patients in the control group received boluses of fentanyl according to \"standard practice,\" albeit this was not detailed by the authors. The results of the study demonstrated that despite similar amounts of total intraoperative fentanyl, patients in the ANI group had lower pain scores compared to the control group in the recovery room. Therefore, greater intraoperative fentanyl administration did not explain per se the difference observed in postoperative pain scores. Interestingly, the distribution of fentanyl boluses throughout the procedure was markedly different between groups: patients in the ANI group received twice as many, but half-dose, fentanyl boluses as patients in the control group. This is similar to a titration of fentanyl during the periods of greater nociception and is reflective of the higher calculated fentanyl concentration in the ANI group. Thus, it would appear that ANI monitoring helped tailor and personalize fentanyl administration to the dynamics of nociception, which could be the explanation for the reduced postoperative pain scores observed. To understand the mechanisms through which a tailored opioid administration may reduce postoperative pain, one must consider that postoperative pain is due to the local inflammatory response at the wound (primary hyperalgesia) and also to central sensitization of the central nervous system (secondary hyperalgesia) initiated via N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation. NMDA receptors are activated by either intense noxious stimuli (inadequate analgesia) or large opioid doses, which lower their activation threshold (excessive opioid analgesia). Furthermore, excessive amounts of intraoperative opioids lead to acute opioid-receptor desensitization that contributes to opioid inefficacy in the postoperative period.10 A plausible explanation of the findings of Upton et al9 might be that personalized opioid administration guided by ANI helped avoid NMDA receptor activation during periods of intensive noxious stimulus or excessive opioid-receptor desensitization, and reduced central hyperalgesia. To test these hypotheses, future studies that aim to better understand the benefit of customizing intraoperative opioids should separately assess primary and secondary hyperalgesia. Since postoperative pain is usually evaluated by global scales (eg, the numerical rate scale) that do not permit a distinction between these 2 mechanisms, future studies should develop better methods to assess primary and secondary hyperalgesia. ANI guidance alone may not be sufficient to decrease pain in the postoperative period. In a prior study on ANI guidance of intraoperative morphine and fentanyl in 120 patients scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, Szental et al11 failed to demonstrate any decrease in the intraoperative opioids or in the postoperative pain in the ANI group. Although the reason for the difference in the latter study with that of Upton et al9 is unclear, it may reflect that small doses of additional morphine administered in the ANI group failed to induce a difference in nociception, and therefore did not reduce secondary hyperalgesia compared with standard practice. Future investigations evaluating the benefit of antinociceptive ANI guidance should take into account: (1) the pharmacokinetic of the opioid used, which should have a rapid onset to promptly blunt the sympathetic response to increased nociception; and (2) the bolus size, which should be as small as possible and ideally effect the site targeted to avoid excessive administration with regard to the nociceptive stimulus. This could be most easily achieved with target-controlled administration of rapid-onset, short-duration opioids and may be realized in the near future with closed-loop administration devices. Decreasing opioid administration has become one of the goals of current anesthesia. Worldwide recommendations support the use of multimodal analgesia by combining anti-inflammatory agents, NMDA receptor–blocking agents, and regional anesthesia as one means to achieve this goal.12 Tailoring opioid administration may be another method of optimizing anesthesia by decreasing or limiting intraoperative opioid use and minimizing postoperative pain. This task would be easier with adequate monitoring of the antinociception/nociception balance. As the ANI measures the relative pS activity and thus the sympathetic–pS balance, which has been used as a surrogate for the antinociception/nociception balance, various clinical applications in anesthetized or awake adults and children have been tested or are currently under investigation. In anesthetized adults undergoing lower limb orthopedic surgery, the ANI accurately differentiated hypertension related to excess of nociception and hypertension related to a prolonged tourniquet application.13 In children under sevoflurane anesthesia, the ANI assessed the effectiveness of pain release by regional anesthesia at the start of surgery.14 The ANI also helped assess postoperative pain in adults and young children as well as procedural pain in sedated critically ill patients.15,16 As the ANI assesses the ANS activity, other clinical applications are under investigation, such as the prediction of hypotension after spinal anesthesia or the evaluation of the intrinsic effect of drugs commonly used in anesthesia on the ANS. For example, recent studies have shown that ketamine and nefopam did not alter ANS activity.17 Despite the potential benefits of ANI monitoring, there are limitations to its use, including severe arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation, implanted pacemakers, cardiopulmonary bypass, and the use of antimuscarinic drugs. Despite these limitations, there is no doubt that, along with the monitoring of the depth of hypnosis, the availability of an objective monitor to assess the antinociception/nociception balance may markedly change our approach to intraoperative pain management in a wide range of clinical settings.

Sometimes biological aspects cause SBS, sometimes the chemicals present in your building, but human biological systems are affected. This paper reveal a review of SBS, including symptoms, causes, effects, work-related illnesses, prevention, and control. Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) is a medical condition where people experience unexplained symptoms of illness or discomfort while occupying a building. The severity of these symptoms tends to worsen with prolonged stay in the building, but improves or disappears once they leave. SBS can have significant consequences, including: Impaired work or school performance, strained personal relationships, Reduced attendance, Decreased productivity. SBS can occur in various settings, such as: Offices, Homes, Schools, Nurseries. Common symptoms of SBS include: Eye problems (irritation, watering, dryness), Respiratory issues (runny or blocked nose, sore throat), Skin problems (itching, dryness), Headaches, Fatigue, Lethargy, Poor concentration. Overall, SBS can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life and productivity, making it essential to identify and address the underlying causes of the condition.",

These conditions are illnesses or impairments that are expected to last for an extended period of time and require medical attention and care that is above and beyond what would normally be expected for a child or adolescent of the same age, extensive hospitalization, or in-home health services.1 These conditions include, among others, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, spina bifida, hemophilia, seizure disorders, neuromuscular disease, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and congenital heart diseases. Although each specific condition may be relatively or extremely rare, when they are considered together, many children and adolescents are affected. Health conditions may be characterized by their duration and their severity. Although these terms are often linked, they refer to different aspects of a health condition. A chronic condition is generally one that has lasted or is expected to last more than a defined period of time, usually 3 months or longer. Conditions vary widely in their onset, course, and duration.2 Severity refers to the impact a condition has on a child's physical, intellectual, psychological, or social functioning.3 This impact may occur as a result of persistent symptoms, required treatments, limitations of activity or mobility, or interference with school, recreation, work, and family activities. Current estimates are that between 10 and 20 million American children and adolescents have some type of chronic health condition or impairment. Most of these conditions are relatively mild and interfere little with the children's ability to participate in usual childhood activities.4 However.",

Physical symptoms are the same for PMS and PMDD. Depending on the severity of the symptoms experienced by the patient should guide the choice of treatments. Mild cases can be treated with changes in lifestyle and pharmacological therapies and in severe cases require drug therapy.",

There are vital differences not only as to etiology (Cobb<sup>1</sup>) but also as to the manner in which the illness sets in, its evolution and its clinical manifestations. In fully developed epilepsy the attacks usually show an assortment of features, including psychic, visceral and motor symptoms. In this study we directed attention to the mode of onset and noted that the illness commonly began in one of two ways. In some patients epilepsy set in abruptly; a person previously well fell to the ground in a sudden, violent convulsion. In other patients the disease set in gradually, beginning with slight, peculiar sensations, which recurred with added features until, in the course of months or years, true epileptic characteristics became evident. The first type may be considered as abrupt or violent; the second may be designated",

      "abstract": "The new DSM-5 has a number of changes to addictions and substance-related disorders. Internet Gaming for instance is a “Condition for Further Study”. This means that it is not an “official” disorder in the DSM, but one on which the American Psychiatric Association request additional research. The DSM diagnostic criteria for addictions to the X-subject generally include: – repetitive use of X, that leads to significant issues with functioning; – preoccupation or obsession with X; – craving/withdrawal symptoms when not dealing with X; – the person has tried to stop or curb X, but has failed to do so; – the person has had a loss of interest in other life activities, such as hobbies; – a person has had continued overuse of X even with the knowledge of how much they impact a person's life; – the person uses X to relieve anxiety related to other issues; – the person has lost or put at risk and opportunity or relationship because of X. I suggest that some sport fans may: – meet the above mentioned criteria; – be subject to over-identification with “their team performances”, superstitious conditioning and loss of self-consciousness that may lead to a full blown addictive syndrome, along with comorbidity with pathological gambling. This seems particularly true in Italy, for example, as far as the phenomenon of ultra football supporters is concerned. I argue that further research might be needed to explore the psycho-social consequences of obsessive sport addiction and how this may impact on a person's overall functioning.",

      "abstract": "Pain is a universal concept; however, the experience is unique from person to person. Pain is a subjective term that an individual describes and experiences. Pain has its meaning and is produced out of the complex interactions of body, mind, and culture. Pain can be interpreted differently from individual to individual depending on the time and place where that person is [1]. Pain is defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage [2]. Pain is described as acute or chronic. Acute pain is experienced for short time (two weeks) due to trauma while chronic pain last longer than three months and is associated with injury to tissues or nerves. There are four factors that commonly affect pain expressions: Location, Duration, Intensity and Etiology. The location is the place where the pain occurs. Duration is the time that pain lasts, and is classified as chronic or acute. Intensity tells how severe the pain is. It is usually measured through a pain scale from zero to ten. The patient's rate themselves. Usually, four to six is considered as a moderate level, and above seven is considered to be severe pain [3].",

In all these cases, dopaminergic treatment can be helpful. However, many other nonmotor (and motor) symptoms will have no correlation with dopamine; therefore, they require different treatments, very often with little efficacy, as in apathy or cognitive decline.",

      "title": "Psychosocial Might a pleasure improve anhedonia and depression",
      "abstract": "Introduction Anhedonia (a reduction of the abil­ ity to feel pleasure) is considered a key symptom in major depression and may influence some of its most imp ortant symptoms, such as apathy, difficulty in concentrating and main­ taining attention, and gloomy mood. Various pleasurable sensations seem to be useful both in anhe donia and in depression. These pleasures are more intense than the usual daily ones, and their greater intensity could mean they can still be felt by a certain number of anhedonic individuals. Hypothesis Feeling a pleasant stimulus enhances the user’s sensitivity to subsequent rewards, so subsequent pleasures can be felt more strongly for a certain time. In this way, a pleasure strong enough to be still felt by some anhe­ donic individuals might reinforce their sensitivity to other rewards, enabling them to regain previously faded or lost pleasures, hence impro­ ving the anhedonia. Evaluation of Hypothesis Anhedonia is a key symptom of major depression and may influence some of its symptoms; hence an improve­ ment in anhedonia, produced by a pleasure strong enough to be felt, might positively influence the life of depressed people. Consequences of Hypothesis Since many symptoms of depression could be influenced by anhedonia, ameliorating anhedonia may alleviate also these symptoms of depression. Conclusion A pleasure, strong enough to be felt, might allow anhedonic and depressed persons to regain, for a certain time, previously lostnormal pleasures, thus enabling them to temporarily lead a more enjoyable life.",

Objectives Description of a clinical case of a patient diagnosed with major depressive episode with psychotic symptoms and obsessive compulsive disorder prevalence of compulsive acts that do not respond to drug treatment but to electroconvulsive therapy. Methods Presentation and review of a case. Results A 55-year-old woman diagnosed with recurrent depressive disorder with worsening in the last 4 years. Clinical depressive Sadness, spontaneous crying in the form of access, apathy, isolation and clinofilia desires, complaints mnemonic deficits and complete anhedonia. Obsessional symptoms compulsive as more repetitive behaviors of obsessive ideas, which repeats incessantly despite checking, that does not prepare or calm. The patient has not responded to any pharmacological strategy, despite using full doses and combinations of antidepressant, but euthymics more antipsychotics (sertraline, fluoxetine, reboxetine, venlafaxine, bupropion, lithium, valproic acid, lamotrigine, risperidone, quetiapine, trifluoperazine, clotiapine). For this reason, it was decided to start treatment with ECT, progressively responds in each session, after 8 sessions the patient is euthymic, it has resumed normal activities, no obsessive or psychotic symptoms. Conclusions It is important to know that it is a safe technique that would save not only an economic cost, if not a personal emotional cost. It is noteworthy that more than 50% of depressed patients who respond to a course of ECT, fall between 6 and 12 months despite receiving adequate pharmacological treatment then so we will have to closely monitor the patient.

The concomitant intravenous and intramuscular administration of the specific narcotic antagonist naloxone is warranted in such cases. Further threatening complications of opiate abuse include rhabdomyolysis, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and both peripheral and central nervous lesions. Opiate abuse is often associated with benzodiazepine abuse. Hence, intravenous administration of the antagonist flumazenil is indicated in patients with suspected acute opiate intoxication resistant to naloxone. Cocaine abuse is not frequent in this country but is usually very severe and clinically heterogeneous. The clinical pattern of cocaine intoxication is initially due to excitatory and later to depressant effects on central nervous, circulatory and respiratory systems. The treatment of acute cocaine intoxication is symptomatic. The internal concealment of cocaine and other drugs in packets (body-packing) may lead to bowel obstruction or to acute intoxication following leaking or breaking of packets.",

This type of \"eating disorder,\" which has also been described as \"choking phobia,\" may occur in the absence of body image distortion, fear of becoming fat, or the desire to be thinner. The primary complaint in these children may be physical discomfort accompanied by high anxiety. Negative consequences can be severe and include social withdrawal, family distress, and deleterious effects on the child's physical health. Prompt recognition in the pediatric setting is, therefore, critical to avoid escalation of symptoms and treatment delays. Three pediatric cases of severe choking phobia refractory to prior intervention are presented in which rapid and sustained improvement followed low-dose therapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Possible predictors of response to low-dose SSRI treatment in children with choking phobia and future avenues for investigation are explored.",

Normal-dose dependence is characterized by a wide range of symptoms even after gradual discontinuation. Perceptual symptoms are characteristic. The syndrome is more severe in patients attempting to discontinue lorazepam than those stopping diazepam and more fail to discontinue. Alprazolam is also presenting especial difficulties and may not be fully cross-tolerant with other benzodiazepines. The management of withdrawal centres on the use of flexible withdrawal schedules together with unstinting psychological support. High-dose dependence and abuse are uncommon but increasing, particularly among polydrug abusers. The clinical and research implications of these studies are discussed.",

      "title": "A definition and classification of status epilepticus – Report of the<scp>ILAE</scp>Task Force on Classification of Status Epilepticus",
      "abstract": "Summary The Commission on Classification and Terminology and the Commission on Epidemiology of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) have charged a Task Force to revise concepts, definition, and classification of status epilepticus ( SE ). The proposed new definition of SE is as follows: Status epilepticus is a condition resulting either from the failure of the mechanisms responsible for seizure termination or from the initiation of mechanisms, which lead to abnormally, prolonged seizures (after time point t 1 ). It is a condition, which can have long‐term consequences (after time point t 2 ), including neuronal death, neuronal injury, and alteration of neuronal networks, depending on the type and duration of seizures . This definition is conceptual, with two operational dimensions: the first is the length of the seizure and the time point (t 1 ) beyond which the seizure should be regarded as “continuous seizure activity.” The second time point (t 2 ) is the time of ongoing seizure activity after which there is a risk of long‐term consequences. In the case of convulsive (tonic–clonic) SE , both time points (t 1 at 5 min and t 2 at 30 min) are based on animal experiments and clinical research. This evidence is incomplete, and there is furthermore considerable variation, so these time points should be considered as the best estimates currently available. Data are not yet available for other forms of SE , but as knowledge and understanding increase, time points can be defined for specific forms of SE based on scientific evidence and incorporated into the definition, without changing the underlying concepts. A new diagnostic classification system of SE is proposed, which will provide a framework for clinical diagnosis, investigation, and therapeutic approaches for each patient. There are four axes: (1) semiology; (2) etiology; (3) electroencephalography ( EEG ) correlates; and (4) age. Axis 1 (semiology) lists different forms of SE divided into those with prominent motor systems, those without prominent motor systems, and currently indeterminate conditions (such as acute confusional states with epileptiform EEG patterns). Axis 2 (etiology) is divided into subcategories of known and unknown causes. Axis 3 ( EEG correlates) adopts the latest recommendations by consensus panels to use the following descriptors for the EEG : name of pattern, morphology, location, time‐related features, modulation, and effect of intervention. Finally, axis 4 divides age groups into neonatal, infancy, childhood, adolescent and adulthood, and elderly.",

The patient's behavior in these situations may be motivated by the psychological meanings, interpersonal communications, or social consequences of taking pills. The physician may be able to identify these psychosocial factors by learning about the patient's prior experiences with medications, by eliciting his views of physicians and medical care, and by understanding the consequences of becoming a patient.

Extremely low levels of family adaptation, the severity of negative symptoms and the degree of its impact on social and occupational functioning confirmed the diagnosis of schizophrenia. Material and methods. Psychopathological and psychometric methods were used.Bipolar depression was characterized by severity, atypical circadian rhythm, autochthonous asthenia, atypical symptoms, frequency of mixed depression, and accompanying comorbid symptoms as polymorphic phobias, symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorders, and pathological body sensations (senestoalgia, senestopathy), subpsychotic episodes and the tendency to alcoholism.The results have shown that here is a need for the special variant of schizophrenia with bipolar affective disorders (outside BAD) in modern classifications of mental and behavioral disorders.",

It also causes loss of motivation and poor concentration, and in the long term more fatigue.

      "title": "Management of post-polio syndrome",
      "abstract": "Many patients with post-poliomyelitis syndrome can benefit from a management program. When a post-polio patient presents with new symptoms, it is first essential to identify and treat other medical and neurological conditions which could produce these symptoms. New weakness can be managed with exercise (stretching, strengthening, and aerobic), avoidance of muscular overuse, weight loss, orthoses, and assistive devices. Fatigue can be managed with energy conservation techniques, lifestyle changes, pacing, regular rest periods or naps during the day, amitriptyline to improve sleep, and possibly pyridostigmine (trial in progress). The management of pain is dependent upon its cause. The treatment of post-polio muscular pain can include activity reduction, pacing (rest periods during activity), moist heat, ice, and stretching, use of assistive devices, and life style modifications. Fibromylagia can be treated with amitriptyline, cyclobenzaprine, and aerobic exercise. Joint and soft tissue abnormalities can be managed with modification of extremity use, physiotherapy, orthoses, assistive devices, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, and rarely steroid injections and surgery. Superimposed neurological disorders may produce pain, and should be identified and treated. The identification and treatment of pulmonary dysfunction in a post-polio patient is an important aspect of management, and is discussed elsewhere in this issue. Dysphagia can be managed with diet changes, use of special breathing and swallowing techniques, monitoring fatigue and taking larger meals earlier and smaller meals later, and avoiding eating when fatigued. The management of psychosocial difficulties usually requires an interdisciplinary approach, and may include a post-polio support group, social worker, psychologist, and psychiatrist.",

The “X” factor in most of these situations has been\r\nIdentified as psychological impairments. Hence now adequate\r\nPrograms has been put in place in several countries for the regular\r\nScreening for these impairments among ESRD patients.\r\nDepression has been identified as the most common psychiatric\r\nDisorder prevalent among this group of patients, and its role in causing\r\nMorbidity and mortality in these patients has been studied in detail. Old\r\nAge, pain, comorbid medical or surgical conditions, financial stresses,\r\nPoor social support, have been identified as few important factors that\r\nPredispose the patients to depression and other other psychological\r\nImpairments.

Prevalence of this condition is unavailable in developing countries of the world. It is classified as \"L98.1 Excoriation (skin-picking) Disorder\" in ICD-10 and referred in some literature as \"dermatillomania\". ED is characterized by, but not invariably, the compulsive urge to pick, squeeze or scratch skin surfaces experienced by patients. Commonly picked parts of the body include the face (most picked), arms, legs, back, gums, neck, shoulders, scalp, abdomen, chest, the knuckles (via mouth leading to temporary disfiguration of distal and proximal joints of the middle and little fingers) and other extremities e.g. the fingernails, cuticles, and toe nails;5 skin picking may be accompanied by anxiety with depression following picking. It is often triggered by factors that include feeling or examining irregularities on the skin, feeling anxious etc. Complications include infections, tissue damage and sepsis. Rarely, severe cases cause lifethreatening injuries. Risk of self-harm is increased by feelings of intense helplessness, guilt, shame and embarrassment.8 Studies further describe significant associations between ED and suicidal ideation, suicidal attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations.",

These symptoms can include physical (e.g., pain, shortness of breath), cognitive (e.g., delirium, memory problems, impaired concentration), and affective (e.g., depression, anxiety) experiences associated with the disease and its treatments (1). Symptoms are the side effects and ''toxicities'' of treatment, as well as the direct product of the disease process itself. Symptoms are what patients report to clinicians as the subjective negative feelings of physical and mental changes produced by both disease and treatment. Symptom severity is related to the extent of disease and the aggressiveness of therapy. Common symptoms of cancer and cancer treatment significantly impair the daily function and quality of life of patients. Symptoms that are unrecognized by treatment teams may also become so severe that emergency room visits or hospitalization are required for management, adding substantially to the cost of treatment and to the disruption of the patients' routines and those of their families. Untreated symptoms may also negatively influence treatment effectiveness by interrupting treatment (2). Multiple and severe symptoms present a significant challenge to the resources of those who care for and managecancer patients. For example, intensive cancer therapies produce severe and sometimes life-threatening side effects, resulting in patients' inability to care for themselves and in total dependence on caregivers (3). Undertreatment of symptoms has become a major health problem in its own right.",

      "title": "Lifestyle medicine for depression",
      "abstract": "The prevalence of depression appears to have increased over the past three decades. While this may be an artefact of diagnostic practices, it is likely that there are factors about modernity that are contributing to this rise. There is now compelling evidence that a range of lifestyle factors are involved in the pathogenesis of depression. Many of these factors can potentially be modified, yet they receive little consideration in the contemporary treatment of depression, where medication and psychological intervention remain the first line treatments. “Lifestyle Medicine” provides a nexus between public health promotion and clinical treatments, involving the application of environmental, behavioural, and psychological principles to enhance physical and mental wellbeing. This may also provide opportunities for general health promotion and potential prevention of depression. In this paper we provide a narrative discussion of the major components of Lifestyle Medicine, consisting of the evidence-based adoption of physical activity or exercise, dietary modification, adequate relaxation/sleep and social interaction, use of mindfulness-based meditation techniques, and the reduction of recreational substances such as nicotine, drugs, and alcohol. We also discuss other potential lifestyle factors that have a more nascent evidence base, such as environmental issues (e.g. urbanisation, and exposure to air, water, noise, and chemical pollution), and the increasing human interface with technology. Clinical considerations are also outlined. While data supports that some of these individual elements are modifiers of overall mental health, and in many cases depression, rigorous research needs to address the long-term application of Lifestyle Medicine for depression prevention and management. Critically, studies exploring lifestyle modification involving multiple lifestyle elements are needed. While the judicious use of medication and psychological techniques are still advocated, due to the complexity of human illness/wellbeing, the emerging evidence encourages a more integrative approach for depression, and an acknowledgment that lifestyle modification should be a routine part of treatment and preventative efforts.",

      "title": "Diagnostic guidelines for bipolar depression: a probabilistic approach",
      "abstract": "Objectives: There are currently no accepted diagnostic criteria for bipolar depression for either research or clinical purposes. This paper aimed to develop recommendations for diagnostic criteria for bipolar I depression. Methods: Studies on the clinical characteristics of bipolar and unipolar depression were reviewed. To identify relevant papers, literature searches using PubMed and Medline were undertaken. Results: There are no pathognomonic characteristics of bipolar I depression compared to unipolar depressive disorder. There are, however, replicated findings of clinical characteristics that are more common in both bipolar I depression and unipolar depressive disorder, respectively, or which are observed in unipolar‐depressed patients who ‘convert’ (i.e., who later develop hypo/manic symptoms) to bipolar disorder over time. The following features are more common in bipolar I depression (or in unipolar ‘converters’ to bipolar disorder): ‘atypical’ depressive features such as hypersomnia, hyperphagia, and leaden paralysis; psychomotor retardation; psychotic features, and/or pathological guilt; and lability of mood. Furthermore, bipolar‐depressed patients are more likely to have an earlier age of onset of their first depressive episode, to have more prior episodes of depression, to have shorter depressive episodes, and to have a family history of bipolar disorder. The following features are more common in unipolar depressive disorder: initial insomnia/reduced sleep; appetite, and/or weight loss; normal or increased activity levels; somatic complaints; later age of onset of first depressive episode; prolonged episodes; and no family history of bipolar disorder. Conclusions: Rather than proposing a categorical diagnostic distinction between bipolar depression and major depressive disorder, we would recommend a ‘probabilistic’ (or likelihood) approach. While there is no ‘point of rarity’ between the two presentations, there is, rather, a differential likelihood of experiencing the above symptoms and signs of depression. A table outlining draft proposed operationalized criteria for such an approach is provided. The specific details of such a probabilistic approach need to be further explored. For example, to be useful, any diagnostic innovation should inform treatment choices.",

      "abstract": "Background: Majority of the antipsychotics including some of the atypical antipsychotics are associated with adverse effects related to blockade of dopamine (D2) receptors. Of them, galactorrhoea can be a very distressing and embarrassing symptom. A constant search is therefore on for antipsychotics with lesser adverse effects.\r\nCase description: A thirty year old married lady suffering from Unspecified Nonorganic Psychosis of three years duration had developed troublesome galactorrhoea while on treatment with trifluperazine. It was changed over to risperidone in an effort to reverse galactorrhoea but without benefit. She was then switched over to aripiprazole while tapering off the previous medication. Her mental condition improved while her galactorrhoea too stopped within three weeks.\r\nDiscussion: Unlike other antipsychotic drugs, aripiprazole as a partial D2 agonist, may not result in the severe hypodopaminergic state in the tubero-infundibular pathways and thus does not increase prolactin levels. This mode of action is unique to aripiprazole and explains how it can ameliorate the galactorrhoea induced by other antipsychotic drugs.\r\nConclusion: Aripiprazole is an effective and a safer atypical antipsychotic more so for its low propensity for galactorrhoea. It may also reverse the galactorrhoea induced by other antipsychotics such as risperidone.",

Antidepressants are a specific treatment for this condition, but their effective use requires considerable judgment, knowledge and skill. Many drugs are available, although with a few exceptions there are no substantial differences in their overall efficacy in equivalent doses. Shades of clinical judgment dictate the use of one preparation over the other. In any case, physicians should become thoroughly familiar with several of these agents. A fair trial of treatment requires therapeutic doses for at least three to four weeks. These drugs have a low safety margin and elderly patients are especially at risk for the cardiac, anticholinergic and CNS side effects. Duration of treatment is decided empirically. The successful chemotherapy of depression is one of the most gratifying experiences in medicine.",

      "title": "Brain Death",
      "abstract": "The term \"brain death\" (BD) is used to indicate a clinical situation characterized by the irreversible loss of all brain functions; the identification of this condition is closely linked to the development of intensive care medicine that, with mechanical ventilation, allows the maintenance of somatic functions even when cerebral functions are ceased. BD diagnosis is essentially based on the presence of three cardinal clinic criteria: 1) coma or unresponsiveness, 2) absence of brainstem reflexes 3) absence of spontaneous breathing, evaluated with apnea test. For BD diagnosis the following prerequisites must be scrupolously considered: knowledge of the proximate cause of coma and confirmation of its irreversibility; exclusion of confounding clinical variables (severe electrolyte, acid-base, endocrine disturbances); hypothermia and/or hypotension; drug intoxication or poisoning. Ancillary tests used in BD confirmation are represented by neurophysiological methods to highlight the loss of bioelectrical brain activity (EEG, evoked potential (EP)) and methods for demonstration of cerebral circulatory arrest (TransCranial Doppler (TCD); Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ( SPECT); conventional Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA); CT angiography; MRI angiography). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether ancillary tests are able to confirm the complete cessation of all brain functions and then, in adults, ancillary tests are not needed for the clinical diagnosis of brain death and they should never replace the clinical neurological examination. However, even though ancillary tests are not mandatory but only optional in many countries, they continue to be used, especially when there are factors that may interfere with the complete clinical assessment or when apnea test cannot be performed. Although BD is a relatively simple clinical diagnosis, there are substantial differences in perceptions and practices regarding its declaration among countries, states and even between hospitals worldwide. There are also cultural and religious obstacles—especially in lower-income countries—to the determination of death with neurologic criteria, which lead to the suspension of mechanical ventilation. Therefore, health organizations should implement educational campaigns to improve knowledge and awareness of current criteria among the population, and national and international scientific societies should also make every efforts to validate and standardize clinical and laboratory criteria. Finally, it should reminded and underlined that the ultimate purpose of brain death determination should be to increase the number of organs donated, to improve the quality of life of organ recipients.",

      "abstract": "Background: Insomnia can manifest as difficulty in falling asleep, in maintaining sleep throughout the night, or waking up too early, with symptoms often unpredictably changing over time. Pharmacologic options for insomnia treatment include prescription hypnotics, such as y-amino butyric acid-receptor agonists, sedating antidepressants, over-the-counter antihistamines, melatonin-receptor agonists, and alternative therapies. A concern with insomnia medications is the risk of next-day residual effects, which can impair memory and ability to perform certain tasks, such as driving, and may increase the risk of accidents and falls, especially in the elderly. Objectives: To describe the impact of current insomnia treatments on next-day performance.Results: The longer-acting benzodiazepines are associated with next-day “hangover” effects and, as a result, have been largely replaced by agents in the nonbenzodiazepine class, which typically have shorter half-lives. The hypnotic, sedative activities of these classes of drugs depend on variations in binding characteristics to the a, subunit of the γ-amino butyric acidA- receptor, which inhibits neuronal activity in broad areas of the brain and is found in areas of the brain responsible for sleep/wakefulness and sedation. However, nonbenzodiazepines with a rapid onset of action and short half-life have shown limited efficacy for maintaining sleep throughout the night. These properties have contributed to the development of modified-release formulations. Zolpidem extended-release is a bilayer tablet that retains the fast onset of action of its parent compound Zolpidem while extending the duration of hypnotic activity, owing to a slower-release portion of the tablet. Conclusions: Based on clinical evidence, the risk of residual next-day effects of Zolpidem extended-release is limited, mainly due to the similarly short half-life in its extended-release formulation.",

      "abstract": "Hypocalcemia can manifest as a variety of presentations, ranging from neuromuscular irritability to seizures, and psychiatric manifestations such as emotional instability, anxiety, and depression. Here, we present a unique case of hypocalcemia-induced acute psychosis. A 24-year-old woman presented to the emergency department (ED) with confusion and agitation for four to five days. The patient was noted by the family to have decreased oral intake and sleep. Auditory and visual hallucinations prompted the family to bring the patient to the ED. The patient was mildly tachycardic. Initially, the patient was agitated, impulsive, and aggressive, exhibiting psychotic features including visual hallucinations, paranoid delusions, thought broadcasting, tangential and perseverative thought processes, and erotomanic delusions. She had mild leukocytosis and elevated procalcitonin on admission. A thorough workup ruled out infectious/inflammatory processes. Cerebrospinal fluid was negative for acute meningitis/encephalitis, autoimmune encephalitis antibodies, and paraneoplastic etiology. Thyroid-stimulating hormone was normal and thyroid antibodies were negative. The CT brain and MRI brain were unremarkable. The patient was severely hypocalcemic (6.7) with low parathyroid hormone (<6) on admission. To note, the patient has multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 2B (MEN2B). She underwent total thyroidectomy five months prior for metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma complicated by postsurgical hypoparathyroidism. The patient had been non-compliant with calcium and calcitriol supplementation postoperatively. The patient was started on IV calcium gluconate and transitioned to calcitriol with calcium level improvement over the next three days. She experienced marked improvement, with the resolution of her psychosis. The patient's subacute onset psychosis with no personal or family psychiatric history and a rapid response to calcium correction supports hypocalcemia etiology. This case illustrates new-onset acute psychosis in a patient with calcium regulation imbalance. The development of hypocalcemia secondary to thyroidectomy with postsurgical hypoparathyroidism and calcium supplement non-compliance precipitated psychosis. A few similar cases have been reported, and here, we note that treatment of hypocalcemia promptly resolves symptoms. As per our review, this will be the first case of neuropsychiatric symptoms without associated cortical calcifications seen on imaging. It is important to recognize hypocalcemia as a rare cause of psychosis so as to not mistakenly categorize such presentations as primary psychotic disorders and miss a medically treatable illness.",

The first of these is that the term hypothyroidism refers to the pathologic condition of the thyroid gland, whereas in fact, it refers to the condition in the body created by an insufficiency of the thyroid hormone in the tissues; this may occur without pathology in the thyroid itself. Second, the physician has in mind a clinical syndrome corresponding to myxedema, which is a rather rare and extreme form of thyroid deficiency. Far more common—and requiring diagnosis—is a clinical state of hypothyroidism, without the history or physical findings associated with myxedema. Third, the average physician, unfortunately, still feels that determination of the basal metabolic rate is a diagnostic test for hypothyroidism. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism is indicated in a very wide variety of clinical conditions, such as (a) states of fatigue, somnolence, psychasthenia, malnutrition, obesity, anemia, hypertension, edema, chronic cardiac disease, diabetes, allergy, and gastroenterologic disorders, and (b) states of pituitary insufficiency appearing as disorders of the adrenal or gonad, since pituitary secretion is so dependent upon an adequate supply of the thyroid hormone.

      "title": "Treatment implications for bipolar disorder co-occurring with anxiety syndromes and substance abuse",
      "abstract": "Anxiety symptoms and syndromes affect approximately half of both types I and II bipolar disorder (BD) patients at some time, more in women than men. Reported prevalence has ranked: generalized anxiety ≥ phobias ≥ panic ≥ post-traumatic stress syndrome ≥ obsessive–compulsive syndrome. BD associated with anxiety disorders is less responsive to mood-stabilizing treatments, with greater disability, substance abuse, and possibly suicidal risk. Emerging treatments for anxiety in BD patients include lurasidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, valproate, and psychotherapies, whereas the efficacy and safety of standard anxiolytics and antidepressants are not established. Abuse of alcohol, cannabis, stimulants, and opioids, alone or in combinations, also affects about half of BD patients at some time—more men than women and possibly somewhat more in type I than II. Substance abuse greatly complicates clinical care, contributing to erratic treatment-adherence, adverse outcomes, disability, increased risk of suicide or accidental death, and increased costs of care and from disability.",

      "title": "Palinopsia and Other Reversible Visual Disturbances Induced by Topiramate",
      "abstract": "We read with interest the article by Yun et al (1) describing 9 new patients with topiramate-induced palinopsia. Palinopsia, consisting of the persistence of visual images after the removal of the initial stimulus, may be observed in different medical conditions, especially migraine (2), but may also be provoked by different medications. Topiramate is an antiepileptic drug useful for migraine prophylaxis and for the treatment of both partial and generalized seizures (3). Topiramate has been rarely associated with adverse ocular events, in particular ciliochoroidal effusion syndrome, but patients with transitory visual disturbances induced by topiramate are being increasingly recognized (1). We evaluated 2 patients with other types of visual disturbances that were severe but transitory and fully reversible and appear related to beginning topiramate or dosage increase of the medication. Patient 1: A 19-year-old woman had a 1-year history of migraine with aura. Her headaches usually were preceded by visual symptoms (teichopsia or visual distortion) lasting for about 20–30 minutes and occurred monthly. Topiramate was started at a daily dose of 25 mg. Within 5 days, she complained as if looking “through a veil.” This visual disturbance was continuous, and she was not taking any other medications. A complete ophthalmologic examination was unremarkable. Physical examination, numerous blood tests, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electroencephalography were normal. Topiramate was discontinued, and within 2 days, her visual symptoms completely disappeared. She was prescribed amitriptyline for migraine prophylaxis. There was no recurrence of her visual symptoms in 6 years of follow-up. Patient 2: A 21-year-old man had a 6-year history of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Initially, he was treated with levetiracetam 3 g/d, with reduction of seizure frequency. At age 20 years, topiramate 100 mg/d was added, and he remained seizure-free for 5 months. He then experienced 2 generalized tonic–clonic seizures, and his topiramate was gradually increased by 50 mg/wk up to 200 mg/d. Two days after reaching the maximal dosage, the patient complained of severe blurred vision (“I see all black”) that lasted for approximately 30 minutes. He had no similar symptoms in the past and was taking no other medications. Neurologic and ophthalmologic examinations were normal. Topiramate was gradually reduced to 50 mg/d and valproate was given at 1,000 mg/d. In the ensuing 9 years, he has not experienced seizures or visual disturbances. Our 2 patients had reversible visual disturbances associated with use of topiramate. In our first patient, visual complaints began after institution of topiramate, whereas in the second patient, visual symptoms were associated with an increase in the dose of medication. Either discontinuing the medication (patient 1) or lowering the dose (patient 2) led to cessation of the visual disturbances. The symptoms experienced by our patients expand the spectrum of visual complaints experienced by patients taking topiramate.",

      "title": "Drug selection and timing of initiation of treatment in early Parkinson's disease",
      "abstract": "There is increasing evidence to challenge the traditional view that the initiation of drug treatment in Parkinson's disease (PD) should be delayed until the patient has significant disability such as to affect work or social function. Firstly, to delay treatment sentences the patient to protracted impairment of quality of life that could be improved by therapy. Secondly, there is evidence to support the notion that earlier rather than later initiation of treatment leads to better long term motor benefit. The selection of which drug to begin must be tailored to the patient's individual characteristics and circumstances. Monoamine oxidase B inhibitors result in a mild improvement in motor function compared to dopamine agonists or levodopa. They are well tolerated, easy to use once a day drugs and there is evidence that early use of Rasagiline improves motor outcome. Dopamine agonists lead to a substantial improvement in motor function and are, or will shortly be, available as once a day drugs. They are generally well tolerated but can be associated with exacerbating confusion or hallucinations and with behavioral changes. Levodopa is the most potent of the dopaminergic drugs. It is routinely combined with a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor and can also be used with a catecholo-o-methyl transferase inhibitor for enhanced absorption. The most important limiting factor for the use of levodopa is the emergence of motor complications. These are related to a number of factors including the dose of levodopa and the duration of its use.",

      "title": "Four Faces of Baroreflex Failure",
      "abstract": "The baroreflex normally serves to buffer blood pressure against excessive rise or fall. Baroreflex failure occurs when afferent baroreceptive nerves or their central connections become impaired. In baroreflex failure, there is loss of buffering ability, and wide excursions of pressure and heart rate occur. Such excursions may derive from endogenous factors such as stress or drowsiness, which result in quite high and quite low pressures, respectively. They may also derive from exogenous factors such as drugs or environmental influences.Impairment of the baroreflex may produce an unusually broad spectrum of clinical presentations; with acute baroreflex failure, a hypertensive crisis is the most common presentation. Over succeeding days to weeks, or in the absence of an acute event, volatile hypertension with periods of hypotension occurs and may continue for many years, usually with some attenuation of pressor surges and greater prominence of depressor valleys during long-term follow-up. With incomplete loss of baroreflex afferents, a mild syndrome of orthostatic tachycardia or orthostatic intolerance may appear. Finally, if the baroreflex failure occurs without concomitant destruction of the parasympathetic efferent vagal fibers, a resting state may lead to malignant vagotonia with severe bradycardia and hypotension and episodes of sinus arrest.Although baroreflex failure is not the most common cause of the above conditions, correct differentiation from other cardiovascular disorders is important, because therapy of baroreflex failure requires specific strategies, which may lead to successful control.",

Nowadays, it is a wider spread opinion that 10% of the live born children belong to the group of those with neurodevelopment risks or that were under influence of other factors (medical history, clinical), which can lead to the early brain damage. Risk factors can be divided into perinatal, prenatal and postnatal ; and the worst effect of all have: premature birth - before the 32nd week of gestation ; low birth weight - less than 1500 grams ; machine breathing longer than 48 hours in the first 28 days of life ; cardio - respiratory collapse at birth including: Apgar score of 0– 3 in the fifth minute of life, inability to establish spontaneous respiration within the first 10 minutes and lasting muscle hypotonia during the first 2 hours of life ; prolonged perinatal hypoxemia ; acidemia ; neonatal hypoglycemia or recurrent apnea ; a history of epileptic seizures ; disturbances of consciousness of the newborn ; other potential neurological problems, such as previous CNS infection ; documented sepsis ; meningitis ; pathologic Hyperbilirubinemia, so called “Complicated” intracranial hemorrhage diagnosed by ultrasound (all except first degree) ; hypoxic - ischemic changes ; periventricular leucomalacia ; hydrocephalus and other congenital malformation ; and viral and other infection of the mother in the first weeks of pregnancy. With objective to prevent an easier neuromotor deviation and difficulties with basic life function to become dominant, stereotypical and habit of the child, physiotherapy intervention in the NICU is performed. It includes the proper positioning of the newborn, respiratory physiotherapy, early neurodevelopmental therapy, neonatal handling, preoral therapy and parent education. Although it is a small child it is important to have an holistic interdisciplinary team approach that focuses on the child as a whole and includes all professional disciplines and their existing knowledge in solving problems of the small patient. In the NICU, the basis of the team which take care of neurodevelopment risky infants are the physiotherapist, the neonatologist physician and the nurse.",

      "abstract": "espanolLas depresiones en las personas mayores desencadenan una serie de consecuencias fisicas, funcionales, sociales, psicologicas, que pueden mantenerse en el tiempo, aun tras la mejoria de la sintomatologia afec- tiva. Se considera que en mas de las tres cuartas partes de los mayores deprimidos pueden persistir sintomas residuales, dando lugar a estados postdepresivos en forma de depresiones menores, depresiones subum- brales o depresiones subsindromicas. Entre estos sintomas residuales mas frecuentes en los estados postdepresivos destacan las dificultades de concentracion, el enlenteci- miento, la astenia, los sintomas somaticos, los trastornos del sueno o la hipocondriasis. En los mayores son mas frecuentes las de- presiones subclinicas o subsindromicas, que frecuentemente aparecen tras la mejoria de un trastorno depresivo mayor. Los factores que se asocian para la aparicion de estas depresiones subsindromicas son de tipo so- ciodemografico (ausencia de contactos so- ciales), empeoramiento funcional, historia previa de trastornos afectivos, antecedentes de trastornos vasculares cerebrales o facto- res existenciales (preocupaciones sobre el futuro, baja percepcion de salud,..). Este tipo de depresiones tienden a la cronici- dad y al deterioro funcional, y por tanto se recomienda el tratamiento de las mismas.

It is considered that in more than three quar- ters of elderly depressed may persist, giving rise to postdepressive states in the form of minor depressions, sub-threshold depres- sions or subsyndromic depressions. Among these most prevalents residual symptoms in postdepressive states are difficulties of con- centration, bradipsychia, asthenia, somatic symptoms, sleep disorders or hypochondria- sis. In elderly people, subclinical or subsyn- dromal depressions are more prevalent, which frequently appear after the improvement of a major depressive disorder. The factors that are associated for the appearance of these subsyndromic depressions are sociodemo- graphic factors (loss of social contacts), functional impairment, previous history of affective disorders, history of cerebrovascu- lar disorders or existential factors (concerns about the future, low perception of health, ..). This form of depression tends to chronici- ty and functional impairment, and therefore treatment is recommended.

It is linked to hypertensive disorders, (pre-)eclampsia, certain auto-immune diseases, the use of immunosuppressive medication and kidney failure. Treatment of the hypertension is crucial, but antiseizure drugs and treatment of the underlying disease may also be necessary. Most patients have a complete recovery within 2 weeks.

This chapter will discuss evidence for a role of the glutamate system in morphine withdrawal. Specifically, the idea that morphine withdrawal is a state of glutamate hyperactivity in defined brain regions will be discussed. One of those brain regions is the locus coeruleus.",

Angina pain symptoms—or equivalents such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and nausea—are considered stable if they are experienced over several weeks in the absence of major deterioration [1-3]. Those affected by CSA typically have CAD involving one or more large epicardial arteries, although individuals diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, endothe‐ lial dysfunction, or valvular stenosis/deficiencies may also exhibit angina [1]. Symptoms usually occur predictably upon physical exertion and are relieved by rest or nitroglycerin [1]. The severity of symptoms experienced can vary, typically ranging from Canadian Cardiovas‐ cular Society [CCS] class I to class III angina. A number of factors can also aggravate symptoms including heightened emotional states, diet, smoking, and weather [1,4].",

We intend to present in this study several oral adverse effects encountered during finasteride administration, represented by mild and moderate signs which generally responded to topical procedures without to require the stop of the drug administration. New studies on large samples will further document the existing relation between the described oral adverse effects and the implied pathophysiological mechanisms.

Alcohol can mimic or accentuate many of the symptoms of depression: low mood, low energy, changes in appetite, weight or sleep pattern, poor concentration, feelings of guilt or worthlessness and suicidal ideation. Many people with depression can develop an alcohol problem as they may ‘self-medicate’ to feel more energetic or cheerful. In severe cases, alcohol misuse can lead to impaired judgement and increase the risk of suicide. Patients with severe depression and alcohol dependence coexisting are considered to have a ‘dual diagnosis’ and often require support from mental health specialist services such as community alcohol team in addition to primary care support.",

I do not wish, however, to be understood as advocating the disuse of hypnotics in all cases of insomnia; my remarks must be taken to apply only, so far as my experience goes, to febrile insomnia, or the insomnia of convalescence from acute diseases, to the condition of sleeplessness arising from long hours of mental activity or excitement, and to insomnia from exhaustion.

We present a subgroup of patients with the following pattern of symptoms and historical detail: (1) severe sexual and physical abuse by family members; (2) relatively good premorbid professional and marital adjustment (considering later difficulties) though characterized by (3) hypomania, binge eating, and morbid obesity. A pronounced shift in eating behaviors follows (4) medical trauma (e.g., injury, cancer, surgery) that occurs after age 30, interrupts previous hypomanic adaptation, and leads to severe restriction, purging, and dramatic weight loss (e.g., 100 lb). Although only one patient met full criteria for anorexia nervosa, weight loss and starvation were serious enough to provoke further medical crises in all patients. Finally, (5) during both weight loss and weight restoration patients demonstrated significant dissociative disturbance, including dissociated mood and personality states (i.e., multiple personality disorder), self-destructive behavioral episodes repeating early trauma, and avoidance of food as a way to manage PTSD symptoms. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

The disorder produces negative impacts on physical and social functioning, health related quality-of-life, emotional health and wellbeing, personal relationships, and the ability to complete daily work/life activities. It is considered to be a central sensitivity syndrome and a member of several overlapping conditions that produce diffuse pain such as chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, tension headache, myofascial pain syndrome, and restless legs syndrome. In order to address the illness and its related comorbidities, successful treatment plans are multidisciplinary, patient centered, individualized and multifaceted. Plans must be comprehensive and include disease education for patient and family members, lifestyle changes, aerobic exercise, dietary consults for weight reduction, sleep hygiene, strength training, cognitive behavioral therapy, pharmacotherapy, and perhaps complementary and alternative medicine-based therapies. There is good evidence to support the use of exercise to improve functioning and reduce symptoms. Amitriptyline, pregabalin, duloxetine, milnacipran, tramadol, and cyclobenzaprine have the best evidence for efficacy in reducing the symptoms and treating comorbidities. Some data exists supporting the use of acupuncture, mind-body interventions such mindfulness-based stress reduction, acceptance and commitment therapy, hypnosis, and biofeedback. Insufficient research is available for non-steroidal anti-inflammatories agents, acetaminophen and gabapentin. All other opioids, benzodiazepines, atypical psychotics and sedative hypnotics have no proven efficacy and are not a part of current FM treatment guidelines.",

The clinical symptomatology of the survivor's syndrome had only gradually been described during a period of about 20 postwar years. Among the particularities of what survivors experienced were their being outlawed, discrimination, defamation, total absence of rights, loss of individuality, life threatening over a long period, being uprooted, the fact of little number of survivors in one's family and elsewhere, lack of grave for the victims, loss of language, culture and home and many others. Characteristics of the survivor's syndrome are continuing anxiety of being persecuted, struggle against memory, tension feeling, rumination over past, low self esteem, irritability, feeling of survivor's guilt, lack of initiative, retreat in apathy, inability of gaiety and to enjoy the pleasures of life, and return of the persecution in dreams among others. Discussions on care and treatment for the aging survivors now is still vivid in many countries. As a consequence of the holocaust experience remains our knowledge that even a fully built up and equilibrated personality can completely be altered, if circumstances are forcing. Further on it has become more clear that there is a transmission if in altered form of the personality changes to at least the second and third generations. In spite of its many difficulties and setbacks psychiatric help is possible, so that there has developed psychiatry of the persecuted as a new branch of psychiatry.",

      "abstract": "I have described a group of patients who are seemingly successful in their professional and social lives, and who seek analysis ostensibly for professional reasons or for minor difficulties in their relationship. However, sooner or later they reveal phenomena which are strikingly similar to those observed in so-called autistic children. These autistic phenomena are characterized by an almost impenetrable encapsulation of part of the personality, mute and implacable resistance to change, and a lack of real emotional contact either with themselves or the analyst. Progress of the analysis reveals an underlying intense fear of pain, and of death, disintegration or breakdown. These anxieties occur as a reaction to real or feared separation, especially when commitment to analysis deepens. In the case I have described in detail the patient used various projective processes to deflect painful emotions either into other people, including the analyst, or into their own bodies. As a consequence the various objects or organs of the body swell up and became suffused with rage as a result of having to contain the unwanted feelings. This process leads in turn to intense persecutory fears and a heightened sensitivity to the analyst's tone of voice and facial expression. It would seem that the initial hypersensitivity of part of the personality is such as to lead it to anticipate danger to such an extent that it expels feelings even before they reach awareness. The sooner the analyst realizes the existence of this hidden part of the patient the less the danger of the analysis becoming an endless and meaningless intellectual dialogue and the greater the possibilities of the patient achieving a relatively stable equilibrium. Although the analyst has to live through a great deal of anxiety with the patient I feel that ultimately the results make it worth while.",

      "abstract": "MOTION sickness represents a response to a particular pattern of vestibular discharges which are generated chiefly in the utriculus of the labyrinth and stimulate pathways through the cerebellum to the brain stem. 1 The response requires a lengthy process of summation since minutes to hours are needed until the vestibular discharges induce a variety of symptoms which culminate in vomiting. Conversely, a relatively rapid process of adaptation may suppress the manifestations of motion sickness. In addition, there are other ways of weakening or preventing the response. Thus, the effect of motion is minimized by assuming a supine position, which greatly reduces the stimulation of the utriculus. Further, the reduction of psychological, visual, visceral or other facilitating influences may lower the incidence of motion sickness. Finally, there are certain drugs which are preventive. During World War II extensive investigations centered on parasympatholytic agents, central nervous system stimulants or depressants, vitamins or",

These neuropsychiatric sequelae have considerable functional consequences at the level of the individual, society, and the broader economy. Neuropsychiatric long covid symptoms are thought to be causally diverse, and a range of risk factors as well as biological, psychological, and environmental mechanisms have been hypothesized to contribute to symptom development and persistence. When present, objective cognitive deficits tend to be modest for most individuals, with some evidence suggesting increased risk of dysfunction and decline specifically for older adults with a history of severe acute illness. Longitudinal data suggest a delayed emergence of psychiatric symptoms may occur in the weeks and months after an acute covid illness. Emerging research points to the early recovery period as a potential window of opportunity for intervention to alter patient trajectories, though evidence based treatment remains lacking.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics ARID1B-related disorder (ARID1B-RD) constitutes a clinical continuum, from classic Coffin-Siris syndrome to intellectual disability with or without nonspecific dysmorphic features. Coffin-Siris syndrome is classically characterized by aplasia or hypoplasia of the distal phalanx or nail of the fifth and additional digits, developmental or cognitive delay of varying degree, distinctive facial features, hypotonia, hypertrichosis, and sparse scalp hair. Frequencies of other features, such as developmental delay (with speech often more affected than motor development), is consistent across the clinical spectrum, and may include malformations of the cardiac, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and/or central nervous systems. Other findings seen in individuals with ARID1B-RD include feeding difficulties, slow growth, ophthalmologic abnormalities, hearing impairment, seizures, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and autistic features. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ARID1B-RD is established by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ARID1B by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment for strabismus, refractive error, hearing loss, congenital heart defects, obstructive sleep apnea, constipation, gastroesophageal reflux, cryptorchidism, scoliosis, and seizure disorders. For significant feeding issues, a nasogastric and/or gastrostomy tube may be required. Developmental therapies, including speech/language and feeding therapy, is recommended for those with developmental delay. Surveillance: At least annual assessment of developmental progress and educational needs; annual ophthalmology evaluation and assessment for scoliosis (until growth is complete). Audiology evaluation, behavior assessment, and hormonal evaluation/bone age as needed based on symptoms. Those with seizures should be monitored as clinically indicated. Genetic counseling ARID1B-related disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. With the exception of two families in which a parent and child had features consistent with ARID1B-related disorder, all individuals diagnosed to date have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Once the ARID1B pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "title": "Unpacking agitation in practice: a call for greater precision",
      "abstract": "Agitation is a term often used by health professionals to describe patient behaviour that is regarded as problematic or disruptive. What constitutes agitation has been a topic of debate, and no unified conceptualisation prevails. Rather like terms such as ‘indigestion’, agitation may refer to completely different things when used by different clinicians. Or as famously said by Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass: ‘When I use a word it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less’.\nA consensus statement by the International Psychogeriatric Association (IPA) [1] proposes that specific behaviours (excessive motor activity, verbal aggression, physical aggression) associated with ‘emotional distress’ have to be present for at least 2 weeks before a ‘diagnosis’ of agitation is made. This definition of agitation is limited to patients with mild-to-severe cognitive impairment, in particular dementia. Disruptive patient behaviours that are attributable to other ‘psychiatric disorders’ (e.g. psychosis), medical conditions or inadequate care do not fall under this definition of agitation. Remarkably delirium, commonly associated with agitation, is not mentioned in that statement. Perhaps this is not all that surprising as delirium is a somewhat invisible condition at bedside and organisational levels [2].",

      "title": "ALCOHOLIC EPILEPSY.",
      "abstract": "The term \"alcoholic epilepsy\" is comparatively new in medicine and describes a class of inebriates who have convulsive symptoms resembling epilepsy. Some writers call it a form of delirium tremens and acute alcoholism; others consider it a distinct epilepsy due to the toxic action of alcohol on the brain centers. In some instances the craving for alcohol precedes the paroxysm or epileptic fit like an aura or premonition. Sometimes the convulsion is intensified and increased by alcohol, or in other instances it may be neutralized and the direction of the symptom changed. The sudden maniacal impulse to become narcotized by alcohol, as seen in the dipsomaniac and periodic inebriates, closely resembles epilepsy. A number of cases have been noted where a distinct convulsion preceded the use of spirits and was followed by a continued impulse to drink. When this craving was neutralized by treatment, the convulsion returned. When spirits were",

      "abstract": "Panic disorder can be misdiagnosed as epilepsy and vice versa, which, in turn, can impact the patient, their family, and the healthcare system. Here, we describe a rare case of a 22-year-old male with a 9-year history of misdiagnosed drug-resistant epilepsy. On presentation to our hospital, the patient's physical examination and other investigations were unremarkable. The attacks were reported to last for about 5-10 minutes and were related to interfamilial distress. He reported feeling anxious about having an attack, experiencing palpitations and sweating before and during episodes, feeling chest tightness, derealization, and fearing loss of control, based on which a diagnosis of panic disorder was made. The patient was treated with 12 sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy, following which all his antiepileptic medications were stopped over 8 weeks. The dose of sertraline was increased and maintained at 200 mg once daily and was gradually stopped after 6 months of remission. This case highlights that panic disorder should be considered as a differential diagnosis of epilepsy. This can be done through a cross-specialty referral, especially given that the clinical manifestations of hyperventilation syndrome can be diagnosed differently by neurologists, psychiatrists, and other specialists.",

      "abstract": "Intractable pain, headache or otherwise, is a devastating and life‐controlling experience. The need to effectively and aggressively control pain is a fundamental tenet of clinical care. In the past several years, increasing advocacy for continuous opioid therapy has become an important, if not controversial, theme in the development of treatment guidelines and teaching programs. Ironically, the increasing willingness of physicians to prescribe scheduled opioids for their headache and pain patients has occurred in the absence of compelling data demonstrating efficacy or long‐term safety. To the contrary, two meta‐analyses on chronic noncancer pain (CNCP) and one long‐term uncontrolled study on headache patients demonstrate a relatively small number of patients benefiting from the treatment. Recent neuroscience data on the effects of opioids on the brain raise serious concern for long‐term safety and also provide the basis for the mechanism by which chronic opioid use might induce progression of headache frequency and severity. Significant adverse effects, including influence on sexual hormonal balances, physical and psychological dependence, the development of opioid‐induced hyperalgesia, and cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death that can be seen with standard dosages of methadone, make a strong argument against widespread use of continuous opioid therapy (COT) in otherwise healthy young and middle‐aged headache patients. We believe that COT should be used in rare circumstances for chronic headache patients, and propose initial guidelines for selecting patients and monitoring treatment. The physician should be well versed in the details of opioid prescribing, administration, and monitoring, and should be prepared to discontinue opioids when clinical justification, patient behavior, or failure to achieve therapeutic goals make discontinuance necessary.",

First, re-evaluating the diagnosis to make sure that no comorbidities were missed, and that the diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) is accurate, particularly with respect to recognition of clinical features that might suggest previously unrecognized bipolarity or psychotic features. Secondly, clinicians should ensure that the patient has adhered to the recommended medication. When finally reaching the point of certainty or near certainty that the patient has not benefited from a truly adequate course of treatment lasting ≥8 weeks, the next major considerations usually are to either switch antidepressants or to augment the original choice of treatments. Lastly, selection of the most appropriate “next choice” strategy should take into account the tolerability of and degree of improvement observed with the initial antidepressant medications. Many clinicians prefer to switch patients who have poorer tolerability and minimal symptom improvement and try to augment therapy when the initial antidepressant has been well tolerated and resulted in some degree of symptom improvement.",

There is always a temptation to administer a narcotic for pain, but it should be remembered that the administration of a narcotic for more than a few days can readily lead to addiction. Administration of a narcotic is not justified for chronic conditions, with one exception, and that is for an inoperable malignant lesion when the patient's life expectancy is only a few months.

The most common pathophysiologic mechanism is through GABA receptor blockade and the most commonly used family of ICU drugs, reducing the seizure threshold, is antibiotics. The exact role that these medications play in inducing a clinical or subclinical seizure, in the context of cerebral injury or other multi-organ failure, is in many cases unclear. The best treatment for drug-induced seizures is increased vigilance and prevention. Cautious measures should be used to minimize or eliminate any unwanted drug side effects by attempting to start and keep the patient on the lowest effective dose for the desired therapeutic effect. When upward dosage titration is necessary it is best to increase slowly while keeping a watchful eye on all laboratory and clinical indicators of success or failure. Free levels of antiepileptic or other medications should be considered in the critically ill, due to numerous factors affecting their final action on the pharmacologic target. If a seizure occurs clinicians should always seek a medication as the cause of the witnessed seizure and should consider replacing it with another agent that has less epileptogenic potential. Lastly, a GABAergic receptor agonist antiepileptic drug should be used as first-line antidote in most of the cases.",

We aimed to analyze the relationship between post-stroke apathy at 1 year after stroke and (1) apathy in acute phase; (2) demographic, pre-stroke predisposing conditions (previous mild cognitive impairment, alcohol abuse, mood/anxiety disorder) and clinical features (stroke type and location, neurological symptoms); (3) post-stroke depression and post-stroke cognitive impairment, and (4) post-stroke functional outcome, quality of life and the perception of health. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Consecutive stroke (infarct/intracerebral hemorrhage) patients without aphasia or consciousness disturbances were included in the acute phase of stroke and assessed at 1 year after stroke. We assessed apathy with the clinically rated version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale. We also assessed post-stroke depression (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and post-stroke cognitive impairment (attention, mental flexibility, verbal, motor and graphomotor initiative, and non-verbal and verbal abstract reasoning, and Mini-Mental State Examination), functional outcome (Barthel Index), quality of life and perception of health (EuroQol). Data were analyzed using bivariate associations (&amp;#x03C7;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and t test) and stepwise multivariate analysis. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We included 76 stroke patients [32.9% women, mean age 62.9 years (SD = 10.9) and a mean of 6.9 (SD = 4.3) years of education]. Apathy was present in 17 patients in the acute phase and in 18 (23.7%) patients at 1 year after stroke. At 1 year after stroke, 41% of the acute apathetic patients remained apathetic. Sixty-one percent of new cases of post-stroke apathy were detected. Post-stroke apathy was associated only with previous cognitive impairment, apathy in acute stroke, post-stroke cognitive impairment, verbal abstract reasoning and with worse Barthel Index scale scores. In the multivariate logistic regression model, verbal abstract reasoning (odds ratio, OR = 7.03) and apathy in acute stroke (OR = 3.8) were identified as independent factors for post-stroke apathy at 1 year. Apathetic patients did not report worse quality of life or health. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Apathy in acute stroke phase was a reliable indicator of post-stroke apathy. Apathy should be assessed in both phases. Verbal abstract reasoning impairment was also an independent factor for post-stroke apathy impairing patients' ability to reason about goal-directed activity. Even though apathetic patients had worse post-stroke functional outcome, they did not report losing quality of life or having worse health.",

      "abstract": "Bulimia (bulimia nervosa; binge eating) is characterized by episodic eating of large amounts of food, followed by self-induced vomiting or laxative abuse. Psychotherapy has been the mainstay of treatment and often has been unsuccessful. The similarity of bulimia to major depression has led to evaluation of antidepressant drugs for treatment of the disease. Imipramine has proven effective in reducing binging episodes, and further evaluation of antidepressants seems warranted. Phenytoin also has been effective in some cases, suggesting that bulimia may be a neurologic disorder analogous to epilepsy. Optimal treatment may be antidepressants combined with a nutrition/psychotherapy program.",

      "title": "Human psychopharmacology of Ecstasy (MDMA): a review of 15 years of empirical research",
      "abstract": "Abstract MDMA (3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine) or ‘Ecstasy’ was scheduled as an illegal drug in 1986, but since then its recreational use has increased dramatically. This review covers 15 years of research into patterns of use, its acute psychological and physiological effects, and the long‐term consequences of repeated use. MDMA is an indirect monoaminergic agonist, stimulating the release and inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin (5‐HT) and, to a lesser extent, other neurotransmitters. Single doses of MDMA have been administered to human volunteers in double‐blind placebo‐controlled trials, although most findings are based upon recreational MDMA users. The ‘massive’ boost in neurotransmitter activity can generate intense feelings of elation and pleasure, also hyperactivity and hyperthermia. This psychophysiological arousal may be exacerbated by high ambient temperatures, overcrowding, prolonged dancing and other stimulant drugs. Occasionally the ‘serotonin syndrome’ reactions may prove fatal. In the days after Ecstasy use, around 80% of users report rebound depression and lethargy, due probably to monoaminergic depletion. Dosage escalation and chronic pharmacodynamic tolerance typically occur in regular users. Repeated doses of MDMA cause serotonergic neurotoxicity in laboratory animals, and there is extensive evidence for long‐term neuropsychopharmacological damage in humans. Abstinent regular Ecstasy users often display reduced levels of 5‐HT, 5‐HIAA, tryptophan hydroxylase and serotonin transporter density; functional deficits in learning/memory, higher cognitive processing, sleep, appetite and psychiatric well‐being, and, most paradoxically, ‘loss of sexual interest/pleasure’. These psychobiological deficits are greatest in heavy Ecstasy users and may reflect serotonergic axonal loss in the higher brain regions, especially the frontal lobes, temporal lobes and hippocampus. These problems seem to remain long after the recreational use of Ecstasy has ceased, suggesting that the neuropharmacological damage may be permament. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

The symptoms that are reported following the withdrawal of these drugs can be classified into 8 groups: influenza-like symptoms, psychic symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep disorders, equilibrium disorders, sensory disturbances, extrapyramidal symptoms and other symptoms. It is characteristic of these symptoms that they appear 1-4 days after reduction of the dose or the last administration of the drug. They may also appear in the infants of mothers who used an antidepressant during the last phase of the pregnancy. It is important that the patient be informed accurately and carefully at the start and termination of any treatment with an antidepressant. In order to prevent withdrawal symptoms, it is advisable to reduce the dosage slowly if possible when the treatment is to be terminated.",

      "abstract": "A 41-year-old woman is diagnosed with a major depression after a few weeks of having been operated of a stomach reduction (bariatric surgery). She goes into old antidepressant medication for a few weeks with an increasing worsening of her state, at the point she is sent to the emergency room with high irritability, intense agitation, suicide thoughts as the highlight symptoms of what we think to be a mixed episode of a bipolar disorder and how we orient the case during hospitalization. The patient follows both public and private psychiatric services and after discharge from acute hospitalization, still with residual depressions symptoms, her private psychiatrist substitutes the given treatment, including mood stabilizers, by only antidepressants. Two weeks after discharge from the hospital, the patient is relocated to our partial hospitalization resource. During her stay in our resource, we decide to keep the new treatment and diagnosis and increase the dosage of one of the antidepressants, which immediately yields to hypomania symptoms, at what we conclude that our patient is better treated as a bipolar type II with a mood stabilizer and low doses of an SRI. We find this to be an interesting case in the both psychopathological and psychophysiological point of view. To understand the case beyond clinical diagnosis, we discuss profoundly whether the bariatric surgery may have a role as a trigger.

Yet the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in the medical setting can be complicated by the symptoms of disease or the side effects of treatment. Somatic symptoms from cancer obfuscate the diagnosis of mood disorders and other psychiatric disorders. Valuable tools such as opioid analgesics, steroids, and anticholinergic medications may produce undesirable psychiatric side effects. Adverse effects (including delirium, mania, and depression) as well as milder effects (such as irritability, insomnia, and weight gain) may impair quality of life. One major challenge to psychiatric diagnosis presents itself during end-of-life care. In this case, it may be difficult to distinguish between primary psychiatric disorders and end-of-life distress. Psychosocial stressors, unrelated to disease or treatment, can occur and sometimes complicate management. Patients' reactions to recommended treatments may be related to other issues, such as grief, frustration, or need for control. As a result, the diagnosis of mood disorders may require input by mental health professionals.",

The reasons for IPED use are often hedonistic in nature and they are used in so-called \"cycles\" over several weeks. The most common side effects are: testicular atrophy, acne, hypersexuality, hypertension, gynecomastia, lipid metabolism disorders, mood swings, hair loss, and policythemia. Common consequences following IPED use are: decreased libido, oligo- or azoospermia, and erectile dysfunction. To reduce undesirable side effects and consequences, IPED users often take medications for self-treatment; occasionally IPED users also mention such medications and ask for them in the general medical practice.Zusammenfassung.

Die häufigsten Nebenwirkungen während einer IPED-Anwendung sind: Hodenschrumpfung, Akne, Hypersexualität, Bluthochdruck, Gynäkomastie, Lipidstoffwechselstörungen, Stimmungsschwankungen, Haarverlust und Polyglobulie. Häufige Folgen nach einer IPED-Anwendung sind: Reduktion der Libido, Oligo- oder Azoospermie und erektile Dysfunktion. Um unerwünschte Nebenwirkungen und Folgen von IPED zu reduzieren, werden oft Medikamente zur Selbstbehandlung eingenommen und gelegentlich auch in der allgemeinärztlichen Praxis angesprochen und nachgefragt.",

      "title": "LMNB1-Related Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics LMNB1-related autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a slowly progressive disorder of central nervous system white matter characterized by onset of autonomic dysfunction in the fourth to fifth decade, followed by pyramidal and cerebellar abnormalities resulting in spasticity, ataxia, and tremor. Autonomic dysfunction can include bladder dysfunction, constipation, postural hypotension, erectile dysfunction, and (less often) impaired sweating. Pyramidal signs are often more prominent in the lower extremities (e.g., spastic weakness, hypertonia, clonus, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and bilateral Babinski signs). Cerebellar signs typically appear at the same time as the pyramidal signs and include gait ataxia, dysdiadochokinesia, intention tremor, dysmetria, and nystagmus. Many individuals have sensory deficits starting in the lower limbs. Pseudobulbar palsy with dysarthria, dysphagia, and forced crying and laughing may appear in the seventh or eighth decade. Although cognitive function is usually preserved or only mildly impaired early in the disease course, dementia and psychiatric manifestations can occur as late manifestations. Affected individuals may survive for decades after onset. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of LMNB1-related ADLD is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and MRI findings and either an LMNB1 duplication or (more rarely) a heterozygous deletion upstream of the LMNB1 promoter identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic. For autonomic dysfunction: Neurogenic bladder may require management of urinary retention and/or urgency and recurrent urinary tract infection. Constipation may require good hydration, increased dietary fiber, stool softeners, and/or laxatives. Orthostatic hypotension can be minimized by pharmacologic intervention, compression stockings, physical therapy, and increased dietary salt. Erectile dysfunction is treated medically. Impaired sweating is managed with cool environment and attention to fever during infection. Spasticity may be treated with medications and physical therapy. Ataxia can be managed with strategies to minimize falls and increase strength, and adaptive equipment such as walkers or wheelchairs. Feeding difficulties can be managed with speech therapy and appropriate feeding interventions to assure adequate nutrition while preventing aspiration pneumonia. Surveillance: Routine assessment of: weight, nutrition, and feeding; pulmonary status (re possible recurrent pneumonia); bladder and erectile function; psychosocial well-being; and medications/doses to avoid iatrogenic polypharmacy. At least yearly assessment: by a neurologist for disease manifestations and progression; and by a physiatrist, orthopedist, physical therapist, and occupational therapist to address orthopedic, equipment, and functional needs. Genetic counseling LMNB1-related ADLD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, all individuals diagnosed with LMNB1-related ADLD whose parents have undergone molecular genetic testing have the disorder as the result of a large LMNB1 duplication (or a deletion upstream of LMNB1) inherited from an affected parent. Each child of an individual with LMNB1-related ADLD has a 50% chance of inheriting the LMNB1 duplication (or deletion upstream of LMNB1). Once the causative pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for LMNB1-related ADLD are possible.",

      "title": "Postpolio syndrome: Clinical and epidemiological studies",
      "abstract": "Poliomyelitis anterior acuta (polio) is a viral disease with an asymptomatic or mild course in most of the affected patients. In a minority of the patients the virus invades the nervous system. When this results in muscle weakness the term paralytic poliomyelitis is used. Paralytic poliomyelitis has a characteristic course. Acute onset with subsequent muscle weakness is followed by a two-year period of recovery of muscle strength. When maximal recovery is reached, some patients are still left with residual paresis. Usually a period of relative stability of several decades follows, whereafter some patients may experience new neuromuscular complaints. When other causes of progressive neuromuscular symptoms have been excluded, this complex of symptoms is called syndrome. The complaints mainly concern new or increasing muscle weakness, decrease in muscle size, muscle cramps, muscle and joint pains, involuntary 'twitches' of muscles, fatigue, diminished stamina and increase of disabilities. This thesis focusses on several aspects of the postpolio syndrome that are still a matter of debate. We investigated: (1) the clinical features of the postpolio syndrome, i.e., the occurrence of the new neuromuscular complaints and the extent of progression of new muscle weakness; (2) the diagnostic means to distinguish postpolio patients from polio survivors with stable neuromuscular conditions; (3) the prevalence of new neuromuscular complaints resulting in an impaired function in Dutch polio survivors.",

      "abstract": "The scrutiny of this small group of patients, presenting a serious deterioration of insidious onset, reveals as outstanding factors the constitutional inadequacy of the individual patient and the unfavorable external factors which conditioned and frustrated him. Two of the patients developed pulmonary tuberculosis, but the clinical picture and course in these 2 patients were not markedly different from those of the other 7 patients. One may say that in this group the physical examination revealed no adequate cause for the onset of the deterioration. The clinical picture and course of the mental disorder in this group may be outlined as follows: The patient in adolescence or early adult life, without any adequate explanation in the way of physical illness or drastic change in the environment, begins to show a striking loss of sociability, initiative, interest and personal care. The course is as a rule steadily downwards, ending in a parasitic existence at a very low level. With the abeyance of the superior functions, with the loss of social response, of spontaneity, and of interest, there occur, perhaps as release phenomena, reactions of a lower neurological level—meaningless smiling and laughter, explosive outbursts of anger, occasional autoerotism, mannerisms and grimaces, automatic movements. Memory may be retained to a surprising extent; incoherence is frequently noted but the patient is uncommunicative. There is no special manifestation of basic urges, of underlying preoccupations, of repressed and dissociated factors. There seems to be a lack of vital energy associated with the egoistic as with the more complex social trends. The condition is one of defect rather than of conflict. In the comparative absence of tension, or turmoil, of compensatory strivings or phantasies, the clinical picture makes the impression of self-abandonment, of surrender, of acceptance of life at a lower automatic level. This surrender may be further evidence of the constitutional defect of vitality of the organism already indicated in childhood and made more manifest in face of the demands of the independent, mature, social life. The challenge of life to these underprivileged, poorly conditioned, and frustrated individuals is beyond their capacity. While others with somewhat different endowment react with hysterical or compulsive evasions, with affective slumps or sprees, with imaginative phantasies or regressive dramatisations, this group differently endowed reacts to the challenge with a simple surrender. If we continue to retain these patients within the hospitable group of schizophrenia, it may be legitimate to characterize their special type of reaction as schizophrenic \"surrender.\" In the further analysis of the conditions of this \"surrender\" the inadequacy or abiotrophy of component systems of the organism requires to be investigated and evaluated.",

Symptoms of encopresis frequently begin after an illness. They can also result from psychosocial stressors, inappropriate toilet training, or in conjunction with a behavior disorder. Enuresis is an elimination disorder characterized by the repeated voiding of urine in inappropriate places (e.g., bed, clothing, floor) at least twice per week for 3 consecutive months. Enuresis can be specified as one of three types: nocturnal only, diurnal only, or nocturnal and diurnal.",

The extrapyramidal symptoms include acute dyskinesias and dystonic reactions, tardive dyskinesia, Parkinsonism, akinesia, akathisia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Extrapyramidal symptoms are caused by dopamine blockade or depletion in the basal ganglia; this lack of dopamine often mimics idiopathic pathologies of the extrapyramidal system. Less recognized is that extrapyramidal symptoms are also associated with certain nonantipsychotic agents, including some antidepressants, lithium, various anticonvulsants, antiemetics and, rarely, oralcontraceptive agents. Extrapyramidal symptoms caused by these agents are indistinguishable from neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms. Clinicians must be able to recognize these side effects and be able to determine the antipsychotic-induced and nonantipsychotic causes of extrapyramidal symptoms.",

Antipsychotic polypharmacy (APP), defined as the use of 2 or more antipsychotics, is common in schizophrenia, with a global median rate of 19.6% (interquartile range, 12.9%-35.0%), although substantial variations exist between treatment settings, regions, populations, and prescribers. Reasons for APP are diverse and include trying to enhance antipsychotic efficacy or targeting different symptoms or symptom domains that are insufficiently addressed by antipsychotic monotherapy, including anxiety, insomnia, aggressive/impulsive behaviors, or negative symptoms. APP has also been associated with the desire to lower the dose and/or reduce side effects of the original antipsychotic, the process of ongoing or aborted cross-titration, combination of different antipsychotic formulations, and prescriber and/or patient/family preference.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND:A musical hallucination (MH) is a type of auditory hallucination, and is defined as hearing music, sounds, or songs in the absence of external auditory stimuli. There are several case reports of conventional doses of tri- or tetracyclic antidepressants inducing MHs, but no such report for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Here we report a case of a patient with MHs induced by conventional doses of paroxetine. CASE REPORT:The patient was a 22-year-old woman with panic disorder (PD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). On the 10th day of treatment with paroxetine 20 mg/d, olanzapine 5 mg/d, and lorazepam 1.5 mg/d, she developed MHs such as \"an opera song sung by a female singer.\" The MHs occurred several times a day, and once continued for 5 to 10 min. Because of a suspicion of paroxetine-induced MHs and poor clinical improvement, paroxetine was reduced and discontinued on the 31st day, whereas venlafaxine was started and increased to 75 mg/d. Two days after the discontinuation of paroxetine, the MHs disappeared and symptoms of PD and MDD were much improved. Several weeks later, in response to a negative life event, her symptoms of PD and MDD returned to the original levels, but MHs were not observed. CONCLUSIONS:The present report suggests that conventional doses of paroxetine can induce MHs, which are most likely ascribable to the anticholinergic effects of the drug. This adverse effect should be differentially diagnosed from psychotic symptoms arising from psychiatric disorders, especially MDD.",

Doses ranging from 0.2 to 2.0 mg divided into three intravenous injections over a few hours relieved long-standing symptoms to varying extents. These included clouded thinking, tiredness, muscular symptoms such as neck tension, cramps and shaking and the characteristic perceptual symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal, namely, pins and needles, burning skin, pain and subjective sensations of bodily distortion. Mood disorder, when present, also improved but the reduction in anxiety and depression may have reflected relief of physical symptoms. The onset of maximum response was sometimes delayed by as much as a day but was usually prompt. Side effects were reported to be either absent or typically described as lightheadedness or dizziness, lasted only a few minutes and were usually well tolerated. The benefits last between a few hours and several days despite flumazenil's otherwise short duration of action. However, symptoms did return to varying degrees in most cases, suggesting the need for repeated doses.",

When these symptoms are seen in a newborn infant, the physician should consider a diagnosis of withdrawal from maternal drugs. Narcotics reported to cause these symptoms in the neonate are heroin,1 methadone,2 meperidine,3 morphine, codeine,4 pentazocine,5,6 and propoxyphene.7 A glossary of drugs is provided in Fig. 2. The onset of symptoms may be present at birth or may begin within four days of delivery. In some instances, symptoms may not become obvious until 10 days of age. This depends upon the drug the infant was exposed to in utero and the pharmaco-kinetic excretion of the drug. Subacute symptoms of narcotic drug withdrawal may last for 4 to 6 months.8 Rosen and Pippenger9 have demonstrated that infants born to mothers maintained on methadone do not begin to manifest withdrawal symptoms until the plasma level is less than 0.06 µg/mL. In utero exposure to multiple drugs may cause a biphasic pattern of withdrawal symptomatology in the neonate.10 Polydrug abusers frequently use as many as two to five drugs in combination; these might include phenobarbital, diazepam, marijuana, pentazocine, tripelennamine, phencyclidine, and codeine.11 A physician who is unaware of a mother's drug ingestion may initially make an erroneous diagnosis of colic in the infant; therefore, a detailed maternal drug history should be obtained, including prescription and nonprescription drugs received, social habits of the parents, and whether the mother is breast-feeding.",

      "title": "Distinguishing subclinical (subthreshold) depression from the residual symptoms of major depression.",
      "abstract": "The terms ‘sub-clinical’ or ‘subthreshold’ are widely used in medicine to label individuals who are in the early stages of a disease process (e.g., cancer, hypertension, etc.) and to identify high-risk populations that need to be monitored or provided with specific preventative interventions or treatments. Because the pathophysiological changes that occur in the sub-clinical stages of a condition are similar to those that occur during the full-blown disease, sub-clinical states are usually considered prodromal versions of the disease under consideration.\r\n\r\nBased on this usage, subclinical or subthreshold depression should refer to an individual who has not previously met full criteria for major depression who currently experiences depressive symptoms that are not severe enough or persistent enough to merit a diagnosis of major depression. Using this concept, a recent two-year follow-up study found that subthreshold depression can predict the subsequent occurrence of depressive disorders (OR=6.23, 95% CI=3.31-11.74) or anxiety disorders (OR=3.47, 95% CI= 1.78-6.78).[1]\r\n\r\nUnlike other medical disciplines, in clinical psychiatry the sub-clinical and subthreshold labels are also used to describe residual clinical states after the partial remission of a full episode of a condition. For example, ‘sub-clinical depression’ is often used to describe the clinical state of a patient who has not entered full remission and still has residual symptoms after treatment with antidepressants.[2],[3] I believe it important to distinguish these two situations. Prodromal depressive symptoms prior to the onset of a full-criteria major depression and the residual depressive symptoms after the partial resolution of a major depressive episode may be symptomatically similar but they are clinically distinct conditions that require different interventions so it is inappropriate to combine them under a single label. Residuals symptoms following a major depressive illness require continued pharmacological and/or psychotherapeutic treatment but sub-clinical depressive symptoms prior to the first occurrence of a major depressive illness usually only require observation and follow-up. More active treatment for sub-clinical depressive symptoms is usually only justified if they persist for two years or longer (in which case the diagnosis of Dysthymic Disorder is usually applied) or if the individual has had full-criteria major depressive illness in the past and thus is at a high risk of progressing to a full-criteria episode of illness.\r\n\r\nCollapsing these different situations under a single rubric is both inaccurate and could potentially lead to inappropriate treatment. I recommend that persistent depressive symptoms following a major depressive illness that do not meet the full criteria of the disorder be labeled ‘residual symptoms’ (not sub-clinical or subthreshold symptoms) and that the ‘sub-clinical depression’ or ‘subthreshold depression’ labels be limited to depressive symptoms that occur prior to the first onset of a full depressive episode. But depressive affect is part of the normal human condition so we must also avoid the inappropriate overuse of the sub-clinical and subthreshold labels by, for example, labeling the depressive symptoms identified in screening programs of healthy community members as ‘subthreshold depression’. Depressive symptoms in individuals without prior episodes of full-criteria depressive illness should only be given the sub-clinical or subthreshold labels if the symptoms are ‘clinically significant’, that is, when they result in significant distress or significant social or occupational dysfunction.",

Over-the-counter medications, the first line of defense, have little impact on sleep beyond placebo effects. Ironically, antihistamines in them can increase daytime drowsiness and may enhance the person's belief that sleep is getting worse. When these drugs fail, the chronic sufferer often turns to the physician, who is expected to be ready with medically proved answers. Twenty-seven million prescriptions were written for hypnotics in 1976. Barbiturates, accounting for 20% of these prescriptions, lead to a predictable cycle of dependence, tolerance, and escalating doses. These medications also disrupt the sleep structure. Rapid eye movement (REM) and slow-wave sleep (stages 3 and 4) are suppressed, and the EEG shows increased β activity. Physical and psychological dependence, withdrawal reactions, and \"REM rebound\" reactions (severe nightmares and sleep more disturbed than before taking medication) often accompany attempts to stop using these drugs.",

These phenomena can occur shortly after patients have started to take antipsychotics, for some time or even for a long time after. Patients who choke frequently or take rapid, irregular breaths interspersed with groans or sighs need to be observed closely. Risk factors are high doses of and long-term use of antipsychotics. Clinical examination of the gag reflex and the respiration contributes very little to an unequivocal diagnosis of swallowing disorders. However, swallowing disorders can be identified reliably by means of videofluoroscopy.

Resuscitative or critical stageThe psychological characteristics of this stage include stressors of the intensive care environment, uncertainty about outcome, and a struggle for survival.The intensive care environment can be both overstimulating and understimulating with the monotony of lying in a hospital bed for weeks.Cognitive changes such as extreme drowsiness, confusion, and disorientation are common during this phase.More severe cognitive changes such as delirium and brief psychotic reactions also occur, usually as a result of infections, alcohol withdrawal, metabolic complications, or high doses of drugs.Patients may also be intubated, which greatly limits direct communication. TreatmentIn depth psychological intervention is of minimal value at this phase, since physical survival is the primary goal.Patients should be encouraged to cope with the frighteningly unusual circumstances of the intensive care unit through whatever defences are available to them, even primitive strategies such as denial and repression.Supportive psychological interventions should focus on immediate concerns, such as sleep, pain control, and protecting patients' coping strategies.Non{pharmacological approaches to pain control, such as hypnosis and relaxation, can be effective.Medical staff can also effectively intervene during this early stage of recovery by working with a patient's family members.Family members may be anxious and distressed while observing the patient undergo treatment, which fosters the same response in the patient.It is important to help family members understand this effect and help them to convey a sense of hope and calmness to the patient.",

There is evidence that, in some ADD/ADHD children, there might be decreased levels of metabolism of catecholamine, brain chemicals related to adrenalin (epinephrine) and noradrenalin (norepinephrine) (Lubar, hand-out). Because of this, stimulant medications are often effective treatments for these children, especially in reducing hyperactivity. Children on the medication often show improved attentiveness and decreased impulsivity. However, a significant problem with the pharmacological treatment of ADD children is the statedependent and shortlived effects. For example, the frequently prescribed medication Ritalin (Methylphenidate) lasts only for 3 or 4 hours in the nervous system. As soon as the medication wears off, full blown symptoms of ADD and ADHD appear (Lubar, hand-out). Furthermore, Ritalin has numerous undesirable side-effects such as insomnia, loss of appetite, inhibited growth, and depression.",

Subclinical hepatic encephalopathy may manifest only on neuropsychological testing, with minimal slowing of mental processes and mild cognitive impairment. Moderately severe hepatic encephalopathy is associated with lethargy, apathy, and subtle changes in personality. This chapter presents the possible mental signs and symptoms, possible physical signs and symptoms, and clinical course and prognosis. It also describes the case of a 69-year-old patient who displayed the symptoms of chronic hepatic encephalopathy along with an unusual, delusional misidentification syndrome. When very mild hepatic encephalopathy is suspected, neuropsychological testing maybe extremely useful. Patients who are at risk for hepatic encephalopathy include: those with hepatitis (especially hepatitis C), individuals who have abused alcohol, have malignancies spread to the liver, toxic exposure, toxic drug reactions, or chronic liver disease of any other kind (Wilson's disease).",

      "abstract": "Fluctuations in the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), such as wearing-off and on–off effects, and dyskinesias are related to a variety of factors, including duration and dosage of levodopa, age at onset, stress, sleep, food intake, and other pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms. The majority of patients, particularly those with young onset of PD, experience these levodopa-related adverse effects after a few years of treatment. Assessment of these motor complications is difficult because of the marked clinical variability between and within patients. Daily diaries have been used in clinical trials designed to assess the effects of various pharmacological and surgical interventions on motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. The most common type of dyskinesia, called \"peak-dose dyskinesia\", usually consists of stereotypical choreic or ballistic movements involving the head, trunk, and limbs, and occasionally, the respiratory muscles, whereas tremor and punding are less-common complications. Dystonia is also typically seen in patients with diphasic dyskinesia and wearing-off effect. Recognition of the full spectrum of clinical phenomenology of levodopa-related motor complications is essential for their treatment and prevention. © 2005 Movement Disorder Society",

Most patients start levodopa within four years of the onset of disease, earlier in the akineto-rigid patients (average delay of 2.1 years) than in those where resting tremor predominates (average delay of 3.4 years). Advanced age (&gt;80) is no deterrent to the use of levodopa if required. Wearing off is most noticeable in Stage 3 or after 10 years of therapy with levodopa. An inverse correlation was found between age and wearing off, suggesting a marked sensitivity of younger patients to levodopa. Future studies on the use of dopamine agonists should thus be stratified according to age.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Individuals suffering from drug addiction may also manifest features of bipolar spectrum disorders. Hyperthymic and cyclothymic temperaments may render individuals vulnerable to later development of substance abuse. Bipolar disorders themselves may be altered or precipitated by substance use, most notably by stimulants (amphetamines), alcohol, and cannabinoids.The clinical usefulness of mood stabilizers, particularly antiepileptics, has been established as safe and effective in substance abusers with and without comorbid mood disorders. Most studies on this issue have been of short duration and focused on the resolution of a currently manifest period of illness. Few studies have been conducted on the usefulness of these drugs on the long-term longitudinal course of these diseases, such as frequently encountered recurrent relapses into states of agitation, impulsivity, and/or dissatisfaction. As opposed to the clinical experience with traditional antidepressants and neuroleptics, antiepileptics do not induce counter-polar states (depressed patients abruptly turning manic or hypomanic; nor patients currently hypomanic or manic turning abruptly depressed). Many clinicians consider antiepileptic mood stabilizers to be the preferred category of medications for the treatment of such patients. Valproate appears to be a potentially fruitful medication to study in these dual diagnosis patients due to preliminary evidence demonstrating its anticraving efficacy.",

      "abstract": "Many headache patients present when medications fail, are inadequate, are contraindicated, or are not tolerated. These are patients with severe disability. Most have daily headaches, including chronic migraine, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, or other primary headaches. This brief review addresses, in broad strokes, some thoughts about alternatives beyond the usual daily oral preventive therapies. Do not proceed to more invasive or elaborate approaches until the big 3 are done: diagnosis is established, onabotulinumtoxinA administered when appropriate, that is, if the patient has chronic migraine, and wean is accomplished if the patient has medication overuse headache. Large numbers of patients are helped without the need for more arcane and unproven treatments by following these initial approaches. Simple nerve blocks can be useful in the initial steps, but more invasive blocks and stimulators are not recommended until the big 3 are completed. Wean of overused medications must be absolute and may require an intravenous bridge over several days, either in an infusion unit or inpatient in a medical model. Wean should be accompanied by establishing onabotulinumtoxinA or daily prevention from the beginning. Consider referral to a structured multidisciplinary headache program. This is for patients who require an interdisciplinary approach and may be day-hospital or inpatient. Invasive blocks and stimulators may be appropriate, and the latter are currently being studied in controlled studies. The most promise, with the best balance of efficacy vs adverse event prospects, may be occipital nerve stimulators or sphenopalatine ganglion stimulators.© 2012 American Headache Society.

Review of the literature disclosed a paucity of previous reports of hiccup, but many reports of myoclonus after opiate administration. A wide variety of opiates and routes of administration have been implicated, but high doses and the presence of other agents (antipsychotics, antiemetics, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, antidepressants) may pose special risks. Review of the literature suggests three types of opiate- related myoclonus. Opiate-induced myoclonus (OIM) is often generalized and is either periodic or associated with rigidity. Opiate-induced myoclonus frequently occurs in the context of underlying medical conditions, D2 antagonist coadministration, or other drugs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, antidepressants), and usually responds to either naloxone or benzodiazepines. Intrathecal OIM has not been linked to D2 antagonist coadministration or benzodiazepine responsiveness but may be associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents. Opiate withdrawal myoclonus may be stimulus- sensitive, associated with D2 antagonist coadministration, and responsive to benzodiazepines and unresponsive to naloxone. There are several problems in interpreting the literature, and more study is needed. Opiatergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic, and other mechanisms are considered.",

Additional literature was obtained from relevant books and monographs.The mean elimination half-life for methamphetamine is approximately 10 hours, with considerable inter-individual variability in pharmacokinetics. Direct effects at low-to-moderate methamphetamine doses (5-30 mg) include arousal, positive mood, cardiac stimulation and acute improvement in cognitive domains such as attention and psychomotor coordination. At higher doses used typically by illicit users (> or =50 mg), methamphetamine can produce psychosis. Its hypertensive effect can produce a number of acute and chronic cardiovascular complications. Repeated use may induce neurotoxicity, associated with prolonged psychiatric symptoms, cognitive impairment and an increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease.

Traditionally and quite soundly it is considered that FD concerns group of psychosomatic diseases, however in its pathogenesis the big role is taken away to local motor disturbances (an antroduodenal dyscoordination owing to a disbalance of intestinal neuromediators and gastrointestinal hormones), and also to behavior factors (an alimentary stereotype, alcohol and a tobacco smoking) and to a chronic lesion of intramural nervous plexuses of a digestive tube by toxins of a pathological intestinal microflora. FD considerably reduces quality of life of patients that demands its timely revealing and treatment.",

Case report: We report a case of the 35 years old man who presented seven months period of irritability, occasional low mood, and sleep disturbances without the concurrent hallucinations or delusions. The patient had a history of nephrotic syndrome and for this reason, required prednisolone. The corticosteroid induced irritability that has appeared three months after the treatment has started. The psychiatric examination showed neither the psychomotor retardation, manic or depressed mood, nor hallucinations and delusions. However, the level of irritability was undoubtedly increased. Conclusions: Corticosteroids are drugs commonly used in many systemic diseases. During a psychiatric examination, a careful evaluation is necessary to distinguish the side effects of corticosteroids from the primary psychiatric disorders.",

When the dystonic complaints did not improve, botulinum toxin was applied and recovery was achieved. In most cases, botulinum toxin can provide a dramatic improvement in the treatment of tardive dystonia, which is very difficult to treat and causes significant loss of functionality and poor quality of life.

Steroids were then withdrawn, and the patient resumed his premorbid personality, but had amnesia for much of his previous behavior.

For decades lithium was the only effective medication available for this purpose. However, not all patients responded to lithium, particularly those with a rapid cycling course of illness (four or more affective episodes per year) or mixed states (meeting criteria for depressive and manic states simultaneously). Over the last 15 years or so, fortunately, many new medications have emerged to greatly expand therapeutic options for our patients. Anticonvulsants such as valproate, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine have all received FDA approvals for treatment of bipolar mood states. This article summarizes the roles that lithium and several anticonvulsants play in the current treatment of mood disorders, with attention to their mechanism of action, indications, dosing, and side effects.",

Neurologic adverse reactions to nefopam are confusion, hallucinations, delirium and convulsions. There are several reports about fatal convulsive seizures, presumably related to nefopam. A 71-year-old man was admitted for surgery for a lumbar spinal stenosis. He was administered intravenous analgesics : ketorolac, tramadol, orphenadrine citrate and nefopam HCl. His back pain was so severe that he hardly slept for several days; he even needed morphine and pethidine. At 4 days of administration of intravenous analgesics, the patient suddenly started generalized tonic-clonic seizures for 15 seconds, and subsequently, status epilepticus; these were not responsive to phenytoin and midazolam. After 3 days of barbiturate coma therapy the seizures were controlled. Convulsive seizures related to nefopam appear as focal, generalized, myoclonic types, or status epilepticus, and are not dose-related manifestations. In our case, the possibility of convulsions caused by other drugs or the misuse of drugs was considered. However, we first identified the introduced drugs and excluded the possibility of an accidental misuse of other drugs. Physicians should be aware of the possible occurrence of unpredictable and serious convulsions when using nefopam.",

      "abstract": "A recently proposed diagnostic class, psychotic trigger reaction, is deduced from careful clinical studies of eight white men, who upon a very specific trigger stimulus committed murder or attempted to (and in one case also rape). The new class is defined as a sudden ego-alien, motiveless (at least with respect to aggression), motor-wise well organized, violent complex action without emotional concomitants. The action is evoked (not provoked) by an individually unique stimulus within a specific context reviving repeated past traumatic experience. Typically there is no (significant) loss of consciousness and practically full recall. Observed are first-time hallucinations (visual, auditory, tactile, somesthetic, but not olfactory as in temporal lobe epilepsy) and signs of imbalance in the autonomic nervous system (loss of bladder control, ejaculation, profuse sweating, nausea). Only four of these men had previous psychiatric diagnoses (and then various ones) or abnormal EEGs at some time in their lives. Variety in prior diagnoses would be consistent with a seizure-like disorder, here specifically implicating an imbalance in functioning between limbic and frontal lobe systems. Clinical tests for the latter were prevailingly indicative of dysfunctioning. A detailed clinical analysis of the violent acts within their context suggests behaviors are analogous to certain limbic system mechanisms, especially the kindling phenomenon.",

Psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, psychosis, eating disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorders are associated with the direct intoxicating effects of acute and chronic substance misuse and withdrawal syndromes, often within an inhospitable social environment. There is an increased risk of traumatic injury resulting in hospitalization among substance users. An awareness of and a high index of suspicion about drug use must pervade all aspects of practice, especially assessment. Pharmacotherapy is available for opiates, alcohol and nicotine. Substance users are heterogeneous, no single approach is universally effective, and evaluation of treatment outcome should be multidimensional.",

Athletes suffering from NFOR/overtraining syndrome (OTS) might not present with 'textbook symptoms'; instead, they could be asymptomatic, display a myriad of individualised symptoms or exhibit normal symptoms of acute fatigue. The protocol involves two graded exercise tests to exhaustion with a 4-h rest between bouts and involves measures of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and prolactin (PRL), measured at four time points: baseline, immediately after completion of the first test, prior to the second test and immediately after the second test. An important feature of NFOR/OTS is the inability to sustain exercise performance, and several studies have indicated NFOR using simulated or sport-specific performance testing such as incremental testing, time to exhaustion and competition performance. Disturbances in mood state are often reported in athletes suffering OTS and appear to be sensitive to periods of intensified training in both endurance and strength sports.",

The patient had no history of psychiatric pathologies or any other eating disorder, but he did not rest adequately at night, was overweight and had a family and personal history of other sleep disorders.

Reappearance of seizures may be due to lack of protection and/or an abstinence syndrome. Seizures due to lack of protection occur following withdrawal of any antiepileptic drug when the epilepsy is not cured; they may not reappear for years (although over 80% occur within a year) and treatment then has to be restarted. They seem to be less frequent after withdrawal of carbamazepine or phenytoin than after withdrawing valproate, although the reason for this is not understood. Seizures due to an abstinence syndrome only occur after withdrawing benzodiazepines, phenobarbitone and primidone; they are seen in patients with both active and inactive epilepsy whilst the drug is being withdrawn and tend to be self-limiting. It is not necessary to reintroduce the drug when epilepsy is cured. Felbamate and vigabatrin cause seizures related to their withdrawal, but the mechanism of this is not clear. There is no scientifically established guideline for withdrawing antiepileptic drugs, but it is considered important to stop one at a time, starting with those which may cause abstinence syndromes, followed by the more toxic, less effective antiepileptic drugs, which cause more drug interactions and are more awkward to take.Further specific studies are necessary to establish the mechanisms of relapses and the scientific basis for withdrawal of antiepileptic drugs.",

      "title": "CONSISTENT PATTERNS IN SECONDARY HEALTH EFFECTS OF DISASTERS",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce a consistent pattern of death and injury. Primary causes are directly attributable to the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, direct trauma in earthquakes and tornados. Secondary causes vary less by event type as they are driven by common effects: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Primary and particularly secondary causes may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory ailments, diabetes, psychological disorders), rely on recurring procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease), or a combination; some conditions require regular oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. The link among all is the dependence on maintenance care, the disruption of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants (most commonly carbon monoxide). Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes include response to the primary event beyond effects of pre-existing conditions: disruption to lifelines and routine and extended effects (e.g., prolonged outages, seismic aftershocks, personal loss). Most secondary health effects of disasters are predictable and can be prevented or at least lessened by the combination of awareness and deliberate action by governments, institutions, support services, and individuals. In actual practice, secondary effects recur in most events and see limited preventive measures.",

      "abstract": "Some patients with psychotic features seem refractory to psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacological interventions after substance abuse related problems are excluded as an explanation.We present a patient who at the age of 20 developed several schizophreniform symptoms.Seizure like symptoms also developed during a stay in the acute ward.He was treated with several antipsychotics, but did not improve much after several referrals to the acute care unit.A lorazepam provocation test was performed.In the ensuing hours, his aggressiveness and nonsense speaking rapidly diminished.Kahlbaum's observation of seizures as part of a catatonia was not understood in this case.1The publication of the new DSM-V diagnosis of catatonia may hopefully reduce the probability of treating a patient for schizophrenia for years without access to a more targeted medication and subsequently electroconvulsive treatments.The case presents hope for some of the patient deemed refractory to conventional schizophrenia treatment schedules.",

      "abstract": "Hyponatremia is occasionally unmasked in psychiatric patients during hospitalization after routine blood and urinary tests, and correlates in most cases with an inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, mainly due to iatrogenic factors. Only a few studies have regarded the combination of psychotropic drugs as triggers of chronic, asymptomatic hyponatremia in bipolar patients, who require to be hospitalized because of the exacerbation of their mental illness. We presented three clinical cases of patients affected by a long-term psychiatric disorder and under polypharmacotherapy for several months. After excluding other potential factors, we hypothesized that pharmacological treatment with a mood stabilizer (oxcarbazepine) associated with a benzodiazepine (delorazepam), a second-generation antipsychotic (olanzapine) or an antidepressant (fluvoxamine), triggered severe hyponatremia ([Na+] ≤125 mEq/L), serum hypo-osmolarity, and elevated inappropriate urine osmolarity added to more diluted sodium concentration. When we discontinued the treatment, clinical conditions of our patients improved, despite the previous administration of hypertonic saline jointly with water restriction. Psychiatrists should consider that bipolar patients on long-term polypharmacotherapy may present a higher risk of severe hyponatremia not clinically detectable. Consequently, routine laboratory tests should be periodically repeated as they represent the only available tool to unmask such electrolyte imbalances.",

Characteristically, the headache is relieved when the patient lies down and becomes accentuated when the patient either sits or stands. In most cases the headache persists for several days, but occasionally it may last for as long as eight weeks. Various explanations have been given for the appearance of the headache, and various factors have been noted that will modify or prevent it.

Increased accessibility, hyperstimulating marketing techniques, a loss of the protective delay between impulse and purchase, and overvaluing of the shopping process and objects purchased may all contribute to the potentially addictive nature of shopping.",

Furthermore, in laboratory studies pramipexole has proved to exert neuroprotector effects and its use in clinical practice from the early stages of the disease has been related to a delay in the appearance of motor complications (fluctuations and dyskinesias). It has recently been shown that it is especially valuable in the treatment of tremors and is also effective in improving certain non-motor symptoms such as depression. Pramipexole is free of the severe side effects (fibrosis and valve disease) linked with ergotic dopaminergic agonists and causes fewer digestive and dysautonomic alterations. Other undesirable side effects of treatment with non-ergotic agonists, such as hallucinations, the appearance of oedemas and drowsiness, can be minimised by carefully selecting the patients. Further studies need to be conducted to help define the long-term effects of dopaminergic agonists on the progress of the disease and also to show the differences between non-ergotic agonists in clinical practice.",

      "title": "Risk, Disorder and Diagnosis",
      "abstract": "develop schizophrenia and is generally not longer than a few years, with an average duration of about one year [7]. Thus it has been seen as a legitimate target for detection and intervention, with the aim of prevention of onset, or at least amelioration or delay of onset [8]. This is the background to the ‘ prodromal intervention ’ fi eld. However, even apparent prodromal symptoms lack specifi city. Characteristic prodromal features include sleep disturbance, irritability, lowered mood, anxiety and decline in school or work performance [7,9]. This clinical picture could be the result of a number of conditions, such as major depression, substance abuse and physical illness, as well as a psychotic prodrome. Even attenuated or isolated psychotic symptoms may not necessarily progress to a frank psychotic disorder, as these are now known to be quite common in the general population [10 – 14]. There are two implications of this lack of specifi city. First, is the recognition that a prodrome cannot be diagnosed as such prospectively, and that the terms ‘ prodrome ’ and ‘ prodromal ’ should not be used to refer to this clinical picture or those apparently presenting with it. This is more than pure semantics. Adoption of the term ‘ prodromal ’ to refer to individuals implies that they are on the path to schizophrenia. It suggests that the ‘ process ’ has already begun. Instead, as McGorry [15] has pointed out, terminology such as ‘ at risk mental state ’ should be used, to highlight that a person presenting with apparent prodromal symptoms may be at increased risk of onset of psychotic disorder within a brief time frame (1 – 2 years), but that onset is not inevitable. The second implication is that there needs to be some narrowing of the defi nition of ‘ at risk ’ so that those so identifi ed truly have a high likelihood of onset of fi rst episode psychosis within a brief period of time. One strategy to achieve this aim has been the development of the ultra high risk (UHR) criteria. These have been described elsewhere [8,16,17]. Essentially, there are three groups identifi ed: (i) attenuated psychotic symptoms",

      "title": "Alcohol Withdrawal: Development of a Standing Order Set",
      "abstract": "Patients in alcohol withdrawal may need less medication for less time with the use of a symptom-based standing order set.Management of alcohol withdrawal in acutely ill hospitalized patients with a critical illness is challenging for pharmacists, nurses, and practicing physicians. Alcohol withdrawal is often a diagnosis considered in patients admitted with trauma; however, it can be confused with other conditions in the list of differential diagnoses of patients admitted with nontrauma diagnoses.1–3 Investigators estimate that up to 1 in 4 patients admitted to general hospitals meet diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence.4Alcohol-dependent patients have a risk of withdrawal, with symptoms including altered concentration, tremulousness, autonomic hyperarousal, psychosis, seizures, and delirium tremens.5 Alcohol withdrawal delirium, commonly known as delirium tremens or “DTs,” is the most serious manifestation of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) and is characterized by hallucinations, disorientation, tachycardia, hypertension, low-grade fever, agitation, and diaphoresis. Delirium tremens or seizures develop in up to 20% of hospitalized patients who experience AWS if the symptoms of withdrawal are not treated.6 Given the seriousness of alcohol withdrawal delirium and the value of appropriate treatment, a symptom-based alcohol withdrawal protocol was developed for use in the critical care and medical wards of a community teaching hospital. This article presents the results of the development of an evidence-based standing order set for alcohol withdrawal.AWS occurs when a person who has become dependent on alcohol stops drinking the amount that he/she has been accustomed to drinking. The autonomic nervous system becomes hyperactive, releasing catecholamines, which lead to physiological changes such as diaphoresis, insomnia, tachycardia, anxiety, and tremors. The complex mechanisms of alcohol intoxication, tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal are not completely understood, but a clear relationship exists between alcohol and alterations in neurotransmission in the brain.The brain functions by maintaining a balance of neurochemicals through inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters. The major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain is γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which works through the GABAA receptor complex. The GABAA receptor complex regulates the passage of chlorine ions into cells. GABA binds to GABAA receptors, a family of chloride ion channels, changing their formation so as to allow chloride ions to pass down an electrochemical gradient. This movement of chloride ions hyperpolarizes the membrane, which leads to neuronal inhibition.7 Alcohol passes inhibitory effects on the GABAA receptors, causing a down-regulation or a decrease in the number of GABAA receptors. This down-regulation is responsible for insufficient central inhibition during alcohol withdrawal, leading to symptoms of hyperexcitability.8A second neurotransmitter of importance in alcohol withdrawal is the excitatory neurotransmitter N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA). NMDA controls excitability by increasing depolarization of the neuronal membrane through the regulation of the flow of calcium into the neuron. The influx of calcium through voltage-gated calcium channels modulates neurotransmitter release and the expression of genes that regulate the production of NMDA and GABA receptor proteins. The continued presence of alcohol increases the calcium channel expression and contributes to alcohol tolerance and AWS.9 Alcohol inhibits the NMDA receptor, which causes a hyperexcitable state and altered anxietylike behavior.10 Abrupt cessation in the intake of alcohol or withdrawal produces a rebound stimulatory effect, resulting in adrenergic hypersensitivity of the limbic system and brain stem, which can lead to irritability (manifested as aggressive behavior), tremors, and seizures. Abrupt cessation of alcohol exposure results in brain excitability because receptors previously inhibited by alcohol are no longer inhibited.1,9 The mortality rate has been found to be in the range of 5% to 15%,11 with an early study12 showing mortality rates from alcohol withdrawal delirium to be as high as 20%. With advances in treatment, mortality rates have decreased drastically, with more recent studies indicating mortality rates in the range of 1%.13–15The symptoms of AWS can include visual, auditory, and/or tactile hallucinations. Severe symptoms include seizures and delirium tremens, disturbances of consciousness, and change in cognition. Often medical and surgical comorbid conditions mask withdrawal symptoms, which can result in inadequate treatment. Such comorbid conditions include dehydration, infection, respiratory disease, thyrotoxicosis, anticholinergic drug poisoning, amphetamine or cocaine use, hemorrhage, and withdrawal from sedative-hypnotic agents.1,4,16The signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal may be confused with other problems common in critical care patients such as electrolyte imbalances, pain, and infection.3 Delirium tremens typically begin between 2 and 4 days after the last drink and last less than a week.13Treatment of alcohol withdrawal begins with appropriate assessment of the patient for signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal delirium. Patients experiencing serious withdrawal symptoms, seizures, and delirium tremens should receive pharmacotherapy to treat their symptoms.13,17 Benzodiazepines are the drugs of choice for the management of alcohol withdrawal.9,18 Benzodiazepines not only ameliorate the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal but prevent seizures and delirium tremens.Different benzodiazepines all appear similarly effective in reducing signs and symptoms of withdrawal.6,18 However, some evidence indicates that longer acting agents may be more effective in preventing seizures. Pharmacological data and clinical experience suggest that longer acting agents can pose a risk of excess sedation in selected groups, including elderly persons and persons with marked liver disease. Longer acting agents, however, contribute to an overall smoother withdrawal course with less breakthrough or rebound symptoms.1,6 Some of the most commonly used benzodiazepines are diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and lorazepam.6,18,19 A literature review suggested that symptom-based treatment was more beneficial than scheduled dosing.6,18,19 However, few controlled studies of treatment exist, and even fewer treatments have been developed and tested in acutely ill patients.4 The literature supports a need to identify and treat alcohol withdrawal early.3,19 Therefore a need was identified in our institution to develop an evidence-based standing order set for alcohol withdrawal.A multidisciplinary committee, including nurses, pharmacists, physicians, and dieticians, was formed to develop a standing order set that could be used to identify and treat alcohol withdrawal in both patients who are critically ill and patients who are not. Furthermore, we wanted to determine if symptom-based treatment was more effective than dose-scheduled treatment of alcohol withdrawal. A critical care nurse and clinical pharmacist were given the task of researching the literature and developing an evidence-based standing order set that could be used for both patients who are critically ill and patients who are not.Both scheduled dosing and symptom-based treatment use benzodiazepines for treatment of alcohol withdrawal. Studies6,16,18,20 have shown that symptom-based treatment requires less benzodiazepine use. These studies suggest that symptom-triggered therapy allows more flexibility in dosing with fluctuations in scores on the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, revised (CIWA-Ar) and level of sedation, which results in less medication being required. Lower doses of benzodiazepine decreased the chance for adverse effects, oversedation, and respiratory depression.6 Less medication also lowers the cost for treatment of alcohol withdrawal.6,16,18,20Benzodiazepines possess better efficacy, a greater margin of safety, and lower abuse potential compared with barbiturates.21 Long-acting benzodiazepines, such as chlordiazepoxide, are used for alcohol withdrawal because they have the advantage of self-tapering after stabilization. The medication is administered in decreasing doses and/or frequency until no medication is taken.9 It was also suggested that an intermediate-acting benzodiazepine should be used to supplement treatment with a long-acting medication.6,18Diazepam and chlordiazepoxide are the long-acting drugs of choice, and lorazepam and oxazepam are the intermediate-acting drugs of choice typically used to treat AWS.6,17 Carbamazepine was evaluated, but evidence that it prevented seizures and delirium was insufficient. Haloperidol was not recommended because it lowered the seizure threshold and prolonged the QT interval.1,20 Oral chlordiazepoxide and/or intravenous lorazepam were chosen as the drugs to be incorporated into the standing order set.1,6,15,17 Lorazepam was chosen because it has no active metabolites and has multiple dosing routes.In addition to the use of lorazepam and chlordiazepoxide, the standing order set included the use of antiemetics and vitamins. Vitamin deficiency is often seen in patients with alcoholism. Patients who abuse alcohol are more likely to have poor nutrition due to poor diet and/or impaired absorption of nutrients, especially the B vitamins. Folic acid is important in formation of red blood cells and protein metabolism. Wernicke syndrome (characterized by cognitive impairment, delirium, abnormal gait, and paralysis of eye muscles) and Korsakoff syndrome are both caused by thiamine deficiency. Thiamin is also needed for the metabolism of glucose.9,16 As a result, thiamine, folic acid, and multivitamins were included in the standing order set.Treatment of alcohol withdrawal includes fluid replacement, correcting electrolyte imbalances, treating acute infections, and treating fevers.1,13,16 Patients with AWS experience electrolyte imbalances in potassium, magnesium, and phosphate due to changes in renal function, altered absorption/reabsorption, poor dietary intake, and vomiting. Alcohol also induces a diuretic effect that leads to dehydration. If the patient’s glycogen stores are low, such as in chronic alcohol abuse, the intake of high doses of alcohol can induce hypoglycemia by decreasing hepatic glyconeogenesis.9,22 These patients are also at a higher risk of infection, particularly pulmonary infection, because alcohol causes a change in the immune system and often causes a dysfunction of protective barriers in the respiratory tract.23 These patients also experience nausea, vomiting, and headaches among other complaints.24 Therefore, the ability to order laboratory studies and treat these complaints was included in the order set.The order set was formatted to follow a symptom-based method, with the intent to decrease the amount of drug used and time required to treat alcohol withdrawal (Figure 1). In symptom-based treatment, medications are administered in response to the development of symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. In scheduled-dose treatment, medications are administered at scheduled times. The format followed similar symptom-based approaches found in the literature.4,20,25In order to use the order set, consistent symptom-based assessment of the patient was needed. To do this, the CIWA-Ar was included as part of the order set. The CIWA-Ar is used to assess patients to determine the need to treat alcohol withdrawal.26 The CIWA-Ar is a 10-item, easily administered scale. The scale consists of 10 signs and symptoms: nausea and vomiting, tremor, paroxysmal sweats, anxiety, agitation, tactile disturbances, auditory disturbances, visual disturbances, headache, and orientation. Patients are asked a question or evaluated on each sign and symptom. Each sign and symptom is evaluated on a 7-point Likert scale except for orientation, which is scored on a 4-point Likert scale. Scores on the CIWA-Ar range from 0 to 67. A score of 8 points or less indicates mild withdrawal. A score of 9 to 15 points indicates moderate withdrawal. A score greater than 15 points indicates severe withdrawal.The CIWA-Ar has been used by several authors to assess alcohol withdrawal in patients.1,5,6,17,18,25 The CIWA-Ar was examined for validity and reliability. Scores on the revised scale were regressed on the original CIWA-A. Beta was .99 and R2 was 0.98.26 The scale should be used 1 to 3 times daily, more frequently when patients are symptomatic and as frequently as hourly when making decisions about medication dosing on the basis of symptoms.6 The CIWA-Ar provides clinicians with an appropriate scale for dosing medications, evaluating effectiveness of therapy, and evaluating the severity of withdrawal more objectively.6,24The preliminary order set was then presented to the multidisciplinary committee, where there was discussion and minor changes were made. The order set was then presented to the institutional review board of the hospital, the pharmacy and therapeutics committee, and the medical council for approval. The multidisciplinary committee then recommended a performance improvement project be conducted on both a critical care unit and a non–critical care unit. The units selected were the trauma intensive care unit (ICU) and the step-down medical/surgical trauma unit. The step-down medical/surgical trauma unit was selected because most patients in the ICU are transferred to that unit.At this point, training of the nursing and pharmacy staff began. The ICU nurse educator trained the ICU staff and the clinical nurse leader from the step-down unit on the implementation of the standing order set. This training was done by one-to-one education and the use of a poster board. The clinical nurse leader then conducted the education of the staff on the step-down unit. The in-service training was validated by a 5-item test given to the nursing staff to ensure that they understood the process and the documentation required. Staff members who did not achieve 100% were given further instruction. The pharmacist educated the pharmacy staff on the medications to be used from the standing order set. The pharmacy staff were not tested because they do not implement the standing order set.The project then began on the 2 identified units, the trauma ICU and the step-down medical/surgical trauma unit. Patients who had a history of alcohol abuse, were intoxicated on admission, or were thought to be going through delirium tremens as determined by physician assessment were identified on the 2 units. Once a physician’s order was received, nurses implemented the order set, which included the CIWA-Ar and guidelines for the administration of benzodiazepines. No benzodiazepines other than those on the order set were to be administered.For comparison, a retrospective chart review was conducted to identify patients treated for alcohol withdrawal before the order set was developed. The patients were identified from their current history provided by the patient or the patient’s family or from their blood alcohol level. The comparison group included only those patients receiving oral chlordiazepoxide and/or intravenous lorazepam because these were the drugs used in the standing order set.Data were collected for 18 months. Data on all patients included length of stay, demographics, days on medication with protocol, days on medication without protocol, amount of lorazepam administered, amount of chlordiazepoxide administered, reversal agent required, history of seizures, use of restraints, sitter present, other pertinent medications used, and blood alcohol level score.Patients in the critical care and non–critical care areas of the hospital were compared. The comparisons were further broken down to patients who used the order set (symptom-based treatment) versus patients who did not use the order set (scheduled-dose treatment).A total of 31 patients were in the symptom-based group, which used the order set: 14 patients (45%) in the non–critical care area and 17 patients (55%) in the critical care area. Other demographic data were similar. The mean age of the patients was 49 years (range, 24–62 years) in the non–critical care area and 51 years (range, 34–66 years) in the critical care area. The mean length of stay was 14.9 days in the noncritical care area and 14.0 days in the critical care area. The mean number of days that the standing order set was used was 3.0 days for the non–critical care patients and 2.7 days for the critical care patients.The amount of drug used varied between the critical care and noncritical care groups. The mean amount of lorazepam used for the non–critical care patients was 14.8 mg, with a range of 0 to 68 mg. The mean amount of lorazepam used for the critical care patients was 10.9 mg, with a range of 0 to 45 mg. The noncritical care patients used a mean of 164 mg of chlordiazepoxide, with a range of 0 to 850 mg. The critical care patients used a mean of 142 mg, with a range of 0 to 375 mg.No patients in either group used a reversal agent. Three patients in the critical care group and 2 patients in the non–critical care group required physical restraints. A sitter was used twice in the non–critical care group.Charts for 25 patients, 16 (64%) in the non–critical care area and 9 (36%) in the critical care area, who did not use the order set and received scheduled-dose medications for alcohol withdrawal were reviewed. Other demographic data were similar. The mean age of the patients was 52 years (range, 34–85 years) in the non–critical care area and 55 years (range, 22–75 years) in the critical care area. The mean length of stay was 6.6 days in the non–critical care area and 6.5 days in the critical care area. The mean number of days taking withdrawal medication was 5.4 days for the non–critical care patients and 4.8 days for the critical care patients.The amount of lorazepam used was similar between the groups, with a mean of 6.5 mg (range, 0–36 mg) for the critical care patients and 6.7 mg (range, 0–28 mg) for the critical care patients.The amount of chlordiazepoxide used varied between the 2 groups: 372 mg (range, 0–1800 mg) for noncritical care patients versus 303 mg (range, 0–875 mg) for the critical care patients.A reversal agent was not used in the non–critical care group but used once in the critical care group. Physical restraints were needed 3 times in the non–critical care group and twice in the critical care group. A sitter was required once in the noncritical care group.A comparison was made between all 31 patients using the order set (symptom-based treatment) and the charts of the 25 patients not using the order set (scheduled-dose treatment; Figure 2). The mean age for patients with the order set was 50 years (range, 24–66 years) and the mean age for patients without the order set was 53 years (range, 22–85 years). The mean length of stay was 14.7 days for patients using the order set and 6.8 days for patients not using the order set. The mean number of days that medication was required to treat alcohol withdrawal was 3.2 days for patients with the order set and 5.2 days for patients without the order set. The mean amount of lorazepam used was 13.8 mg (range, 0–68 mg) for patients using the order set and 6.6 mg (range, 0–36 mg) for patients not using the order set. The mean amount of chlordiazepoxide used was 150.8 mg (range, 0–850) for patients using the order set and 349 mg (range, 0–1800 mg) for patients not using the order set.A reversal agent was not required for any patient using the standing orders and was required once for patients not using the order set. Physical restraints were used 5 times in each group of patients. A sitter was used twice in patients using the order set and once in patients not using the order set. Figure 3 shows a comparison of the patients using and not using the order set by type of unit.This project examined the use of a standing order set for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal in critical care and non–critical care patients. Most patients in the critical care and non–critical care groups were male, and the mean age was similar in both groups. The length of stay for patients who received scheduled-dose medications was shorter than that for patients who used the order set. The difference in length of stay is most likely related to the admission diagnoses, injuries, and/or medical history of the patients in the ICU compared with patients on the step-down unit.Patients who used the order set used more lorazepam on average (13.8 mg) than did patients on scheduled dosing (6.6 mg). However, patients using the standing order set used lorazepam for less time because they were on the standing order set for fewer days than were patients receiving scheduled dosing of lorazepam. In addition, lorazepam was to be given if patients were unable to take oral chlordiazepoxide. Many critical care patients are not able to take oral medications and thus received intravenous lorazepam instead.The opposite was true for the use of chlordiazepoxide. Patients who used the standing order set used less chlordiazepoxide (151 mg) than did patients on scheduled dosing (349 mg) by more than half. Lorazepam is to be given if symptoms are not controlled with chlordiazepoxide, so patients using the standing order set may have needed lorazepam to control their symptoms.The mean length of time that patients used the order set differed from the number of days that patients received scheduled dosing of medication. Patients who used the symptom-based standing order set required fewer days (3.2 days) to treat alcohol withdrawal than did patients who received scheduled dosing of medications (5.2 days). The number of days was less for both critical care and non–critical care patients. Patients who used the symptom-based standing order set would receive medication for fewer days. Although not examined, this difference could result in less costly and less complicated hospital stays. Assessment and treatment for alcohol withdrawal would be more reliable.A reversal agent was needed for 1 patient in the scheduled-dosing group and no patients in the group that used the standing order set. It would be important to look for trends in this information with future patients. Patient safety may be compromised with the need for reversal agents in patients being treated for alcohol withdrawal. Using the standing order set may help avoid the use of reversal agents because the order set is based on the patient’s symptoms and patients would not receive medications unless needed.The use of physical restraints was similar in patients using the standing order set and patients receiving scheduled dosing of medications. Physical restraints may be used for several reasons, such as the patient pulling at tubes, removing essential equipment, or climbing out of bed. It is not clear if the use of restraints was solely due to alcohol withdrawal or if it was related to other problems the patients may have had.Because this study was a performance improvement project with small samples, detailed statistical analyses were not performed. In reviewing the results, it is possible to conclude that some findings were clinically significant. Clinical significance is associated with the importance of the findings to nursing’s body of knowledge. Clinical significance should result in altered decisions or actions by the nurse.27 In reviewing the results of this project, the LOS and the amount of medication given appear to differ. These differences could be explained by the acuity of the patients and the use of intravenous rather than oral medication for treatment of symptoms. However, the difference in the amount of time the patients were receiving medications could result in action by the nurse. Patients using the order set received medication for fewer days (3.2 days) than did patients not using the order set (5.2 days). This difference would mean a less costly and potentially less complex hospital course for patients with AWS. Nurses should assess patients for AWS on admission and encourage the use of the standing order set for those patients deemed at risk for the development of AWS.After completion of the project, both the medical and nursing staff were satisfied with the standing order set, so no changes were made. The institution has approved the use of the standing order set on all units, including the emergency department. This approval also includes the use of the CIWA-Ar, which is very helpful in the assessment of patients with alcohol withdrawal. It is important that all staff be trained in the use of the standing order set. Such training will include education in the initial orientation as a new employee and a review of the policies and procedures. In addition, follow-up on the standing order set should be part of the annual competency assessments, as self-directed competencies are more effective than in-service education.28This quality improvement project has provided useful information to improve assessment and treatment of alcohol withdrawal in both patients who are critically ill and patients who are not. Treatment of symptoms appears to be of more benefit than scheduled doses of medications. Patients in alcohol withdrawal may need less medication for less time with the use of a symptom-based standing order set.",

      "abstract": "Priapism is defined by persistent, painful penile erection which occurs without sexual stimulation. Methadone is used as an analgesic and is also used in detoxification and maintenance protocol for opioid dependence treatment. Here we will report a case of a male with priapism after rapid discontinuation doses of methadone.The case was a young married male who referred to a psychiatry clinic due to long-time spontaneous erections. The patient had no history of mental disorders, trauma or sickle cell anemia. He used to smoke opium for five years and used methadone for four years at a dose of 17 cc daily, which he abruptly discontinued. Then he often experienced spontaneous and painful erections without physical or mental stimulation that caused him shame and embarrassment.In this case, chronology indicates that rapid discontinuation of methadone was possibly responsible for the occurrence of priapism. This may have happened due to a compensatory reaction to methadone side effect of erectile dysfunction, followed by its rapid withdrawal.",

      "title": "How Many Concussions Are Too Many Before an Athlete Should Retire?",
      "abstract": "Concussion is a clinical syndrome characterized by acute, but generally transient, neurologic impairment due to biomechanical forces imparted to the brain. The most commonly reported symptom is headache, although cognitive impairment, amnesia, disequilibrium, sleep disturbances, and behavioral changes are frequently reported as well. By definition, these neurologic symptoms and signs should recover with time; however, there is growing concern for irreversible cumulative effects of repeat concussions. This raises the clinical question that we will address in this chapter—how many concussions are too many before an athlete should retire? Three clinical presentations that should prompt the treating clinician to recommend retirement from contact sports include the following: (1) diagnosis of a neurodegenerative condition, (2) permanent or persistent cognitive or neurobehavioral impairment, and (3) intractable pain and headache (Table 22-1). A relative indication to consider retirement would be progressively lower threshold for concussion with worse symptoms. We will address the evidence that supports these conclusions. Table 22-1 Four Clinical Presentations That Should Prompt Recommendations for Retirement From Contact Sports Strongly recommend retirement if there is: Diagnosis of a neurodegenerative condition Permanent or persistent cognitive or neurobehavioral impairment Intractable pain and headache Consider recommending retirement if there is: Progressively lower threshold for concussion or progressively more severe symptoms",

      "title": "Aplicación del programa de intervención \"talleres de cuidado colaborativo\" en familiares de personas con un trastorno alimentario",
      "abstract": "Los trastornos alimentarios y de la ingesta de alimentos (TA en adelante), entre los que se encuentran la anorexia nerviosa, la bulimia nerviosa y el trastorno por atracon, constituyen un conjunto de cuadros clinicos que se caracterizan por la alteracion de las conductas relacionadas con la alimentacion (restriccion alimentaria, episodios de sobreingesta, atracones, etc.) y por la presencia de metodos de control del peso (vomitos, ejercicio fisico excesivo, laxantes, etc.). Son trastornos psicologicos de etiologia multifactorial y repercusiones serias para quienes los padecen, en todas las areas de su vida (Frank, 2015). No obstante, los aspectos positivos que perciben de los sintomas, como la sensacion de control, autoeficacia, proteccion o seguridad, entre otros, favorecen que presenten ambivalencia frente al cambio y el tratamiento o recuperacion. Cuando el TA se manifiesta, las consecuencias fisicas, psicologicas y sociales que experimentan las personas que lo padecen les llevan a necesitar la asistencia de sus familiares, que asumen el rol de cuidadores, para asi obtener apoyo emocional, instrumental y economico (Dimitropoulos, Klopfer, Lazar y Schacter, 2009). Por tanto, estos problemas de salud implican repercusiones no solo para ellos, sino tambien para sus seres queridos, es decir, para los padres, hermanos, parejas, abuelos y amigos cercanos, entre otros. En esta linea, las consecuencias para los cuidadores de personas con un TA, fruto de su rol, tienden a ser mas negativas que para otros familiares, como los de afectados de esquizofrenia o de depresion, debido a que experimentan una mayor tension en la relacion con quien padece el problema, sienten una preocupacion mas elevada por su salud y su futuro, e indican tener que supervisarle o instarle a afrontar las actividades cotidianas en mayor medida (Martin et al., 2015). En general, las repercusiones psicologicas y emocionales para los seres queridos de quien sufre el TA son graves. Por ejemplo, tienden a percibir una menor sensacion de autoeficacia, y un incremento en la sintomatologia depresiva y ansiosa (Anastasiadou, Sepulveda, Parks, Cuellar-Flores y Graell, 2016; Sim et al., 2009). Por otra parte, el desconocimiento sobre estos problemas de salud contribuye a la aparicion de respuestas emocionales y conductuales desadaptativas (Whitney et al., 2005), que pueden girar en torno al criticismo u hostilidad, o constituir respuestas de ansiedad e hiperproteccion. Estas reacciones, denominadas „emocion expresada‟, pueden influir tambien en los resultados en salud y recuperacion de los propios pacientes. Se genera asi, como resultado, un determinado clima emocional en la familia que puede ser perjudicial para todos sus miembros. Por tanto, se hacen necesarias las intervenciones especificas sobre los cuidadores de personas con TA, con el objetivo de disminuir su malestar emocional y evitar que actuen, en contra de su intencion, como factor mantenedor del problema. Ademas, cabe destacar que el impacto de estos problemas en la salud de los familiares es tan elevado que precisan de una intervencion mas focalizada en ellos para que su malestar disminuya (Slater, Treasure, Schmidt, Gilchrist y Wade, 2015). Uno de los abordajes que existen en la actualidad, centrado especificamente en los cuidadores, es el Maudsley Collaborative Care Skills Workshops (talleres de cuidado colaborativo), desarrollado desde la unidad especializada en TA del South London and Maudsley Hospital, en Reino Unido. Esta intervencion ha demostrado su eficacia en dar respuesta a las necesidades de informacion y de adquisicion de habilidades para manejar el problema que presentan los familiares, ademas de disminuir su malestar psicologico y la carga de cuidado subjetiva que experimentan (Treasure et al., 2007). El objetivo de este programa de intervencion consiste en que los familiares aprendan habilidades de comunicacion y de gestion de las situaciones relacionadas con el TA, para convertirse en cuidadores que guien a sus seres queridos con el problema y les ayuden durante el proceso de enfermedad, relacionandose con ellos de una forma mas positiva (Treasure, Sepulveda, Whitaker, Todd y Lopez, 2010). Hasta el momento, las intervenciones llevadas a cabo desde este marco de referencia ofrecen resultados positivos. Tras el trabajo realizado con los cuidadores, se confirma la reduccion en el malestar psicologico, en la carga de cuidado y en la emocion expresada, manteniendose estos resultados a lo largo de los posteriores seguimientos (Hibbs, Rhind, Leppanen y Treasure, 2015; Pepin y King, 2013; Sepulveda et al., 2010; Treasure y Nazar, 2016; Treasure et al., 2007). Ademas, el feedback directo de los propios cuidadores respalda estos datos, puesto que manifiestan estar satisfechos con los contenidos de los talleres, el incremento del conocimiento sobre su rol como cuidadores, la mejora de la comunicacion en la familia y el poder formar parte de un ambiente de normalizacion del problema, el cual resulta de ayuda para ellos (Goodier et al., 2014; Sepulveda, Lopez, Macdonald y Treasure, 2008; Sepulveda, Lopez, Todd, Whitaker y Treasure, 2008). No obstante, los talleres de cuidado colaborativo para los familiares se han realizado en escasas zonas geograficas, fundamentalmente en Reino Unido, lugar en que se desarrollaron. Pepin y King (2013) senalan la necesidad de aplicar este tipo de talleres en otras localizaciones, para comparar los resultados y averiguar si tienen un impacto similar, observando si existen diferencias culturales. Ademas, cabe senalar que los cuidadores de personas con un TA suelen presentar motivacion para participar en estos programas (Whitaker y Macdonald, 2008), pudiendo resultar un recurso adecuado para ellos, con el objetivo de incrementar su bienestar y sus recursos para hacer frente a las circunstancias adversas. Es por ello que el objetivo de este trabajo ha sido, por un lado, analizar y describir la representacion de la enfermedad, la emocion expresada, el impacto de los sintomas y el malestar psicologico de los familiares de afectados de TA y, por otro, evaluar la eficacia de los talleres de cuidado colaborativo en cuidadores espanoles, en comparacion con otro programa de intervencion creado ad-hoc, al que se denomino psicoeducativo.",

      "abstract": "Antidepressant-induced jitteriness/anxiety syndrome is characterized as anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia, and (hypo)mania, which appear immediately after initiation or increased dosage of an antidepressant. This report describes a case of the jitteriness/anxiety syndrome caused by the coadministration of celecoxib with escitalopram and trazodone in a patient with depression and spondylolisthesis. The depression of a patient, a woman in her 60 s, had been in remission at least for 5 years under treatment using escitalopram and trazodone. Immediately after coadministration of celecoxib because of her buttock and limb pain, she showed anxiety, agitation, akathisia, insomnia, irritability, aggressiveness, impulsivity, and hypomania. These symptoms disappeared after the discontinuation of celecoxib. The present case suggests that coadministration of celecoxib with escitalopram and trazodone can cause the jitteriness/anxiety syndrome, presumably via a pharmacokinetic interaction of celecoxib with these antidepressants and/or the effects of celecoxib on serotonergic neurotransmission.",

Addiction is a chronic relapsing condition characterized by compulsive drug seeking behaviour and consumption, loss of control in limiting consumption and drug dependence typified by withdrawal symptoms when access to the drug is denied. An overviewof the background and our current understanding of the mechanisms that underpin substance abuse and addiction is provided in this chapter. The findings from neurobiological studies suggest that the initial response to addictive substances activate both 'liking' (hedonic) and 'wanting' hotspots in the nucleus accumbens of the ventral striatum, provoking both the pleasurable effects and the desire to continue taking such agents. People who are dependent on alcohol will display withdrawal symptoms on abrupt cessation of drinking or significant reductions in intake. The withdrawal symptoms include nausea, emesis, tremor, tachycardia, restlessness, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, nightmares and transitory hallucinations.",

The history and neurologic and general physical examinations usually permit a definitive diagnosis. When in doubt, diagnostic testing is indicated. Certain historical and examination findings increase the likelihood of a secondary headache disorder and the need for diagnostic testing. These include (1) recent head or neck injury; (2) a new, worse, worsening, or abrupt onset headache; (3) headache brought on by Valsalva maneuver or cough; (4) headache brought on by exertion; (5) headache associated with sexual activity; (6) pregnancy; (7) headache in the patient over the age of ~50; (8) neurologic findings and/or symptoms; (9) systemic signs and/or symptoms; (10) secondary risk factors, such as cancer or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Less worrisome are headaches that wake the patient from sleep at night, always occur on the same side, or show a prominent effect of change in posture on the patient's pain. Diagnostic studies include neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, and blood tests, which are selected depending on the patient's history and findings. For most patients, the diagnostic test of choice is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain is usually obtained in the setting of trauma or the abrupt onset of headache. CSF examination is useful in diagnosing subarachnoid bleeding, infection, and high and low CSF pressure syndromes.",

Results Apomorphine is a dopaminergic agonist that acts directly on D2 receptors. It has been used in alcoholism, male sexual dysfunction and with diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Conclusions The present work describes the case of a woman with PD who developed a loss of control over the consumption of apomorphine that resulted in a significant impairment of her functioning. PD patients with high frequency develop different psychiatric symptoms. Conversely, anti‐Parkinsonian drugs also generate psychiatric symptoms that can be experienced by the patient as pleasant sensations (‘alerting’, ‘awakening’, ‘activating’, hypomania and hypersexuality). In spite of this, addiction to these drugs in patients with PD is a very rare phenomenon. Currently, the prescription of apomorphine has been extended to patients with erectile dysfunction, which may increase the prevalence of addiction cases or of severe psychiatric symptoms.",

      "title": "Effects of ozone treatment on chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy: a promising research area",
      "abstract": "Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common side effect of chemotherapy (CT), which involves mainly platinum-derived drugs, taxanes, vinca alkaloids, and proteasome inhibitors. The usual symptoms of CIPN are numbness and tingling, hypoesthesia or allodynia, pain, loss of strength, and alterations in proprioception or thermal sensitivity. CIPN can become chronic, persist for months or years after completing CT, and be associated with and worsen other symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, and fatigue. CIPN affects the ability to carry out activities of daily living and markedly reduces patients' health-related quality of life (HRQOL).1,2 When CIPN occurs during treatment, it can lead to a decreased CT dose or even premature withdrawal, with a subsequent negative impact on cancer prognosis. Current status of CIPN: Unfortunately, prophylactic and therapeutic measures for managing CIPN are very limited in number and degree of effectiveness.1 Duloxetine is the only evidence-based treatment, but only for \"pain\" management, with a \"moderate degree\" of recommendation, given the \"modest magnitude of its benefit.1\" In a large randomized controlled trial (RCT), compared with the placebo group (0.34), duloxetine provided a pain reduction of 1.06 points on a 10-point scale (using the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form \"average pain\"), which disappeared 1 week after stopping the treatment, and it is a treatment associated with potential side effects.3 Although multiple treatments are usually administered for the management of numbness and tingling secondary to CIPN (such as venlafaxine, oxcarbazepine, amitriptyline, gabapentin, pregabalin, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and several antioxidants), the Clinical Guideline of the American Society of Medical Oncology established that there is insufficient evidence to recommend its use outside of RCTs.1 Moreover, the development and evaluation of new strategies to mitigate and manage the chronic side effects of cancer treatments (CIPN included) was established as an area of urgent research by the American Society of Medical Oncology.4 The pathogenesis of CIPN is multifactorial, and different combinations of factors are likely predominant for different drugs. Alterations have been described in the following aspects: i) microtubule activity; ii) ion channel activity (Na, K, Ca, transient receptor potential channels); iii) DNA (with subsequent alterations and dysregulation of intracellular transcriptional and signaling pathways, particularly those associated with DNA repair and apoptosis); iv) mitochondrial functions and cellular metabolism (with a local increase in oxidative stress and scavenger alterations); v) local alterations in the immune system (with local processes of neuroinflammation and microischemia); and vi) myelin alterations and axonal degeneration.2,5 Ozone (O3) treatment (O3T): O3 is a highly reactive compound composed of three oxygen (O2) atoms with higher oxidizing power than O2, meaning that it can chemically react with different substances by adding an atom of oxygen (or removing electrons) to its molecular structure. Because its oxidizing properties produce lung toxicity, O3T must always be carried out to avoid airway exposure to O3.6 Medical O3 is produced from medical-grade O2 using certified medical O3 generators. Its clinical use is based on an O3/O2 mixture at different concentrations, where O2 continues to be the most frequent component of the mixture (95–99%), with only a small percentage of O3 (< 1–5%). Owing to its short half-life (approximately 25 minutes at 30°C), the O3/O2 gas mixture cannot be encapsulated or stored and must be produced and administered in situ. The two main routes of O3/O2 administration that induce systemic effects are autohemotherapy and rectal insufflation. Using any of those approaches, O3T can produce an indirect systemic effect by inducing an adaptive response of the tissue and organism. O3 does not bind to specific receptors, nor does it follow the usual principles of pharmacology: it does not circulate through the bloodstream, nor does it follow the processes of distribution, metabolism or elimination. At adequate concentrations and for administration, O3/O2 interacts with the mucosa of the colon and rectum (rectal route) or with blood components (intravenous route). This produces rapid, moderate, and \"controlled\" oxidative stress at the local level, especially through interactions with double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids, with the disappearance of O3 and the generation of O3 peroxides i) intracellularly, with further actions as second messengers, and ii) extracellularly, as alkenals (mainly 4-hydroxynonenal), which can reach distant tissues through the bloodstream. These second messengers can modulate the glutathione redox system and activate nuclear transcription factors such as nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2, which induces the transcription of antioxidant response elements and the subsequent increase in antioxidant enzymes. Furthermore, at moderate O3 concentrations, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 can also induce a decrease in the activity of Nfkb (nuclear factor kappa B, with proinflammatory action), which is one of the immune pathways modulated by O3T and leads to anti-inflammatory action. Additionally, O3/O2 can induce the activation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase metabolism in red blood cells (with a further increase in 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and a shift to the right of the oxy-hemoglobin dissociation curve) as well as nitric oxide liberation by the microvasculature, with potential improvements in oxygen delivery to tissues and blood flow, respectively.6 In this way, O3/O2 can facilitate local autoregulation of ischemia, oxidative stress, and inflammation, with potential beneficial effects on diseases mediated by factors such as chronic ischemic diseases or inflammatory diseases. In the same way, these potential effects of O3/O2 look promising against some of the mechanisms involved in the production of CIPN that we have mentioned above. Two reviews have described the potential mechanisms of action and potential role of O3T in CIPN.5,7 Additionally, the potential role of the gut microbiota in CIPN has also been suggested, which could offer another potential target for the mechanism of action of O3T. Experience in O3T of CIPN: Because of the limited therapeutic options available for CIPN, treatments are usually offered to patients based on their mechanisms of action or their usefulness in other similar conditions, even if they have not proven effective in CIPN. With the same approach, according to the mechanisms of action of O3/O2, our multidisciplinary chronic pain unit offers O3T for the management of patients when symptoms are refractory to usual treatments, do not have effective treatment, or conventional treatment is potentially associated with high morbidity. In our hospital, the compassionate use of the O3T approach was approved by the Health Care Ethics Committee (September 20, 2017). This decision was based on the 37th Article of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki (Fortaleza 2013). Currently, in our center, O3T is prospectively evaluated with the approval of the Ethics Committee of Las Palmas (April 29, 2022), which is registered in the Spanish Clinical Studies Registry (REEC 0063-2022-OBS) and ClinicalTrials.org (NCT05417737). Therefore, our current experience with O3T in CIPN patients is focused on different symptoms associated with CIPN and is based on compassionate use in a limited number of patients, pending subsequent evaluation in RCTs. The next paragraphs describe our main preliminary findings using O3T in CIPN. (Further details are shown in Additional Table 1. https://links.lww.com/MGAR/A98) The first report8 assessed 11 different locations (four hands and seven feet) in a group of seven patients with chronic pain secondary to CIPN (median age of 49 years, range: 36–73 years). Before submission for compassionate O3T, patients' symptoms were under unsuccessful treatment for a median time of 12 months. Rectal O3T provided significant and clinically relevant pain relief. A decrease in pain was reported by 86% of the patients. According to the visual analog scale (VAS), the pain level significantly decreased at the end of O3T (VAS score from 7 to 4) and remained significantly reduced 3 months (VAS score: 5.5) and 6 months (VAS score: 6) after the end of O3T. This long-lasting effect of O3T in CIPN pain is consistent with the protracted effect described in the management of some radiation-induced toxicities.9 The initial magnitude of the effect on the VAS score (3 points on a 10-point scale) and duration of improvement (6 months) compared favorably with those described for duloxetine (a 1-point decrease in a 10-point scale that disappeared 1 week after the end of duloxetine treatment) (Figure 1).Figure 1: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN): clinical changes at the end of O 3 T.Clinical details before O3T and at the end of O3T: i) Pain, assessed by the visual analog scale (VAS), from 0 (better) to 10 (worse); ii) Health status (EQ-VAS) included in the EQ-5D-5 L questionnaire, from 0 (worse) to 100 (better); and iii) Grade of toxicity according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v.5.0) scale of the National Cancer Institute of EEUU, from 0 (no toxicity) to 5 (death). P value of paired comparisons according to the exact (significance) Wilcoxon rank test. Box: Quartiles 1 and 3; O3T: ozone treatment; X: median value.The second report10 described 26 cancer survivors treated with rectal O3T because of persistent or refractory side effects of cancer treatment. The analysis of the subgroup of 15 patients with CIPN revealed statistically significant improvements in all five domains of the EQ-5D-5 L HRQOL questionnaire (developed by the EuroQol Group), which includes mobility, self-care capacity, ability to carry out activities of daily living, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The median value of the self-evaluation of health status (EQ-VAS) included in the EQ-5D-5 L questionnaire (from 0 (worse) to 100 (better)) also significantly improved after O3T (from 50 to 75). Additionally, after O3T, there was a significant improvement in the grade of CIPN toxicity according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v.5.0) scale of the National Cancer Institute of EEUU. This work revealed that O3T could improve CIPN toxicity, and patients positively evaluated the impact of O3T on their HRQOL (Figure 1). A final report in 202311 specifically evaluated the impact of O3T on anxiety and depression in 16 patients treated because of refractory symptoms of severe diseases, most of which were secondary to CIPN. In this work, after O3T, patients reported a significant improvement in i) the anxiety/depression dimension of the general EQ-5D-5 L questionnaire and ii) both subscales (anxiety and depression) of the focused Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Both subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were significantly i) correlated with the anxiety/depression dimension of the EQ-5D-5 L questionnaire and ii) inversely correlated with self perceived health status. However, in this study, it was not possible to determine whether the improvement in anxiety and depression was a direct effect of O3T or if it was partially related to the improvement in physical symptoms reported by most of the patients. In the complementary management of these patients, O3T was planned by rectal insufflation, 40 sessions in 4 months. Initial pharmacological treatments were maintained during O3T and were further reduced or removed in many patients when clinically indicated. Rectal insufflation of O3/O2 was well tolerated. The main side effects of O3T were soft and transient meteorism and bowel bloating, as expected with this O3T approach. The mild side effects of the procedure were described in our different manuscripts and are consistent with large reviews.12 In these works, many patients receiving O3T also reported improvements in different symptoms associated with CIPN, such as numbness and tingling, and alterations in hand and foot proprioception, a sense of balance, thermal sensitivity, or desire and sexual potency. However, these are encouraging but unpublished data, and they are currently under evaluation. These reports evaluated patients with refractory symptoms of CIPN after many months (median more than 12 months) of conventional management and revealed relevant clinical improvement (in magnitude and duration) after 4 months of O3T. These findings are encouraging and merit further research in a clinical condition (CIPN) without established therapy, except for the described effect of duloxetine on painful CIPN. However, these preliminary studies have two notable limitations: they were non-RCTs and had small sample sizes. Therefore, the results must be evaluated with caution. Focused RCTs are needed to validate these preliminary results. Currently, our hospital is carrying out two related RCTs in patients with CIPN: i) one focused on \"pain\" (EU CT ID: 2024-518021-16-00, NCT04299893) and ii) another ongoing RCT focused on \"numbness and tingling\" (EU CT ID: 2024–517196–20–00 and NCT06706544). Additionally, a prospective study is evaluating the impact of O3T on HRQOL, anxiety, and depression in cancer and noncancer patients treated with symptomatic and compassionate intention (AEMPS/REEC: 0063-2022-OBS, NCT05417737) in our chronic pain unit. Multicenter collaboration could facilitate and accelerate these advances and further research. Conclusion: CIPN is a common side effect of CT, with a potentially high impact on the administration of CT and the HRQOL of patients. Except for the small benefit of duloxetine for pain related to CIPN, there are limited therapeutic options for the different symptoms associated with CIPN. Few preliminary reports suggest that O3T could offer clinically relevant improvements in different symptoms associated with CIPN. The magnitude and duration of these results merit further focused research. RCTs are ongoing.

In the case to be described tinnitus with moderate deafness developed, but the amaurosis that occurred completely overshadowed the loss of hearing. The severity of the symptoms may be, and frequently is, independent of the amount of quinine taken, since persons with sensitivity will show rapid and severe visual loss after swallowing a small amount of quinine in a cold remedy.

      "abstract": "We have all encountered the following postanesthesia care unit dilemma a myriad of times. As the attending covering the postanesthesia care unit, the anesthesiologist will be confronted not infrequently with the following clinical scenario: \"He needed 500 μg fentanyl in the operating room for a toe amputation and has received 20 mg morphine, and he's still complaining of severe pain…. Do you think he may need more morphine?\" Opiates do prevail as first-line therapy for moderate to severe surgical and chronic pain states. However, their use may actually confound the clinical picture postoperatively, because opiate exposure counterintuitively may actually trigger exaggerated pain sensation. When assessing a patient experiencing exaggerated postoperative or chronic pain, several questions should come to mind. First, is this patient experiencing tolerance or hyperalgesia induced by opiate therapy? Second, does the management differ for the two etiologies? Third, what underlying mechanisms, both at the neuroanatomic and molecular/chemical levels, underlie the two processes? Fourth, how does the recent literature on opiate-induced hyperalgesia influence previously accepted views of pre-emptive analgesia? Fifth, what treatment modalities exist for opiate-induced hyperalgesia? Most importantly, sixth, how can opiate-induced hyperalgesia be prevented? In this literature review, we aim to address these questions and to hopefully change the current perception and management of perioperative and chronic pain states with opiates.",

Major attention should be given to the identification of opioid insensitive neurogenic pain qualities, and to a lesser degree the pain intensity. The following pain qualities are of interest: Diffuse deep located nagging pain which is treated with peripherally acting analgesics and/or long acting opioids. Dysaesthetic pain, described as a superficial burning sensation, is usually only partially responsive to opioids and may be treated with antidepressants, whereas neuralgic pain usually is unresponsive to opioids and may be treated with anticonvulsants. Other special pain qualities should be treated as specifically as possible.

      "title": "Panic Disorder Versus Thyroid Medication Overuse: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Panic disorder is defined as the occurrence of spontaneous panic attacks that are not triggered by any specific stimulus. The symptoms of panic disorder include panic episodes that occur frequently and unexpectedly, as well as anxiety about the possibility of experiencing further panic attacks, the repercussions of panic attacks, or a change in behavior as a result of panic attacks. This study presented the diagnosis and treatment of panic disorder comorbid with thyroid medication overuse. Case presentation: A 36-year-old female patient presented to the emergency room with a primary concern and symptoms consistent with panic disorder, including experiencing a sense of losing control or impending death, chest pain, difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat, excessive perspiration, trembling, and dizziness. The patient experienced significant periods of anxiety between episodes, preoccupied with the anticipation of the next occurrence. Each episode had a duration of roughly 15 minutes. The patient refutes any history of alcohol or drug misuse, and her sole medical condition is hypothyroidism. Subsequently, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the thyroid profile and make a referral to an internal medicine specialist for collaborative treatment. We treated the patient with a combination of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine 20 mg/day and a course of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Conclusion: Repeated episodes of intense panic attacks, accompanied by feelings of anxiety and observable alterations in behavior, distinguish panic disorder as a medical illness. The treatment involves the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antidepressants, and cognitive behavioral therapy.",

Often patients have more than one specific phobia. Children may be less able to spontaneously articulate their fears and the presenting symptoms may include nonspecific behaviors such as crying, tantrums, freezing, or clinging. A specific phobia can be distinguished from a developmentally appropriate fear by the persistence, severity, and degree of associated functional impairment. The treatment of choice for specific phobia is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) including exposure therapy and systematic desensitization.",

      "abstract": "Episode depresif merupakan diagnosis kejiwaan yang termasuk dalam kelompok diagnosis gangguan mood afektif. Kelainan fundamental dari gangguan jiwa kelompok ini adalah adanya perubahan yang nyata pada suasana perasaan (mood) atau afek menuju ke arah depresi yang ditandai dengan kemurungan, kelesuan, ketidakgairahan hidup, perasaan tidak berguna, dan putus asa. Seorang wanita usia 24 tahun datang ke poliklinik Rumah Sakit Jiwa Provinsi Lampung dengan keluhan utama merasa sedih yang berlebihan sejak tiga minggu yang lalu setelah dirinya didiagnosis menderita kista folikuler oleh dokter spesialis kandungan. Pasien telah mendapatkan penjelasan bahwa kista tersebut dapat sembuh sendiri apabila pasien memiliki anak lagi, namun pasien tetap merasa khawatir dan tidak bisa melawan rasa sedihnya ketika mengingat kondisinya tersebut. Pasien juga menjadi malas bekerja dan beraktivitas, lebih sering di rumah, dan mengalami gangguan tidur, sakit kepala, serta pegal-pegal pada tubuhnya. Pada pemeriksaan fisik tidak didapatkan kelainan klinis sedangkan pada pemeriksaan psikiatri didapatkan gangguan berupa mood hipotimia dengan afek yang sempit dan serasi, tidak didapatkan gangguan isi pikir dan tidak didapatkan gangguan persepsi. Pasien didiagnosis dengan aksis I: (F.32.11) episode depresif sedang dengan gejala somatik, aksis II: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis III: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis IV: masalah dengan psikososial, dan aksis V: Global Assestment of Functioning (GAF) score 70-61 (pada saat pemeriksaan). Pasien mendapatkan terapi psikofarmaka dengan obat antidepresan golongan Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) Fluoxetin 1x10 mg dan obat antiansietas golongan benzoiazepine Merlopam 2x5 mg yang dikombinasikan dengan psikoterapi suportif Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). Kombinasi pemberian obat tersebut memiliki efek samping yang minimal dan tingkat keberhasilan yang lebih baik. Episode depresif pada pasien ini disebabkan oleh kekhawatiran pasien yang berlebihan terhadap penyakit kista folikel yang dideritanya.

ECT is considered a low risk procedure and most commonly experienced side effects are minor in nature. Many of these side effects can be relieved by reassurance and over-the-counter medications. The minor side effects may include headache, muscle pain, nausea rarely associated with vomiting, confusion and post treatment agitation. Memory disturbance is usually limited to impaired short term memory during the treatment course and for a few weeks following the completion of the course. Adolescents who have been evaluated months or years following ECT do not differ significantly from those who did not receive this treatment. Prolonged seizures may be somewhat commoner in adolescents than in adults and may be prevented and treated by appropriate steps. No fatalities, which could be directly attributed to ECT, have been ever reported in this age group.",

Dizziness is often used as a non-specific term to describe many sensations, including vertigo, presyncope, disequilibrium and lightheadedness. In another sense, dizziness can be described more specifically as a feeling of unsteadiness or a mild intoxication, or as if the ground is rocking, or the affected person has to take side-steps to keep balance. Vertigo, by comparison, is often described as a feeling of rotation; the room or surroundings are spinning around like a carousel. Presyncope is often described as sensation of impending fainting or sense of falling. Lightheadedness is a much more vague description of dizziness, difficult to define. Disequilibrium, on the other hand, can be described almost in the same terms as dizziness: a feeling of unsteadiness or loss of balance.",

      "abstract": "Patients often complain of indigestion, but what do they mean? Indigestion is an old English word that means lack of adequate digestion, but patients and doctors interpret this in different ways. Many patients mean heartburn or acid regurgitation, the classic symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Some describe belching, abdominal rumblings, or even bad breath as indigestion. Others mean pain localised to the epigastrium or a non-painful discomfort in the upper abdomen which may be described as fullness, bloating, or an inability to finish a normal meal (early satiety). Dyspepsia is best restricted to mean pain or discomfort centred in the upper abdomen. #### Major structural causes of dyspepsia Overlap of subgroups of dyspepsia based on symptoms in patients with documented functional dyspepsia There are many causes of dyspepsia, but at least two thirds of patients have no structural or biochemical explanation for their symptoms. It has been suggested that dyspepsia can be subdivided based on groups (or clusters) of symptoms. However, subgroups have not proved to be of value in identifying the underlying cause of dyspepsia and overlap considerably. Some patients report having troublesome burping associated with abdominal bloating or discomfort that is transiently relieved by bringing up the wind. These patients have aerophagy, and repeated swallowing of air may be obvious during the consultation. History taking is key to identifying the likely cause of dyspepsia. ### Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease It is important and practical to distinguish gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) from dyspepsia. Frequent heartburn is a cardinal symptom of GORD; acid reflux causes a retrosternal or epigastric burning feeling that characteristically radiates up towards the throat, is relieved transiently by antacids, and is precipitated by a meal or by lying down. #### Uncommon causes of upper abdominal pain or discomfort that may be confused with dyspepsia",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Familial paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) is characterized by unilateral or bilateral involuntary movements. Attacks are typically precipitated by coffee, tea, or alcohol; they can also be triggered by excitement, stress, or fatigue, or can be spontaneous. Attacks involve dystonic posturing with choreic and ballistic movements, may be accompanied by a preceding aura, occur while the individual is awake, and are not associated with seizures. Attacks last minutes to hours and rarely occur more than once per day. Attack frequency, duration, severity, and combinations of symptoms vary within and among families. Age of onset is typically in childhood or early teens but can be as late as age 50 years. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of familial PNKD is suspected in a proband who presents with attacks of dystonia, chorea, and/or ballismus typically provoked by alcohol or caffeine. Identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in PNKD by molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis. Management Treatment of manifestations: Avoid triggers (e.g., caffeine, alcohol, excitement, stress, fatigue). Response to pharmacologic treatment is poor; clonazepam or diazepam can be effective in some individuals. Some individuals have responded to gabapentin, levetiracetam, or acetazolamide. Surveillance: Monitor medication requirements and dosage. Genetic counseling Familial PNKD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, all reported individuals with familial PNKD have inherited PNKD from an affected parent. Offspring of an affected individual have a 50% chance of inheriting the PNKD pathogenic variant. Once the PNKD pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.",

Mixed episodes of symptoms of mania and depression are not uncommon in people with ID. Lithium has been successfully used in the prophylaxis of bipolar disorder in ID. Long-term medication treatment should normally continue for at least 2 years after an episode of bipolar disorder.

      "title": "How disturbing are side effects of beta blockers",
      "abstract": "Drug side effects are notoriously difficult to evaluate accurately. In this particular context there are further problems arising from the exclusion of many patients in some of the few published series of populations exposed to beta-blocking drugs. In some of these same series, placebo side effects appear to affect almost as manv patients as the active drug. However, detailed breakdown of these side effects show significant differences in the actual complaints made by patients of each group. Apart from the well known major complications of beta-blocking drugs, the lesser but still disturbing ones to mention include generalized fatigue, muscle weakness, cold extremities, nightmares and impotence. A change of beta-blocking preparation or else lowering the dosage often ameliorates these problems.",

      "title": "Treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea may be an Important Adjunct to Therapy of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder not to be Overlooked",
      "abstract": "THE ALMOST INEVITABLE EXPERIENCES OF LIFE-THREATENING TRAUMATA AND THE UBIQUITOUS CONFLICTS THAT PROMOTE THESE EVENTS HAVE left countless survivors with persisting cognitive, autonomic, and behavioral sequelae. Known in previous generations as battle fatigue, acute stress reaction, thousand-yard stare, soldiers heart syndrome, irritable heart, Da Costa Syndrome, shell shock, and many other designations, it was rediscovered and renamed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after its description by Friedman in 1980 as the Post-Vietnam Syndrome.1 It is estimated that as many as 15% to 30% of Vietnam combat veterans developed this disorder2 and that it affects 11% to 17% of recent Iraq and Afghanistan combat veterans.3 Current DSM IV diagnostic criteria include (A) exposure or witness to a seriously traumatic event with intense emotional response; (B) recurrent re-experiencing of the event in various ways; (C) persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma and numbing of general responsiveness; and (D) persistent autonomic, cognitive, and/or behavioral hyperarousal.4 Criterion B includes nightmares that have been designated the “hallmark symptom” of PTSD,5 and criterion D includes insomnia and other parasomnias. The nightmares typically include vivid trauma-related content. They are not exclusively REM-sleep related and emerge from all stages of sleep.\r\n\r\nPatients typically describe insomnia and parasomnias such as loud somniloquy, and arousals resembling sleep terrors or panic. Some describe motor activation during sleep like sleepwalking or even dream enactment suggestive of REM sleep behavior disorder. Polysomnographic studies have not demonstrated consistent findings to implicate a fundamental sleep disorder of PTSD, but studies of sleep microstructure and brain imaging may offer more insight.6–8 There have been reports of increased incidence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with PTSD, and comorbidity is not unexpected, given the already high prevalence of OSA.9\r\n\r\nIn the paper by El-Solh and colleagues10 in this issue of SLEEP, the authors report on adherence to therapy with various modalities of positive airway pressure (PAP) in a consecutive retrospective case series of OSA in veterans with and without PTSD. Using the Computerized Patient Record System at a Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, the authors abstracted cases from a continuous 4.5-year period to compare 142 veterans with OSA and PTSD with 147 having OSA without PTSD that were matched for age, race, gender, BMI, and OSA severity indices. These individuals were seen for initial follow-up at 30 days following prescription of PAP, reflecting a loss to follow-up of only 6 PTSD subjects and one control. Adherence to PAP was defined by > 4 hours use per night for 70% of nights. Using this definition, 82 of 142 patients (57.7%) with PTSD and 43 of 147 control cases (29.3%) were non-adherent.10\r\n\r\nIn the PTSD group, non-adherence to PAP was associated with post-treatment endorsement of nightmares (P = 0.002) and PAP adherence with pre-treatment Epworth Sleepiness Scale score (P = 0.01). Nightmares were endorsed at follow-up visit by 28% of adherent and 56% of non-adherent patients, as compared with 73% of all PTSD patients prior to treatment. Adherent patients endorsed pre-treatment ESS scores greater by 2 points, compared with non-adherent patients (14.4 ± 5.3 vs 12.3 ± 5.9). This small difference suggests a relationship between symptomatic sleepiness and motivation for therapy, but is not enough to indicate much clinical significance. Though depression and substance abuse were more frequently documented in the PTSD patients, they did not distinguish adherent from non-adherent cases; neither did age, BMI, marital status, employment, substance abuse, severity of OSA, pulmonary function (FEV1), PAP modality, mask type, or pressure. Opiate medication was prescribed for more non-adherent patients (26% vs 13%) but this did not reach statistical significance. There was no significant difference for any of the common complaints about PAP use such as mask discomfort, air hunger, high pressure, claustrophobia, leaks, nasal dryness, or epistaxis.\r\n\r\nEl-Solh et al. suggest that persistent nightmares could influence treatment adherence by frequent awakenings. Indeed, this could inhibit replacement of the mask in the setting of post-awakening anxiety. It may also indicate a bidirectional relationship, with nightmare-related anxiety leading to reduced mask use and PAP or OSA-related increases in nightmare propensity. Their retrospective study does not permit evaluation of post-treatment total sleep time, sleep efficiency, or patient interview data to clarify these possible relationships. Also, the absence of quantitative PTSD assessment does not allow for comparison of PTSD severity between adherent and non-adherent patients. The authors correctly note that their chart review does not permit evaluation of initial response to PAP titration, social support system, referral source, or understanding of risk.10\r\n\r\nThe high lack of adherence to PAP in these cases of OSA in patients with PTSD poses major challenges as well as opportunities in view of the cardiovascular, metabolic, and hypersomnia risks that endanger these non-adherent patients. Furthermore, the fragmentation of their sleep can predispose them to additional morbidity such as continuing nightmares and other parasomnias that can add risk of injury. Interestingly, it has been reported that dream recall is reduced in the presence of OSA.11 However, posttraumatic nightmares might be promoted by apnea-induced arousals. It is well documented that nightmares, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors can be precipitated by sleep fragmentation such as with OSA, and diminish with PAP therapy.12,13 This would be similar for “pseudo-REM-sleep behavior disorder,”14 in which OSA-induced arousals from REM and NREM sleep result in recurrent spells of aggressive and violent dream enactment behaviors that resolve with PAP therapy, as documented by spousal report and by repeat PSG monitoring (that again confirms normal presence of REM-atonia).\r\n\r\nThough polysomnographic studies of sleep in PTSD have shown little clinically significant sleep pathology, patients endorse many symptoms that tend not to appear in the safe, supervised environment of the sleep laboratory.6 The ubiquity of sleep symptoms, however, implicates some fundamental aberration of sleep in this disorder, and there are reports suggesting that sleep-focused treatment alleviates PTSD.15 It is reasonable, therefore, to anticipate that treatment of OSA in these individuals may improve both disorders. Hence, the finding of El-Solh et al.10 raises the question of how the fundamental PTSD symptom of the nightmare may be both facilitated by OSA and also interfere with its therapy. Any means of diminishing nightmares could possibly promote more effective treatment of OSA as well as improve PTSD. Clearly, the provocative findings of El-Solh et al. beg for prospective studies to further elucidate these important and complex issues. For instance, the possibility that imagery rehearsal therapy or pharmacotherapy with prazosin might reduce nightmares and enhance CPAP adherence must be tested.15 Might alternative therapy for OSA such as mandibular advancement appliances improve comorbid PTSD? What is the lower limit of sleep disordered breathing severity that would be additive or complicate symptoms of PTSD? What is the possibility that use of CPAP, known to cause REM rebound with increased REM density,16 might increase nightmare intensity and discourage use of CPAP? The finding of El-Solh et al.10 stimulates us to think about the fundamental relationship between PTSD and sleep as well as the practical issue of how to enhance nocturnal sleep and daytime wakefulness, as well as mitigate PTSD symptoms and cardiovascular and metabolic risks in these individuals.",

While the severity and duration of the systemic inflammation are associated with the occurrence of ICU-acquired weakness (ICU-AW), malnutrition and immobility during the treatment can exacerbate the symptoms. The goal of nutrition therapy in critically ill patients is to provide an adequate amount of energy and protein while addressing specific nutrient deficiencies to survive the inflammatory response and promote recovery from organ dysfunctions. Feeding strategy to prevent ICU-AW and PICS as nutrition therapy involves administering sufficient amounts of amino acids or proteins later in the acute phase after the hyperacute phase has passed, with specific attention to avoid energy overfeeding. Physiotherapy can also help mitigate muscle loss and subsequent physical impairment. However, many questions remain to be answered regarding the potential role and methods of nutrition therapy in association with ICU-AW and PICS, and further research is warranted.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To report a case of rhabdomyolysis related to correction of hyponatremia secondary to psychogenic polydipsia, possibly complicated by the use of ziprasidone. CASE SUMMARY: A 50-year-old white man treated for 3 weeks with ziprasidone 40 mg twice daily for chronic paranoid schizophrenia was admitted to the intensive care unit after a witnessed generalized seizure. Marked hypotonic hyponatremia was present secondary to psychogenic polydipsia. After correction of hyponatremia with intravenous NaCl 0.9%, he developed a substantial elevation in the creatine kinase level without any evidence of muscle trauma, stiffness, or swelling or any signs of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Renal failure or compartment syndrome did not complicate the clinical picture. DISCUSSION: It is well known that severe hyponatremia can cause neurologic complications such as stupor, seizures, and even coma. Hyponatremia from water intoxication (n = 28) and its correction with intravenous fluids (n = 2) may cause non-neurologic complications such as rhabdomyolysis. An explanation may lie within the calcium–sodium exchange mechanism across the skeletal myocyte or the failure of cell volume regulation secondary to extracellular hypo-osmolality. Neuroleptic medications have been linked to the development of rhabdomyolysis, with antipsychotics being the primary offenders. As of August 2005, there has been only one reported case of rhabdomyolysis related to correction of hyponatremia complicated by an atypical antipsychotic (clozapine). It is possible that ziprasidone, like clozapine, may enhance muscle cell permeability leading to rhabdomyolysis under similar conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric patients treated with atypical antipsychotic medications should be closely monitored for rhabdomyolysis during correction of hyponatremia, thus permitting prompt therapy to limit its complications.",

      "title": "Recognizing Mimics of Depression: The '8 Ds': This Mnemonic Helps Recall Conditions That May Make Medically Ill Patients Appear Depressed",
      "abstract": "Many psychiatric and medical illnesses as well as normal reactions to stressors have symptoms that overlap with those of depressive disorders, including outwardly sad or dysphoric appearance, irritability, apathy or amotivation, fatigue, difficulty making decisions, social withdrawal, and sleep disturbances. This cluster of symptoms forms a readily observable behavioral phenotype that clinicians may label as before considering a broader differential diagnosis. To better understand what other conditions belong in the differential diagnosis, we reviewed a sample of 100 consecutive medical/ surgical inpatients referred to our consultationliaison psychiatry practice for evaluation of Ultimately, only 29 of these patients received a diagnosis. Many of the other diagnoses given in our sample required attention during inpatient medical or surgical care because they were potentially life-threatening if left unaddressed--such as delirium--or they interfered with managing the primary medical or surgical condition for which the patient was hospitalized. Hurried or uncertain primary care clinicians frequently use depression as a catch-all term when requesting psychiatric consultation for patients who seem depressed. A wide range of conditions can mimic depression, and the art of psychosomatic psychiatry includes considering protean possibilities when assessing a patient. We identified 7 diagnoses that mimic major and developed our 8 D differential to help clinicians properly diagnose depressed patients who have something other than a depressive disorder. Although our sample consisted of hospitalized patients, these mimics of may be found among patients referred from other clinical settings for evaluation of possible depression. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] The perils of misdiagnosis Depression is common among patients hospitalized with medical or surgical conditions. DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for a major depressive episode (MDE) include the presence of low mood and/or anhedonia, plus [greater than or equal to]4 other depressive symptoms for[greater than or equal to]2 weeks. (1) Growing evidence suggests that the relationship between and morbidity and mortality in medical illness is bidirectional, and nonpsychiatrists are becoming increasingly aware of major depression's serious impact on their patients' physical health. (2-5) Although improving nonpsychiatrists' recognition of in medically ill patients is laudable, it comes with a high falsepositive rate. In a study of primary care outpatients, Berardi et al found that 45% of patients labeled depressed did not meet ICD-10 criteria for major depression, but >25% of those patients were prescribed an antidepressant.6 In a large retrospective study, Boland et al found that approximately 40% of patients referred to an inpatient psychiatric consultation service for did not meet criteria for a depressive illness, and primary medical services often confused organic syndromes such as delirium and dementia with depression.' Similarly, Clarke et al found that 26% of medical and surgical inpatients referred to psychiatry with depression had another diagnosis commonly delirium that better accounted for their symptoms. (8) What is the harm in overdiagnosing depression? Missing a serious or lifethreatening diagnosis is a primary concern. For example, unrecognized delirium, which frequently was misdiagnosed as in the Berardi, (6) Boland (7) and Clarke (8) studies, is associated with myriad difficulties, including higher morbidity and mortality. (9) Substance use disorders, which also commonly masquerade as depression, frequently are comorbid with medical illness. Delays in appropriate treatment of withdrawal syndromes particularly of alcohol and sedative/hypnotic medications--are risk factors for increased mortality in these illnesses. …",

      "abstract": "Drowsiness is one of the cardinal symptoms of motion sickness; therefore, a symptom-complex centering around \"drowsiness\" has been identified which, for convenience, has been termed the sopite syndrome. Generally, the symptoms characterizing this syndrome are interwoven with other symptoms but under two circumstances the sopite syndrome comprises the main or sole overt manifestation of motion sickness. One circumstance is that in which the intensity of the eliciting stimuli is closely matched to a person's susceptibility, and the sopite syndrome is evoked either before other symptoms of motion sickness appear or in their absence. The second circumstance occurs during prolonged exposure in a motion environment when adaptation results in the disappearance of motion sickness symptoms, except for responses characterizing the sopite syndrome. Typical symptoms of the syndrome are: 1) yawning, 2) drowsiness, 3) disinclination for work, either physical or mental, and 4) lack of participation in group activities. Phenomena derived from an analysis of the symptomatology of the sopite syndrome are qualitatively similar but may differ quantitatively from abstractions derived in other motion sickness responses. One example is the sometimes unique time course of the sopite syndrome. This implies that the immediate eliciting mechanisms not only differ from those involved in evoking other symptoms, but, also, that they must represent first order responses. Diagnosis is difficult unless the syndrome under discussion is kept in mind. Prevention poses a greater problem than treatment.",

      "title": "Stressing out, or outing stress?",
      "abstract": "Stress is an unavoidable component of our working life. How we deal with it may have profound consequences for our job satisfaction, our health and the standard of care we are able to give our patients [1]. Any stressful event will elicit a characteristic physiological response consisting of autonomic stimulation and heightened arousal, which will then persist to some degree for the duration of the stressful stimulus. During an acutely stressful event, such as an intraoperative critical incident, this 'fight or flight' reaction may directly contribute to the resolution of the stressful event. On the other hand, because chronic occupational stresses such as poor working conditions or extended hours are seldom amenable to rapid resolution, the fight or flight reaction in these circumstances may be both inappropriate and ineffective. Our ability to tolerate stress is the result of a complicated interaction of inconstant factors. These include our own personality and coping skills, our current levels of fatigue, distraction or frustration, our experience of previous stressors, the strength of our social or occupational support and, not least, the nature of the stressor itself. However, a fundamental component is our individual 'locus of control' [2]. This term describes our belief in our ability to influence events around us, individuals who believe they have this ability having an 'internal' locus, in contrast to those with an 'external' locus who place more emphasis on the role of chance. Individuals with an internal locus of control tend to report less occupational stress than those without it [3]. Recent studies of occupational stress in nurses have demonstrated the complex relation between the perception of stress and the character of the individual. In a study comparing occupational stress between intensive care unit (ICU) nurses and non-ICU nurses, the ICU nurses found that their ICU nursing activities were less stressful than non-ICU nurses found their non-ICU nursing tasks to be [4]. The authors concluded that ICU nurses had maximized their job satisfaction, and minimized their occupational stress, by selecting a speciality that offered them the high degree of personal autonomy and job complexity which they required for personal fulfilment. In a separate study, when ICU nurses were asked to specify the most stressful aspect of being an ICU patient they selected items relating to loss of personal control significantly more frequently than ICU patients did when given the same questionnaire [5]. The association of a preference for working in a stressful environment, a strong need for personal autonomy and an internal locus of control has been described as 'Type A' behaviour [6]. This rather loose term also includes characteristics such as self-confidence and a strong work commitment, a preference to work alone when under pressure and an urgent sense of time pressure. Type A behaviour is observed more frequently in doctors than in other health professionals, and is associated with a high level of job satisfaction, a low perception of occupational stress and a low requirement for sick leave [2]. Although the prevalence of Type A behaviour in different medical specialities has not been studied, it is likely that doctors who have chosen a speciality in which they usually work alone, and in an environment over which they can exert a high degree of personal control, might be expected to display marked Type A behaviour patterns. Many anaesthetists and intensivists will recognize this as a description of their own working practice. If Type A behaviour offers a degree of protection against the consequences of choosing a profession with a high exposure to occupational stress [3], and if doctors in general, and anaesthetists in particular, display a high prevalence of this behaviour, is there any need to be concerned about our exposure to stress in the workplace? The obverse to the high-achieving behaviour of the Type A individual is their tendency to suppress symptoms of fatigue, and sacrifice their own and their family's social needs, to their pursuit of a successful career [6]. This is exemplified by the results of a survey of occupational stress in health professionals, which demonstrated that doctors made less use of coping strategies such as social support, and were less able to separate home and work, than almost any other group [2]. It has even been suggested that health workers have a particular susceptibility to occupational stress because of the emotional stresses to which they are exposed [7], particularly if they have not been trained to deal with these aspects of their work [8]. Occupational stress is usually beyond the individual's control, and is therefore exactly the form of stress with which competitive, achievement-orientated Type A individuals are least able to deal [3]. In the face of such stressors, individuals may adopt coping strategies such as denial or rationalization which, whilst providing apparent short-term relief, actually perpetuate the individual's exposure to the stressor. Furthermore, although decreasing the individual's emotional involvement in a stressful situation may be helpful in the short-term, in the face of continued exposure these coping mechanisms can lead to a growing sense of detachment and cynicism, impairing the health professional's ability to emphathize with their patient, and resulting in a progressive reduction in job satisfaction. If their home and work environment are already poorly separated, the emotional detachment is likely to extend into the individual's home life, and slowly erode the support it previously offered [9]. In the long term, this will increase the doctor's vulnerability to prolonged stress and lead to social isolation, professional over-involvement, emotional exhaustion and 'burn out' [2]. Finally, the sustained fight or flight response elicited by continued exposure to the stressor may itself present a significant threat to the doctor's own health, through an increased risk of cardiovascular or infectious disease, as well as depression, anxiety and excessive alcohol consumption [10-12]. Another, more recent, factor adds a potent source of stress to this fragile structure. The protective effect of an internal locus of control on the perception of occupational stress is diminished if the individual feels they have lost control of the stressor. The recent organizational changes to the delivery of health care in many developed countries, with the consequent reduction in doctors' autonomy, poses exactly this risk. A recent study has confirmed an increase in the level of occupational stress, and a fall in morale, amongst doctors as a consequence of these changes [13]. These changes illustrate the challenge that is facing the profession. As doctors, we have chosen to work in a highly competitive, achievement-orientated environment. As anaesthetists and intensivists, we have selected a speciality in which our high degree of personal autonomy, and our control over our environment, contribute to our job satisfaction. Yet, as individuals, we are faced with a growing burden of occupational stressors that fall outside our control, and with which we are poorly equipped to deal. Since we are unlikely to be able to reduce our exposure to these stresses significantly, we should take steps to improve our ability to deal with them. The first of these steps is to acknowledge our exposure to stresses beyond our control. The observations on doctors' behaviour through the centuries suggest that we are not good at conceding our own vulnerability and that, as care givers, we make poor recipients. This should not be a point of pride. Second, we need to accept that not only are we probably not as good at dealing with these stresses as we might like to believe, but also that they may compromise both our health and the health and happiness of our families. Finally, we have to equip the next generation of doctors with the skills they will need to meet the roles they will encounter in the course of their careers. This does not simply mean training doctors to deal with identifiable stresses such as starting a new job [8], comforting the bereaved [14] or managing the department [15], although this is important. We also need to develop a working environment in which we have the skills to support our juniors and the expectation that our colleagues will support us. Clearly this cannot be imposed by management directive. Rather it is the responsibility of us all to learn how to provide support to our colleagues, and to encourage them to support us. Stress, like mortality, involves us all, and denial is no cure. C. E. Granger Blackpool M. P. Shelly Manchester",

      "abstract": "Background: Sleep disorders can be related to loss, disruption or inappropriate day-night rhythm of sleep and represent a great economic burden, involving morbidity and mortality. The insomnia or hypersomnia, secondary to a psychiatric disorder such as depression or psychosis, is frequent in psychiatric practice. Moreover, al though uncommon, primary sleep disorders can also cause psychological or psychiatric problems, with some interdependence, which is not completely understood. case presentation: A 48-year-old woman presented atypical depressive symptoms resistant to antidepressants. In this atypical state, she also showed excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), snoring, daytime naps and cognitive symptoms. After a sleep study with polysomnography, an obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) manifested as atypical depression was diagnosed. Remission of depressive symptoms was verified with additional continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. conclusion: The awareness that OSA could be presented as an atypical depression allows its early detection and treatment, and possibly the prevention of numerous medical disorders. Psychiatrists and General Practitioners should be familiar with sleep disorders and psychiatric co-morbidities.",

      "abstract": "Back to table of contents Previous article Next article Clinical & ResearchFull AccessMisuse of Steroids, Other Performance Enhancers Slips Under RadarNick ZagorskiNick ZagorskiSearch for more papers by this authorPublished Online:24 Feb 2022https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.pn.2022.03.10.42AbstractThe misuse of legal muscle builders and/or illicit steroids combines elements of eating and substance use disorders.iStock/Light Field StudiosDSM-5-TR recognizes 10 broad types of substance use disorders, ranging from disorders involving substances that can be purchased over the counter (alcohol and tobacco) to prescription medications (stimulants, hypnotics, and pain relievers) and illicit drugs (cocaine). However, some mental health professionals think one important class of substances remains missing from this list: anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs).Now, anabolic steroids are briefly mentioned in DSM-5-TR as an example that might fit in the “Other or Unknown Substance-Related Disorders” category. Harrison Pope, M.D., M.P.H., a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and leading researcher on anabolic steroids, is among those who think steroids and other PEDs deserve more clinical visibility. He noted that steroid users in particular show all the signs of biological and psychological dependence: they take larger quantities over time, experience withdrawal effects when not taking them, and continue to use them despite warnings to stop from loved ones or the emergence of adverse side effects.PED use is also prevalent enough to deserve its own category, Pope said. A study published in 2020 found that about 16% of young men aged 18 to 26 in the United States reported using legal performance enhancers, such as creatine supplements, while nearly 3% reported using anabolic steroids (which are illegal without a prescription). Among women, 1.2% reported using legal PEDs, while 0.8% reported using anabolic steroids. Some of Pope’s own research has indicated that there may be as many as 1 million adults in the United States who show the signs of steroid dependence.“PEDs are definitely misused by many people and pose serious health consequences,” said Wilson Compton, M.D., M.P.H., deputy director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse and a member of the Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Work Group for DSM-5. “The question is do they share the specific criteria outlined for other SUDs?”Compton told Psychiatric News that one of the key elements separating PEDs from other drugs in the SUD category is that steroids and other PEDs are not consumed for an immediate high but rather taken over weeks to gradually change body shape. Another issue is that some substances known to enhance performance, such as caffeine or amphetamines, are in existing categories.What Drives PED Use?With more data, PED misuse may one day fit into the chapter on eating disorders in the DSM.Similar to people with an eating disorder, most people who use PEDs struggle with issues related to a distorted body image, said Kyle Ganson, Ph.D., a clinical social worker and assistant professor at the Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work at the University of Toronto. (To the contrary of media narratives, PED misuse is not confined to bodybuilders, baseball players, or other high-performance athletes). PED misuse also often begins in adolescence, he continued; youth may see themselves as weak or flabby and undertake a range of behaviors including diets, increased exercise, and the use of substances to boost metabolism or muscle growth.“These aren’t stereotypical eating disorder behaviors,” said Jason Nagata, M.D., M.Sc., an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco. “Instead of vomiting, they work out intensely; instead of diet pills, they overuse steroids.”Because PEDs are more frequently used by males than females and the use of these products typically leads to a more toned body, PED misuse can be easily missed by parents, teachers, and even doctors.“Typically, the person will start with one legal supplement like whey protein, then advance to a polysubstance pattern,” Ganson said. “For many, the trajectory may lead to illicit substances like steroids.”A study of national survey data conducted by Nagata, Ganson, and colleagues found that male youth who use legal PEDs are about three times as likely to subsequently use anabolic steroids as those who do not use PEDs.Even users who don’t progress to illegal PEDs face risks, Nagata said. Recent longitudinal data have also suggested that youth who use legal PEDs are more likely to subsequently engage in drinking, risky sexual behaviors, and criminal offenses compared with those who do not. Over-the-counter performance enhancers are also not harmless; as with many nutritional supplements, they are poorly regulated and often contaminated with other substances. (Nagata noted that a handful of states, including Massachusetts, have proposed regulations to ban the sale of muscle-enhancing and/or weight loss supplements to minors due to concerns over health risks.)Screening for PED MisuseAs with Pope and others who have witnessed the detrimental effects of these drugs, Ganson and Nagata believe the misuse of steroids and other PEDs warrants its own section in the DSM. “It would help professionals better screen for this disorder in youth while also raising awareness about the male eating disorder experience,” Nagata said.Nagata acknowledged the difficulty in finding a diagnostic home for PED misuse given how trans-diagnostic it is; in addition to sharing traits with substance use disorders and eating disorders, PED misuse overlaps with body dysmorphic disorder. Many youth who use these substances can develop unhealthy obsessions and repetitive behaviors related to their appearance. Nagata noted that muscle dysphoria, a disorder in which people become preoccupied with large muscles, was added to DSM-5 as a subtype of body dysmorphic disorder; however, that disorder reflects only a small portion of people who misuse PEDs.Despite the lack of clear diagnostic criteria, there are clues psychiatrists and other health professionals can look for to identify potential cases of performance-enhancing drug misuse. As noted, this is primarily—but not entirely—an issue among young men, especially those who experience adverse life events or social stigma.“It makes sense that youth who are put in positions to feel defenseless would turn to behaviors aimed at getting stronger,” Ganson said. He was part of a study published last year that identified childhood sexual abuse as a significant risk factor for both legal and illicit performance-enhancing drug use. “What was unusual in that study was that while women are much less likely overall to use PEDs, the rates of use among men or women who were abused were roughly similar,” he said.Nagata added that PED use is also elevated among sexual minorities; a recent study he conducted found that around 44% of gay or bisexual men and 30% of gay or bisexual women had used PEDs in their lifetime; those that reported PED use were more likely to have symptoms of disordered eating or muscle dysphoria. Nagata said this elevated use is driven by both stigma and social media representations of ideal body types. Few studies have examined PED use in transgender individuals, but Nagata said that he believes some people transitioning from female to male would look for ways to become more muscular and masculine, so they might be another group likely to misuse PEDs.Physicians should be prepared to ask patients who report mood swings and/or aggression about use of PEDs and other muscle enhancing behaviors.“One of the issues complicating PED misuse is that we don’t know what crosses the line between the safe versus risky use of legal PEDs,” Nagata said. “Therefore, it is useful to focus on overall behaviors. Have the youth stopped engaging with friends or family to work out instead? Have they eliminated certain foods or made other major dietary changes? As with other substance use disorders, any use that has an adverse impact on their school, work, or social life is problematic.”Pope noted that while patients who misuse steroids may be less willing to admit their use than those who use over-the-counter products, a routine blood test can provide clues whether a patient is misusing these substances. “Significantly lower levels of the good cholesterol (HDL), coupled with elevated bad cholesterol (LDL), is one telltale clue of steroid misuse,” he said. “Elevated numbers of red blood cells is another possible sign.” Other common symptoms of steroid use that might be seen by a primary care doctor include high blood pressure, truncal acne (on the back, chest, neck, or arms), and the emergence of breast tissue in men. “It’s important that more health professionals begin asking questions about these substances,” Ganson said. While many youth may be driven to start taking PEDs to become stronger, misuse can pose physical and mental health risks. ■“Prevalence and Correlates of Muscle-Enhancing Behaviors Among Adolescents and Young Adults in the United States” is posted here.“Associations Between Adverse Childhood Experiences and Performance-Enhancing Substance Use Among Young Adults” is posted here.“Appearance and Performance-Enhancing Drugs and Supplements (Apeds): Lifetime Use and Associations With Eating Disorder and Muscle Dysmorphia Symptoms Among Cisgender Sexual Minority People” is posted here.“The Lifetime Prevalence of Anabolic-Androgenic Steroid Use and Dependence in Americans: Current Best Estimates” is posted here ISSUES NewArchived",

      "abstract": "α-Pyrrolidinopentiophenone (α-PVP), also known as “Flakka,” is a synthetic cathinone drug that is being sold on the illicit drug market as a substitute for cocaine, methamphetamine, and MDPV. It is particularly popular in underdeveloped communities. The drug is often consumed in powder, crystalline, tablet, or capsule form. It is important to note that commercial products containing α-PVP are labeled as “not for human consumption” or “for research use only.” When ingested, α-PVP increases the levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, leading to feelings of euphoria, alertness, and well-being. However, it also comes with a range of negative side effects, including increased heart rate, mania, high blood pressure, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, kidney failure, and agitation. In severe cases, it can even cause delusions, epilepsy, and violent behavior, potentially resulting in suicide or homicide. In conclusion, according to the serious health and safety risks associated with α-PVP, it is crucial for comprehensive research to be conducted, particularly in Middle Eastern countries. Targeted prevention efforts and effective legislation are also necessary to address the harm caused by this dangerous substance. By understanding the various aspects of α-PVP, health-care professionals, law enforcement agencies, and policymakers can work together to mitigate its impact on individuals and communities and create a safer environment.",

      "title": "Exercise-induced muscle pain, soreness, and cramps.",
      "abstract": "The three types of pain related to exercise are 1) pain experienced during or immediately following exercise, 2) delayed onset muscle soreness, and 3) pain induced by muscle cramps. Each is characterized by a different time course and different etiology. Pain perceived during exercise is considered to result from a combination of factors including acids, ions, proteins, and hormones. Although it is commonly believed that lactic acid is responsible for this pain, evidence suggests that it is not the only factor. However, no single factor has ever been identified. Delayed onset muscle soreness develops 24-48 hours after strenuous exercise biased toward eccentric (muscle lengthening) muscle actions or strenuous endurance events like a marathon. Soreness is accompanied by a prolonged strength loss, a reduced range of motion, and elevated levels of creatine kinase in the blood. These are taken as indirect indicators of muscle damage, and biopsy analysis has documented damage to the contractile elements. The exact cause of the soreness response is not known but thought to involve an inflammatory reaction to the damage. Muscle cramps are sudden, intense, electrically active contractions elicited by motor neuron hyperexcitability. Although it is commonly assumed that cramps during exercise are the result of fluid electrolyte imbalance induced by sweating, two studies have not supported this. Moreover, participants in occupations that require chronic use of a muscle but do not elicit profuse sweating, such as musicians, often experience cramps. Fluid electrolyte imbalance may cause cramps if there is profuse prolonged sweating such as that found in working in a hot environment. Thus, despite the common occurrence of pain associated with exercise, the exact cause of these pains remains a mystery.",

      "abstract": "The major concepts presented in this review can be summarized as follows: 1. There is a multidirectional continuum of anesthetic states—some represented by CNS excitation and others by depression. 2. The reticular activating system is influenced by all anesthetics; some inhibit its action (stage III) and some hyperexcite the system resulting in a function disorganization (stage II-C). 3. Some agents traverse both excitation and depression, diethyl ether (I, II, III). 4. Others induce only stage II—catalepsia, e.g. nitrous oxide, ketamine, gamma-hydroxybutyrate, alpha-chloralose, phencyclidine, trichlorethylene, and enflurane. 5. Others induce no stage II but progress directly from stage I stage III, e.g. halothane and barbiturates. 6. Cataleptic agents may induce further CNS excitation manifested by seizures, e.g. gamma-hydroxybutyrate, phencyclidine, ketamine, alpha-chloralose, trichlorethylene, and enflurane. 7. The functional definition of surgical anesthesia is: a stage induced by a drug that makes the subject relatively unresponsive to painful stimuli and amnestic. Thus, the subject does not respond during surgery and cannot recall what happened afterwards. This state can be achieved by functional disruption of CNS systems by marked stimulation or depression.",

Initially no major cholinergic features were observed. The ataxia of delayed onset was not accompanied by clinical or electrophysiological signs of polyneuropathy. The possible pathogenetic mechanisms are reviewed and discussed. This case illustrates the need to closely monitor all patients intoxicated with such chemicals for at least 5 weeks. One should not only keep in mind the well-known late-onset polyneuropathy, but also the less frequent delayed central nervous system effects, even in the milder cases where initial signs of acetylcholine excess are only minimally present or lacking.",

      "title": "Bereavement: Signs, Symptoms, and Course",
      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;In his paper “Mourning and Melancholia,” Freud described five features of melancholia, “ … a profoundly painful dejection, cessation of interest in the outside world, loss of the capacity to love, inhibition of all activity, and a lowering of the self-regarding feelings to a degree that finds utterance in self-reproaches and self-revilings, and culminates in a delusional expectation of punishment. He felt that mourning includes these same symptoms, except for the last. Freud believed that mourning is not a pathological condition and that it subsides with time; interfering with it was useless and potentially harmful. Indeed, the loss of a loved one is a universal experience that may be one of the most significant and traumatic life events that people face. Nevertheless, most people cope with loss with minimal morbidity. For a minority, the death of a loved one may lead to increased use of substances (alcohol, benzodiazepines, and other hypnotics), the development of a psychiatric illness like chronic depression, or even greater mortality. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHORS&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Paula L.

The negative effects of nocturia include sleep fragmentation, decreased productivity at work, and increased risk of falls and fractures. A workup to find the underlying cause of nocturia will help guide treatment, which may include pharmacologic agents.",

A year ago, the treatment was changed to intramuscular formulation with abilify maintena to ensure compliance and adherence. The patient continues to consume toxic in weekends, with symptoms of self-referentiality and suspicion towards their environment. Two weeks ago, he was with the girlfriend of a friend and after this event, the friend has been threatening him. The patient has a state of anxiety rising, with interpretations and associations delirious about this friend. He sleeps with a knife in bed if the friend entered his home. It is a very overwhelmed situation, magnifying and causing severe impact on their underlying disorder.

      "abstract": "Chronic pain is associated with disabling physical and emotional symptoms. Patients with chronic pain utilize more health services, have an impaired sense of well-being and frequently experience anxiety or depression. Unfortunately, treatment for chronic pain is not always correctly targeted, which leads to a reduced quality of life. Treatment of chronic pain involves a comprehensive approach using medication and functional rehabilitation. The usual approach for mild to moderate pain is to start with nonopioid analgesics. Also, trying antidepressant drugs for sleep loss and gabapentin for neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia is appropriate. For moderate to severe chronic pain, opioid analgesics can be used without any serious side effects if adequately used at the right dosage. It is important to provide guidance on the safe use of analgesics and other psychoactive drugs. Dosing of acetaminophen should be limited to avoid liver toxicity, and topical analgesics are preferred for focal pain. Full-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should not be used for more than short periods, in order to avoid gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular complications. Mechanisms of analgesia, drug selection, and recommendations for clinical usage for the management of chronic pain are reviewed in this paper.",

Specifically, a young person may have an underlying biological or cognitive vulnerability to bipolar disorder, which results in the reduced effectiveness of the person's “shock absorbers” for significant events. Therefore, when a significant event occurs, he/she may experience more marked cognitive, behavioral, or affective change than would someone without the disorder. Following this, he/she may experience either decreased social or occupational functioning or social withdrawal leading to depression, or increased activity and sleep disruption resulting in mania. These changes may in turn exacerbate the initial mood state, and lead to a cycle towards more marked symptomatology (see Figure 6.1).",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 (C-19) pandemic has highlighted the significance of understanding the long-term effects of this disease on the quality of life of those infected. Long COVID-19 (L-C19) presents as persistent symptoms that continue beyond the main illness period, usually lasting weeks to years. One of the lesser-known but significant aspects of L-C19 is its impact on neuropsychiatric manifestations, which can have a profound effect on an individual’s quality of life. Research shows that L-C19 creates neuropsychiatric issues such as mental fog, emotional problems, and brain disease symptoms, along with sleep changes, extreme fatigue, severe head pain, tremors with seizures, and pain in nerves. People with cognitive problems plus fatigue and mood disorders experience great difficulty handling everyday activities, personal hygiene, and social interactions. Neuropsychiatric symptoms make people withdraw from social activity and hurt relationships, thus causing feelings of loneliness. The unpredictable state of L-C19 generates heavy psychological pressure through emotional suffering, including depression and anxiety. Neuropsychiatric changes such as cognitive impairment, fatigue, and mood swings make it hard for people to work or study effectively, which decreases their output at school or work and lowers their job contentment. The purpose of this narrative review is to summarize the clinical data present in the literature regarding the neuropsychiatric manifestations of L-C19, to identify current methods of diagnosis and treatment that lead to correct management of the condition, and to highlight the impact of these manifestations on patients’ quality of life.",

While physical dependence is linked to withdrawal syndrome, psychic dependence, on the Author's opinion, is related to a long-standing previous state of true or masked endogenous depression (in this case it would be well termed as \"neuropsychological dependence\"), and the drug taking is only a maladaptive self-medication. This thesis is substantiated by the literature, reporting, in chronic drug addicts the use of the whole series of antidepressants (i.e. tricyclics, doxepine, lithium, etc.), with noticeable therapeutical success. According with other reports and with personal experience, the Authors maintain a great importance to drugs acting, directly or not, on GABA, i.e. l-glutamine, piracetam, and, particularly, N-dipropilacetic acid.",

This report describes three cases of pica and calls for its separate nosological placement in clinical psychiatry. In the Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders fourth edition (DSM-IV), pica is described as persistent eating of nonutritive substances for a period of at least 1 month which is inappropriate to the developmental level and not part of a culturally sanctioned practice (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). On the other hand, impulse-control disorders not elsewhere classified is defined as failure to resist an impulse, drive or temptation to perform an act that is harmful to the person or to others, feeling of an increasing sense of tension or arousal before committing the act and pleasure, gratification or relief at the time of committing the act or shortly thereafter (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Regarding the aetiologies of Pica most contemporary literatures have cited various causative factors, e.g. normal exploratory orality of children, pregnancy, stress and conflicts, cultural beliefs, mental retardation, psychotic disorders and even nutritional deficiencies (Chatoor, 2000; Popper & West, 2001).

It is important to distinguish it from other types of depression, as early as possible. The therapeutic management of dysthymia is similar to the one used in major depressive disorder. Objectives We report the case of a female patient aged 45, diagnosed with depressive disorder not otherwise specified since she was 20. Her psychopathological progress has gradually become aggravated, having now longer periods of depressive mood and an important tendency towards isolation. Methodology The patient is admitted to the Psychiatric Day Hospital presenting with important depressive symptoms. After various antidepressants were withdrawn, lithium salts were introduced. It is then that the patient starts improving her mood. Results – Dysthymia (F34.1). – Mixed and other personality disorders (F61.0). Conclusions In spite of having an appropriate pharmacological, unfortunately, antidepressants improve dysthymia just in 50–70% of patients. Antidepressants resistant dysthymia cases have been studied. In those cases, it has been necessary to add lithium or thyroxine. This confirms that, when it comes to this disorder, there are many neurochemical mechanisms involved, given the positive response to the combination of drugs, notwithstanding the severity of the adverse effects.

A disturbance may result from genetic/dispositional issues, from acute life events, from habitual behaviors and attitudes, or from any combination of these three types of issues.

      "abstract": "La depresion se define como un trastorno prologado del estado de animo caracterizado por sentimientos de abatimiento, infelicidad, apatia… pudiendo inhabilitar a la persona que lo sufre para llevar a cabo las actividades de su vida cotidiana. Su incidencia en los paises desarrollados se ha visto incrementada considerablemente en los ultimos anos, convirtiendose en una de las principales enfermedades incapacitantes en nuestra sociedad. El incremento de la incidencia en la poblacion, ha producido en Espana un aumento en el consumo de terapias antidepresivas, y por consiguiente, la aparicion de nuevas aplicaciones y moleculas que ayuden a combatir esta enfermedad. Cronologicamente, los farmacos inicialmente utilizados en primera linea para el tratamiento de la depresion, han ido quedando en desuso, siendo sustituidos por otras moleculas con menos efectos secundarios y mejores resultados.",

At our four hospital-based pain management centers we have evaluated and treated more than 5,000 patients for chronic pain. The treatment of more than 2,000 of these patients has included the administration of doxepin or amitriptyline. This article reviews the therapeutic use of selected tricyclic antidepressants in the treatment of chronic benign pain and depression, and emphasizes the blockage of serotonin reuptake as the mechanism of action.

      "title": "Treating insomnia with medications",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is a conspicuous problem in modern 24 h society. In this brief overview, medications used to treat insomnia such as hypnotics, sedatives, medications inducing sedation as a side effect, medications directed at the sleep-associated circadian neuroendocrine system, and agents utilized in treating insomnia-inducing sleep diagnoses such as restless leg syndrome are discussed. The newer GABA-effective hypnotics are the only medications with demonstrated effectiveness in treating chronic insomnia with the majority of evidence supporting treatment efficacy for cognitive-behavioral therapy and short acting GABA-receptor agonists. In patients with comorbid insomnia the use of hypnotics can improve outcomes and potentially reduce morbidity and mortality associated with the use of more toxic medications. Except in individuals whose insomnia is secondary to circadian disturbance, mood disorder/depression and/or restless leg syndrome , there is minimal evidence supporting the efficacy of other medications used to treat insomnia despite their widespread use. Sedatives and other medications used off-label for sedative side-effects are a contributing factor to drug induced hypersomnolence, a factor in more than 30% of motor accident deaths. Hypnotic medications with low toxicity, addictive potential, minimal next day sleepiness, and an otherwise benign side-effect profile can be utilized safely and effectively to treat and improve function and quality of life for patients suffering from insomnia. These are the agents that should be exclusively classified as hypnotics and utilized to induce sleep when medications are required to treat the complaint of insomnia. Other pharmacological agents producing sedation (sedatives and agents used off-label for sedative side-effects) should be used cautiously for the treatment of insomnia due to the increased risk of next day sleepiness as well as for known toxicities and adverse side effects.",

On estime ainsi qu’entre un et deux tiers des épisodes dépressifs majeurs ne répondront pas à un premier antidépresseur prescrit. Mais avant de parler d’inefficacité d’un traitement, il est important d’évaluer certains aspects susceptibles d’entraver l’efficacité de ce dernier. Un examen clinique complet ainsi que certains examens complémentaires (TSH par exemple) seront dans un premier temps nécessaires afin de d’éliminer une pathologie organique responsable d’une symptomatologie dépressive, qui pourra régresser une fois cette pathologie traitée. Une cause iatrogène médicamenteuse devra aussi être éliminée, ainsi qu’une cause toxique (abus de substances). L’entretien clinique nous permettra ensuite de confirmer le diagnostic d’épisode dépressif majeur et de son évolution sous traitement, ainsi que d’éliminer des diagnostics psychiatriques différentiels (un trouble bipolaire par exemple) ou certaines comorbidités psychiatriques, tels qu’un trouble de la personnalité. Après s’être assuré que la posologie prescrite et la durée de traitement antidépresseur sont adéquates, l’un des critères fondamentaux à évaluer est l’observance du traitement prescrit. Il est de plus indispensable d’évaluer le contexte de vie et les facteurs de stress parfois responsables d’une chronicisation de la symptomatologie dépressive. Il est donc nécessaire de prendre le temps d’évaluer globalement la situation pour s’assurer que le traitement antidépresseur mis en place est réellement inefficace, avant de passer à une autre stratégie thérapeutique.",

Family and personal histories did not show epilepsy, psychiatric disorders, or (with 1 exception) previous somnambulism.

All patients were treated with either phenytoin or carbamazepine, with cessation of the abnormal nocturnal behavior during follow‐up periods ranging from 9 to 48 months.

      "title": "A history of opioid abuse: Why buprenorphine is superior for the management of opioid use disorder and pain",
      "abstract": "Opioid abuse represents a public health crisis that has significant associated morbidity and mortality. Since beginning in the early 1990’s, the opioid abuse epidemic has been difficult to control due to regulatory, economic, and psychosocial factors that have perpetuated its existence. This era of opioid abuse has been punctuated by three distinct rises in mortality, precipitated by unique public health problems that needed to be addressed. Patients affected by opioid abuse have been historically treated with either methadone or naltrexone. While these agents have clinical utility supported by robust literature, we the authors posit that buprenorphine is a superior therapy for both opioid use disorder (OUD) as well as pain. This primacy is due to the pharmacological properties of buprenorphine which render it unique among other opioid medications. One such property is buprenorphine’s ceiling effect of respiratory depression, a common side effect and complicating factor in the administration of many classical opioid medications. This profile renders buprenorphine safer, while simultaneously retaining therapeutic utility in the medical practitioner’s pharmacopeia for the treatment of opioid use disorder and pain.",

It does not cover specific drug therapies for alcoholism (aversion, chemical restraint, dissuasion), nor nonspecific drug therapies (vitamins, magnesium) the interest and limits of which are well known. All types of psychotropic drugs, antianxiety drugs, antidepressants, thymoregulators, neuroleptics, and beta-blockers are used, with two main indications: (a) to prevent or to treat the withdrawal syndrome and (b) to diminish the psychopathological factors related to alcoholism (anxiety or depression, for example), in order to avoid pathological recourse to alcohol. Recently, attempts have been made to decrease the craving for alcohol in humans after detoxification. Although psychotropic drugs are often used in the management of alcoholics, such management is not limited to them, but also includes psychotherapy and social measures.",

      "title": "Uncomplicated depression is normal sadness, not depressive disorder: further evidence from the NESARC",
      "abstract": "We write to update the results of our recent paper 1 suggesting that uncomplicated depressive episodes are not in fact disorders and should be excluded from the diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD). We also address some concerns expressed about our claims. The concept of \"uncomplicated depression\" is essentially a generalization to all stressors of the \"bereavement exclusion\" that appeared in DSM-IV (and was eliminated in DSM-5). Uncomplicated depression is defined as a response to a stressor that satisfies current DSM-5 five-symptoms-for-two-weeks criteria for MDD but is better explainable as a normal distress response, as evidenced by the fact that it lasts no longer than six months and does not include any of the following pathosuggestive symptoms: marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms, and psychomotor retardation. Uncomplicated episodes thus contain only depressive symptoms common in general distress reactions (e.g., sadness, moderate withdrawal or role impairment, decreased interest in usual activities, insomnia, decreased appetite, difficulty concentrating, fatigue). In our recent paper 1, using longitudinal data from the Epidemiological Catchment Area (ECA) study 2, we found that in those with lifetime uncomplicated MDD at baseline, the one-year recurrence rate (3.4%) was not significantly different from the background MDD incidence rate in those who never previously had MDD (1.7%), but both were dramatically lower than recurrence rates in other (\"complicated\") MDD (14.6%). Thus, in terms of recurrence risk, uncomplicated MDD is different from other MDD but indistinguishable from no-MDD-history. We concluded that \"consideration should be given to eliminating uncomplicated episodes as a class from MDD diagnosis\". However, that study had several limitations. We 3 therefore replicated and broadened the analysis using an entirely different, more recently collected longitudinal community data set – the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC, 4) – that allowed a more clinically meaningful 3-year follow-up window and use of an expanded set of three clinically important validators (depression recurrence, suicide attempt, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)), as well as other advantages in measuring impairment and clinical significance. Due to data-set limitations, only single-episode uncomplicated cases could be evaluated in this study. The results were that people with single-episode uncomplicated major depression had rates during follow-up of MDD recurrence (6.9%), GAD (4.3%), and suicide attempt (0.1%) that were not significantly different from background rates for those who never had MDD (6.1%, 2.7%, and 0.3%, respectively), but were dramatically and significantly lower than rates for both single-episode complicated cases (19.5%, 7.8%, and 0.8%, respectively) and multiple-episode cases (27.1%, 11.2%, and 1.7%, respectively) 3. The results were not explainable by group differences in severity or treatment rates. Given the replication's success, we concluded that uncomplicated MDD is a benign condition that is typologically distinct from the rest of MDD, thus supporting our earlier thesis that uncomplicated MDD is in fact a form of normal sadness. However, in a commentary on the replication, Maj 5 expressed some concerns about the evidence provided by our study. These previously unaddressed concerns are now considered. In MDD, the quality of remission, and especially the number of residual depressive symptoms, is important both because subthreshold depression is harmful in itself and such symptoms predict recurrence and may indicate a latent pathology. Yet, Maj notes, our studies did not report the residual symptom levels among those not experiencing MDD during the follow-up. To address this concern, we analyzed the average number of MDD symptom groups experienced during follow-up by individuals in each of our baseline MDD groups who did not have recurrences during the follow-up period. In each of the four baseline wave 1 lifetime MDD history groups, the mean number of residual symptom groups experienced by those who had no wave 2 recurrences during the 3-year follow-up period was: 0.37 (95% CI: 0.35-0.39) for the no lifetime MDD history group (N=25,514); 0.49 (95% CI: 0.34-0.65) for the lifetime uncomplicated single episode group (N=379); 0.75 (95% CI: 0.65-0.85) for the lifetime complicated single episode group (N=1,756); and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.91-1.10) for the lifetime multiple episodes group (N=1,876). Thus, there is not a significant difference in the number of symptoms during follow-up between the no-MDD-history group and the uncomplicated single episode MDD group. There is no \"residual symptom\" problem indicating implicit pathology or risk of recurrence among the uncomplicated group above the non-MDD baseline. In contrast, the complicated single episode and multiple episode groups both experienced significantly higher residual symptom levels than the no-history and uncomplicated single episode groups. In sum, recovery in uncomplicated depression generally returns to population baseline levels of depressive symptoms, which is unlike the recoveries of those with other MDD. Maj 5 also argued that the 3-year follow-up may have been too short to detect recurrences in uncomplicated cases because recurrence after recovery can occur after longer intervals. He noted, for instance, that in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Collaborative Depression Study, the median time to first recurrence of MDD in people who had fully recovered from their index episode was over 4 years 6. However, the baseline NESARC data used in our study were lifetime MDD data at interview 1. Thus, the duration of the follow-up was not just three years. In fact, many of the individuals classified with lifetime MDD at wave 1 had not had their last MDD episode for some years prior to the wave 1 interview, so the average time interval since recovery was potentially much greater than three years. Thus, to address Maj's concern, we calculated for each of our MDD groups the average time from the end of the last episode to the wave 1 interview to obtain a more accurate approximation of the time intervals from the last episode to the outcome reported for wave 2. The mean years of remission prior to wave 1 assessment for each group were: 9.1 (95% CI: 7.9-10.3) for the lifetime uncomplicated single episode group (N=417); 9.1 (95% CI: 8.6-9.6) for the lifetime complicated single episode group (N=2128); and 3.9 (95% CI: 3.6-4.2) for the lifetime multiple episodes group (N=2501). Thus, the average time from the end of the last episode to the beginning of the wave 2 follow-up period was lengthy, about nine years for both uncomplicated and complicated single-episode cases and about four years for multiple episode cases. This substantial time interval is more than enough for elevated recurrence rates to emerge during the examined 3-year window, and such elevated rates did occur for the single-episode complicated cases but not for the uncomplicated cases at the same 9-year average time since the baseline episode. Our recent replication and extension 3 of our earlier results 1 supports the predictive validity of the uncomplicated versus complicated depression distinction across stressors, supplementing a previous study supporting concurrent validity 7. A course with elevated recurrence relative to population baselines is generally considered the single most salient identifying feature of depressive disorder versus normal sadness 8 and a primary rationale for inferring underlying dysfunction 9, yet no such elevation occurs for uncomplicated depression. The evidence thus supports two conclusions. First, uncomplicated depression is not similar to, and is typologically distinct from, major depressive disorder. Second, given the lack of differences between uncomplicated depression and no history of MDD in crucial negative sequelae including recurrence, suicide attempt, and GAD, uncomplicated depression is best interpreted as an intense normal emotional episode. The additional analyses presented here in response to Maj's 5 concerns regarding quality of recovery and duration of follow-up substantially strengthen the support for these conclusions. Jerome C.

Animais previamente preparados com cânulas direcionadas ao ventriculo\r\nlateral (VL) foram divididos em dois grupos os quais foram submetidos a registro dos\r\nparâmetros cardiovasculares: um grupo que recebeu injecao intracerebroventricular (icv) de\r\nAng II e outro de carbacol. Observamos que a resposta pressora foi maior no grupo com\r\nepilepsia quando comparado ao controle apos a injecao de Ang II (epilepsia: 28,0 ± 3,3 vs.\r\nControle: 13,3 ± 0,7 mmHg, p<0,05), a variacao da frequencia cardiaca (ΔFC) nao foi\r\ndiferente entre os grupos. Nos animais que receberam injecao icv de carbacol, a resposta\r\npressora nao foi diferente entre os grupos, mas houve diferenca dentro dos grupos\r\ncomparando com o basal (-0,5 ± 1,4 vs. 22,3 ± 4,6 mmHg, epilepsia e 1,0 ± 2,3 vs. 24,3 ±\r\n4,0 mmHg, controle, p<0,05), a Δ FC foi diferente entre os grupos (Epilepsia: -24,3 ± 6,1 vs.\r\nControle: -56,3 ± 13,2 bpm), bem como dentro do grupo controle comparando seu periodo\r\nbasal ao periodo pos-injecao de carbacol (396,7 ± 17,0 vs. -56,3 ± 13,2 bpm,\r\nrespectivamente). Em outro experimento, os animais foram submetidos ao registro apos a\r\nsobrecarga intragastrica de NaCl 12%, os quais apresentaram uma queda da pressao nos\r\ntempos 30, 40 e 50 min no grupo com epilepsia quando comparamos ao periodo de 10\r\nminutos apos a gavagem (10’: 5,6 ± 2,9 vs. 30’: -8,0 ± 5,3 mmHg; 40’: -11,5 ± 4,9 mmHg;\r\n50’: -9,0 ± 4,5 mmHg). Esta queda nao foi observada nos animais controle. Quanto a Δ FC\r\nnao houve diferenca entre os grupos, porem no grupo com epilepsia houve um aumento apos\r\na gavagem quando comparamos os tempos -10, -1, 40, 50 e 60 minutos (10’: 49,2 ± 23,0\r\nvs. -10’: 0,0 ± 0,0 bpm; -1’: -5,7 ± 11,1 bpm; 40’: 3,5 ± 7,3 bpm; 50’: -7,0 ± 9,6 bpm e\r\n60’: -5,7 ± 11,3 bpm). Nossos resultados sugerem que a epilepsia induzida por pilocarpina e\r\ncapaz de alterar mecanismos centrais dependentes de angiotensina, carbacol e aumento da\r\nosmolaridade plasmatica que alteram o controle da pressao arterial prejudicando o organismo\r\nem situacoes corriqueiras e contribuindo para a SUDEP.",

      "abstract": "Convulsive status epilepticus is a common emergency condition in paediatric practice. Classically, it is defined as continuous or recurrent seizure activity lasting for longer than 30 min in which the patient does not regain baseline mental status.1 Commonly, intervention is recommended after only 5 min of seizure activity2 as neuronal damage may begin to occur after this period, and the longer a seizure continues, the less likely it is to stop spontaneously.3 It seems likely, however, that mortality and morbidity after prolonged seizures should often be dependent upon underlying aetiology rather than duration of seizure activity.4 Repetitive serial seizures (ie, seizure clusters with return to baseline between events, but occurring frequently enough to be highly disruptive) and non-convulsive status epilepticus are also relatively common in children with epilepsy and are associated with significant morbidity.5\n\nDiazepam, lorazepam and midazolam, the drugs most widely used to stop prolonged seizures, are members of the benzodiazepine family, a class of psychoactive drugs with varying hypnotic, sedative, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant and amnesic properties.6 Differences in their affinity for receptor subtypes account for different pharmacological effects, in combination with widely varying pharmacokinetic profiles. These pharmacokinetic differences often impose specific routes of administration and specific formulations for individual members of the benzodiazepine family. The aim of this review is to detail their clinical pharmacology as it relates to their use in the management of prolonged seizures in children.\n\nBenzodiazepines produce their range of effects by modulation of the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor subtype A (GABAA). The GABAA receptor comprises five subunits; each receptor is assembled from a combination of polypeptides, most commonly two αs, two βs and one γ, although several other subunits exist (eg, δ, e, π, θ and ρ).7 The combination of different subunits governs the …",

      "abstract": "The most effective method to maintain clinical improvement in the course of schizophrenia is the continuation of neuroleptic therapy. Sometimes we face the dilemma whether neuroleptic administration could be discontinued. There are some unconditional indications for treatment cessation (signs of intolerance, complications, general medical conditions); all other situations can be considered as relative indications. The risk and benefit of treatment discontinuation should be carefully evaluated. Neuroleptic withdrawal seems to be safer among older patients, with single episode of the psychosis of mild severity, with no family history of schizophrenia. It is necessary to achieve a stable clinical improvement before neuroleptic withdrawal. Worsening of the clinical status creates the most important risk of treatment discontinuation. Other risk factors include unacceptable threatening behavior, increase of family burden. The appearance of withdrawal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, dyskinesia, insomnia, anxiety, etc. are to be considered. These symptoms are rare, and the risk of relapse is smaller when patients were treated with depot neuroleptics before treatment discontinuation than in the case of treatment with oral neuroleptics. Neuroleptic discontinuation and introduction of placebo cause more risk of relapse than continuation of active treatment.",

      "title": "Epilepsy and Psychosis",
      "abstract": "Psychosis is a significant comorbidity for a subset of patients with epilepsy, and may appear in various contexts. Psychosis may be chronic or episodic. Chronic Interictal Psychosis (CIP) occurs in 2-10% of patients with epilepsy. CIP has been associated most strongly with temporal lobe epilepsy. Episodic psychoses in epilepsy may be classified by their temporal relationship to seizures. Ictal psychosis refers to psychosis that occurs as a symptom of seizure activity, and can be seen in some cases of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. The nature of the psychotic symptoms generally depends on the localization of the seizure activity. Postictal Psychosis (PIP) may occur after a cluster of complex partial or generalized seizures, and typically appears after a lucid interval of up to 72 hours following the immediate postictal state. Interictal psychotic episodes (in which there is no definite temporal relationship with seizures) may be precipitated by the use of certain anticonvulsant drugs, particularly vigabatrin, zonisamide, topiramate, and levetiracetam, and is linked in some cases to “forced normalization” of the EEG or cessation of seizures, a phenomenon known as alternate psychosis. Seizures and psychosis may also co-occur secondary to another neurologic disorder, such as a traumatic brain injury, brain tumor, or limbic encephalitis. When a patient with epilepsy develops psychosis, the clinician should attempt to determine the cause, as treatment approach may vary. In this article, we review the various forms of epilepsy-related psychosis and discuss a rational approach to the evaluation and management of patients with epilepsy and psychosis.",

When individuals remain at very high altitudes for long periods of time, mental status changes may ensue. Changes in mental state, however, may be prominent, signaling a gradually developing or worsening hypoxia. Worsening hypoxia or anoxia will lead to loss of consciousness and may cause irreversible brain damage or death.

Objectives We report the case of a male patient aged 58 with multiple previous admissions for behavioral alteration symptoms, including exhibitionism. He is referred as irritable, uninhibited and sleeping disorders. There is a risk of flight as he is difficult to be held so it is feared that he can be run over by a car. He shows a marked self-referentiality. Methodology The patient is admitted. He properly gets used to the rules of the Ward. Pharmacological adjustment is performed. During his admittance he shows no behavior disorders neither episodes of self or hetero aggression and poor impulse. He properly makes comments of what happened during his stay. He responds well to treatment prescribed. Sleep pattern is restored. Results Schizophrenia (undifferentiated) 295.90 (F.20.3); intellectual disability mild 317 (F70); neurocognitive disorder (possible). Conclusions This is unusual case because it is normal that the sexual function of such patients is adversely affected, not finding numerous cases of disinhibition in our medical consultation. This is due to the different aspects that are affected, biological (drugs), psychological and social levels. We have different therapeutic alternatives to address this problem.

DMDD is a condition with an early age of onset (i.e., symptoms apparent by age 10, although the diagnosis cannot be made before age 6); however, nothing is known about the condition among adults in part because questions about temper outbursts (versus \"often losing temper\") are not consistently asked after 6 years of age. Other qualifiers are present so that better-known conditions are not overlooked. For instance, manic symptoms that are present for more than 1 day, symptoms that are not exclusively occurring during major depressive disorder, or symptoms that are better explained by autism, posttraumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety, and dysthymia are exclusionary. Although DMDD can co-occur with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, and substance use disorder, it preempts diagnoses of both oppositional defiant disorder and intermittent explosive disorder.",

      "abstract": "Patients with insomnia complain of problems with sleep onset or sleep maintenance or early morning awakenings, or a combination of these, despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep. In addition, to fulfill the diagnostic criteria for insomnia the complaints need to be associated with negative daytime consequences. For chronic insomnia, the symptoms are required to be present at least 3 days per week for a duration of at least 3 months. Lastly, for insomnia to be defined as a disorder, the sleep complaints and daytime symptoms should not be better explained by another sleep disorder. This criterion represents a diagnostic challenge, since patients suffering from other sleep disorders often complain of insomnia symptoms. For instance, insomnia symptoms are common in e.g., obstructive sleep apnea and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. It may sometimes be difficult to disentangle whether the patient suffers from insomnia disorder or whether the insomnia symptoms are purely due to another sleep disorder. Furthermore, insomnia disorder may be comorbid with other sleep disorders in some patients, e.g., comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA). In addition, insomnia disorder is often comorbid with psychological or somatic disorders and diseases. Thus, a thorough assessment is necessary for correct diagnostics. For chronic insomnia disorder, treatment-of-choice is cognitive behavioral therapy, and such treatment is also effective when the insomnia disorder appears comorbid with other diagnoses. Furthermore, studies suggest that insomnia is a heterogenic disorder with many different phenotypes or subtypes. Different insomnia subtypes may respond differently to treatment, but more research on this issue is warranted. Also, the role of comorbidity on treatment outcome is understudied. This review is part of a Research Topic on insomnia launched by Frontiers and focuses on diagnostic and treatment challenges of the disorder. The review aims to stimulate to more research into the bidirectional associations and interactions between insomnia disorder and other sleep, psychological, and somatic disorders/diseases.",

Patients who gave a history of amnesia following cerebral trauma, but were clear mentally at the time the EEG was taken, showed only a slight increase in the percentage of abnormal records as compared to the control series. This was true even when the records were taken within a few hours of the accident. 3. If there was an impairment of consciousness of any degree at the time the EEG was taken, abnormality in the EEG was the rule. 4. Electroencephalographic records taken within 30 minutes after patients sustained head injury showed a greater percentage of abnormality than those taken after 30 minutes had elapsed. The rapid disappearance of abnormal electroencephalographic findings points, in our opinion, to some mechanism in concussion other than petechial hemorrhage, cerebral contusion, embolic phenomenon, or any other histopathological change which must of necessity require several days to disappear. 5. In the patients with abnormal electroencephalographic records the average velocity of the striking object or of the falling head at the time of impact was greater than the velocity necessary to produce concussion in experimental animals as determined by others. The average velocity of the striking object or falling head in patients who showed normal or borderline electroencephalographic records was less than the velocity necessary to produce concussion in experimental animals. 6. The study of the electroencephalographic records taken immediately following mild head injury was less reliable than clinical judgment in predicting time loss from work. An ultimate opinion of the value of EEGs in this respect will depend upon a study of a group of more severely injured patients.",

      "title": "Review of Ayurvedic Herbal Drugs for Management of Insomnia (Anidra) Along with their Experimental Studies",
      "abstract": "Ayurveda “Science of life” is a unique combination of science and philosophy that balances the holistic aspects of health i.e. physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. Its aim is to promote and preserve physical and mental health and cure of ailments too. In order to lead a good quality of life both physical and mental health of a person should be maintained in good conditions. Now a days, even people know the importance of mental health as due to their busy lifestyle usually they succumb to unhealthy lifestyle which later pose harm to their health. Due to extreme stress in life people are becoming susceptible to various mental and lifestyle health issues like anxiety, depression, HTN, Diabetes and insomnia. Insomnia is defined as a condition where a person is unable to sleep or does not have a sound and sufficient sleep and wakes up usually tired and exhausted. The general causes of insomnia include stressful lifestyle, environmental influence, mental tension, changed food habits or any mental trauma. It is generally of two types: acute insomnia and chronic insomnia. The acute insomnia is referred to a condition one with short duration of few days to few weeks and the second chronic insomnia is which lasts for longer duration of few months to even years. Some of the major symptoms of insomnia include: difficulty in falling asleep at night, sleeplessness, waking up abruptly while sleeping and then not being able to fall asleep again, waking up tired and exhausted, irritability, sometimes wake up with headache, less concentration and low mood throughout the day, over thinking and worry related to sleep. There are various treatments available for this ailment in the form of oral medicines and therapies. In Ayurvedic treatment for insomnia some therapies such as Shirodhara and herbal medicines like Brahmi, Ashwagandha, Sarpgandha are known to produce calming and relaxing effect and result in sound and good sleep. This paper aims to compile and review the classical literature regarding management of Anidra; scientifically reported classical and non-classical sedative herbs; and clinical trials conducted on Anidra.",

      "abstract": "As aging comes, an increased prevalence of medical maladies and chronic pain independently or interactively disrupt sleep, which in turn can exacerbate either one. Furthermore, anxiety about pain can further negatively impact sleep. Fortunately, good quality sleep can improve pain management. Because benzodiazepine receptor agonists (including the “Z” drugs) can reduce anxiety and improve sleep, they seem a convenient choice. However, their use in this population, particularly for more than short-term (guidelines range from 2 to 6 weeks max), is not recommended because of increased likelihood of falls, further disruption of sleep, dependence, and problems with discontinuation (withdrawal). Besides, this population is often likely to take concomitant medication for pain or other central nervous system depressants leading to potentially serious and even life-threatening interactions involving synergistic amplification of respiratory depression (opioids being a particularly dangerous interaction). Therefore, insomnia in older adults should ideally be treated with a non-benzodiazepine receptor agonist; if indicated, they may be used, but should be closely monitored and tapered to avoid long-term adverse problems (direct or from withdrawal). Older adult patients with insomnia may be more optimally treated with sleep aids that do not interact with the GABAA receptor.",

Over 2/3 of methadone‐substituted patients suffer from chronic hepatitis C but a history of psychiatric disorders or drug addiction is still seen as a contraindication for IFN‐α because of a possible increased risk of severe psychiatric side effects such as depression, suicide attempts or psychotic episodes. We report on the case of a 33‐year‐old patient with chronic hepatitis C and a positive psychiatric history (drug abuse, borderline personality and four suicide attempts). After 4 months of therapy with IFN‐α he developed a psychosis with persecution mania, complex thought disorder, disturbance of sexual identity, sleeplessness, anxiety, depression and increased irritability with suicidal thoughts. Symptoms did not disappear after discontinuation of interferon treatment. To our knowledge, there are no other reports of persistent psychosis with a possible association to interferon treatment. Development of psychosis and other psychiatric side‐effects may be an indication of possible neuromodulatory effects of IFN‐α with long‐term treatment. On the other hand, the treatment for hepatitis C was successful. Ideas for safer treatment in methadone patients with psychiatric co‐morbidity and chronic hepatitis C are needed.",

      "title": "What Are Nurses Doing to Help PMS Patients?",
      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a hot topic these days but the disorder remains an enigma. Many women suffer, to some degree, the cyclic signs of PMS-irritability, depression, anxiety, impaired concentration, breast swelling and tenderness, headache, binge eating and/or craving for sweet or salty foods. But why? Is the cause hormonal and/or biochemical imbalance, poor nutrition, underlying psychiatric disorder, or some other unknown factor(1-3)? syndrome is defined as a complex of symptoms-somatic, behavioral, and emotional-occurring in the luteal phase. This phase usually begins in midcycle with ovulation, when the follicle is changed into corpus luteum, and ends at (or shortly after) menstruation(l). In many ways, PMS mimics dysmenorrhea; the key differences are in the timing of symptoms and in pelvic cramping. Although headache, nausea, edema, and fatigue are common to both, pelvic cramping is specific to, and the principal sign of, dysmenorrhea, which generally begins a day or two before menses and peaks in severity on the first or second day of flow. PMS has a wider variety of symptoms (150 having been identified in the literature)(4). syndrome also begins earlier in the cycle than does dysmenorrhea, and PMS is abruptly relieved at menses. An estimated 20 to 40 percent of women of childbearing age suffer some premenstrual symptoms. However, it is also believed that only 5 to 15 percent have very severe symptoms(5). Many theories have been proposed on specific etiology. An estrogen/progesterone imbalance, excessive prostaglandins, abnormal magnesium metabolism, vitamin deficiencies, reactive hypoglycemia, and neuroendocrine changes in the hypothalmic-pituitary axis are among them, but no theory has been conclusively proved(1-8). Theories on effective treatment also abound. AJN asked nurses, physicians, and researchers involved in the treatment and study of PMS what methods they used, and to what effect. It became clear that nurses are playing the key role in the management of patients with PMS, and that they can back up their advice on methods with solid evidence. Michelle Harrison, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, author of Self-Help for Premenstrual Syndrome, advises physicians that nurses are ideally qualified to handle patients with PMS(9). Guy E. Abraham, a California PMS specialist known for significant research on nutritional and vitamin treatment for the disorder, agrees: The in PMS treatment is that the patient has most of her contact with a nurse. Total nurse management is not unusual, unless a medical evaluation is necessary to rule out possible disease. predominant model might describe Mary Ann Wilson, RN, C, a nurse practitioner who has seen over 100 PMS patients in the obstetrics and gynecology department of the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, a health maintenance organization (HMO) in East Hartford, Connecticut. department is staffed by five nurse practitioners, four physicians, and two RNs who do phone follow-up. Wilson says PMS patients are referred to the nurse practitioners. We do all the screening and counseling, unless a medical problem is indicated, or the patient requests an MD, she reports. initial PMS consult is scheduled during the patient's asymptomatic follicular phase (which runs from menses to ovulation), Wilson explained, since a PMS patient is then under less stress and she'll have much more energy to do what you suggest. Some women, says Wilson, will first call during an emergency. We'll do a 'validating' visit; we will talk and calm them and advise a visit when they don't feel so bad. If the patient seems in crisis, particularly if she is suicidal, we will send her immediately to the mental health department for counseling. Most HMO patients have had a thorough physical within six to 12 months of seeking help for PMS. nurse reviews the patient's chart for health problems that could be contributing to, or confused with, PMS. A nutritional history is taken, with particular attention to excessive alcohol, salt, and caffeine intake.

Consumidor de cannabis desde hace 5 años, con aumento en el ultimo año a 6 unidades al día, presentando de forma puntual fenómenos de autorreferencialidad e ideas de perjuicio en contexto de consumo así como cierto aislamiento. En primero de ingeniería consulta en psiquiatría por animo bajo, dificultad en la concentración y procrastinación. Se inicia tratamiento con metilfenidalto de liberación prolongada hasta 36 mg con parcial respuesta y buena tolerancia. Al aumentar a 54 mg al día el paciente comienza de forma instalada con soliloquios y risas inmotivadas, fenómenos autorreferenciales e ideas delirantes de perjuicio centrada en vecinos. Además presenta movimientos corporales repetitivos y desorganizados que el paciente justifica “como si estuviera imitando a personajes de videojuegos”, por lo que se ingresa en unidad de hospitalización breve. Se suspenden los estimulantes, sin mejorar los síntomas por lo que se inicia paliperidona hasta 18 mg al día con buena respuesta y remisión de la sintomatología psicótica.

      "abstract": "Opioid induced hyperalgesia is a paradoxical reaction characterized by an enhanced perception of pain related to the use of these drugs in the absence of disease progression or withdrawal syndrome.In contrast to cases of tolerance, defined as the loss of analgesic potency during prolonged use of opioids, no improvement is seen with dose escalation.Opioid induced hyperalgesia could be manifested in the context of maintenance dosing and withdrawal, at very high or escalating doses, and at ultra-low doses.To establish a differential diagnosis is important to consider that increasing the dose may produce a temporary improvement in patients with tolerance but not in those who develop hyperalgesia.Pathogenesis of this phenomenon is not well defined, but there are several experimental studies in animal models and in humans that have shown that hyperalgesia is not triggered by a single factor.Proposed mechanisms include: NMDA receptor mediation, modulation by the calcium/calmodulin protein kinase, the increase in the number of nociceptors or excitatory neurotransmitters release.There are different treatment strategies available, such as the reduction in the dose of opioid used, opioid rotation or association of other analgesic.Other options are NMDA receptor antagonists or combination therapy with COX-2 inhibitors.In this paper we review recent advances in the understanding of the underlying mechanisms, clinical studies and available treatment strategies.",

      "title": "Managing postpolio syndrome pain",
      "abstract": "POLIO IS A DISTANT MEMORY for most health care providers, but post-polio syndrome (PPS) is becoming increasingly common in patients who survived the last polio epidemics in the 1950s and 1960s. As the survivors of polio age, their struggles with the disease's residual effects become more problematic. These are the diagnostic criteria for PPS: prior poliomyelitis confirmed by history, neurologic exam, and electrodiagnostic test if needed to rule out other causes a period of neurologic recovery from the acute illness followed by an extended interval of neurologic and functional stability gradual or abrupt onset of new weakness accompanied by abnormal muscle fatigue, with or without generalized fatigue, muscle atrophy, or muscle or joint pain exclusion of other medical, orthopedic, or neurologic causes of the problems listed above.1 The cause of PPS isn't known, but researchers have several theories. One is that the ongoing process of denervation and reinnervation of motor neurons gets out of balance, with denervation exceeding reinnervation. A second theory is that persistent latent poliovirus becomes reactivated. A third theory is that a different virus infects the motor neurons, causing weakness. Or, PPS may reflect a normal loss of strength due to aging and weight gain that's simply more noticeable in patients who've had polio. About 640,000 Americans have PPS, which occurs in 22% to 68% of patients who've had polio. Time of onset ranges from 15 to 40 years after the acute polio episode. Some researchers believe that all polio survivors eventually will develop some symptoms of PPS. Signs and symptoms A patient with PPS may describe the muscle pain as a deep ache. Pain often is accompanied by a gait disturbance, and patients who had residual respiratory muscle weakness are likely to have respiratory problems. New-onset respiratory problems can be caused by new respiratory muscle weakness or by progressive scoliosis. Muscle atrophy can lead to decreased production of body heat and autonomic dysfunction. Some patients develop central or obstructive sleep apnea. Another complication is “flat-back syndrome,” the inability to stand erect because of forward flexion in the trunk and pain in the lower back and legs.2 Therapeutic interventions Physical therapy for PPS focuses on energy conservation, pacing activities, and strengthening exercises directed at the deconditioned muscle groups. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) can help strengthen weakened muscles and decrease pain. Magnet therapy (applied over trigger points) also may help. Drug therapy consists of centrally acting anti-Parkinson's drugs such as bromocriptine and selegiline. Although these drugs aren't approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat PPS, small studies have suggested that they may offer some benefit to patients with PPS; further research is needed.3,4 Medications that address fatigue have been used with only partial success in patients with PPS. Anticholinesterases such as pyridostigmine (also not FDA-approved for PPS) have been tried to treat deficiencies in neuromuscular junction transmission. These drugs have worked in only about half the cases, possibly because PPS involves various neuromuscular junction defects.5 Pain medications are indicated when rest and rehabilitation don't provide adequate relief. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen are most frequently prescribed with excellent results. Although PPS can't be cured, patients can have periods of stability that last 3 to 10 years. Physical therapy and analgesics can offer some respite during the slow downward course of PPS.

      "title": "Melatonin for Sundown Syndrome and Delirium in Dementia: Is It Effective?",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: The terms \"sundown syndrome\" or \"sundowning\" are used to describe a wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms occurring in individuals with dementia in the late afternoon, evening, or night.1 These symptoms include confusion, restlessness, anxiety, agitation, aggression, pacing, wandering, screaming, yelling, and hallucinations. The treatment of sundown syndrome is challenging, and pharmacological therapies are not particularly effective. An 81-year-old man with Alzheimer's disease diagnosed 4 years previously was admitted to the elderly department because of behavioral disturbances, sleep disorders, and wandering. His wife said that his cognitive and functional impairments had gradually worsened over the past 4 years and that, in the last 6 months, her husband had become verbally aggressive, agitated, and restless; wandered; and paced. He did not sleep for long and had difficulty falling asleep. The symptoms increased in the late afternoon and at night. He had no hallucinations or delusions. One month before admission, delirium was suspected, and his general practitioner prescribed haloperidol, but it was not effective. Physical and neurological examination showed no abnormalities. He scored 8 out of 30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (indicating severe cognitive impairment) and 50 on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (indicating severe behavioral disturbances). Blood and urine test results were normal. During admission, sundown syndrome was diagnosed, and he received pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for behavioral and sleep disturbances, but none was effective, and some aggravated symptoms. The pharmacological interventions consisted of benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, cholinesterase inhibitors, mood stabilizers, and antidepressants, all given in an optimal dosing schedule. After extensive review of his history, the effect of past treatments, and the published literature, melatonin was started at a dose of 2 mg at 8:00 p.m. for sleep disorders. Not only did his sleep quality improve within a week, but there was also significant improvement in his behavior within 2 hours of initiation of melatonin. A therapeutic trial with an additional dose of 2 mg given at 3:00 p.m. was started, and his symptoms gradually improved over the subsequent 2 weeks (NPI score 20). No behavioral changes were observed in the 2-month follow-up. The prevalence of sundown syndrome in individuals with dementia is estimated to be 2.4% to 66%.1 This wide variation is primarily due to the numerous definitions of the disorder. Several studies have reported that the circadian rhythm, which melatonin regulates, may be an important factor contributing to sundown syndrome.2, 3 Melatonin secretion is low or dysregulated in individuals with dementia, with levels of melatonin detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of controls being almost five times as high as those in individuals with Alzheimer's disease.3, 4 In addition, previous randomized controlled trials and case series have found that melatonin significantly improves sundown syndrome in individuals with dementia.5-7 All of these studies had some limitations, such as different definitions of sundown syndrome, small sample size, different settings (home, hospital), and various dosages of melatonin. One study reported that melatonin (n = 24; placebo, n = 17) did not significantly affect sleep, circadian rhythms, or agitation in individuals with dementia.8 It is important to differentiate sundown syndrome from delirium because of differences in treatment and prognosis. Delirium is characterized by an acute onset of changes in cognition and behavior, a fluctuating course during the day, and an altered level of consciousness.9 In general, it can be caused by a medical condition, drug or substance intoxication, or withdrawal.9 Delirium may gradually improve as the primary problem resolves or the medical condition becomes stable. Sundown syndrome is characterized by a rapid onset or exacerbation of the usual behaviors that occur every day at the same time, in the late afternoon, evening, or night. Although it has been suggested that physiological and environmental factors contribute to the development of this syndrome, no cause is typically found in most individuals.1 The pharmacological interventions for delirium are better documented than those for sundown syndrome. Sundown syndrome and delirium share many symptoms, but it is not known whether they share the same pathophysiological mechanisms, although the circadian rhythm pathway is implicated in both conditions.2, 3, 10 It has been suggested that dysregulation of melatonin secretion is associated with postoperative delirium in elderly adults,10 but only two articles were found on the efficacy of melatonin as treatment for delirium in the literature.11, 12 The first reported two cases;11 one was a 53-year-old man successfully treated with melatonin for severe postoperative delirium unresponsive to antipsychotics or benzodiazepines, and the second was a 78-year-old man with a history of postoperative delirium who was given melatonin to prevent another episode of postoperative delirium. He did not develop postoperative delirium on melatonin. The second article reported that low-dose melatonin (0.5 mg/d) given every night for 14 days or until discharge was associated with lower risk of delirium than placebo in elderly adults (n = 72; mean age 84.5).12 Further adequately powered randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of melatonin in the management of neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia. Until then, melatonin could be considered a treatment option, especially in individuals who fail to respond to other interventions.

      "abstract": "Partial remission from depression, with residual symptoms, is an important problem in depression. This paper reviews the frequency and features of this outcome, and its association with relapse. Residual symptoms occur in many depressed patients after acute treatment. They span the typical symptoms of depression, except those characteristic of severe disorders. Other persistent abnormalities include social dysfunction, dysfunctional attitudes, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis overactivity, shortened REM sleep latency, and mood lowering after tryptophan depletion. Associations of some of these with residual symptoms are not clear. There is growing evidence for similar residual symptoms in bipolar disorder, particularly bipolar depression. The most important consequence of residual symptoms is a much-increased risk of relapse, particularly in the first year. Residual symptoms are a strong indication for vigorous and longer than usual continuation of antidepressant treatment in order to prevent relapse. There is good evidence for the use of cognitive therapy as an adjunct.",

Ada 6 jurnal yang menyatakan sikap berdiri lama berhubungan signifikan dengan NPB, namun 2 jurnal lainnya menyatakan sebaliknya. Sikap berdiri lama yang melebihi 20 menit dapat memberikan stress pada otot posterior tubuh dan persendian columna vertebralis, terutama di regio lumbal yang dapat menimbulkan keluhan NPB dengan tingkat dan kualitas nyeri yang bervariasi. Adanya faktor pekerjaan seperti beban kerja, lama kerja, sikap kerja, bantuan alat, dan banyaknya jam istirahat, serta faktor personal, seperti usia, merokok, jenis kelamin dan IMT, dapat ikut mempengaruhi kemunculan NPB pada seseorang, sehingga seseorang yang memiliki masa kerja yang lebih lama beresiko lebih besar mengalami keluhan NPB daripada seseorang yang memiliki masa kerja baru. Faktor-faktor ini dapat berpotensi memberikan bias pada hasil penelitian apabila tidak dipersiapkan dengan cermat.",

      "abstract": "Depression has become a common psychiatric disorder affecting people of middle-aged group, especially due to their psychosocial issues. Although there are many Allopathic medicines available for its management but these are not free from their adverse/side effects. So people are now looking for alternative medicines to avoid adverse effect of chemical medications. A combined approach of various traditional treatment principles along with psychotherapy will help to overcome the stressors. A 45-year-old male patient, agriculture officer by profession, was admitted to the inpatient department for reducing the dose of antidepressants [sertraline (200 mg) and agomelatine (50 mg)] which he was taking for the last three years. The patient complained of sleeplessness or difficulty in maintaining sleep, loss of appetite, lack of interest in doing daily activities, racing of negative thoughts, and at times experiencing irrational fear. Based on signs and symptoms and Dosha vitiation that is Vata and Kapha, the case was diagnosed as Vishada (~major depressive disorder) with mild features of Chittodvega (~anxiety). On admission, the treatment protocol included Snehapana (~internal oleation) followed by Virechana (~therapeutic purgation), Satvavajaya chikitsa (~psychotherapy), and Shamana aushadhi (~palliative treatment). After the course of treatment, there was considerable improvement such as involving in daily activities, reduced negative thoughts, and improvement in sleep with the reduction in Hamilton's Depression Rating Scale score from 12 to 3. The dosage of antidepressants was tapered after one month of follow-up.",

It is a mental health condition that can range in severity from mild to severe. The severity of depression can be assessed based on the number, intensity, and duration of symptoms, as well as their impact on an individual's daily functioning. Mild depression typically involves symptoms such as feeling sad, low energy, and a lack of motivation. These symptoms may not significantly interfere with an individual's ability to function in their daily life, and they may still be able to maintain their social and occupational obligations. Moderate depression involves more severe and persistent symptoms, such as a sense of hopelessness, persistent feelings of sadness, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions. These symptoms may make it challenging to fulfill daily responsibilities, and may result in social isolation or problems at work or school. Severe depression involves symptoms that significantly impair an individual's ability to function in their daily life, such as suicidal thoughts, complete loss of interest in activities, and difficulty with basic tasks such as personal hygiene or eating. Severe depression is a medical emergency and requires immediate professional intervention to prevent harm to oneself or others",

      "abstract": "Opioids are integral to multimodal analgesic regimens in children with moderate to severe acute pain. Throughout normal childhood there are marked changes in physiology, and social and psychological development that influence the perception and expression of pain, the pharmacology of opioids, and how they are used. A multidimensional pain assessment is key to guiding appropriate opioid prescribing. Most of the commonly used opioids in adults are used in children, with the increasing exception of codeine (as a result of regulatory change), and are generally well tolerated. Patient groups at increased risk of ventilatory impairment include neonates and those with obstructive sleep apnoea, severe neurodevelopmental conditions, trisomy 21, and severe epilepsy. Slow-release opioids are not recommended for general use, but may be used in select populations, for example, following scoliosis surgery, major trauma or burns. Prescribing and administration errors are a major issue in paediatrics generally; the potential consequences of opioid prescribing or administration errors are serious, particularly following hospital discharge. Opioids prescribed at discharge are frequently in excess of a child’s analgesic requirements; three to five days supply appears sufficient for the majority of common paediatric operations. Discharge opioid prescriptions have been linked to long-term opioid use in adolescents with risk factors. Misuse of prescription opioids by adolescents is also concerning, with prevalence estimates ranging from 1.1% to 20%. Caregivers have a tendency to underdose opioids in their children; caregiver education may improve appropriate administration. Caregivers must also be provided with instructions on safe storage and disposal of unused opioids.",

To limit the field of discussion, I choose to consider under \"other causes\" only those headaches or neuralgias, with associated symptoms, which appear periodically for months or years or most of a lifetime in the ambulatory or ordinary office patient. Such patients usually carry on most of their regular duties and enjoy good health except for short periods of marked discomfort. Real pathologic changes in the face or head, or",

      "abstract": "In recent years the number of patients with defecatory disturbances has increased due to an aging population, stress, and other related factors. The medical community has failed to focus enough attention on this condition, which remains a sort of psychosocial taboo, enhancing patient anxiety. Defecatory distur- bance classified according to cause and location can fall into one of four groups: 1) Endocrine abnormalities; 2) Disturbances of colonic origin that result from the long-term use of antihypertensive drugs or antidepressants or from circadian rhythm disturbances that occur with skipping breakfast or lower dietary fiber. Irri- table bowel syndrome (IBS) and melanosis coli cases fall under this category; 3) Defecatory disturbance originating in the rectum (outlet obstruction syndrome). Rectocele, rectal prolapse, concealed prolapse, mucosal prolapse syndrome, and irritable rectal syndrome fall into this category. Pelvic descent and perineal descent are often caused by a dysfunction of the pudendal nerves that innervate the atonic levator ani muscle that forms the basis of the pelvis; and 4) Defecatory disturbance caused by anal diseases such as hemorrhoids, anal fistulas, fissure, postoperative complications, as well as other factors. The same individual may have more than one of the complications listed above. Therefore, diagnosis by thorough examina- tion is essential.",

IC/BPS presents with suprapubic pain or discomfort perceived to be related to the urinary bladder with one or more urinary symptoms (e.g., urgency, frequency or nocturia) for more than 6 weeks. The exact etiology is not clearly understood. It can sometimes co-exist with other chronic pain disorders, complicating the diagnosis and management. IC/BPS can adversely impact the quality of life, impede work, and interfere with the sleep, sexual and social life of the affected individual. The contemporary treatments are palliative and aim for symptom control only. There is no cure available presently. Moreover, treatment effects are highly variable; therefore, personalization of treatment is vital for achieving the desired outcomes. Management includes lifestyle modifications, physical therapy, systemic pharmacotherapy, intravesical therapies and surgery. Conservative treatments are usually used first, followed by invasive and combination therapies if required. Treatment should aim beyond symptom improvement and encompass improvement in quality of life. Further research is needed to understand the etiology and pathophysiology of IC/BPS. It will assist in the development of new biomarkers and drug development.",

      "abstract": "As the tolerability of pharmacological agents decreases with age, exercise may be particularly helpful as a possible treatment or stabiliser of mood and cognitive function in older age. Exercise has been most commonly evaluated for the treatment of depression. Exercise interventions designed primarily for treatment of physical conditions in the elderly do appear to confer psychological benefits as well, with reduction in depressive symptoms over the course of treatment. The effects of exercise on reducing depressive symptoms are not dissimilar to the effects of antidepressant drugs and cognitive behaviour therapy. Exercise may be a useful low-tech intervention for people with mild to moderate depression. In particular, exercise may be helpful in the elderly and in patients who have had insufficient response to, or are intolerant of, pharmacotherapy. Mastery of a new skill and positive feedback from others may increase feelings of self-esteem and improve mood. Exercise may distract participants from persistent negative thoughts. Exercise has been shown to improve executive function acutely in adults of all ages. It is possible that dance routines or other exercise regimens requiring some cognitive input may confer additional benefit to cognitive function. Exercise has a moderate effect on the ability of people with dementia to perform activities of daily living and may improve cognitive function. Midlife exercise may also have an impact on later cognitive function.",

Patients with a course of depression-hypomania (or mania)-free interval also responded poorly to prophylactic lithium when the depression was treated with antidepressants. They responded well when antidepressants were withdrawn. Antidepressants often cause or accentuate a switch from depression to hypomania or mania, and temporary refractoriness to lithium of the hypomania or mania. In this way lithium fails to prevent depression.",

      "abstract": "For about 40% of Americans, Insomnia is a major health issue that often leads to fatigue, reduced immunity, and dangerous driving. A good night sleep is essential for functioning and performance. It also influences mood, cognition, concentration, fatigue, and healing. Insomnia may be related to medical and psychiatric disorders, shift work, stimulants, travel, anxiety, pain, and other problems (e.g., poor sleep environment). People with insomnia (e.g., difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings and daytime drowsiness) tend to rely on alcohol, drugs, and other remedies. Insomnia may reflect sleep apnea or other medical or mental health disorders that require evaluation as well as poor sleep hygiene. Insomnia can be brief, episodic or chronic. Unfortunately, many people assume that insomnia is normal and do not report it to the nurse or seek treatment. Sleep deprivation impairs the person's physical, mental, and cardiac functioning. Often insomnia is treated with medications which may have side effectives or be habit forming. Individuals with insomnia need evaluation of the precipitants of insomnia, education about sleep hygiene, and information about non-pharmacological treatments. In clinic and hospital settings, nurses are in a pivotal position to identify sleep problems, educate patients, and refer them for follow up.",

This phenomenon typically occurs as the effect of dopaminergic medications wears off (\"off\" FoG) but on rare occasions, it can also be observed during peak medication effect (\"on\" FoG). In this report, we present the case of a 65-year-old female with a 13-year history of akinetic-rigid idiopathic PD who developed recurrent episodes of \"on\" FoG after bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS). She underwent STN-DBS for management of motor fluctuations, which resulted in a marked improvement in her motor symptoms. Within the next 6 months and after several programming sessions, the patient reported \"on\" FoG occurring regularly 1 h after taking levodopa and lasting a few hours. Accordingly, a repeated levodopa challenge showed that FoG resolved with either levodopa administration or STN stimulation alone, but the combination of both therapies induced recurrence of FoG in our patient. Subsequent management was complex requiring adjustments in levodopa dose and formulation along with advanced DBS programming.",

Alcohol addiction encompasses a three-stage cycle that becomes more intense as alcohol use progresses: <italic>binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect</italic>, and <italic>preoccupation/anticipation</italic>. These stages engage neuroadaptations in brain circuits that involve the basal ganglia (reward hypofunction), extended amygdala (stress sensitization), and prefrontal cortex (executive function disorder). This chapter discusses key neuroadaptations in the hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic stress systems and the critical role of glucocorticoid receptors. These neuroadaptations contribute to negative emotional states that powerfully drive compulsive alcohol drinking and seeking. These changes in association with a disruption of prefrontal cortex function that lead to cognitive deficits and poor decision making contribute to the chronic relapsing nature of alcohol dependence.",

      "abstract": "Substance use disorders (SUDs) are medical and mental health conditions that affect millions of people worldwide, of all ages, races, genders and socioeconomic levels. Men are affected at a higher rate than women, but substance misuse among women is increasing. SUDs range from mild to severe and occur when the use of alcohol and/or other legal or illicit drugs cause clinically significant impairment, including health problems, disability, and failure to meet major responsibilities at work, school, and/or home. The disorders are recurrent and often serious, but treatable, and many people do recover. The most severe SUDs are sometimes called “addictions,” though the terms “addiction” or “addicts” can be stigmatizing. This terminology often poses a barrier to seeking and receiving help. In more recent work, the term that is used in professional and clinical contexts is “substance misuse.” According to The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision, SUDs encompass ten separate classes of legal and illicit drugs: alcohol; caffeine; cannabis (marijuana); hallucinogens; inhalants; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics; stimulants (amphetamine-type substances, cocaine, etc.); and tobacco. The overall costs of SUDs to individuals, their families, and their communities are staggering. These costs include compromised physical and mental health; reduced quality of life; increased crime and violence; increased motor vehicle crashes; abuse and neglect of children; loss of productivity; and health care costs. The United States ranks twenty-seventh among developed countries in life expectancy; the rate has plateaued and is declining for certain subpopulations. This trend is due largely to substance misuse. This article outlines a comprehensive range of resources on the complex, evolving subject of SUDs, through a social work lens. It begins with a general overview of SUDs, followed by works on diagnosis, and resources regarding SUDs and certain subpopulations: people of color, people with mental illness, older adults, youth, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, intersex, asexual and other gender/sexual identity (LGBTQIA+) people. References focusing on screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT); and treatment approaches are also included. Specific subsections are devoted to outlining resources on alcohol, marijuana/cannabis, opioids and tobacco use disorders as well. The article concludes with resources regarding significant policy dimensions of SUDs and the neuroscience behind these disorders.",

As a rule, late-life depression afflicts medically ill, disabled persons living under chronic stress and/or isolation. Symptoms and signs of medical illnesses and behavioral limitations from disability are often difficult to distinguish from depressive symptomatology. Under-reporting of depressed mood and other psychological symptoms is common by older adults and contributes to under-diagnosis of depression. Many antidepressant drugs and some psychotherapies have been found more efficacious than their respective comparison conditions. However, each of these treatments helps less than half of depressed older adults, necessitating a treatment strategy in which failure or intolerance of each treatment step informs the next. Clinical subpopulations of late-life depression — psychotic depression, dysthymic disorder, depression associated with an adverse life event, treatment-resistant depression, and residual symptoms of depression — require special attention.",

      "title": "The physical examination in office practice",
      "abstract": "Physical illness may first declare itself as a disturbance in thinking, mood, or behavior. Recognition of physical disorders is enhanced by informed use of the relevant procedures of physical examination. Objections to physical examination are based on the assumptions that it is overly timeconsuming, is psychotherapeutically contraindicated, or requires unusual skill, but observation and minimally intrusive procedures can provide much information that may exclude emergent organic conditions. Different patients, illnesses, and settings require different levels of examination; the author describes the appropriate procedure for psychotic patients, substance abusers, patients taking psychotropic medications, and other patients.",
