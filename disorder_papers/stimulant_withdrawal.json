      "abstract": "of the forthcoming 10th revision of the International Classification ofDiseases contains a list of reactions to severe stress and adjustment disorders.3 Two examples provide sufficient illustration.Acute stress reaction comprises exposure to an exceptional medical or physical stress followed by the onset, within one hour, of generalised anxiety or any two of the following: social withdrawal, narrowing of attention, apparent disorientation, anger or verbal aggression, despair or hopelessness, inapprop- riate or purposeless overactivity, and uncontrollable and excessive grief.Treatment is supportive and non-specific and the prognosis is favourable.Post-traumatic stress disorder includes brief or prolonged exposure to an exceptional mental or physical stress followed within six months by persistent remembering or reliving of the stress; by intrusive flashbacks, vivid memories, recurring dreams; or by distress when exposed to (or avoiding) circumstances associated with the stressor.These features are accompanied by either psychogenic amnesia or persistent increased psychological sensitivity and arousal with at least two of the following: difficulty in falling or staying asleep, irritability, difficulty concentrating, distractibility or increased restlessness and apprehension.Again, treatment is supportive and non-specific, though the long term outlook is uncertain.Thus at a popular level stress is a vigorous concept that has engendered a prosperous industry dedicated to its relief, while in scientific and medical contexts the concept languishes with dubious reliability and validity.Fifty years ago the stress hypothesis began displacing obscure focuses of infection as an antecedent of a variety of life's ills.As Susser has remarked: \"Many excellent sets of teeth and many pairs of tonsils were sacrificed to that hypothesis.We can count ourselves fortunate that the stress hypothesis does not require surgical intervention.\"'14",

As a mood state, depression is characterized by feeling despondent or unhappy, while depression as a mood disorder is a persistent set of symptoms as described in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV). Specifically, major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric condition in which diagnostic criteria require five or more depressive symptoms, one of which must include either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure. Other depressive symptoms include significant weight loss, sleep changes (i.e., insomnia or hypersomnia), psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, diminished ability to think or concentrate, and recurrent thoughts of death. MDD is also distinguished from normal symptoms of sadness by criteria for symptom severity and duration: symptoms of depression must have been present during the same two-week period, be present all or most of the time, and represent a change from a previous level of functioning.",

      "title": "KNOWING DEPRESSION AND PHARMACOLOGICAL, NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES FOR ITS TREATMENT",
      "abstract": "Summary Since 1990, significant efforts have been made towards developing interventions to prevent depression. Depression is a serious medical illness that involves brain. Persons of any age-children or adults may develop depression symptoms. Symptoms such as intense sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities, sleep disturbances or oversleeping, change in appetite and deceased energy level; feeling of helplessness and thoughts of suicide are sequels to stress induced depression. The primary clinical manifestations of major depression are significant depression of mood and impairment of function. Mood and anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses. Clinical depression must be distinguished from normal grief, sadness, disappointment and the dysphoria or demoralization often associated with medical illness. Physical changes also occur, particularly in severe, vital, or melancholic depression. These include insomnia or hypersomnia; altered eating patterns, with anorexia and weight loss or sometimes overeating; decreased energy and libido; and disruption of the normal circadian and ultradian rhythms of activity, body temperature and many endocrine functions. Depressed patients usually respond to antidepressant drugs, or, in severe or treatment-resistant cases, to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This review focuses on knowledge of depression, pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures for its treatment and future directions for the field of depression prevention.",

In caffeine intoxication, these symptoms cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning and are not due to a general medical condition or better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. an anxiety disorder). Nicotine is highly lipid‐soluble and rapidly enters the brain after inhalation. Nicotine receptors are found on dopaminergic cell bodies and stimulation of these receptors leads to dopamine release. Withdrawal symptoms occur within 6–12 hours of stopping smoking and include intense craving, depressed mood, insomnia, anxiety, restlessness, irritability, difficulty in concentrating and increased appetite. Nicotine withdrawal can be misdiagnosed as depression, anxiety, sleep disorders and mania. Withdrawal can also exacerbate the symptoms of schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Late Onset Depression",
      "abstract": "In the older population, one of the serious health concerns that are associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) is a depressive disorder. Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

Brief psychotic disorder is an acute but transient disorder with the onset of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior At least one of these symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications.

It is characterized by the co-occurrence of several symptoms of decreased, increased, or abnormal psychomotor activity. Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, not an independent nosological entity. Historically associated mainly with schizophrenia (e.g., catatonic subtype), ICD-11, similarly to DSM-5, now recognizes catatonia under a separate classification category, apart from psychotic disorders. In addition to schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, it can occur in the context of other mental disorders, such as mood disorders, or neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or immediately after intoxication or withdrawal from psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine, cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of some psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Moreover, catatonia can occur as a direct pathophysiological consequence of various nonpsychiatric medical conditions, e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, neoplasms head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, or encephalitis. Due to the fact that catatonia was mostly associated witch schizophrenia, many cases were not diagnosed and thus did not receive indicated treatment. There are no specific “anti-catatonic” drugs, first-line treatment are benzodiazepines and ECT, in addition to the symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recognition of catatonia as an independent category in ICD-11 can improve medical care for catatonic patients in clinical practice. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "title": "Physical activity, participation and health-related quality of life in chronic fatigue syndrome and multiple osteochondromas",
      "abstract": "WSAS Work and Social Adjustment ScaleChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is, according to the CDC-1994 criteria, a disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue of a new or definite onset, which is present for at least six months.The fatigue is not the result of exertion, is not alleviated by rest and leads to a significant reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social and personal activities.In addition, the fatigue has to be accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms, which have to be present for at least six months: impaired short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscles pain, pain in several joints, headache of a new type, pattern or severity, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours [6].Besides the CDC-1994 criteria [6], over 20 other case definitions have been developed with differences in main symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria [14,15].Consequently, these case definitions vary in sensitivity and specificity, but consensus on a uniform case definition has not been reached.Since the CDC-1994 case definition is the most frequently cited and most extensively validated [14], this case definition will be used throughout this thesis to define CFS.Estimates of prevalence rates vary in relation to case definitions and study designs [16,17], and range between 0.2% -2.2% for developed countries [16][17][18].The total prevalence of CFS in Europe is estimated around 2 million [19].CFS is 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in women than men [16,17] and is most common in young adults with its peak at 20-40 years of age [16].Information on incidence rates is even more scarce and is estimated at 15/100.000adults per year in de United Kingdom [18].Limited attention has been given to the societal impact of CFS in Europe [19], but a significant economic burden has been identified due to both direct as indirect or hidden costs.Direct costs encompass mainly various medical costs, and indirect costs consist of occupational limitations (productivity loss, absenteeism, work incapacity) and nonmedical, often hidden costs such as informal care given by the patient's social context CFS can be considered a non-specific disorder characterized by chronic fatigue that may be accompanied by chronic pain.The aetiology of MO is clear and, consequently, MO can be classified as a specific disorder explaining the localized (nociceptive) pain due to the structural deformities.However, as with many chronic disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain remains not fully understood.The pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain complaints is hypothesized to be multifactorial and can differ depending on the underlying disease [42][43][44].This thesis is particularly interested in the impact of chronic fatigue in patients who also experience chronic pain.environmental and personal factors can either be facilitating or restricting [49].As presented by the ICF (Figure 1), all concepts are inseparable and insight into the association between all concepts is necessary to clarify the impact of CFS and MO (health condition) on a person's physical activity level (PAL), activities, participation and HRQOL. Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

      "title": "Medications and Their Effects on Sleep",
      "abstract": "Abstract Many medications affect the central nervous system (CNS) and can alter the patterns of sleep and wakefulness. Others can induce sleep disorders (eg, nightmares, periodic limb movements of sleep or restless legs syndrome) or exacerbate them (eg, obstructive sleep apnea). Some agents can cause both insomnia and excessive sleepiness in different individuals, or in the same individual under different circumstances. These can be a primary therapeutic effect of the drug, a withdrawal effect, or an adverse reaction. Each medication possesses class and agent-specific effects on sleep. Alcohol’s effect on arousal and sleep is biphasic. Alcohol has both stimulatory effects (at low doses and on the rising phase of alcohol levels) and sedative effects (at high doses and on the falling phase of alcohol levels). Metabolism of alcohol occurs at a constant rate of 10 to 20 mg/dl per hour. Alcohol’s sedating effect can be additive with other agents such as benzodiazepines. Acute ingestion decreases sleep latency, increases non–rapid eye movement (NREM) stages 3 and 4 sleep, and reduces rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the first half of the sleep period (Table 16–1). It is metabolized quickly, and alcohol causes a rebound increase in the frequency of arousals and awakenings and an increase in REM sleep during the second part of the night. Nightmares and vivid dreams can occur. In addition, alcohol ingestion can cause worsening of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea by increasing upper airway resistance due to a decrease in pharyngeal dilator muscle tone.",

      "abstract": "Cytokines whose primary function is that of acting as signaling molecules of the immune system, have been implicated in the provocation or exacerbation of mood disorders such as depression. This position has been supported by several lines of evidence; (1) proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α) and bacterial endotoxins elicit sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, soporific effects) and symptoms of anxiety/depression that may be attenuated by chronic antidepressant treatment. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) induces less profound sickness, but elicits anhedonia, a key symptom of depression; (2) neuroendocrine and central neurotransmitter changes, reminiscent of those implicated in depression, may be elicited by some of these cytokines, and these effects are exacerbated by stressors; (3) severe depressive illness is accompanied by elevations of cytokine production or levels, although these effects are not necessarily attenuated with antidepressant medication; and (4) immunotherapy, using IL-2 or IFN-α, promote depressive symptoms that are attenuated by antidepressant treatment. It is proposed that chronic cytokine elevations engender neuroendocrine and brain neurotransmitter changes that are interpreted by the brain as being stressors, and contribute to the development of depression. Further, the effects of the cytokine treatments may act synergistically with stressors, and cytokines may provoke a sensitization effect so that the effects of later stressor experiences are exacerbated.

If you can’t quit on your own, or if you relapse after short periods of abstinence, you may need to be detoxified or attend a structured substance abuse or dual-diagnosis treatment program to break the cycle of addiction. Abstinence is recommended because continued substance use can have a negative effect on your mood disorder and your motivation and can give an “incorrect” reading of the level of some antidepressant medications in your bloodstream.

Of note, two key changes in DSM-5 pertinent to older adults are elimination of minor depression from the appendix and elimination of the bereavement exclusion criterion for major depression. In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss. Depressive symptoms are likewise present in other DSM-5 disorders, such as adjustment disorder with depressed mood and mood disorder due to a general medical condition (see Table 5–1 ).

A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

      "title": "Assessment and Management of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

      "abstract": "The Organic Amnestic Syndrome is characterized by a selective cognitive impairment in short- and long-term memory. The syndrome occurs in a state of clear awareness and without any significant loss of the remaining intellectual abilities. Conditions associated with Amnestic Syndrome of either transient or persistent course include thiamine deficiency, head trauma, carbon monoxide poisoning, subarachnoid hemorrhage, herpes simplex encephalitis, brain tumor, bilateral posterior cerebral arterial occlusion, and cerebral hypoxia. Management approaches are similar to those described for demented patients. The most commonly implicated substances are alcohol and sedative-hypnotic drugs. Several other drugs have been reported to produce amnestic disorders, including bromides, isoniazid, and anticholinergic agents. Organic Hallucinosis is a syndrome characterized by recurrent or persistent hallucinations attributable to specific organic factors judged to be etiologically related to the disturbance. Alcoholic Hallucinosis consists of vivid auditory hallucinations developing shortly after cessation or reduction of heavy ingestion of alcohol in an individual who apparently has alcohol dependence.",

      "abstract": "The clinical picture of alcohol withdrawal syndrome lies somewhere on a continuum that ranges from slight morning tremor to genuine delirium tremens. The diagnosis, usually easy, may be beset with several traps: alcoholism may be unrecognized, or a diagnosis other than withdrawal syndrome may be wrongly made, or again a complication may be either overlooked or erroneously suspected. An acute withdrawal syndrome normally regresses in less than one week, but a subacute withdrawal syndrome, which presents as signs of residual hyperexcitability of the central nervous system, must be recognized, as it may persist for several months. Beside delirium tremens, with its mandatory and well-established treatment, prevention of alcohol withdrawal syndrome and treatment of its initial stages raise no problems, as it consists above all of psychotherapy combined by such tranquillizers as febarbamate or a benzodiazepine taken in well-specified dosage.",

Approximately 1% of Americans have used illicit stimulants in the past month, and nearly 25,000 deaths were attributed to stimulant overdose in 2017. Acute effects include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and euphoria. High doses of stimulants may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, severe hypertension, agitation, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, stroke, hyperthermia, or rhabdomyolysis. Abstinence after regular use of stimulants may lead to dysphoria, fatigue, insomnia, and agitation. People who use stimulants may present with acute effects or medical complications. Cocaine metabolites and amphetamines can be detected in urine for a few days after use. The most serious complications of acute use are cardiovascular (especially myocardial infarction and stroke) and psychiatric (agitation and delirium); the risk of hyperthermia is also increased. A number of psychosocial modalities appear to reduce stimulant use among selected individuals, including individual and group counseling, cognitive–behavioral therapy, contingency management, and community reinforcement. No medication has been consistently shown to reduce complications and use of stimulants, although prescription stimulants and topiramate show some promise for treating cocaine use disorder. Syringe exchange programs and safe consumption sites are associated with decreased stimulant use-related complications. Caffeine has mild stimulant effects and may lead to a mild dependence syndrome.",

      "title": "Síndrome de sobreentrenamiento",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

      "abstract": "Abstract Elderly individuals, particularly those with cognitive impairment, are oftentimes restless during the night, and this increases the distress of relatives, professional carers and themselves. A number of conditions other than dementia need to be considered from nyctophobia and insomnophobia, to pain, specific motor disorders during sleep, parasomnias as REM-sleep behaviour disorder, dipping, hypoglycemia, withdrawal or excessive tea, coffee and alcohol consumption. A clear-cut differential diagnosis between dementia and delirium is not always possible, as dementia is the major risk factor for confusional states decreasing the vulnerability by anticholinergic medication and any other disruptive factor, biological or psychological. Treatment of nocturnal agitation usually requires (1) reassurance and re-orientation; (2a) the discontinuation of anticholinergic substances; (2b) symptomatic psychotropic intervention; and (3) causal treatment of underlying problems. Benzodiazepines should only be used at the lowest necessary dosage for the shortest possible time, particularly in individuals who are already benzodiazepine-dependent. Quetiapine or mirtazapine at low dosages can be employed in patients with psychotic or depressive symptoms. Melatonin and its derivatives hold promise for chronic circadian rhythm disorders. There is no “one fits all” recipe for this notorious problem and each case needs to be examined individually.",

      "abstract": "In the study of the instances of the disease which I have just described, it was most clearly evident from their pathological course that their existence was intimately connected with a disturbance of some kind in the nervous system, and essentially dependent upon it. In both predisposition existed, in so far that the one (Case I.) the woman was worn out with anxiety, want of rest, etc., from nursing the member of her family who died just before the first attack of the disease, she was hysterical and nervous; in the other (Case II.) he had been subjected for years to severe responsibilities, cares, and worries, which had impaired his general health. In Case I, complete recovery took place after a certain length of time, and she remained well, until experiencing another mental emotion and shock—from business reverses—a relapse occurred. From this time on, every relapse slight or great, every recrudescence of the cutaneous symptoms, subjective or objective, could be traced to some such slight or severe mental emotion or impression, or increased worry, or care, or anxiety and furthermore the grade of the relapse, whether transient or grave, varied according to the grade of the emotion, shock, or other disturbance received. It was also constantly seen how objective manifestations constantly followed immediately upon neuralgic pains, or a hemicrania or some other evidence of sensory innervation. Still more conclusive, perhaps, of the neurotic character of the disease was the observation that diminution in the severity of the subjective and objective manifestations occurred in proportion as the patient's morale improved, and the final cessation of the pathological symptoms and entire quiescence of the disease were only obtained when the changed circumstances of the patient's life protected her against the occurrence of mental emotions or shocks and precluded the experience of annoyances, worries, or cares.

The term manic-depressive illness was introduced by Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) in the late nineteenth century.1 It is in most patients a chronic illness with recurrent manic and depressive episodes, usually alternated with periods with normal mood between the episodes. A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

      "abstract": "Ketamine is an anesthetic drug that is also used for off-label indications such as the mediation of analgesia and sedation in various settings. It is additionally recognized as an agent with antidepressant potential. For depression, it is most commonly administered as a slow intravenous infusion in subanesthetic doses (usually 0.5 mg/kg). As an antidepressant, is strikingly different from conventional antidepressant drugs in that it brings about rapid and marked attenuation of depressive symptoms even in patients with refractory depression. The benefits are observed within hours of administration, peak after about a day, and are lost 3-12 days later. Patients who do not benefit after the initial dose may benefit with serial dosing or at higher doses. Benefits can be maintained for weeks to months by the continuation of ketamine sessions at 2- to 4-day intervals. Adverse effects include dissociative and psychotomimetic changes that are almost always mild and transient, if present; transient elevation of heart rate and blood pressure often occur. These changes are usually well tolerated and are very seldom responsible for treatment discontinuation. Whereas ketamine is an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, and whereas much is known about its different biological effects, its actions that mediate the antidepressant response are presently not known for certain. Although big data on ketamine are presently unavailable, the drug holds promise in the treatment of depression, especially refractory depression.",

Psychological factors are decisive, and they usually include a major anxiety generated by intrapsychic conflicts, which are converted by unconscious defense mechanism into symptoms. The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing.

      "abstract": "Abstract When individuals, regardless of their age, are subjected to a significant psychosocial stressor, two possible outcomes are likely—in one instance the person is not significantly affected by the stressor and proceeds on with their life without indication of perceptible problem. In the other possible scenario, the individual experiences a negative reaction to the stressor. Herein, at some point the person begins to exhibit behavioral, mood, or emotional symptoms, the person is then described as manifesting an adjustment disorder, and there is then the need to initiate change in order to restore even functioning. It is important to emphasize that adjustment disorders differ from acute stress disorders in that the latter represent reactions to extraordinary traumatic stressors (i.e., life‐threatening events).",

      "abstract": "Fatal catatonia is considered a complication to the usual schizophrenic course. The syndrome may occur in cases of apparent health or show itself as an exacerbation during any form of schizophrenia. The heredobiologic and pathophysiologic mechanisms, and the clinical course prove that this syndrome does not represent a separate schizophrenic group but merely a complication. The symptoms are: A prodromal phase which lasts from 2 weeks to a few months and shows the usual schizophrenic pattern. First Phase.—Increasing perplexity and intense anxiety; incoherence; extreme restlessness; a \"blind drive for annihilation\" and suicidal tendencies; acrocyanosis, increased blood-pressure. Second Phase.—Motor restlessness changing to a more primitive pattern; consciousness becomes increasingly clouded; unusual hematopoietic changes of the blood; blood pressure falls; pulse is rapid and weak; pupils are dilated and react sluggishly to light; reflexes are decreased; high elevation of temperature; pronounced cyanosis; petechial hemorrhages into the tissue; sudden respiratory death or vasomotor collapse. Autopsy Findings.—Negative except for petechial hemorrhages into the tissues, and transformation of the fatty bone marrow to the erythropoietic state. A theory of possible \"asthenic metabolic changes\" due to disturbances in the hormonal-vegetative system, and its practical application were discussed.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is a disease of the brain defined by any of the following conditions at least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring >24 hours apart, one unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years, diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome. Epilepsy can cause many consequences, such as using long-term antiepileptic drugs.It is important to know when drug administration starts and the right drug selection. The choice of type of drug is mainly based on the type of seizure. Other factors to consider are the age of the patient and the existing comorbidities. In the course of efforts to achieve seizure free, sometimes the addition of drugs or drug substitution is needed. Absolute drug substitution is done if serious side effects occur to the patient. The other indication of drug substitution is if there is no improvement in the frequency and severity of the seizure.After a seizure-free period is reached, the next problem is when to stop the drug. Discontinuation of the drug has the consequence of the risk of recurrent seizures. But on the other hand, the cessation of AED in some cases corrects the side effects that arise from the drug. Some literatures suggest the termination of OAE begins after 3 years of seizure free. But when referring to the definition of epilepsy issued by ILAE in 2014, that epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who have remained seizure-free for the last 10 years, with no seizure medicines for the last 5 years, then the cessation of the drug is carried out after 5 years of seizure-free period.",

Un paciente con insomnio presenta consecuencias diurnas como fatiga, somnolencia, deterioro de la memoria, cambios en el estado de ánimo, en la concentración, así como en su desempeño social o familiar, entre otros. La asociación de este padecimiento con la salud física y mental es importante debido al impacto que tiene en la calidad y la esperanza de vida de los que lo padecen.

Induction of mania in our patient is keeping with the literature regarding induction or worsening of hypomanic or manic symptoms at a lower dose of quetiapine. Hypomanic or manic symptoms at a low dose of quetiapine are brief and seem to reverse the effect by either discontinuing the causing agent or increasing it dose. Quetiapine being an atypical antipsychotic possess antidepressant property at low doses as well as mood stabilizer at higher doses. At lower dose, due to its serotonergic antagonism property, quetiapine appears to induce or worsen hypomanic or manic symptoms. As the dosage increases its dopamine antagonistic activity become more prominent and the medication acts as a mood stabilizer. This is one of the possible explanations of disappearing of manic or hypomanic symptoms at a higher dose.",

When treatment with a CNS drug is discontinued, patients can experience classic new withdrawal symptoms, rebound and/or persistent postwithdrawal disorders, or relapse/recurrence of the original illness [6, 9, 14] . New and rebound symptoms can occur for up to 6 weeks after drug withdrawal, depending on the drug elimination half-life [2, 3] , while persistent postwithdrawal or tardive disorders associated with longlasting receptor changes may persist for more than 6 weeks after drug discontinuation. Initial withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs have been reported to be more frequent and severe when high-potency drugs and drugs with a short elimination half-life have been used [9, 10] . CNS drugs with a shorter elimination half-life and rapid onset of action also carry a higher risk of dependency and high-dose use [9, 10] . Withdrawal symptoms can be relatively short-lasting, lasting for a few hours to a few weeks with complete recovery, while others may persist and last for several months [1, 15, 16] . Fava et al. [1] have proposed using the terminology ‘withdrawal syndrome’ to replace the term ‘discontinuation syndrome’, which has been most often used to describe SSRI withdrawal. They have recommended the Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in clinical practice, and have advanced the treatment of depression and other mental disorders. However, more studies are needed on the effects of decreasing and discontinuing these medications after their long-term use [1] . Withdrawal symptoms may occur with all SSRIs and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [1] , similarly to other CNS drugs, including benzodiazepines [2–4] and antipsychotics [5, 6] . Withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drugs produces psychiatric symptoms that can be confounded with true relapse or recurrence of the original illness [1, 2, 7] . When discontinuing or decreasing SSRIs, withdrawal symptoms must be identified to avoid prolonging treatment or giving unnecessarily high doses [6, 8] . Different types of syndromes have been described with the withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drug classes, including benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants, opiates, barbiturates, and alcohol: (1) new withdrawal symptoms (classic withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs) [1, 4–6, 9–12] , (2) rebound [2, 6, 9, 13–16] , and (3) persistent postwithdrawal disorders [7, 17, 18] ( table 1 ). These types of withdrawal need to be differentiated from relapse and recurrence of the original illness.

Specifically, a young person may have an underlying biological or cognitive vulnerability to bipolar disorder, which results in the reduced effectiveness of the person's “shock absorbers” for significant events. Therefore, when a significant event occurs, he/she may experience more marked cognitive, behavioral, or affective change than would someone without the disorder. Following this, he/she may experience either decreased social or occupational functioning or social withdrawal leading to depression, or increased activity and sleep disruption resulting in mania. These changes may in turn exacerbate the initial mood state, and lead to a cycle towards more marked symptomatology (see Figure 6.1).",

Some of these symptoms, that include an array of behavioral and psychiatric manifestations, are known as behavioral and psychiatric (or psychological) symptoms of dementia (BPSD). For several reasons they are an important case for General Practitioner consultation. Some of the se symptoms tend to oc cur si mul ta ne ously, in factors, such as psychosis (agitation and aggressiveness), mood (depression and anxiety), frontal behavior (desinhibition and euphoria), apathy and insomnia. The cause of these symptoms can be dementia itself, and in some situations they are a core diagnostic feature in the diagnosis. However, the possibility of a drug or a somatic disease as a cause for the se symptoms must always be actively sought, especially if the BPSD have a particular clinical presentation. So, the exclusion of another medial disorder (that is non demential) is mandatory. After excluding other causes, a treatment with an anti-dementia drug must be offered, as there is evidence that acetylcholines terase inhibitors and memantine improve, not only cognition, but also BPSD in some dementia (including Alzheimer's disease). Then, non-pharmacologial measures must be started. However, a pharmacological treatment with psychotropic drugs should also be started, if treatment is urgent or the symptoms severe. The symptom or symptoms should be identified and the therapeutic targeted for those specific symptoms. Despite the clinical trials performed with psychotropics for BPSD are uncommon and sometimes have questionable designs, it is very important to treat these symptoms. Care givers should also be instructed on how to deal with BPSD. Whenever a BPSD is difficult to control, especially if not improving after a trial with the measures here described, a referral for Neurologic or Psychiatric evaluation should be done. There ferral note should be \"BPSD [specify] severe and not improving after treatment with [specify]\".",

      "title": "Adjustment disorders: the state of the art",
      "abstract": "The diagnostic category of adjustment disorder was introduced in the DSM-III-R 1. Prior to that, it was called transient situational disturbance. The DSM-IV 2 and ICD-10 3 descriptions of adjustment disorder are broadly similar. The main features are the following: a) the symptoms arise in response to a stressful event; b) the onset of symptoms is within 3 months (DSM-IV) or 1 month (ICD-10) of exposure to the stressor; c) the symptoms must be clinically significant, in that they are distressing and in excess of what would be expected by exposure to the stressor and/or there is significant impairment in social or occupational functioning (the latter is mandatory in ICD-10); d) the symptoms are not due to another axis I disorder (or bereavement in DSM-IV); e) the symptoms resolve within 6 months once the stressor or its consequences are removed. Adjustment disorders are divided into subgroups based on the dominant symptoms of anxiety, depression or behaviour. Since its introduction, the category of adjustment disorder has been the subject of criticism on three fronts. The first was that it constituted an attempt to medicalize problems of living and did not conform to the criteria for traditional disorders such as having a specific symptom profile 4. The second was that it was a \"wastebasket diagnosis\" which was assigned to those who failed to meet the criteria for other disorders 5. The third was on its diagnostic instability 6 and that its main utility was to serve as a \"justification\" for diagnosis-based reimbursement operating in the healthcare system of the US. Despite this, the category has been retained in the further classifications, in large measure due to its clinical utility. Adjustment disorder continues to be diagnosed in a range of clinical settings. Consultation-liaison psychiatry is the context in which the diagnosis is most likely to be made. Around 12% of referrals are so diagnosed in university hospitals in the US 7, a figure that resembles that in European hospitals 8. Nevertheless, the frequency with which adjustment disorder is now diagnosed seems to be declining, in parallel with an increase in the diagnosis of major depression 9, possibly due to the availability of psychotropic drugs, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), that are safer in those who are medically ill than the older agents. So, changes in the prevalence of adjustment disorders may reflect a change in the \"culture of prescribing\", stimulating changes in the \"culture of diagnosis\" 10. Adjustment disorder has been reported to be almost three times as common as major depression (13.7 vs. 5.1%) in acutely ill medical in-patients 11 and to be diagnosed in up to one third of cancer patients experiencing a recurrence 12. In obstetric/gynaecology consultation-liaison 13, adjustment disorders predominated over other mood disorders. Among those assessed in an emergency department following self harm, a diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% of those interviewed, while a diagnosis of major depression was made in 19.5% of cases 14. None of the major epidemiological studies carried out in the community, such as the Epidemiological Catchment Area Study 15, the National Comorbidity Survey Replication 16 or the National Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys 17 included adjustment disorder among the conditions examined. An exception was the Outcome of Depression International Network (ODIN) study 18, which found a prevalence of only 1% for adjustment disorder in five European countries. A possible reason for this was that mild depression was included in the depressive episode category, inflating that category at the expense of adjustment disorder. By contrast, a study of elderly people from the general population 19 found the prevalence of adjustment disorder to be 2.3%, similar to that of major depression. Adjustment disorder is reported to be very common in primary care, but relevant epidemiological studies in this setting are rare and report rates of the disorder range from 1 to 18% 20,21 among consulters with mental health problems. Concerning psychiatric settings, a study of intake diagnoses into outpatient clinics 22, combining clinical evaluation and the use of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID, 23), found that adjustment disorder was the most common clinical diagnosis, made in 36% of patients, whereas the diagnosis was made in about 11% of cases using SCID. Among psychiatric inpatients, 9% of consecutive admissions to an acute public sector unit were diagnosed with adjustment disorder 24. Quantifying the prevalence of adjustment disorder in child and adolescent populations is difficult, due to changes in the diagnostic criteria over time 25. In the younger age groups, unlike adults, adjustment disorder carries with it significant morbidity and a poor outcome, frequently developing into major psychiatric illness 25,26. A general population study in Puerto Rico 27 found a rate of 4.2% among 14–16 year old people, while the total psychiatric morbidity was 17.8%. A similar rate was found in children aged 8–9 in Finland 28. Among outpatients, figures of 5.9–7% have been reported 29,30. In child liaison psychiatry, over one third of those with recent onset diabetes were so diagnosed 31, making it the most common psychiatric disorder to follow this well defined stressor. The current diagnosis of adjustment disorder assumes that there is a stressor which acts as a trigger and that the condition is self-limiting. So, adjustment disorder is closer to the definition of a discrete disorder as proposed by Kendell 32 than most other disorders in psychiatry, since its etiology and course are encapsulated within the diagnosis, while the definition of many other mental disorders is cross-sectional and based on symptoms alone. Yet, the current classifications impose a hierarchical model that assumes equivalence in how adjustment disorder and other diagnoses are construed. As currently classified, adjustment disorder is a sub-threshold diagnosis, that is trumped once the symptom threshold for another diagnosis is met. There is an inherent belief that a sub-threshold condition is less severe than a full-blown disorder such as major depression, the diagnosis by which adjustment disorder is most often superseded. Yet, the evidence for this is lacking, and there is empirical data 33 that, when measures of symptom severity or social functioning are examined, there is no difference between those with mood disorders and adjustment disorder. Furthermore, up to 25% of adolescents with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder engage in suicidal behaviour 34, while among adults with this disorder the figure is 60% 35. Adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide 36, while among all suicide deaths in the developing world it is the most common diagnosis 37. These data show that, far from being a mild condition, adjustment disorder has a significant impact on behaviour. On the other hand, the current classifications fail to distinguish between adaptive and maladaptive reactions to stress. The DSM-IV tries to address this problem by stating that a diagnosis of adjustment disorder is only made when the distress is of clinical significance 38. There are two components to this: the distress must be in excess of what would normally be expected and/or there is an impairment in social or occupational function. In relation to the first of these, one of the most insightful critics of the DSM-IV, J. Wakefield 39, points out that it would allow the top third in the normal distribution of mood reactivity to be classified as disordered, and that it does not take into account the contextual factors that might cause this excess in distress. For example, the loss of a job for one person might be manageable while for another it could heap poverty on a family resulting in distress that might not be inappropriate under the circumstances. Cultural differences in the expression of emotion also need to be considered. In liaison psychiatry, where the diagnosis of adjustment disorder is most frequently made, a knowledge of \"normal\" coping with illness in that specific culture is essential and the diagnostic process will be guided by the extent to which an individual's symptoms are in excess of this. Some might argue that the fact of visiting a doctor indicates abnormal distress, yet the tendency to consult is also determined by factors additional to illness, including cultural and personal attitudes to symptoms. So, the mere fact of a consultation should not of itself be taken as a proxy measure of excessive distress. Neither should the decision to refer to psychiatric services, since this too is governed by factors that are not always related to symptom severity (e.g., a wish \"to do something\" under pressure from a patient in the face of continuing distress). Because adjustment disorder is a diagnosis made in the context of a stressor, there is a danger that any distress following such an event might be labelled as a disorder 40. Clinical judgement, therefore, plays a large part in making the diagnosis of adjustment disorder in the current criterion vacuum and future classifications should accord weight to culture, context and personal circumstances in differentiating normal from pathological distress. The second criterion, requiring impairment in functioning, is arguably a more robust indicator of disorder, since it is this which leads to treatment seeking. For example, the inability to work is potentially a significant indicator of impairment. However, there may be situations where functioning is reduced in the presence of non-pathological reactions. For instance, if the circumstances are especially traumatic, such as the loss of a child, the period of impaired function may be longer than anticipated in those with non-pathological responses. The evaluation of functioning in children places special demands on the assessor, since it has to be set against the demands of the developmental stage, and the degree of dependency and autonomy in key relationships. The presence of pre-existing impairment and extant vulnerabilities, such as learning disability and developmental disorders, must also be considered when making the evaluation. The ICD-10, contrary to the DSM-IV, requires the presence of both excessive symptoms and functional impairment for the diagnosis of adjustment disorder, thus narrowing the application of this category. Because of the hierarchical nature of ICD-10 and DSM-IV, adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed once the criteria for another condition are met. The condition that most frequently trumps adjustment disorder is major depression/depressive episode. This is evident from studies that compare the clinical with the research approach. For example, in a study of those presenting because of self-harm, a clinical diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% and one of major depression in 19.5% of cases, but using SCID the proportions changed to 7.8% and 36.4% respectively 14. However, there is a point of departure between the two conditions when other variables are considered. Suicidal behaviour occurs earlier in the course of adjustment disorder as compared to major depression 41 and the interval from suicidal communication to completion of suicide is shorter 42. The socio-demographic profile and childhood risk variables differ between the two groups 41. Among adolescents dying by suicide, there is much less evidence of prior emotional or behavioural problems 42. In addition, the readmission rates for those with adjustment disorder are significantly lower than for those with major depression, generalized anxiety or dysthymia 43 and hospitalization is also shorter 6. This highlights the need for the clearer operationalization of adjustment disorder in future classifications. A further but lesser area of potential overlap is with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The conflation is not so much related to the symptoms of these disorders but to the stressors themselves. There has been an expansion in the stressors that are deemed to trigger PTSD, from those that are potentially life threatening, as originally described, to events that are less traumatic, such as financial problems or watching distressing images on television – a phenomenon called \"criterion creep\" 44. In clinical practice, a diagnosis of PTSD is often made reflexively 45 once such an event is identified, although adjustment disorder might be a more appropriate diagnosis. Overall, it is clear from the data available that adjustment disorder is sufficiently severe and distinct from other disorders, especially major depression, to warrant upgrading from its sub-syndromal status to that of a full-blown and independent mental disorder. Criteria for the DSM-IV revision have already been suggested 46. The Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS, 47) and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI, 48) do not incorporate adjustment disorder at all. The Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN, 49) do include adjustment disorder, but only at the end of the interview, in section 13, which deals with \"inferences and attributions\". This comes after the criteria for all other disorders have been completed, and there are no specific questions with regard to adjustment disorder to assist the interviewer, relying instead on clinical judgement. The SCID 23 also includes a section dealing with adjustment disorder, but the instructions to interviewers specify that this diagnosis is not made if the criteria for any other mental disorder are met, with the de facto effect of relegating it to a sub-syndromal status. In light of the very low threshold for diagnosing major depression, even in studies using SCID and purporting to be inclusive of adjustment disorder, major depression will often supersede adjustment disorder, irrespective of the context in which the symptoms have arisen. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI, 50) also incorporates a section on adjustment disorder but, as in SCID, that disorder is trumped when any other diagnosis is made. So, while structured interviews have greatly facilitated epidemiological research in psychiatry, the possibility that they are overly rigid, having been designed for use by lay interviewers, cannot be excluded. This is especially pertinent for a diagnosis such as adjustment disorder, which relies heavily on clinical judgement, context and presumptive longitudinal course rather than symptoms alone. As a result of the problems with the current crop of structured diagnostic instruments, attempts have been made to identify suitable screening instruments for adjustment disorder. Because there is symptom overlap with major depression, there is a possibility that instruments which screen for depression might identify people with adjustment disorder. A number of scales have been used for this purpose, including the Zung Depression Scale 51, which has been shown to be an adequate screen for adjustment disorder and major depression combined 52, but when compared to SCID has inadequate sensitivity and specificity 53. A study of health care workers with \"reactive depression\", an old-fashioned diagnosis but one which encapsulates the concept of adjustment disorder most closely, found little correlation with the Zung scale score 54. Efforts to develop a screening instrument using a coping measure have also been unsuccessful 55. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, 56) has been used for screening purposes in cancer patients, but it does not distinguish between major depression and adjustment disorder 57. Similar problems arose when the 1-Question Interview and the Impact Thermometer 58 were tested for their ability to screen for adjustment disorder. The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology 59 might have a role in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression and has been used in one study reporting that non-environmentally induced disorder had more melancholic symptoms and a different quality to the mood changes compared to environmentally triggered disorder 59. Further investigation of this is clearly required. Adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed in the absence of a stressor. The event must be external and occur in close time proximity to the onset of symptoms. The longer the time period between the triggering event and the onset of symptoms, the less likely is the diagnosis to be adjustment disorder. For this reason, a period between the event and symptom onset of 3 months in DSM-IV and 1 month in ICD-10 is required. Caution must be exercised when this gap is relatively long, for two reasons: firstly, those who are depressed often attach significance to particular events, that in themselves were neutral in effect at the time, in an \"effort at meaning\"; secondly, recall bias may lead to an unreliable date of the event. The 3 month upper limit may prove to be excessively long and it is difficult to ascertain the empirical data on which this is based. Concerning the type of event, there is little to assist the clinician in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression. While 100% of those with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder have recent life events, 83% of those with major depression also report such events, with more related to marital problems and fewer to occupational or family stressors in the adjustment disorder group 60. Such differences, while statistically significant, are unlikely to be clinically meaningful in an individual patient, since they are not exclusive as precipitants to either major depression or adjustment disorder. And the events can range in severity from those that are generally regarded as mild, such as a row with a boyfriend, to those that are more serious. This will be mediated by individual vulnerability. In the preamble to the section on adjustment disorder, the ICD-10 states that \"individual vulnerability and risk plays a greater role than in other disorders\" such as PTSD or acute stress reactions. However, it is unclear on what evidence this is based. By contrast, the DSM-IV is silent on this issue. The possibility that a diathesis-stress model operates is worthy of consideration and personality is arguably the most obvious predisposing factor. There have been few studies directly comparing adjustment disorder against other disorders to allow definitive claims about the role of personality, and caution is advisable in the current state of knowledge. The relevant studies can be classified in two broad groups: those directly examining adjustment disorder and those examining diagnoses akin to adjustment disorder. The prevalence of personality disorder among those with adjustment disorder in comparison to those with other depressive disorders seems to be not different 20, although studies are few and numbers small. Among personality dimensions, neuroticism emerged as a factor predisposing to adjustment disorder in a military sample 61. Attachment style has also been examined, and maternal overprotection was found to be a risk factor for later adjustment disorder 62,63, while paternal abuse was associated with the severity of the disorder 63. Studies using terminologies that imply a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, such as \"reactive\", \"non-endogenous\" or \"situational\" depression, are also of interest, although there is a caveat that these conditions may not be identical to adjustment disorder due to differences in the definitions in the earlier classifications. One such study 64 found that the strongest relationship was between premorbid neuroticism and a non-endogenous symptom pattern and evidence of \"oral dependent\" personality. The findings in relation to neuroticism and a non-endogenous pattern of symptoms were replicated by others 65 in studies of subjects and their relatives 66. The absence of clear symptomatological criteria for adjustment disorder in either DSM-IV or ICD-10 means that greater weight is attached to clinical judgement than in most other current conditions. Symptoms of low mood, sadness, worry, anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration, having their onset following a recent stressful event are likely indicators of a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, although it must be borne in mind that major depression can also present similarly. Mood disturbance is often more noticeable when the person is cognitively engaged with the event, such as when speaking about it, while at other times mood is normal and reactive. The removal of the person from the stressful situation is associated with a general improvement in symptoms. In the case of those who develop adjustment disorder in response to serious illness, changes in mood are related to changes in the illness itself. The more typically \"melancholic\" the symptoms are — e.g., diurnal change, early morning wakening, loss of mood reactivity — the less likely is the diagnosis of adjustment disorder. A family history of depression might also suggest a depressive episode. Due to the low symptom threshold for diagnosing major depression, it is easy to make a diagnosis of this condition rather than adjustment disorder. While the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines on depression recommend a period of \"watchful waiting\" 67, so as to allow for the possibility of spontaneous resolution, under pressure from the patient and his/her family, or the doctor's own desire \"to do something\", a diagnosis of major depression (or generalized anxiety) may be made and antidepressants prescribed. Difficulties also arise when the stressor, and hence the symptoms, is persistent and has little likelihood of resolving. Antidepressants may be prescribed on pragmatic grounds, as there is no way of establishing if the symptoms are likely to spontaneously remit or if they are now independent of the initial trigger and constitute major depression. The absence of a response to antidepressants should raise the possibility that this is an adjustment disorder, so that psychological therapies are offered rather than engaging in protracted trails of multiple medications. A further consideration is that what appears to be a single stressor (e.g., a diagnosis of a serious physical illness) may be associated with ongoing symptoms as different facets of the diagnosis impinge upon the patient (e.g., the initiation of painful treatments, treatment failures, etc.). Failure to appreciate that rolling stressors prolong symptoms might lead to an erroneous diagnosis of major depression. The role of the consequences of the initial stressor in prolonging symptoms is recognized in the DSM-IV definition of adjustment disorder. Based on the predominant symptoms, several subtypes of adjustment disorder are recognised by DSM-IV and ICD-10 (Table 1). The subtypes are broadly similar in the two classifications but, apart from adjustment disorder with depressed mood, they have received little attention. The depressed subtype is the most common in adults, while the subtypes with predominant disturbance of conduct or of conduct and emotions are more commonly diagnosed among children and adolescents. The distinction between adjustment disorder and a normal stress response is based on the severity of symptoms and their duration; the impact on functioning taking into account the nature of the stressor; the personal and interpersonal context in which it has occurred; cultural norms with regard to such responses. PTSD and acute stress disorder require the presence of a stressor of a magnitude that would be traumatic for almost everybody and the symptom constellation is also specific, although both of these have recently been challenged 40. Moreover, not everybody exposed to such traumatic events responds by developing PTSD and the possibility that other disorders can follow instead needs to be considered. For those not meeting the PTSD diagnostic criteria, but with significant symptoms and/or functional impairment, adjustment disorder should be considered a possible alternative. What may appear to be an adjustment disorder, because of the sub-threshold level of the symptoms or the lack of functional impairment, might be an axis I disorder in evolution that only emerges as a recognizable syndrome after a period of watchful waiting. Thus, the revision of an index diagnosis of adjustment disorder may be necessary at times, especially if there are persisting symptoms in spite of termination of the stressor. Few studies have examined the disorders that are comorbid with adjustment disorder, an exercise that is hampered by the fact that the criteria for this disorder preclude axis I comorbidity. Yet, a recent study 19 found that almost half of patients exhibited comorbidity with major depression or PTSD. Surprisingly, complicated grief and adjustment disorder were not significantly comorbid. The relationship between substance abuse and adjustment disorder is also deserving of mention, since it may explain the seeming instability of the adjustment disorder diagnosis. Firstly, substances may be misused for relief of symptoms such as anxiety and depression, which are prominent in adjustment disorder. Substances such as alcohol are themselves depressogenic and may present with mood changes leading to misdiagnosis. This may explain why in one study 6 several patients with an admission diagnosis of adjustment disorder were relabelled on discharge as having a primary diagnosis of substance misuse. The evidence base for the treatment of adjustment disorder is limited, due to the paucity of studies. A further problem is that these are self-remitting conditions, so that trials of interventions may fail to identify any benefits due to spontaneous resolution. In general, brief therapies are regarded as being the most appropriate, with the exception that, when stressors are ongoing, prolonged supportive measures may be necessary. However, there is a caveat for children and adolescents diagnosed with adjustment disorder, since there is evidence 26 that a majority of adolescents eventually develop major mental disorders. Practical measures may be useful to assist the person in managing the stressful situation. A person being bullied at work might decide to invoke an internal redress system or may seek the support of the trade union. A person in an abusive relationship might seek a barring order. A vulnerable person taking on too much work may benefit from simple, directive advice. Harnessing family members' input, involving supportive agencies such as social services or encouraging involvement in a support or self-help group may alleviate distress. Psychological therapies, delivered individually or in groups, span the range including supportive, psychoeducational, cognitive and psychodynamic approaches. Relaxation techniques can reduce symptoms of anxiety. Facilitating the verbalization of fears and emotions and exploring the meaning that the stressor has for the individual might also ameliorate symptoms. In persons who engage in deliberate self-harm, assistance in finding alternative responses that do not involve self-destruction may be of benefit and to date dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has the best evidence base 68. Ego enhancing therapy was found to be useful during periods of transition in older patients 69. \"Mirror therapy\", a therapy including psychocorporeal, cognitive, and neurolinguistic components, was effective in patients with adjustment disorder secondary to myocardial infarction 70. Cognitive therapy was helpful when administered to patients with adjustment disorder who experienced work-related stress 71 and among army conscripts with adjustment disorder 72. In a study of terminally cancer patients 73, similar improvements were found in those with adjustment disorder and other psychiatric diagnoses. Some of these psychological interventions have been tested in specific medically ill groups, such as those with cancer, heart disease or HIV. While improvements in coping have been demonstrated, it is unclear if subjects had adjustment disorder, some were open pilot studies (e.g., 74) and survival and quality of life rather than symptoms were the outcome measures in others (e.g., 75). The basic pharmacological management of adjustment disorder consists of symptomatic treatment of insomnia, anxiety and panic attacks. The use of benzodiazepines to relieve these is common 76. While antidepressants are advocated by some 77, especially if there has been no benefit from psychotherapy, there is little solid evidence to support their use. Nevertheless, those with sedative properties targeting sleep and anxiety may have a role when benzodiazepines are contraindicated 78, such as in those with a history of substance dependence. There are few trials specifically directed to the pharmacological treatment of adjustment disorder and these are mainly on subjects with the anxiety subtype 79,80,81,82,83,84,85. A study 79 comparing a benzodiazepine with a non-benzodiazepine found that the anxiolytic effects of each were similar, although more responded to the non-benzodiazepine. Two randomized placebo-controlled trials examined herbal remedies, including extracts from kava-kava 80 and valerian plus other extracts 81, and demonstrated a positive effect on symptoms. A study found that tianeptine, alprazolam and mianserine were equally effective 82, while a pilot study of cancer patients with anxious and depressed mood found trazodone superior to a benzodiazepine 83. One study in primary care 84 examined the response of patients with major depression and with adjustment disorder to antidepressants, using reported changes in functional disability based on case note information. Overall, the adjustment disorder group was twice as likely to respond to antidepressants. However, as this was a retrospective case note study, the relevance of the findings is questionable. One study compared pharmacological and psychological interventions in subjects with adjustment disorder randomly assigned to supportive psychotherapy, an antidepressant, a benzodiazepine or placebo, and found that all improved significantly 85. Overall, these studies lend little support for the superiority of antidepressants, and arguably for any specific treatment, in the management of adjustment disorder, but further studies are clearly required. Adjustment disorders are common mental disorders, especially in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Their prevalence seems to be higher in children and adolescents, in whom they are associated with significant morbidity and a poorer outcome than in adults. Suicidal behaviour is common in both adolescents and adults with these disorders, and adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide. There are major problems with the diagnostic criteria for adjustment disorder in both ICD-10 and DSM-IV. The most prominent of these is the status as sub-syndromal conditions. This has resulted in their being the subject of little research. Furthermore, current classifications fail to provide guidance on distinguishing these disorders from normal adaptive reactions to stress, and encourage the diagnosis of major depression in people with self-limiting reactions to stressors. Treatments for adjustment disorders are underinvestigated, although brief psychological interventions are likely to be the preferred option.",

      "title": "[Heroin addiction].",
      "abstract": "Heroin is an illicit, highly addictive drug. It is either the most abused or the most rapidly acting member of opioids. Abusers describe a feeling of a surge of pleasurable sensation, named as \"rush\" or \"high\". Repeated administration of high doses of heroin results in the induction of physical dependence. Physical dependence refers to an altered physiological state produced by chronic administration of heroin which necessitates the continued administration of the drug to prevent the appearance of a characteristic syndrome, the opioid withdrawal or abstinence syndrome. Withdrawal symptoms may occur within a few hours after the last administration of heroin. Symptoms of the withdrawal include restlessness, insomnia, drug craving, diarrhea, muscle and bone pain, cold flashes with goose bumps, and leg movements. Major withdrawal symptoms peak between 48 and 72 hours after the last dose of heroin and subside after about a week. At this time, weakness and depression are pronounced and nausea and vomiting are common. Nevertheless, some chronic addicts have shown persistent withdrawal signs for many months or even years. Heroin addiction is considered as a behavioural state of compulsive drug use and a high tendency to relapse after periods of abstinence. It is generally accepted that compulsive use and relapse are typically associated with the status of heroin craving or heroin hunger that are difficult to define but appear to be powerful motivational significance in the addiction process. The route of administering heroin varies largely and may indicate the degree of seriousness of the individual's addiction. Intravenous administration seems to be the predominant method of heroin use, but recently a shift in heroin use pattern has been found, i.e. from injection to sniffing and smoking. Frequent injections coupled with widespread sharing of syringes increase the risk of contracting HIV, hepatitis B, C and other blood-borne infectious diseases. Long-term use of heroin has also severe medical consequences such as scarred veins, bacterial infections of blood vessels, liver and kidney diseases, and lung complications.",

In volunteer subjects, they have been known to produce a variety of intense and unusual psychic effects. These include bizarre visual phenomena, ranging from a heightening of the apparent brightness or beauty of colored objects in the environment, through distortions in the perceived nature or meaning of real objects (illusions) to true visual hallucinations of colors, shapes, or even of complex scenes or events. These visual phenomena are usually accompanied by intense and often rapidly shifting emotional experiences (ranging from mild apprehension to panic, severe depression or mystical elation) or by concurrent emotions (such as depression and joy) which are not experienced simultaneously under ordinary conditions. Subjects describe changes in body image, the body or its parts appearing larger or smaller, intense feelings of depersonalization, including states in which the subject believes he is",

      "title": "Safe Deprescribing of Antidepressants",
      "abstract": "Abstract There are numerous reasons why stopping antidepressants might be prudent, including harms (for example, emotional numbing, sexual issues, and other physical health consequences) outweighing benefits, use beyond guideline recommendations, and patient preference. Withdrawal effects arise due to adaptation to chronic use of antidepressants – often termed physical dependence, distinct from addiction. Withdrawal effects can manifest as either physical or psychological symptoms and can often be mistaken for a return of an underlying condition or onset of a new physical or mental health condition. The most severe withdrawal effects are suicidality, akathisia and protracted withdrawal syndromes which can last for months or years and can sometimes be debilitating. Careful tapering can minimise these effects. After long‐term use tapering should be gradual (months or years), and adjusted to a rate that the individual can tolerate. Dose reduction should be conducted in a hyperbolic pattern (so that decrements become smaller and smaller as the total dose gets lower) to reflect the hyperbolic relationship between dose and receptor occupancy. In order to facilitate gradual hyperbolic tapering formulations other than widely available tablets will be required, including liquid versions, compounded versions or off‐label use of existing formulations. Switching from one antidepressant to fluoxetine can be problematic. Every‐other‐day dosing for antidepressants other than fluoxetine is likely to lead to withdrawal effects.",

      "title": "Alteraciones estructurales de las regiones cerebrales sexuales tras empleo de paroxetina versus agomelatina",
      "abstract": "El estado de animo del individuo es un tono vital interno dominante y mantenido, que influye en el comportamiento de la persona y en su percepcion del mundo. Este puede verse normal o eutimico, elevado o hipertimico; bajo o deprimido. Las alteraciones de la esfera afectiva son un grupo de afecciones clinicas que se caracterizan por la perdida de ese sentido del control y por el sentimiento subjetivo de un gran malestar. (SINTOMAS) Los pacientes con animo deprimido experimentan una perdida de energia y del interes, sentimientos de culpa, dificultades de concentracion, perdida del apetito, pensamientos de muerte… entre otros sintomas. Los trastornos del espectro depresivo, cuentan actualmente con una extensa farmacopea, centrados fundamentalmente por los psicofarmacos del grupo de los antidepresivos. Tanto el propio deterioro animico asi como su tratamiento pueden traer consigo un sintoma adicional, la disfuncion sexual (DS). Los Inhibidores Selectivos de Recaptacion de Serotonina (ISRS) provocan una amplia variedad de DS, desde las mas habituales como descenso en la libido, disminucion de la excitacion y retardo en el orgasmo, a otras mas anecdoticas como priapismo (en pene y clitoris), anestesia genital, anestesia peneana, ereccion, orgasmos y eyaculacion espontaneos, aumento de la libido, orgasmos dolorosos… (F. Arias et al, 2000). A pesar de todo, en las fichas tecnicas, la incidencia de la disfuncion sexual se establece entre 2-16%, muy inferior a la estimada en la practica real (Montejo AL, 2001). A modo de resumen, podemos concluir que existe bibliografia que justifica la DS provocada por los antidepresivos (concretamente los ISRS) en seres humanos, no obstante con las limitaciones: 1) Los pacientes con Trastorno del espectro depresivo pueden presentar en si mismo DS como sintoma de la enfermedad. 2) Los pacientes pueden presentar comorbilidad que de lugar a DS. 3) La infraestimacion de la DS debido a la dificultad que supone recoger en una historia clinica reglada la sexualidad como ritmo biologico esencial. Es por eso que creemos que es esencial dar un paso mas y buscar a nivel biologico, que es lo que se modifica a nivel estructural en la esfera, tras el empleo de psicofarmacos del grupo de los antidepresivos, concretamente comparando un ISRS con un antidepresivo melatoninergico. Para ello creemos que es una herramienta muy util el estudio anatomopatologico del Sistema Nervioso Central de animales de experimentacion. Trabajando sobre las areas cerebrales implicadas en la sexualidad. Nuestra hipotesis de trabajo se basa en que la Paroxetina produce disfuncion sexual y la Agomelatina no, por tanto las regiones cerebrales estudiadas en los animales a los que se les administro Paroxetina mostraran diferencias con respecto a los animales a los que se les administro Agomelatina. La descripcion de dichas diferencias podria dar lugar a las bases que expliquen de forma estructural la disfuncion sexual producida por un ISRS. Para la realizacion de nuestro trabajo hemos utilizado como animal de experimentacion un total de 20 ratas de la raza Wistar que al inicio del tratamiento tenian aproximadamente 50 dias (postpuberales); y un peso aproximado de 150 gr. Esta camada de ratas se divide en 4 grupos: dos experimentales y dos controles. 1) Animales del Grupo control 1 Formado por 4 animales. Una jaula. No se administra ninguna sustancia. 2) Animales del Grupo control 2 Formado por 4 animales. Una jaula. Se admInistra HMC. 3) Animales del Grupo experimental 1 Formado por 6 animales. Dos jaulas de tres animales cada una. Se administra Paroxetina. 4) Animales del Grupo experimental 2 Formado por 6 animales. Dos jaulas de tres animales cada una. Se administra Agomelatina. A todos los animales se les expuso a un ciclo de luz-oscuridad de 12 horas a traves de un punto de luz y un temporizador y se les administro las sustancias correspondientes a lo largo de 28 dias naturales. Se realizo un pesaje de los animales en tres momentos del estudio: al inicio, en el dia 14 y en el dia 28. Pesamos la jaula con animales y sin animales, hallamos la diferencia y hacemos un promedio del peso. A lo largo de los 28 dias se realiza un diario de conducta: conductas extranas, psicomotricidad, subida en patas traseras, olfateo general, olfateo anal, intromisiones, etc. Tras 28 dias de administracion de las sustancias; se procede al sacrificio e inclusion de muestras. Tincion mediante la tecnica inmunohistoquimica con los anticuerpos murinos: • Anticuerpo Tiroxina-Hidroxilasa (TH): es un anticuerpo policlonal de conejo. Concentrada a 1/300 • Anticuerpo Receptor alfa de Estrogenos (RE-a): es un anticuerpo policlonal de conejo. Concentrada a 1/300 • Anticuerpo Oxitocina (OXT): es un anticuerpo policlonal de conejo. Concentrada a 1/500 RESULTADOS FRUTO DE LA OBSERVACION (DIARIO DE CONDUCTA) En el grupo de las ratas a las que se les administro Paroxetina se produjo un importante incremento de peso en comparacion con el grupo al que se le administro Agomelatina. Las primeras doblaron su peso y las segundas experimentaron un incremento del 40% del peso corporal aproximadamente. Estos cambios de peso dieron lugar al reajuste de dosis. En el grupo de Paroxetina llamaba la atencion el intenso apetito que mostraban a partir del dia 10 del estudio. En comparacion con los otros grupos de estudio mostraban una importante voracidad. Ademas mostraban un incremento de la actividad motora que se mostraba en subidas sobre patas traseras y olfateo general. A pesar de todo esto era un grupo de ratas muy colaboradoras, que no mostraban resistencia ni a ser manipuladas ni a la administracion del farmaco. Respecto al grupo de Agomelatina mantenian un apetito estable. La psicomotricidad solo se veia incrementada en el momento de la manipulacion, que comenzaban a dar vueltas alrededor de la jaula. Se mostraban parcialmente colaboradoras a la manipulacion y a la administracion del farmaco, con una conducta ambivalente e imprevisible, en ningun momento agresiva. Los grupos control mantuvieron un apetito estable, no sufrieron incremento ni descenso de peso. Respecto a la psicomotricidad no hay hallazgos destacables. RESULTADOS FRUTO DE LA OBSERVACION A MICROSCOPIO OPTICO .-Sistema dopaminergico: descenso marcado y global en todo el sistema dopaminergicos (desde origenes hasta destinos) en los animales tratadados con Paroxetina comparado con los animales tratados con Agomelatina y los animales control; que fue objetivado mediante el tratamiento estadistico de los datos obtenidos a traves del programa de procesamiento digital ImageJ. .-Sistema oxcitocinergico: no se observan diferencias significativas entre los grupos de estudio .-Sistema receptor alfa de estrogeno: se observa descenso de RE alfa en la pars tuberalis de los animales tratados con Agomelatina.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the diagnostic criteria for hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo to be included in the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders (ICVD). The aim of defining diagnostic criteria of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo is to help clinicians to understand the terminology related to orthostatic dizziness/vertigo and to distinguish orthostatic dizziness/vertigo due to global brain hypoperfusion from that caused by other etiologies. Diagnosis of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo requires: A) five or more episodes of dizziness, unsteadiness or vertigo triggered by arising or present during upright position, which subsides by sitting or lying down; B) orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia syndrome or syncope documented on standing or during head-up tilt test; and C) not better accounted for by another disease or disorder. Probable hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo is defined as follows: A) five or more episodes of dizziness, unsteadiness or vertigo triggered by arising or present during upright position, which subsides by sitting or lying down; B) at least one of the following accompanying symptoms: generalized weakness/tiredness, difficulty in thinking/concentrating, blurred vision, and tachycardia/palpitations; and C) not better accounted for by another disease or disorder. These diagnostic criteria have been derived by expert consensus from an extensive review of 90 years of research on hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo, postural hypotension or tachycardia, and autonomic dizziness. Measurements of orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate are important for the screening and documentation of orthostatic hypotension or postural tachycardia syndrome to establish the diagnosis of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo.",

      "title": "Refining cause of death attribution among opioid, opioid‐stimulant and stimulant acute toxicity deaths",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background and aims Deaths attributed to a combination of opioids and stimulants have risen dramatically in recent years, largely attributed to fentanyl, yet little is understood about which drug class is primarily responsible. Attributing death to acute substance toxicity is complex and lacks clear standards. We aimed to determine whether additional causes of death and other significant conditions among deaths attributed to fentanyl were similar regardless of stimulant involvement, and distinct from deaths involving stimulants without opioids. Design Cross‐sectional analysis using records from the California Electronic Death Registration System. Setting and cases Unintentional acute toxicity deaths involving fentanyl or stimulants (methamphetamine or cocaine) occurring in San Francisco, USA, during 2013–2023. Measurements We compared demographic characteristics and causes of death or other significant conditions (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, other medical cause, or no other additional cause) among five mutually exclusive groups of deaths: stimulants without opioids (stimulant‐only), fentanyl with stimulants (fentanyl‐stimulant), fentanyl without stimulants (fentanyl‐only), other opioids (e.g., heroin, oxycodone) with stimulants (“other opioid‐stimulant”), and other opioids without stimulants (“other opioids‐only”). We conducted separate unadjusted and adjusted multivariable logistic regression models for each outcome (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, other medical, or no additional cause). The primary analysis included results for the fentanyl groups. Findings Of 4475 deaths attributed to acute opioid and/or stimulant toxicity, 24% involved stimulants‐only, 45% fentanyl‐stimulants, and 12% fentanyl‐only; the remaining 20% involved other opioids. Stimulant‐only decedents were the oldest (mean age 54 years), followed by fentanyl‐stimulant (47 years) and fentanyl‐only (44 years; p &lt; 0.001 for all). The adjusted odds of having cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or other medical causes of death (adjusted odds ratios [aORs] from 0.03 to 0.52, with 95% confidence intervals [CIs] from 0.01 to 0.68) were lower and the odds of no additional cause of death (aORs from 2.53 to 3.31, with 95% CIs from 2.00 to 3.40) were higher for both groups of deaths involving fentanyl compared with deaths attributed to stimulants‐only. There were no statistically significant differences in causes of death when comparing fentanyl‐only with fentanyl‐stimulant deaths. Findings were similar for other opioid deaths. Conclusion In San Francisco, USA, causes of death and other significant condition characteristics among deaths attributed to fentanyl appear to be similar regardless of the involvement of stimulants, but are markedly different from deaths involving stimulants without opioids. When reporting on drug‐related mortality and developing interventions, deaths attributed to a combination of fentanyl and stimulants may be appropriately considered in the context of opioid overdose prevention, while deaths attributed to stimulants without opioids may require a response focused on preventing and treating underlying chronic medical conditions.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis use disorder is diagnosed when a problematic pattern of cannabis use results in significant impairment. Problematic and significant impairment is defined as meeting at least two of 11 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013) criteria within a 12-month period. The DSM-5 (APA, 2013) criteria include: 1) more use than intended; 2) desire or unsuccessful attempts to cut down; 3) significant time spent acquiring, using, or recovering from cannabis; 4) cravings; 5) failure to fulfill major obligations; 6) continued use despite related social and interpersonal problems; 7) reduction or elimination of important activities due to use; 8) use in physically hazardous situations; 9) continued use despite knowledge of experiencing physical or psychological consequences; 10) tolerance; and 11) withdrawal. The severity of the disorder may be classified as mild (i.e., 2-3 symptoms), moderate (i.e., 4-5 symptoms), or severe (i.e., 6 or more symptoms). Further specifiers include: in early or sustained remission, and the use occurs in a controlled environment.",

      "abstract": "Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy (DPHL) is a demyelinating syndrome characterized by acute onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms days to weeks following apparent recovery from coma after a period of prolonged cerebral hypo-oxygenation. It is diagnosed, after excluding other potential causes of delirium, with a clinical history of carbon monoxide poisoning, narcotic overdose, myocardial infarction, or another global cerebral hypoxic event. The diagnosis can be supported by neuroimaging evidence of diffuse hemispheric demyelination sparing cerebellar and brainstem tracts, or by an elevated cerebrospinal fluid myelin basic protein. Standard or hyperbaric oxygen following CO poisoning may reduce the likelihood of DPHL or other neurologic sequelae. Bed rest and avoidance of stressful procedures for the first 10 days following any prolonged hypoxic event may also lower the risk. Gradual recovery over a 3 to 12 month period is common, but impaired attention or executive function, parkinsonism, or corticospinal tract signs can persist. Stimulants, amantadine or levodopa may be considered for lasting cognitive or parkinsonian symptoms. Anticipation and recognition of DPHL should lead to earlier and more appropriate utilization of health care services.",

      "abstract": "A common neurological condition known as epilepsy is characterized by recurrent bouts of uncontrollable body movements that affect only a portion of the body (partial) or the full body (generalized), occasionally accompanied by loss of consciousness and control over bowel or bladder function. Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure. The duration of postictalphase varies from minutes to hours depending on the type of seizure, the frequency and intensity of seizures, and the length of the seizure.",

These include impaired attention and concentration (often due to preoccupation with morbid or worrying thoughts); anxiety, which usually accompanies depression; irritability; agitation or retardation; fatigue after sleepless nights; and weakness due to insufficient food intake. In addition, depressed patients may take risks with little regard to the consequences, make suicidal gestures or attempts that go wrong, and take alcohol or other substances that impair functioning to relieve distress. In keeping with these considerations are the reductions in performance in tests of cognitive and psychomotor function in depressed patients.1\n\nIf depression causes or contributes to accidents in these ways then therisk of accidents might be expected to fall as the disorder improves in response to treatment with antidepressant drugs (or other treatment). On the other hand, the unwanted effects of antidepressants may adversely affect cognitive and psychomotor function (especially in those with pre-existing cerebral impairment), thereby increasing the risk of accidents. This is particularly the case in patients who do not respond to treatment and thus are impaired by both the depression and the drug. Drug induced effects may be clinically obvious, with, for example, somnolence due to oversedation; mild effects may be evident only on formal psychometric testing.

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizoaffective disorder was first described in the literature by Kasanin in 1933, referring to a group of patients in whom both psychotic (“schizo”) and mood (“affective”) symptoms are prominent features. A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

      "title": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper airway collapse during sleep that is highlighted by a reduction in, or complete cessation of, airflow despite documented on going inspiratory efforts. Due to the lack of adequate alveolar ventilation that results from the upper airway narrowing, oxygen saturation may drop and partial pressure of CO2 may occasionally increase. The events are mostly terminated by arousals. Clinical consequences are excessive daytime sleepiness related to the sleep disruption. Minimal diagnostic criteria have been defined for OSAHS. Patients should have excessive daytime sleepiness that can not be better explained by other factors, or experience two or more of the following symptoms, again that are not better explained by other factors: choking or gasping during sleep; recurrent awakenings from sleep; un-refreshing sleep; daytime fatigue; and impaired concentration. All patients should have more than five obstructed breathing events per hour during sleep. An obstructive apnea or hypopnoea can be defined as an event that lasts for ≥ 10 s and is characterized by an absence or a decrease from baseline in the amplitude of a valid measure of breathing during sleep that either reaches >50% with an oxygen desaturation of 3% or an arousal (alternatively a 30% reduction with 4% desaturation). The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends these definitions. The Task Force of the AASM also states that there are common pathogenic mechanisms for obstructive apnea syndrome, central apnea syndrome, sleep hypoventilation syndrome and Cheyne-Stokes breathing. It was more preferable to discuss each of these separately; although, they could be placed under the common denominator of \"sleep-disordered breathing syndrome\". The definition of OSAHS using two components, daytime symptoms and breathing pattern disturbances during sleep, may suggest that there is a tight correlation between the two. However, unfortunately this is not the case. The breathing pattern abnormalities, mostly described by an Apnea/Hypopnoea Index (AHI), only weakly correlate with quantified measures of sleepiness, such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). This probably means that interindividual sensitivity, with some individuals coping better with sleep fragmentation than others, does compromise the relationship between the AHI and daytime sleepiness scores. In addition, epidemiological studies show a broad range of sleepiness in the general population. Obviously, epidemiological studies investigating the prevalence of OSAHS are all biased by the lack of a uniform definition. The prevalence of an AHI of >5 events · h-1 in a general population (without taking into account symptoms of sleepiness) has previously been estimated to be 24% in a male population. When symptoms of sleepiness were also taken into account, the prevalence decreased to 4% in males and 2% in females.",

Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Most guidelines recommend that benzodiazepines and z‐drugs used continuously for more than 4 weeks should be withdrawn, if the patient is agreeable, because of the unfavourable balance of harms (including physical dependence, addiction, tolerance and withdrawal effects) and benefits. Withdrawal effects arise due to adaptation to chronic use of benzodiazepines and z‐drugs – often termed physical dependence, distinct from addiction. Addiction is an issue only for a small minority of benzodiazepine users whilst withdrawal effects and physical dependence affect a much larger group of patients taking medication as prescribed. Withdrawal effects can manifest as either physical or psychological symptoms and can often be mistaken for a return of an underlying condition or onset of a new physical or mental health condition. The most severe withdrawal effects are suicidality, akathisia and protracted withdrawal syndromes which can last for months or years and can sometimes be debilitating. Careful tapering can minimise these effects. After long‐term use tapering should be gradual (months or years), and adjusted to a rate that the individual can tolerate. Dose reduction should be conducted in a hyperbolic pattern (so that decrements become smaller and smaller as the total dose gets lower) to reflect the hyperbolic relationship between dose and receptor occupancy. In order to facilitate gradual hyperbolic tapering sometimes formulations other than widely available tablets will be required, including liquid versions, compounded versions or off‐label use of existing formulations. Switching from one benzodiazepine to a longer‐acting drug like diazepam can sometimes be helpful.",

Besides, using it in the treatment of depression, it is found to be effective in reducing withdrawal symptoms due to smoking cessation. A 28-year-old female patient with a history of depression was admitted to emergency department an hour after ingestion of bupropion, quetiapine, and levothyroxine in high doses to commit suicide. While accepting her into the Intensive Care Unit, she was awake, alert, disoriented and agitated. After 2h, the patient had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. The necessary treatment was given and 9h later with hemodynamic improvement, the patients' mental status improved. Bupropion may cause unusual behaviors such as delusions, paranoia, hallucinations, or confusion. The risk of seizure is strongly dose-dependent. We want to emphasize the importance of early gastric lavage and administration of activated charcoal.",

Patients suffering from delirium experience an acute change in mental status, fluctuating levels of consciousness, and an inability to acquire new information. Patients with major neurocognitive disorder experience significant cognitive decline in complex attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, perceptual-motor, and social cognition. The chapter also discusses mental disorders due to another medical condition. These patients can experience psychotic, mood, or anxious symptoms or a personality change; their intellectual functioning usually remains intact. A patient presenting with a first episode of psychiatric symptoms and no prior psychiatric history should be evaluated for an acute medical etiology causing the psychiatric symptoms, particularly if he or she is over 40 years of age. Anticholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine) may slow the rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease, and the combination of an anticholinesterase inhibitor and memantine may be more effective than either medication alone.",

      "title": "The “Good Enough” Mood Stabilizer: A Review of the Clinical Evidence",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT A growing family of medications is used for mood stabilization in bipolar disorder. These medications fall into two broad categories according to likely mechanisms of action. Within the categories, specific drugs may vary in their efficacy for different phases of the disorder. The first category, including lithium, anticonvulsants, and some novel treatments, appears to have mechanisms related to intracellular second messengers. These medications have more pronounced antimanic than antidepressant effects, except for lamotrigine, which has antidepressant effects without precipitating mania. The second group of mood stabilizers is the atypical antipsychotics, which act through dopamine and other monoamines. Olanzapine and in all likelihood other drugs in the class possess marked, acute antimanic properties and possible antidepressant properties, but require further study before they can be used as routine options in long-term care. It is clear that the advent of multiple mood stabilizer candidates has not yet led to a single ideal therapy for bipolar disorder, but rather to options that can be flexibly tailored to the lifetime needs of individual patients, in sequences or combinations, and perhaps in conjunction with other classes of psychotropics.",

      "title": "Cytokines, stress and depressive illness: brain‐immune interactions",
      "abstract": "Cytokines, signaling molecules of the immune system, have been implicated as a contributing factor for mood disorders such as depression. Several lines of evidence supporting this contention are briefly reviewed and caveats are introduced. Essentially, a relationship between cytokines and depression is based on the findings that: 1) proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin‐1, interleukin‐6, tumor necrosis factor‐α) and bacterial endotoxins elicit sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, soporific effects) and symptoms of anxiety/depression that may be attenuated by chronic antidepressant treatment, 2) cytokines induce neuroendocrine and central neurotransmitter changes reminiscent of those implicated in depression, and these effects are exacerbated by stressors, 3) severe depressive illness is accompanied by signs of immune activation and by elevations of cytokine production or levels, and 4) immunotherapy, using interleukin‐2 or interferon‐α, promotes depressive symptoms that are attenuated by antidepressant treatment. It is argued that cytokine synthesis and release, elicited upon activation of the inflammatory response system, provoke neuroendocrine and brain neurotransmitter changes that are interpreted by the brain as being stressors, and contribute to the development of depression. Furthermore, such effects are subject to a sensitization effect so that a history of stressful experiences or cytokine activation augment the response to later challenges and hence the evolution of depression",

The alcohol withdrawal syndrome is produced by the emergence of the biological mechanism of neurological tolerance to ethanol. The clinical manifestations of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome are due to the hyperexcitability of the central nervous system: agitation, excitability, tremor, convulsions, status epilepticus, delirium, sympathetic hyperactivity. Usually benign, the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is frequently manageable on an ambulatory basis, as long as no clinical counter-indication is present such as a serious previous alcohol withdrawal syndrome, previous withdrawal convulsions, a significant medical or psychiatric comorbidity, a high level of alcohol consumption, a pregnancy, or the lack of an effective familial or social support. The ambulatory management of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome requires frequently the use of a sedative drug. Benzodiazepines used orally for a duration of 3 to 5 days are actually considered a first choice. Inability to work and drive is frequently present for several days.",

      "abstract": "Stress--that is, any type of stimulus that challenges the organism's normal internal balance--induces a physiologic response involving a variety of hormones and other signaling molecules that act on, among other organs, the brain. This stress response also can influence the progression of alcohol and other drug (AOD) addiction through various stages. For example, AODs can directly activate the stress response. In turn, certain stress hormones (i.e., glucocorticoids and corticotrophin-releasing factor) also act on the brain system that mediates the rewarding experiences associated with AOD use (i.e., the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system). Moreover, elevated glucocorticoid levels and stress increase AOD self-administration in certain animal models. During a later stage of the addiction process, in contrast, excessive and/or prolonged stress may impair the reward system, inducing heavier AOD use to maintain the rewarding experience. During the final stage of addiction, when the addicted person experiences withdrawal symptoms if no drug is consumed, chronic AOD use results in gross impairment of the normal stress response and other signaling mechanisms in the brain, resulting in a state of anxiety and internal stress. At this stage, people continue to use AODs mainly to relieve this negative-affect state.",

In a typical scenario, a perpetrator adds a date-rape drug which has sedative effect into alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverage of an unsuspecting person. After drug administration, mostly amnesia and symptoms such as confussion, loss of memory, lack of muscle control, dizziness occur. The main drugs in sexual assaults are benzodiazepines such as γ-hydroxy butyrate and its analogs, clonazepam, alprazolam, flunitrazepam, oxazepam, ketamine, barbiturates, antidepressants, cocaine and stimulants. Most of these drugs are colorless, odorless and highly soluble in alcohol or other beverages quickly. They are rapidly absorbed and eliminated after oral administration. A victim may complain to police or other legal forces after several days due to emotional trauma as shame, fear, doubt and disbelief. For this reason, It is important to know what time the sample is taken from the victim to confirm the presence of the drug. In this study, we will present a general approach to date-rape drugs used in sexual assault.",

      "title": "Akathisia: Is Restlessness a Primary Condition or an Adverse Drug Effect? Keep a Discerning Eye out for This Adverse Effect of Antipsychotics and Other Drugs",
      "abstract": "Akathisia--from the Greek for inability to sit--is a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by subjective and objective psychomotor restlessness. Patients typically experience feelings of unease, inner restlessness mainly involving the legs, and a compulsion to move. Most engage in repetitive movement. They might swing or cross and uncross their legs, shift from one foot to the other, continuously pace, or persistently fidget. In clinical settings, akathisia usually is a side effect of medication. Antipsychotics, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and buspirone are common triggers, but akathisia also has been associated with some antiemetics, preoperative sedatives, calcium channel blockers, and antivertigo agents. It also can be caused by withdrawal from an antipsychotic or related to a substance use disorder, especially cocaine. Akathisia can be acute or chronic, occurring in a tardive form with symptoms that last >6 months. (1,3) Much isn't known about drug-induced akathisia Our understanding of the pathophysiology of akathisia is incomplete. Some have suggested that it results from an imbalance between the dopaminergic/cholinergic and dopaminergic/ serotonergic systems (4); others, that the cause is a mismatch between the core and the shell of the nucleus accumbens, due in part to overstimulation of the locus ceruleus. (5) More recently, researchers established a positive association between higher scores on the Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side Effects Rating Scale and D2/D3 receptor occupancy in the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle). (6) The D2/D3 receptor occupancy model might explain withdrawal symptoms associated with cocaine/ as well as relative worsening of symptoms after tapering or discontinuing stimulants in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Elements of a clinical evaluation When akathisia is suspected, evaluation by a clinician familiar with its phenomenology is crucial. A validated tool, such as the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (at out cometracker.org/library/BAS.pdf) can aid in the detection and assessment of severity. (8) In evaluating patients, keep in mind that the inner restlessness that characterizes akathisia can affect the trunk, hands, and arms, as well as the legs, and can cause dysphoria and anxiety. Akathisia has been linked to an increased likelihood of developing suicidal ideation and behavior. (9) Less common subjective symptoms include rage, fear, nausea, and worsening of psychotic symptoms. Because of its association with aggression and agitation, drug-induced akathisia has been cited--with little success--as the basis for an insanity defense by people who have committed a violent act. (10) Or is akathisia another psychiatric disorder? Akathisia might go undetected for several reasons. One key factor: Its symptoms resemble and often overlap with those of other psychiatric disorders, such as mania, psychosis, agitated depression, and ADHD. In addition, akathisia often occurs concurrently with, and is masked by, akinesia, a common extrapyramidal side effect of many antipsychotics. Such patients might have the inner feeling of restlessness and urge to move but do not exhibit characteristic limb movements. In some cases, cognitive or intellectual limitations prevent patients from communicating the inner turmoil they feel. (11) Medication nonadherence further complicates the picture, sometimes prompting a clinician to increase the dosage of the drug that is causing akathisia (Box 1 (12)). Box 1 Think twice before increasing the dosage Patients who develop symptoms of akathisia sometimes stop taking their medication; this often results in psychiatric relapse. (12) In addition, symptoms of akathisia often mimic psychiatric symptoms and can be mistaken for worsening anxiety or psychosis; in such cases, a practitioner might increase the dosage of the agent that is causing akathisia, potentially leading to further deterioration of the clinical picture. …",

Behavioral disorders linked to pathological inebriety can be improved by moderate doses of sedatives such as benzodiazepine, carbamate, tetrabamate or neuroleptic drugs for the most agitated states.

Postpartum depression is associated with anxiety, mood swings, tiredness, feeling scared all the time, trouble sleeping or sleeping, weight loss, stress eating, losing interest, sudden weight gain, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions, fatigue and several other issues. It can happen during pregnancy as well as after giving birth. Some women experience baby blues while some experience postpartum depression. Women feel depressed and sadly most of the time. Depression can make it difficult for mother to take care of herself and the child. Various lifestyle choices also need to be mentioned while talking about factors causing PPD. Some factors affecting PPD are lack of physical activity and exercise, bad eating habits, disturbed sleep cycle etc. it may include hormonal changes, sleep deprivation, risk factors, psychological stress. One of the chief factors affecting postpartum depression is the sleep cycle. It is seen that less sleep is brought near to postnatal depression. Exercise, psychosocial support, physical stretching or working activity can decrease symptoms of depression. Exercise causes the release of mood-boosting hormones such as dopamine and serotonin, which elevates the mood. Low esteem caused by depression can be decreased by an elevated mood. Exercise can also increase endogenous endorphins and opioids which gives a positive mood. It also increases problem solving capacity and confidence. The most common management methods used for managing depression are psychological support, professional help, interpersonal psychotherapy and cognitive therapy.",

O DSM 5 trara o tipo conforme o tempo e intensidade dos sintomas apresentados. Em relacao aos Transtornos Depressivos apresentam as mesmas caracteristicas que o episodio depressivo, presente no Transtorno Bipolar, acompanhado de alteracoes somaticas e cognitivas que afetam significativamente a capacidade de funcionamento do individuo. O que difere entre eles sao os aspectos de duracao, momento ou etiologia presumida. E relevante destacar a importância de um diagnostico correto, para tratamento dos Transtornos que, na maioria das vezes, e realizado atraves de tratamento medicamentoso e psicoterapia.Ainda, ressaltamos que a elucidacao e a compreensao desses transtornos sao fundamentais, sendo que, quanto mais precoce for o diagnostico, possivelmente, melhor sera o prognostico.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

      "title": "A Changing Landscape: Traumatic Brain Injury in Military Combat and Civilian Athletics",
      "abstract": "Combat scene, a wounded or dead hoplite lies on the ground, black-figured hydria, Cleimachos (potter), 560-550 BCE. Louvre, (Museum), Paris, France. Photo credit: Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY. Diagnosing concussion has posed a special challenge in current military conflicts, as some symptoms and clinical findings are similar to acute stress reaction and other conditions. The Department of Defense (DoD) currently defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as: a traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force that is indicated by new onset or worsening of at least one of the following clinical signs, immediately following the event: 1) any period of loss of a decreased level of consciousness (LOC), 2) any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury, 3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking, etc.), 4) neurological deficits (weakness, loss of balance, change in vision, praxis, paresis/plegia, sensory loss, aphasia, etc.) that may or may not be transient, or 5) the presence of an intracranial lesion (1). Diagnosing TBI currently depends on a thorough history and the patient's status at the time of injury, and there is currently no single objective test or diagnostic biomarker for concussion/mild TBI (mTBI). Advancing diagnostic efforts, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command is funding biomarker studies to identify the unique biological effects of TBI and leverage knowledge to develop more objective diagnostic tools to determine the severity of brain injury. TBI severity within the DoD are currently classified as mild/moderate/severe (1). Concussion/mTBI involves normal structural imaging, LOC for up to 30 min, alteration of consciousness up to 24 h, and post-traumatic amnesia up to 24 h. If a patient meets criteria in more than one category of severity, the provider assigns the higher severity level. Definition standardization remains a problem as concussion grading systems and definitions published by various organizations make comparing findings from various research studies extremely difficult. A collaborative effort among the DoD, Veterans Health Administration, Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Brain Trauma Foundation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is developing a medically useful definition and staging criteria for mTBI/concussion. We live in a sport-crazed society, and although injury is usually an accepted consequence of “playing the game,” there is a heightened awareness about sport concussions. Pick up a newspaper, or watch the evening news or “Sports Center,” and you're bound to read or hear something about sport concussions. The media are obsessed with this topic, particularly with the negative news that makes headlines and ultimately sells newspapers. Even so, there is good news to report, and progress is being made. Forty-nine states have passed concussion laws in the past 4 years, aimed at educating athletes, parents, and coaches about the symptoms of concussion and the dangers of continuing to play while still symptomatic. According to the CDC, Emergency Department diagnosis of youth sport concussions has increased by an estimated 60% over the past decade (2). Surprisingly, this is good news, as it speaks to the increased public awareness and better recognition of concussion, as opposed to an increase in actual concussions. Concussion remains a major military concern given the short- and long-term impacts to our service members; recent conflicts have sparked an increase in TBI research funding designed to accelerate medical innovation. There were 266,810 service members in the DoD from 2000 to 2012 who were diagnosed with TBI—81.7% of these injuries concussions (3). Although the risk for TBI is certainly higher in the combat environment, the majority of these injuries (83.4%) is actually nondeployment-associated (3). In parallel to sport-concussion awareness, military medicine has also taken significant policy steps to promote early identification and concussion treatment (4). In 2010, the DoD published a policy mandating that any deployed service member involved in a potentially concussive event (such as 50 m from a blast, vehicle collision or rollover, blow to the head, etc.) receive a medical evaluation using the Military Acute Concussion Evaluation; receive a minimum 24 h of downtime, even if he was not diagnosed with a concussion; and must be re-evaluated prior to returning to duty (5). Since then, the DoD has screened over 14,950 deployed service members for concussion and has staffed 11 Concussion Care Centers in Afghanistan that promote concussion recovery and medical oversight (internal DoD data; personal communication). The U.S. Army is implementing this concept worldwide to ensure one standard of concussion care, whether the injury occurs on the battlefield or in garrison. The Veterans Administration-DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines (6) were rated as the highest concussion-management guideline in a 2011 edition of Brain Injury (7). Beginning in 2009, the DoD has published numerous TBI clinical recommendations in collaboration with civilian experts in the areas of cognitive rehabilitation, driving assessment, postinjury neurocognitive testing in the deployed environment, management of neuroendocrine dysfunction, assessment and treatment of dizziness, and management of visual dysfunction (8), and an additional three clinical recommendations will be published this year to include graded return to activity, sleep disturbances, and use of neuroimaging. The tests for detecting concussion and tracking recovery are becoming more sensitive, especially when used in combination with other tools to create a multimodal approach to concussion assessment. Despite all that has been accomplished, caring for service members and athletes at risk for sustaining cerebral concussion has always been a challenging task and never more so than in today's litigious society. Concussion is different from other injuries, in that we still rely heavily on an athlete's or a service member's subjective reporting of symptoms for decisionmaking, and we lack the neuroimaging protocols that might allow us to identify the damage and understand its severity. The cause-and-effect relationships, or lack of same, between repetitive head trauma and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are the subject of significant debate. Several published case reports have described tau deposits in the brains of deceased contact-sport athletes, but most of the neuroscience community does not believe that controlled experimental research has yet identified a causal relationship linking repetitive head trauma in sports and CTE(9–12). Innovative neuroimaging techniques are on the horizon and will eventually permit tau and other proteins to be traced in vivo. This should allow for prospective investigations comparing head-impact exposure with tau accumulation, leading to earlier detection and interventions for these chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In the meantime, our responsibility is to safely care for our service members and athletes, to educate them about what is known and unknown regarding the long-term effects of repetitive head trauma, and to ensure that family members, coaches, and military unit leaders implement supportive recovery practices. Unfortunately, the large amount of misinformation on this topic sometimes results in hysteria rather than rational thinking. Concussions are like snowflakes: no two are alike, and no cookbook or calendar can specify exactly how they should be treated. Therefore, we need to go the extra mile. In many cases, it's a matter of counseling our service members and our athletes about the short- and long-term risks of not reporting symptoms, returning to play or duty while still experiencing symptoms, or not modifying risky behaviors that can predispose them to future concussions. We need individualized and sport-specific return-to-play progressions that ensure that service members and athletes are physically and cognitively prepared to return to activity. No checkbox system can be applied to every concussion, and as concussions are diverse and unique injuries that affect each athlete differently, we must learn how to treat them individually. Likewise, concussed service members and athletes are unique, and we must work to understand what makes them different. Sports medicine clinicians must play the important role of counselor to our athletes. Getting to know each athlete's mindset and reaction to injuries allows us to build trust and forge honest lines of communications, thus enabling us to develop an appropriate and individualized plan for managing concussion, which is just as vital as knowing how to interpret the results of a cognitive or balance test. Within a 6-month period, four major consensus or evidence-based documents focused on concussion management will have been released, including the new “Zurich International Guidelines” or the Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport: the 4th International Conference on Concussion in Sport (13–16). This, along with other manuscripts published or soon to be published by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, the American Academy of Neurology, and the National Athletic Trainers' Association, should all be mandatory reading for sports medicine clinicians, as they will define the standard of care for sports medicine clinicians for at least the next 4–5 years. These documents are well-prepared and will make significant contributions to the sports medicine community. The landscape is changing, and these evidence-based guidelines are leading us in a better direction. Although the neuroscience community has learned much about concussion in the last two decades, we admittedly have much more to investigate and to understand.",

      "title": "What Is Personality Disorder?",
      "abstract": "What Is Personality Disorder? Hanna Pickard (bio) The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 689) defines personality disorder (PD) as: A. An enduring pattern of experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of an individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas: 1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events); 2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response); 3. Interpersonal functioning; and 4. Impulse control. B. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations. C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood. E. The enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder. F. The enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., head trauma). Unlike schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other Axis I conditions, PD is not conventionally understood as an illness or disease. Rather, as the name implies, it is a disorder of the personality: an ‘enduring pattern of experience and behavior.’ Metaphorically speaking, it is a condition that is internal to the kind of person someone is, a part of who they are. It is not an external condition that befalls them. Very roughly, personality is the set of characteristics or traits that make us the kind of person we are: the ways we are inclined to think, feel, and act in response to particular circumstances, as well as more generally. All of us have one. PD occurs when the set of characteristics or traits that make a person the kind of person they are causes severe psychological distress and impairment in social, occupational, or other important contexts: the ways a person is inclined to think, feel, and act do them harm, directly or via the effects they have on relationships, work, and life more generally conceived. Diagnosis of a PD requires that these characteristics or traits be long-standing, pervasive, difficult to control or change, and markedly different from cultural expectations. Equally, the distress and impairment caused must be sufficiently extreme to warrant clinical attention: the person needs clinical care and help. Nonetheless, all of us possess characteristics or traits that sometimes incline us to think, feel, and act in ways that cause us distress and adversely affect our social, occupational, or other functioning. PD lies on a continuum with normal human personality. The broad category of PD is currently divided into three subcategories or ‘clusters.’ Cluster A comprises paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal PD. These are more colloquially known as the odd [End Page 181] and eccentric or ‘mad’ PDs. Cluster B comprises narcissistic, borderline, histrionic, and antisocial PD. These are more colloquially known as the dramatic, emotional, and erratic or ‘bad’ PDs. Cluster C comprises obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, and dependent PD. These are more colloquially known as the anxious and fearful or ‘sad’ PDs. A person cannot be diagnosed with any particular PD unless there is clinically significant distress and impairment. But, given that this condition is met, which kind of PD they have depends on what kind of personality they have–on the nature of the problematic pattern of experience and behavior. Stepping back and considering the wider context, the picture painted of PD is bleak. PD is associated with genetic factors (Jang and Vernon 2001) and also environmental conditions (Paris 2001). These include dysfunctional families, where there is breakdown, death, institutional care, and parental psychopathology; traumatic childhood experiences, with high levels of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse or neglect; and social stressors, such as war, poverty, and migration. There are high levels of comorbidity among PDs, and between PDs and psychotic disorders, eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse (Moran 2002). Finally, there is also a strong association between PD and violence and crime, self-harm, and suicide (Moran 2002). As this picture...",

      "abstract": "Drug abuse consists of the use by a subject without a medical recommendation, in quantities or with nonrecommended methods. Substance abuse also refers to their use in order to increase intellectual or physical performance, against the rules established by society. Substance abuse involves the chronic use of non-medical chemicals for hedonistic or entheogenic purposes [1]. Drugs such as alcohol, antidepressants, amphetamine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, glue, cocaine, hallucinogens, metacular, narcotics, opiates, sedatives, stimulants and some organic solvents can be named [2]. Substance abuse can cause criminal or antisocial behavior, may generate long-term changes in personality [3]. Cocaine has major toxic effects on the body. Treatment of cocaine poisoning is complex. The main sales are those that can lead to patient death. For the proper treatment of any inoculation, it is necessary to identify the xenobiotic that generated it. The presence of metabolites, in the case of cocaine - ethylbenzoylcogene (EBE), provides information on the time of administration of the xenobiotic. Gas chromatography or liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry is an optoelectronic method that can identify the presence of cocaine and / or EBE from biological samples. In order to increase the sensitivity of the method, a special mass metrology technique - MS/MS can be used [4, 5].",

      "abstract": "Summary Purpose: To consider the definition of acute symptomatic seizures for epidemiological studies, and to refine the criteria used to distinguish these seizures from unprovoked seizures for specific etiologies. Methods: Systematic review of the literature and of epidemiologic studies. Results: An acute symptomatic seizure is defined as a clinical seizure occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Suggestions are made to define acute symptomatic seizures as those events occurring within 1 week of stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, or intracranial surgery; at first identification of subdural hematoma; at the presence of an active central nervous system (CNS) infection; or during an active phase of multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune diseases. In addition, a diagnosis of acute symptomatic seizure should be made in the presence of severe metabolic derangements (documented within 24 h by specific biochemical or hematologic abnormalities), drug or alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, or exposure to well‐defined epileptogenic drugs. Discussion: Acute symptomatic seizures must be distinguished from unprovoked seizures and separately categorized for epidemiologic purposes. These recommendations are based upon the best available data at the time of this report. Systematic studies should be undertaken to better define the associations in question, with special reference to metabolic and toxic insults, for which the time window for the occurrence of an acute symptomatic seizure and the absolute values for toxic and metabolic dysfunction still require a clear identification.",

      "title": "Experience with Drugs and Driving in Queensland, Australia",
      "abstract": "The effect of any one psychoactive drug on an individual is a function of its interaction with that individual; for this reason, the effect upon one person may not be the same as on another person. When two or more drugs are given at the same time, their effect may be one of antagonism, synergism or potentiation. The effects of a psychotropic drug (ataxia, incoordination, altered level of consciousness or awareness, disturbances of vision and increased reaction time) must surely impair the skills required for safe driving. Many prescribed drugs acting principally on the central nervous system are capable of impairing driving performance: analgesics, anti-depressants, anti-convulsants, sedatives, hypnotics, narcotics and tranquillizers. Other prescribed drugs: anti-histamines, hypotensive agents, hypoglycaemic substances may produce undesirable side effects which impair driving performance. In Queensland if breath analysis indicated a BAC too low to account for a driver's behaviour, a doctor is called to examine the driver, and samples of blood and urine are forwarded to a central laboratory. If the blood concentration of a drug equals or exceeds the accepted therapeutic level of the particular substance, the driver is considered to be under the influence of the drug. The most dangerous period is during the initial stage of taking a prescribed drug. Psychotropic drugs taken in prescribed dosage may initially produce drowsiness, ataxia, impaired judgement and increased reaction time. After a period of time, tolerance to the drug develops, with marked reduction in unwanted side effects. The most common drugs include morphine, pethidine, methadone, methaqualone, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates. The common purpose for such abuse is to get high -a stage of unreality characterized by euphoria and/or hallucinations, either visual or auditory or both. Intoxication by any of these drugs produces severe impairment of driving skills. An exaggerated pharmacological effect commonly occurs when alcohol is taken at the same time as another psychoactive drug. Benzodiazepines are the prescribed drug most commonly involved in instances of driving impairment, both alone and in combination with alcohol. Some drugs commonly associated with impaired driving performance are: mandrax, methadone and diazepam. The extent of the contribution of drivers impaired by drugs and drug-alcohol interaction to traffic accidents has not yet been defined. It will not be defined until all countries enact effective legislation to enable such drivers to be identified. The use of alcohol and psychotropic drugs in Australia has been increasing steadily over the past few years, and continues to increase. It is impossible to obtain accurate figures on the consumption of psychotropic drugs in Australia. (Shortened Author Abstract/TRRL)",

      "abstract": "Introducción y objetivos: Una de las causas más frecuentes de psicosis es el consumo de sustancias. El consumo de cocaína se asocia a la presentación, transitoria o persistente, de síntomas psicóticos por su potente acción como inhibidor de la recaptación de dopamina. Se presenta un caso clínico de una paciente con TLP y psicosis inducida por cocaína que se ensaya tratamiento con cariprazina. Los criterios diagnósticos para el trastorno psicótico inducido por sustancias según DSM-V son: delirios o alucinaciones, examen físico compatible y resultados analíticos en orina positivos a tóxicos, con síntomas durante o inmediatamente después de la intoxicación o abstinencia de la sustancia psicoactiva. La cariprazina difiere de otros antipsicóticos por su actividad agonista parcial y su mayor afinidad por los receptores D3. Este perfil exclusivo parece tener consecuencias beneficiosas sobre los síntomas negativos, la disforia y el deterioro cognitivo. Estudios realizados apuntan a que la cariprazina reduciría el efecto gratificante de la cocaína sobre el sistema de recompensa y reduciría la necesidad de su consumo. Material y métodos: Descripción de un caso clínico y revisión de la literatura. Resultados y conclusiones: Se presenta el caso clínico de una mujer con antecedente de trastorno límite de la personalidad y trastorno por uso de sustancias (cannabis y cocaína) que consulta por síntomas psicóticos en contexto de consumo de cocaína. Se realiza tratamiento ambulatorio inicialmente con olanzapina y diazepam, siendo su evolución parcialmente favorable, presentando hiperfagia y aumento de peso, por lo que se cambia a cariprazina, mejorando la hiperorexia, el craving a cocaína y manteniéndose abstinente y en remisión de la clínica psicótica. Cariprazina se presenta como una opción para el tratamiento de la psicosis aguda por cocaína y mantenimiento de la abstinencia.",

      "title": "Amphetamine Use as a Risk Factor for Low-Dose Risperidone–Induced Acute Dystonia",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Antipsychotic-induced acute dystonia is defined as sustained abnormal postures or muscle spasms that develop within 7 days of starting or rapidly raising the dose of an antipsychotic medication.1 Risk factors include young age, male sex, previous instance of acute dystonia, use of psychoactive substances, rapid titration, and use of high-potency antipsychotics.2 Although second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) have a lower risk than first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) to induce acute dystonia, significant differences exist between SGAs in their ability to induce extrapyramidal symptoms.3,4 The following case report describes a young male patient abusing amphetamine who, shortly after initiating low-dose risperidone, developed acute dystonia that did not occur with olanzapine use.\r\n\r\nCase report. Mr A, a 24 year-old man, was admitted because of paranoid delusional thinking and agitation following daily use of amphetamine. He had no other medical history. A few months earlier, he had been hospitalized in the exact same circumstances and was treated successfully with olanzapine 10 mg daily without presenting any motor anomalies. Olanzapine was prescribed after discharge from the hospital, but Mr A stopped the medication a few weeks later. When he was readmitted more than 4 months later, risperidone orally disintegrating tablet 2 mg was introduced at bedtime. The following morning, the patient developed a sensation of thick tongue, had difficulty swallowing his saliva, and experienced neck and jaw rigidity. No respiratory difficulty was noticed. Within 30 minutes following the administration of diphenhydramine 25 mg intramuscularly, the dystonic symptoms diminished and resolved completely within the next few hours. Risperidone was replaced by olanzapine 10 mg at bedtime, and complete resolution of the psychotic symptoms was obtained without recurrence of dystonic symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe exact pathophysiology of acute dystonia remains unknown but probably involves blockade of dopamine D2 receptors in the striatum. It has been proposed that by blocking serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, SGAs increase dopamine release by substantia nigra neurons in the basal ganglia, which would explain the lower risk of dystonic reactions compared with FGAs. Psychostimulant drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines, are considered a precipitating factor for acute dystonia.5,6 Although these substances may initially enhance release of dopamine in the striatum,7 their long-term use is associated with striatal dopaminergic down-regulation.8 In our case report, amphetamine abuse appears to increase the risk of an acute dystonic reaction with risperidone but not with olanzapine. One could argue that the blood concentration of amphetamine had decreased by the time olanzapine was prescribed and this could reduce the risk of dystonia. However, on the first hospitalization the patient did not have a dystonic reaction when treated with olanzapine although he was taking similar quantity of amphetamine on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nAlthough both risperidone and olanzapine have similar binding affinities to dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, only olanzapine has significant anticholinergic properties.3 In our patient, the addition of the anticholinergic drug diphenhydramine to risperidone significantly reduced the dystonic symptoms, suggesting that acetylcholine is involved in some way in the etiology of this motor side effect. In a recent study, patients at risk for acute dystonia used anticholinergic drugs more often when treated with risperidone than with olanzapine.9 Therefore, blockade of 5-HT2 receptors alone by an SGA may not be sufficient to prevent a dystonic reaction in high-risk patients. In our patient, the induction of dystonic symptoms by risperidone was not likely due to an increase in dopamine D2 blockade by risperidone, as dose equivalence studies suggest that risperidone 3 mg is equivalent to olanzapine 10 mg.10,11\r\n\r\nThis case report suggests that low-dose risperidone, but not olanzapine, can induce an acute dystonic reaction when amphetamine abuse is present. We propose that the anticholinergic activity of olanzapine, in addition to its serotonin 5-HT2 blockade, contributes to the lower risk of dystonic reaction compared with risperidone. Therefore, an SGA having both anticholinergic and anti–serotonin 5-HT2 activity might be a better choice to prevent acute dystonia in high-risk patients.",

Terapi yang diberikan dapat berupa obat-obatan, psikoterapi, maupun keduanya. Jika terapi tersebut tidak dapat mengurangi gejala maka dapat diberikan electroconvulsive theraphy (ECT). ECT menyebabkan berbagai efek samping seperti pusing, disorientasi, kehilangan memori. Biasanya efek samping tersebut dalam jangka pendek, namun kehilangan memori berlangsung berkepanjangan. Namun selain ECT belum ada terapi lain yang mendapat hasil secara cepat untuk terapi depresi berat dan menjadi tantangan untuk pasien yang tidak responsif terhadap ECT. Sehingga diperlukan terapi lain untuk penderita depresi berat. Ketamin merupakan obat bius non- competitive NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) yang digunakan untuk merawat tentara saat di medan perang.

These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The withdrawal syndromes after discontinuance of alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedative drugs, such as chloral and paraldehyde, are all similar. The severity of a withdrawal reaction is largely determined by the daily dose, the duration of administration and the rate of fall of the drug levels after withdrawal, as well as the propensity of the individual patient. The time course of a withdrawal reaction is determined by the drug's clearance. Alcohol has a half‐life of a few hours; withdrawal symptoms may develop within 6–8 hours of abstinence and convulsions in 12–48 hours. After discontinuance of short‐ or medium‐acting barbiturates (half‐life 8–40 hours) symptoms may develop in 1–3 days, followed by convulsions and delirium after 3–8 days. Symptoms and seizures may develop in the 1–10 days after withdrawal of benezodiazepines. In patients with no prior history of epilepsy the types of seizures most commonly induced by drug withdrawal are generalized convulsions, but partial seizures are not uncommon if there is a focal cerebral lesion, or a previous history of partial seizures. Paroxysmal activity and photosensitivity may occur after barbiturate withdrawal in non‐epileptics, more commonly in severe withdrawal reactions. Similar EEG changes may be seen after alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal, but photosensitivity does not appear to have been shown to be a feature of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome.",

      "abstract": "The hallucinogens are a class of psychoactive drugs, either synthetic or plant products, that produce auditory and/or visual hallucinations as well as thought, mood, and perceptual changes. Depending on dosage, expectation (set), and environment (setting), they also can induce euphoria and a state similar to a transcendental experience. These hallucinations can be present as part of a delirium (e.g., from jimsonweed [ Datura stramonium ]) when accompanied by disturbances in judgment, orientation, intellect, memory, and emotion. Delirium also can result from drug withdrawal (e.g., associated with sedative-hypnotic and/or alcohol withdrawal). When used in the context of substance abuse, the term hallucinogen generally refers to a compound that alters consciousness without producing delirium, sedation, excessive stimulation, or impairment of intellect or memory. Hallucinogens that are abused include the prototype hallucinogen d -lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD); other indolealkylamines such as psilocybin (\"magic mushrooms\") and dimethyltryptamine (DMT, also contained in the South American beverage ayahuasca); and the phenalkylamines, including mescaline and dimethoxymethylamphetamine (DOM, also called STP). LSD, DMT, DOM, psilocybin, and mescaline are sometimes characterized as serotonergic hallucinogens on account of their predominant effect on that receptor system. Other plant products with hallucinogenic activity that are abused include the seeds of the morning glory ( Ipomoea ), which contain lysergic acid derivatives, and seeds of the Hawaiian baby woodrose ( Argyreia nervosa ), which contain lysergic acid amide. Cannabinoid agonists; ≡ agonists; antimuscarinic agents; dissociative anesthetics such as phencyclidine (PCP); and designer drugs such as methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy), which are sometimes classified as hallucinogens, are covered elsewhere in this volume.",

      "title": "DSM-5 substance use disorder: how conceptual missteps weakened the foundations of the addictive disorders field",
      "abstract": "DSM-5, following the recommendations of its substance-related disorders workgroup, radically reformulated the diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder (SUD). The changes have generated considerable controversy and concern, and are here reviewed and evaluated. DSM-IV included two substance use disorders, substance dependence and substance abuse. Dependence attempted directly to capture the concept of addiction as a psychiatric disorder, understood as impaired-control use. (The label addiction itself was narrowly rejected in earlier DSM revisions due to its purportedly pejorative nature.) Dependence diagnosis required any three or more of seven possible symptoms indicating impaired-control substance use, including two physiological dependence symptoms (tolerance, withdrawal) and five behavioural symptoms (giving up activities, continuing use despite harmful physical or psychological effects, trying to stop but cannot, taking larger amounts than intended, spending much time obtaining and taking the substance). Abuse diagnosis represented problematic use and required any one or more of four possible substance-related symptoms, including hazardous use (most commonly, driving while intoxicated), interpersonal problems (e.g., arguing with spouse), failure to fulfill role obligations at work, school, or home, and legal problems. 'Abuse' has long been a questionable disorder category. The 'dependence syndrome' model of addiction as impaired control over use 1, 2 is generally accepted as the most plausible conceptual justification for understanding addiction as a true psychiatric disorder rather than as moral weakness, social deviance, or rational choice. Since DSM-III-R, DSM diagnostic criteria for substance use disorders have been based on this model. Consistent with the model, the original intention was for 'dependence' to be the sole addiction disorder category 3. However, pragmatic concerns about having a diagnostic label for anyone needing help with substance use overrode validity concerns, and the abuse category was included in successive DSM editions until DSM-5. DSM's 'abuse' criteria clearly conflated social deviance with addictive pathology. ICD's parallel but narrower 'harmful use' category rejects face-invalid abuse criteria such as hazardous use and insists on substance-caused physical or mental health problems, thus at least ensuring medical need for intervention. Two rationales have been used to justify the DSM's 'abuse' category despite its face invalidity. First, the dependence syndrome model portrays addiction as a 'biaxial' concept with two components, an impaired-control motivational dysfunction and a harmful consequence component involving negative social, psychological, and physical consequences of excessive use 1. The model asserts that harmful consequences by themselves do not imply addiction (e.g., heavy recreational drinking without alcoholism can cause liver cirrhosis or automobile accidents). Nonetheless, the components are sometimes interpreted as distinct categories of psychiatric disorder: impaired-control use (dependence/addiction) and a residual category of harmful use without dependence (abuse). However, as both the DSM-5 definition of mental disorder and the 'harmful dysfunction' analysis of mental disorder 4, 5 make clear, harm without an underlying dysfunction is not a medical disorder. The biaxial conception, properly understood, requi-res both impaired control and consequent harm as components of every diagnosis of substance use disorder 6 and thus provides no support for an 'abuse' disorder category. Second, it is commonly claimed that abuse is mild or prodromal dependence, thus justifying its disorder status. This empirical claim has been amply disconfirmed. Substance abuse—however worthy of intervention—does not predict later dependence at substantial rates and does not correlate with validators in the same pattern as dependence 7. Abuse is also highly contextually anchored; for example, a large percentage of abuse diagnoses are due to driving under the influence of alcohol, which occurs at increased rates among those of higher socioeconomic status simply because they have automobiles 8, 9. To its credit, DSM-5 finally eliminated the substance abuse category. However, rather than acknowledging that the abuse category lacks conceptual validity as an addictive disorder and placing it in the Z Codes for non-disordered problems often treated by clinicians, DSM-5 took another route. Much of the abuse category was assimilated to dependence, in keeping with the empirically discredited 'mild or prodromal dependence' account of abuse. The workgroup relied heavily in its deliberations on factor analyses and item response theory analyses of abuse and dependence symptom items, most of which fail to discriminate abuse symptoms from dependence symptoms as distinct clusters or syndromes. However, researchers have long noted that the DSM dependence items are poorly worded to draw the dependence/abuse distinction among the highly correlated dependence and abuse items 10. Nonetheless, rather than taking the conceptual implausibility of the technical results as confirming the need for rewording and reevaluating the items and strengthening the validity of the dependence criteria, the workgroup interpreted the technical results as refuting the idea of there being abuse that is not a form of dependence: 'The \"abuse category\" has been eliminated from the proposed structure because of the lack of data to support an intermediate state between drug use and drug addiction' (11, p. 867). The implication was that abuse symptoms (including, e.g., hazardous use, despite all the contrary considerations) could be considered variants of dependence symptoms and could validly be retained as impaired-control measures. Conceptual grounding in the dependence syndrome model was thus abandoned in favor of obeisance to a literal reading of the technical results. The consequences for the decision process are vividly presented in the following description by a workgroup member of a scene that could be right out of one of Solomon Asch's social psychology experiments in which group pressure causes an individual to affirm things that are plainly false: 'I was one of the last holdouts against combining the abuse and dependence criteria because, to me, the dependence process and its consequences do seem conceptually distinct. However, as I looked around the table at my colleagues in our in-person meeting on this issue and considered the overwhelming abundance of evidence in favor of combining the abuse and dependence criteria, I found I no longer had grounds to hold to my position' (12, p. 703). In fact, the evidence for homogeneity of dependence and abuse was not 'overwhelming'. The failure of a technical method to clearly discriminate two things, or the demonstration that two things are intercorrelated in ways that allow them to fit a unidimensional mathematical model, is not a demonstration that two things do not exist. It is only a demonstration that the specific method of analysis using the specific selected measures does not discriminate them if they do exist—and in this case, we have strong independent clinical and personal evidence that the two entities, addiction and harmful use, do exist. Unidimensionality of item response analysis results can mean many things other than that there exists only one entity varying in severity 13, and no far-reaching conclusion can be drawn before alternative hypotheses are systematically tested, a task not undertaken by the workgroup. Moreover, there are many other sources of potential evidence that were not given weight. Observing that DSM-5′s decisions were based on a highly selective citing of evidence, Edwards concluded that the workgroup's reconceptualization 'goes against clinical experience, which suggests that people can develop destructive and disruptive drinking behavior without clinical symptoms of dependence' (14, p. 701), as for example in college students' harmful binge drinking independent of addiction. The workgroup's premature embrace of specific technical analyses to override compelling clinical and conceptual realities brings to mind Wittgenstein's famous admonition: 'In psychology there are experimental methods and conceptual confusion… The existence of the experimental method makes us think we have the means of solving the problems that trouble us; though problem and method pass one another by' (15, p. 232; emphasis in original). DSM-5 thus moved the abuse criteria, with all their validity problems, into an expanded category renamed 'substance use disorder' (SUD). Only the 'legal problems' criterion was abandoned because it was rarely used and plainly a matter of social deviance, not pathology. Additionally, a new 'craving' criterion was added both because craving is intuitively a phenomenological counterpart to impaired control and because it is an attractive target of pharmacological intervention. With 11 possible symptoms rather than 7, the idea was that SUD represents an enlarged and more valid impaired-control category with dimensional structure ranging from mild to severe cases; 2 or 3 symptoms is 'mild', 4 or 5 'moderate', and 6+ 'severe' SUD. Mechanically combining existing abuse and dependence criteria in SUD without reformulation exacerbated a problem of symptom criterion redundancy, weakening validity. Criteria overlap in meaning so that it is possible to satisfy multiple criteria and spuriously reach diagnostic threshold due to just one actual feature. For example, one can imagine satisfying the three symptoms of failure to fulfill role obligations, use despite social/interpersonal problems, and activities given up or reduced, all based on the same problem, lessened marital engagement due to time spent drinking with one's friends. Yet this one feature has low face validity for indicating impaired-use disorder. With so many more symptom options in SUD than in the former dependence category, it becomes much easier for an individual to meet three criteria. Thus, one might think that to maintain validity, the threshold number of symptoms needed for diagnosis would be raised to a higher number. This would be especially true because the added abuse symptoms appear to have less validity than the former dependence symptoms in identifying impaired-control dysfunction. Thus, the number of symptoms needed to have confidence that there is a dysfunction should be increased. The workgroup did the opposite; they lowered the number of symptoms required for diagnosis to 2. This is probably the most controversial substance-related change made by the DSM-5. If one considers SUD an expanded impaired-control addiction category analogous to dependence, then this change dramatically increases—indeed, more than doubles—the estimated prevalence of addiction. DSM-5′s SUD revision with its 2-symptom diagnostic threshold allows continued diagnosis of those with two abuse symptoms (e.g., drives under the influence and argues with spouse about it) and those with one abuse and one dependence symptom (e.g., has developed some tolerance to alcohol and drives under the influence). Moreover, diagnosis newly applies to those with two dependence symptoms (e.g., increased tolerance and drinks larger amounts than intended), dubbed by the literature as 'diagnostic orphans' as if they had been incorrectly abandoned rather than purposely placed below a plausible diagnostic threshold. However, studies show that these groups resemble former abuse cases more than dependence cases in prognosis. In terms of addiction as impaired control, the evidence is that probably they are mostly false positives, as validity evaluation of DSM-5 SUD suggests. DSM-5 has been heavily criticized for the lowered SUD diagnostic threshold. Before looking at the rationales offered for this change, one might ask: 'What did this effort yield in terms of increases in diagnostic validity and clinical utility?' Clinical utility for now appears weakened, primarily because virtually all treatment studies have used dependence samples. Consequently, nothing is known about what works with the much larger and more heterogeneous SUD category. Predictive studies have generally shown quite different long-term outcomes for members of the DSM-IV dependence category and the added SUD cases. Nor do the 'mild' SUD cases correspond to the former abuse cases, so that no simple translation is possible. More importantly for long-term scientific purposes, recent analyses present a markedly disappointing picture regarding validity 6. Looking at alcohol use disorder (AUD), which is by far the largest SUD category, DSM-5 AUD provides no gain at all in predictive validity or correlation with crucial validators relative to DSM-IV combined alcohol dependence and abuse. For example, DSM-5 AUD is not significantly different from DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse in levels of standard lifetime validators including episode duration, number of episodes, frequent heavy drinking, number of symptoms, suicidal ideation, service use, and family history. One-year validator results are similarly without validity gains. Alternatively, if one construes SUD as an expanded impaired-control category and compares DSM-5 AUD to DSM-IV alcohol dependence, then DSM-5 AUD represents a major loss of validity 6. DSM-5 AUD is significantly lower than DSM-IV alcohol dependence on every one of the above-mentioned validators except episode duration. Depending on the baseline of comparison, DSM-5 AUD shows no validity gain or substantially decreased validity relative to DSM-IV. Concerns that the threshold of two or more criteria is too low…(e.g., that it produces an overly heterogeneous group or that those at low severity levels are not 'true' cases)…were weighed against the competing need to identify all cases meriting intervention, including milder cases, for example, those presenting in primary care. Construed one way, this argument is a textbook example of begging the question. Mild cases of a disorder are still true cases, and no one is objecting to identifying mild cases of addiction. The objection is that the added cases—which are indeed symptomatically mild—are not mild cases of addictive disorder but rather not true cases of addictive disorder at all. Just as sneezing due to dust in the air is not a mild case of a cold, developing some tolerance to alcohol over time from social and mealtime drinking and driving home from social occasions after drinking is not generally mild addictive disorder. The workgroup's reply that we need to identify all cases including the mild ones begs the question of validity. However, the explanation was probably intended as asserting a pragmatic point, that although the added cases may not be true cases of impaired control, for practical reasons we must be able to diagnose them as disorders to help them. The problem with this pragmatic argument is that it abandons validity as the criterion for category formulation, thereby undermining the integrity of research needed for developing more effective methods for helping those with true addictions. When there was a separate category of abuse, the pragmatic argument was more compelling because the invalidity was segregated in its own category and scientific study could focus on dependence. The present approach leaves the field with no reasonably valid target category for scientific study. The reality is that no one set of criteria is capable of both identifying the addicted and identifying all who could use help for substance use. Identifying the latter group while talking as if one is identifying the former group creates a state of confusion worse than before and presents an obstacle to scientific progress. [T]he substance use disorders criteria represent a dimensional condition with no natural threshold….To avoid a marked perturbation in prevalence without justification, the work group sought a threshold for DSM-5 substance use disorders that would yield the best agreement with the prevalence of DSM-IV substance abuse and dependence disorders combined. This argument offers an example of the classic 'sorites' or 'balding man' fallacy—the fallacy of inferring from the fact there is no sharp boundary between a concept and its opposite that therefore the distinction can be drawn anywhere one likes. The fact that the division between addiction and non-addiction is fuzzy does not imply that the threshold is entirely arbitrary and can be placed to accomplish such extraneous goals as preserving prevalence rates generated by other criteria that have been acknowledged to be invalid. A fuzzy concept can still have many reasonably clear cases, and the boundary should be drawn with an eye to avoiding the classification of conceptually relatively clear cases on the incorrect side of the distinction. Day shades into night, and childhood into adulthood, and the boundaries are fuzzy, but day/night and child/adult still have clear cases that make these vague distinctions extremely useful, and despite the vagueness, there are ways of drawing the distinctions that would be manifestly incorrect. If one can arbitrarily draw a concept's boundary anywhere one wishes, one has in effect discarded the distinction. That, I suggest, is in effect what DSM-5 did with the concept of 'addiction' when it arbitrarily placed the SUD threshold at 2 of 11 symptoms to achieve the goal of preserving earlier prevalence rates, without careful attention to the face conceptual validity of the cases that would fall on either side of the new threshold. Another argument in defense of the 2-symptom threshold concerns dimensionalization in service of prevention. The lower SUD threshold can be seen as part of DSM-5′s move toward dimensional criteria that allow for diagnosis of prodromal and mild conditions to promote prevention. The question is whether the lower end of the severity dimension represents disorders at all, or whether the risk of disorder is sufficiently high to warrant the massive numbers of additional diagnoses. Challenged to justify the fact that the new criteria will pathologize mild conditions, the workgroup Chair, Charles O'Brien, explained as follows: 'We can treat them earlier. And we can stop them from getting to the point where they're going to need really expensive stuff like liver transplants' (17, p. A11). However, this justification is based on an assumption that study after study has shown to be false, namely, that DSM-IV cases of abuse and dependence orphanhood that are newly classified as SUD are an early stage of dependence and have severe outcomes over time. To take O'Brien's example seriously, the established alcohol consumption risk factor for liver cirrhosis requires heavy drinking for decades, which is unlikely to occur at the milder end of the SUD spectrum. There are about 27 000 yearly U.S. cirrhosis deaths (from all causes, not just alcohol), <0.01% of the population, whereas DSM-5 extends the SUD 'impaired control' label to approximately an additional 7% of the entire population each year (about 21 000 000 people) over and above the 5% or so identified by DSM-IV dependence 6. There is no evidence that the cirrhosis cases come out of the added group in significant numbers, nor that such massive diagnostic overreach is a feasible let alone cost-effective way of addressing the prevention of cirrhosis or identifying those at risk. Putting substance-related symptoms together and calling the result a 'severity dimension' of SUD does not make SUD a construct-valid disorder. Non-disordered conditions can be severe (e.g., pain in childbirth, normal grief, binge drinking upon arrival at college). Moreover, the diagnostic threshold should be the point at which the diagnostician is justified in attributing a disorder (e.g., impaired control) rather than a non-disorder 18. In SUD's polythetic diagnostic criteria set, every symptom is given equal weight in meeting diagnostic threshold requirements, so adding weaker indicators of dysfunction from the former abuse criteria allows ample false positives to arise when the diagnostic threshold is reached by combinations of weak symptoms. The workgroup denied the accusation that the new criteria would add to disorder diagnoses: 'a concern that \"millions more\" would be diagnosed with the DSM-5 threshold is unfounded' (16, p. 841). This answer (which contradicts the 'prevention' argument that presupposes increased diagnosis) disingenuously construes the baseline as DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse, which, by design, DSM-5 SUD matches in prevalence. The critics of course have in mind a comparison to DSM-IV dependence, which was generally considered the 'real' impaired-control category. As noted, many millions more are indeed diagnosed by DSM-5 SUD. The name change from 'dependence' to 'substance use disorder' was justified by the claim that the label 'dependence' confused addiction with 'physiological dependence' consisting of tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. The workgroup argued, correctly, that physiological dependence is an expectable consequence of the body's adaptation to some medications, including opioid pain medication, and not sufficient by itself to imply addiction (i.e., impaired-control use) 19. This understanding was already reflected in DSM-IV's text and its three-symptom dependence threshold which required at least one additional behavioural symptom of impaired control even when tolerance and withdrawal were present. Nonetheless, the workgroup argued that the verbal confusion of 'dependence' with 'physiological dependence' was a problem in pain medicine, where doctors and patients may resist adequate opioid medication for fear of inducing physiological dependence that is misconstrued as addiction. The potential for confusion certainly exists. However, there is no solid evidence that physicians' or patients' reluctance about opioid medication for non-cancer pain was generally based on this verbal confusion. Nevertheless, the urgent, overriding importance of this terminological change to facilitate prescription of opioid medication was emphasized by the workgroup's Chair: 'Of all the changes proposed by the DSM-5 work group, this one consistently is greeted by standing ovations when presented to audiences of physicians with the responsibility for the treatment of pain' (20, p. 705). This emphasis in the DSM-5 revision process represented a major historic misstep. At the time the workgroup was making these arguments, a massive problem of abuse of opioid medication for non-cancer chronic pain was emerging in the United States, with resultant heroin addiction and a startling number of overdose deaths, as well as associated social dislocations reaching into communities where it had rarely been seen before. Earlier arguments that it was safe to extend opioid use to non-cancer pain were clearly overstated ovations by pain physicians notwithstanding. Perhaps some physician and patient caution about prescription opioid painkillers was not such a bad thing after all. The DSM-5 workgroup was blind to this growing problem that, as they deliberated, was reaching epidemic proportions. If the opioid misstep had stopped at a purely terminological change, it would have been minimally impactful on research and clinical diagnosis, but it did not. Recall that DSM-5 lowered the SUD diagnostic threshold from DSM-IV's 3 of 7 symptoms to any 2 of 11 symptoms, including tolerance and withdrawal. Thus, the DSM-5 workgroup actually created the very problem that supposedly they were trying to address; they made it possible to diagnose SUD (i.e., addiction) based on the two physiological dependence symptoms alone, thus potentially confusing physiological adaptation with impaired-control use. This self-created problem conflicted with the goal of facilitating prescription of opioids for pain. An important exception to making a diagnosis of DSM-5 substance use disorder with two criteria pertains to the supervised use of psychoactive substances for medical purposes, including stimulants, cocaine, opioids, nitrous oxide, sedative-hypnotic/anxiolytic drugs, and cannabis in some jurisdictions. These substances can produce tolerance and withdrawal as normal physiological adaptations when used appropriately for supervised medical purposes. Under these conditions, tolerance and withdrawal in the absence of other criteria do not indicate substance use disorders and should not be diagnosed as such. Note that the labeling of withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use of opioids and other medications as 'normal' in order to argue that withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use should not be used as an indicator of SUD involves a potentially misleading equivocation on the meaning of 'normal'. Having withdrawal symptoms when cutting down on opioids is not a normal human condition in the sense of 'non-disordered' and is recognized as a separate category of DSM disorder. Moreover, withdrawal disorder often leads to impaired-control use and so has traditionally been a central indicator of addiction. Withdrawal is 'normal' only in the weak sense of being an expectable reaction as the body adjusts to the presence of the substance. However, many disorders are expectable under certain conditions, such as a broken bone when a certain level of pressure is applied to a limb. Prescribed use may expectably induce the complication of withdrawal disorder, and by itself, this does not imply addiction, but calling it 'normal' and eliminating it from SUD criteria suggest that physicians should not be concerned about it in the context of assessing addiction in patients, and this is far from the case. Equivocation aside, the ad hoc approach of excluding the tolerance and withdrawal symptom criteria only when evaluating SUD in medically supervised substance use has two fatal problems. First, it is conceptually incoherent. If, as the workgroup argued, tolerance and withdrawal are not a use disorder when the drug is prescribed, then they are not a use disorder when the same drug is not prescribed, for the very same reason provided by the workgroup—namely, they do not by themselves imply impaired-control use. Moreover, the workgroup's approach yields the absurdity that changes in laws can cause and 'cure' disorders. For example, the criteria allow the absurdity that if a medical marijuana user having only tolerance and withdrawal symptoms moves from a state where cannabis use is legal and medically supervised to a state where its use is illegal, and continues precisely the same pattern of medical use with the same symptoms, the individual has gone from being non-disordered to being disordered. Even the results of research will differ by locale due to differences in the legal status of various substances. Second, this approach violates the DSM-5′s (and harmful dysfunction analysis') definition of mental disorder, which states that the existence of disorder cannot be merely a matter of deviance or conflict with society. Yet, the only difference between the disordered and the non-disordered under DSM-5′s SUD criteria may be that one is taking the substance in accordance with legal rules while the other is not. This approach makes DSM-5 diagnosis overtly an instrument of social control unrelated to disorder status, the very outcome that the definition of mental disorder was designed to avoid. The most troubling implication of these conceptually misguided features of DSM-5 SUD diagnosis is that, with an opioid abuse epidemic upon us, diagnosing an individual who may be developing an opioid SUD while taking prescribed pain medication is now more difficult than before. Such an individual who is experiencing marked tolerance and withdrawal symptoms (which are excluded from consideration) must display two additional behavioural symptoms to be diagnosed, rather than just the one required by DSM-IV. The timing for such ill-conceived changes could not be worse. An additional issue is that there is a degree of arbitrariness to the workgroup's focus on physiological dependence as a potential source of false-positive addiction diagnoses among individuals taking prescribed medication. It has long been observed that taking prescribed opioids can lead to false-positive versions of many of the behavioural SUD symptoms as well. For example, a rural individual attempting to escape chronic pain may well spend much time and give up other activities to maintain an opioid prescription if the only available pharmacy is in a distant town. It is also clear that craving when confronted with triggers can exist even without impaired-control use—and the workgroup recognized this by allowing craving to persist consistent with an individual being in remission. Again, the workgroup might have spent more effort systematically refining the symptom items to achieve greater conceptual validity. To conclude, I have argued that the concerns about DSM-5 SUD diagnostic criteria are quite justified, and the arguments put forward by the DSM-5 workgroup to address critics' concerns generally spurious. Despite some welcome improvements including the elimination of the abuse category and the clarification of terminology, DSM-5′s substantial changes to SUD diagnosis fail to strengthen validity or clinical utility and diverge markedly from projected ICD-11 criteria. In adding highly face-invalid criteria such as hazardous use and social conflicts to a category that is supposed to represent a motivational dysfunction of impaired control, and then lowering the diagnostic threshold to a level that allows weaker-validity criteria by themselves to qualify for diagnosis, DSM-5 has cast into doubt the hard-fought and still controversial validity of SUD as a category of psychiatric disorder. The changes weaken and even abandon the conceptual foundations of the substance disorders field as part of psychiatry. My analysis presupposes that there is such a thing as impaired control of use that warrants psychiatric diagnosis. This assumption is currently under challenge from a variety of quarters. If this assumption is false, then by all means we should move on to a different conceptualization of the kinds of compulsive harmful substance use that we now conceptualize as addiction. The problem is that the DSM-5 workgroup verbally retained the impaired-control framework while reformulating diagnostic criteria in ways inconsistent with that framework. This undermines the ability to pursue good science addressing the validity of the concept of addiction and of the impaired-control model. If ICD-11 resists the temptation to move toward some of DSM-5′s innovations, it will provide a much-needed alternative approach to addictive disorder diagnosis that could become the field's preferred standard for advancing addiction science.",

      "abstract": "The major concepts presented in this review can be summarized as follows: 1. There is a multidirectional continuum of anesthetic states—some represented by CNS excitation and others by depression. 2. The reticular activating system is influenced by all anesthetics; some inhibit its action (stage III) and some hyperexcite the system resulting in a function disorganization (stage II-C). 3. Some agents traverse both excitation and depression, diethyl ether (I, II, III). 4. Others induce only stage II—catalepsia, e.g. nitrous oxide, ketamine, gamma-hydroxybutyrate, alpha-chloralose, phencyclidine, trichlorethylene, and enflurane. 5. Others induce no stage II but progress directly from stage I stage III, e.g. halothane and barbiturates. 6. Cataleptic agents may induce further CNS excitation manifested by seizures, e.g. gamma-hydroxybutyrate, phencyclidine, ketamine, alpha-chloralose, trichlorethylene, and enflurane. 7. The functional definition of surgical anesthesia is: a stage induced by a drug that makes the subject relatively unresponsive to painful stimuli and amnestic. Thus, the subject does not respond during surgery and cannot recall what happened afterwards. This state can be achieved by functional disruption of CNS systems by marked stimulation or depression.",

      "abstract": "Many patients within the Bipolar spectrum, especially when recurrence is high and the inter-episodic period is not free of affective manifestations, may meet criteria for personality disorders. This is particularly true for cyclothymic patients, who are often misclassified as borderline personality disorder because of their extreme mood instability and reactivity. In patients with cyclothymic temperament, lifetime comorbidity with anxiety disorders, in particular panic disorder-agoraphobia, bulimia nervosa, body dysmorphic disorder, alcohol and substance abuse disorder and both cluster C (anxious) and cluster B (dramatic) personality disorders, is the rule rather than the exception [1]. In particular, a large proportion of these patients meet DSM-IV criteria for borderline personality disorders. Cyclothymic-bipolar II-borderline patients display a long-lasting hyper-reactivity to many psychological (i.e, rejection, separation) and physical (i.e., food, light, drugs) stimuli. This marked reactivity of mood could also explain the frequent concomitance of impulse control disorder and substances and alcohol abuse. An analysis of the explanatory power of affective temperaments and personality disorders for each of the criteria of BPD (Perugi et al., in press) revealed that the presence of cyclothymic temperament explains much of the relationship between bipolar II disorder and BPD. The diagnosis of BPD in these patients was favored by the coexistence of an affective cyclothymic temperamental dysregulation coexisting with anxious-dependent traits. We find no reason to separate bipolar II with cyclothymic instability from the stable instability of the borderline type, because mood lability is a common characteristic of both sets of disorders. Further, correlational analyses [2] indicate that in bipolar II atypical depressives mood reactivity and interpersonal sensitivity traits might be related constructs with a cyclothymic temperamental matrix.",

Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

A few outcomes of sleep loss are obesity in adults and children, diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, anxiety symptoms, depressed mood and alcohol use. Sleep disorders are frequently associated with psychiatric issues particularly depression. Studies have demonstrated that individuals with a sleeping disorder have a ten times risk of having depression in contrast to individuals who rest soundly. OSA is also linked with depression. SSRIs which increase 5-HT function increase REM sleep latency, and reduce REM sleep. Some individuals show significant improvements in depressive symptoms following a night of incomplete or complete lack of sleep, leading physicians to consider using sleep deprivation as an intervention. Antidepressants and other treatments for depression can have a beneficial effect on sleep.

      "abstract": "Buprenorphine, a partial μ-opioid agonist and κ-opioid antagonist, is frequently used in the treatment of heroin dependence, and to prevent complications arising from intravenous injection and social consequences of heroin use. Psychosis occurring after discontinuation of buprenorphine or other opioids has been described, but is uncommon. We report the case of a 37-year-old man, suffering from opiates dependence, presenting acute and intense psychotic symptoms beginning after an abrupt discontinuation of buprenorphine, which he was taking for two years as substitution therapy for heroin dependence. The initial medication by risperidone, up to a dose of 8 mg/day was inefficient to control psychotic symptoms. Four weeks later, buprenorphine was finally restarted at 8 mg/day, which allowed a complete remission of psychotic and anxiety-related symptoms. The antipsychotic medication was gradually discontinued two months later, allowing the patient to remain symptom-free eighteen months later. We discuss the potential role of abrupt withdrawal syndrome in the apparition of the psychotic symptoms and the presence of a latent psychotic disorder. An interesting issue in our case report is that a correctly conducted antipsychotic treatment did not succeed in stopping symptoms of delusions, even after four weeks, while reintroducing buprenorphine did, showing in this context an antipsychotic effect. This case report highlights the importance of taking opiate dependence into account in patients with recent onset of psychotic symptoms, even several weeks after withdrawal.",

In this sense, it may be possible to place organic solvents like bond, gas or thinner and narcotics like marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine or heroine under the category of drugs. These drugs are characteristic of having positive medicinal as well as side effects upon human being including but not limited to excitement, hallucinatory image, auditory hallucination, relaxation, sleeping, anorexia, nerve stability, schizophrenia, anaesthesia, brain damage, narcissism, etc. Abuse of drugs, however, would result in direct and indirect impact upon the society, family and industry as a whole by ruining of families, unemployment, loss of manpower, and catastrophic damage of physical and mental health of all people. Strong cling to drugs could also cause devastation of personality by abandoning relationship with family members and friends and even jobs, hobbies and culture and would eventually make addicts unsociable. Furthermore, abuse of drugs could be a cause for more serious phenomenon of social pathology such as drastic increase of inhuman violent crimes, crimes without specific motives, frequent burglary and theft to raise the money to buy drugs with. In contrast with the global trend to enforce the regulations for drug-related crimes, the Korean judiciary authorities keep on dealing leniently with offenders, especially when they are first timers, by only charging the fine not exceeding 50 million Won. To put use of drugs under control, it seems more effective to install and operate facilities which are dedicated to providing supports for drug addicts to get free from the cycle of crimes and return to the society. In sum, it would be extremely important to study the measures needed to prevent occurrence of drug-related crimes because the issue of addiction can not　rely on legal punishments alone. The legal system that imposes heavy penalty upon drug-related crimes may be effective to a certain extent in terms of crime prevention but has limit in itself. It is therefore most imperative to respond in a more active way to prevention of drug-related crimes by introducing the educational programs for drug addiction, by training experts who can treat drug addicts, not to speak of working out preventive measures from the perspective of criminal legislation and socio-cultural aspects as well.",

      "abstract": "The concept of depression encompasses a series of psychopathological disorders that differ in regard to symptomatology, severity, course and prognosis. It is important to individualize these disorders for a better understanding of the following studies and of their diagnostic management. Major depressive disorder, as defined by CID X 1 and DSM IV , may have different clinical characteristics (table I). A specifier that may be employed in diagnosing the major depressive episode is the presence of melancholic symptoms (melancholia), whose main characteristic is the loss of interest and pleasure in all or almost all activities and a lack of reactivity to usually pleasant stimuli. In these circumstances, the depressive mood does not improve, not even temporarily, when something positive happens. Yet, at least three of the following symptoms should be present for the diagnosis of major depression to be made: depressive mood qualitatively different from the normal, worsening in the morning, terminal insomnia (to wake up at least two hours before the usual time), psychomotor retardation or agitation, anorexia or significant weight loss (5% of the body weight per month), excessive or inappropriate guilt. Sometimes, however, the depressive disorder is atypical with mood reactivity, i.e., enhancement of the mood in response to real or potential positive events, significant weight gain, increase in appetite, hypersomnia, sensation of heaviness in the upper and lower limbs, in addition to a prolonged pattern of sensitivity to interpersonal rejection resulting in significant social or occupational impairment . The dysthymic disorder (dysthymia) is characterized by a chronically depressed mood lasting for most of the day, for the majority of days, and lasting for at least two years . The individual may note significant reduction in usual interests and in self-criticism, frequently seeing himself or herself as uninteresting and incapable. As these symptoms become part of daily life, usually they are not mentioned by the patient unless directly inquired about by Andre Luiz Langer Manica, Carolina Garcia Soares Leaes, Benicio Noronha Frey, Mario Francisco Juruena",

      "title": "Serotonin Syndrome Without Overdose: Polypharmacy-Induced Toxicity in a Medically Stable Young Adult",
      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonin activity in the central and peripheral nervous systems that can lead to symptoms such as altered mental status, autonomic instability (e.g., hyperthermia and hypertensive tachycardia), and neuromuscular abnormalities (e.g., clonus and tremor). We present the case of a 29-year-old male healthcare worker with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD), temporal lobe epilepsy, and suspected obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) who presented with sudden-onset agitation, confusion, and abnormal limb movements after his third consecutive 12-hour overnight shift. He had been on stable outpatient doses of escitalopram 20 mg and bupropion XL 150 mg daily for over six months, with naltrexone 50 mg added three months earlier for off-label psychiatric use. In the emergency department, he was treated for presumed seizure or psychosis with multiple sedatives and antipsychotics and subsequently intubated. EEG showed no epileptiform activity, and lumbar puncture was unremarkable. Neurologic findings, including hyperreflexia, clonus, and rigidity, along with rapid clinical improvement following cyproheptadine and benzodiazepines, supported a diagnosis of serotonin syndrome. The patient denied overdose or substance use, and toxicology review concluded that polypharmacy with serotonergic and modulating agents was the likely trigger. We present a young adult who developed serotonin syndrome without overdose, likely due to the cumulative serotonergic effect of multiple prescribed medications at therapeutic doses. This case emphasizes the importance of clinical vigilance in patients with neuropsychiatric comorbidities on centrally acting agents, even in the absence of recent medication changes. It illustrates that even therapeutic combinations of serotonergic and modulating agents can precipitate life-threatening toxicity.",

      "abstract": "To minimize the symptoms of antidepressant discontinuation, gradual tapering is necessary for all serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) except fluoxetine, which has an extended half-life. Agents with shorter half-lives such as venlafaxine, fluvoxamine, and paroxetine should be tapered gradually. Discontinuation symptoms, which frequently emerge after abrupt discontinuation or intermittent non-compliance and, less frequently, during dose reduction, are generally mild, short-lived, and self-limiting but can be distressing and may lead to missed work days and decreased productivity. The symptoms may be somatic (e.g., dizziness and light-headedness; nausea and vomiting; fatigue, lethargy, myalgia, chills, and other flu-like symptoms; sensory and sleep disturbances) or psychological (anxiety and/or agitation, crying spells, irritability). Mild symptoms can often be treated by simply reassuring the patient that they are usually transient, but for more severe symptoms, it may be necessary to reinstitute the dosage of the original antidepressant and slow the rate of taper. Symptoms of discontinuation may be mistaken for physical illness or relapse into depression; misdiagnosing the symptoms may lead to unnecessary, costly tests and treatment. Thus, health care professionals need to be educated about the potential adverse effects of SRI discontinuation.",

      "title": "Magnesium Deficiency. Etiology and Clinical Spectrum",
      "abstract": "Abstract Magnesium deficiency may complicate many diseases. The causes include the following: inadequate intake during starvation or increased requirement during early childhood, pregnancy, or lactation; excessive losses of magnesium as a result of malabsorption from the gastrointestinal tract or from the kidneys during use of diuretics; and to a combination of the two, as in alcoholism. Most often the etiological factors have been operative for a month or more. Acute hypo‐magnesemia can occur without previous Mg deficiency after epinephrine, cold stress and stress of serious injury or extensive surgery. The clinical manifestations depend on the age of the patient and may begin insidiously or with dramatic suddenness, or there may be no overt symptoms or signs. The manifestations can be divided into the following categories: totally non‐specific symptoms and signs ascribable to the primary disease; neuromuscular hyperactivity including tremor, myoclonic jerks, convulsions, Chvostek sign, Trousseau sign (rarely), spontaneous carpopedal spasm (rarely), ataxia, nystagmus and dysphagia; psychiatric disturbances from apathy and coma to some or all facets of delirium; cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation and sudden death; hypocalcemia which is responsive only to Mg therapy; and hypokalemia which is not easily nor completely corrected without Mg therapy. The diversity of etiologies and the multiplicity of manifestations result in confusion and controversy. The documentation of normal renal function is absolutely necessary for maximum doses. The order of magnitude of dose is 1.0 meq Mg/kg on day 1, and 0.3 to 0.5 mEq/kg per day for 3 to 5 days. In emergencies such as convulsions or ventricular arrhythmias, a bolus injection of 1.0 gm (8.1 meq) of MgSO 4 is indicated. Therapy of Mg deficiency in the presence of renal insufficiency requires smaller doses and frequent monitoring. Complete repletion occurs slowly.",

      "abstract": "A mood disorder is a chronic illness, associated with episodic recurrence over time (1,2); when a patient experiences a new mood episode, explore possible underlying causes of that recurrence. The mnemonic RELAPSE can help you take an informed approach to treatment, instead of making reflexive medication changes (Table, page 54). [R]hythm disturbances. Seasonal changes, shift work, jet lag, and sleep irregularity can induce a mood episode in a vulnerable patient. Failure of a patient's circadian clock to resynchronize itself after such disruption in the dark-light cycle can trigger mood symptoms. [E]nding treatment. Intentional or unintentional non-adherence to a prescribed medication or psychotherapy can trigger a mood episode. Likewise, switching from a brand-name medication to a generic equivalent can induce a new episode because the generic drug might be as much as 20% less bioavailable than the brand formulation. (3) [L]ife change. Some life events, such as divorce or job loss, can be sufficiently overwhelming--despite medical therapy and psychotherapy--to induce a new episode in a vulnerable patient. [A]dditional drugs. Opiates, interferon, steroids, reserpine, and other drugs can be depressogenic; on the other hand, steroids, anticholinergic agents, and antidepressants can induce mania. If another physician, or the patient, adds a medication or supplement that causes an interaction with the patient's current psychotropic prescription, the result might be increased metabolism or clearance of the psychotropic--thus decreasing its efficacy and leading to a new mood episode. [P]hysical health changes. Neurologic conditions (epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, stroke), autoimmune illnesses (eg, lupus), primary sleep disorders (eg, obstructive sleep apnea), and hormone changes (eg, testosterone, estrogen, and thyroid) that can occur over the lifespan of a patient with a mood disorder can trigger a new episode. [S]ubstance use and withdrawal. Chronic use of alcohol and opiates and withdrawal from cocaine and stimulants in a patient with a mood disorder can induce a depressive episode; use of cocaine, stimulants, and caffeine can induce a manic state. [E]nd of drug response. Some patients experience a loss of drug response over time (tachyphylaxis) or a depressive recurrence while taking an antidepressant.

      "title": "Parental alienation: the impact on men’s mental health",
      "abstract": "Parental alienation is defined as a mental state in which a child, usually one whose parents are engaged in a high-conflict separation or divorce, allies himself strongly with one parent (the preferred parent) and rejects a relationship with the other parent (the alienated parent) without legitimate justification. Parental alienation may affect men's mental health: a) parental alienation negatively influences mental health of male children and adolescents who are victims of parental alienation. Alienated children/adolescents display guilt, sadness, and depressed mood; low self-esteem and lack of self-confidence; distress and frustration; lack of impulse control, substance abuse and delinquent behavior; separation anxiety, fears and phobias; hypochondria and increased tendency to develop psychosomatic illness; suicidal ideation and suicide attempt; sleep and eating disorders; educational problems; enuresis and encopresis; b) parental alienation negatively affects the mental health of adult men who were victims of parental alienation when they were children and/or adolescents. Long-term effects of parental alienation include low self-esteem, depression, drug/alcohol abuse, lack of trust, alienation from own children, divorce, problems with identity and not having a sense of belonging or roots, choosing not to have children to avoid being rejected by them, low achievement, anger and bitterness over the time lost with the alienated parent; c) parental alienation negatively influences mental health of men who are alienated from their children. Fathers who have lost some or all contact with their children for months or years following separation or divorce may be depressed and suicidal.",

      "abstract": "To make a diagnosis of concussion, you need a reliable history of 2 things: (1) An acute external physical force applied to the brain AND (2) An impairment in the function of the brain directly caused by the external physical force. One or the other is not enough. You need both. You do not need a scan or lab test to make the diagnosis. No scan or test can “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. You do not need to perform a detailed neurological exam to make the diagnosis. The neurological exam is usually unremarkable except for immediately after the concussion. No exam findings “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. A collateral source is key to obtaining a reliable history. The impairment in brain function occurs immediately after the event. The impairment is worst immediately after the event, then gradually improves. There is no other obvious explanation for the impairment.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is an acutely evolving and severe medical emergency. It occurs in several medical and psychiatric disorders but is often missed or misdiagnosed. There are majorly three different categories; the retarded, excited and malignant types. The latter is the most severe due to the associated autonomic instability. Much is unknown about the pathophysiology, but dysfunction of cortico-cortical modulation and a \"top-down modulation\" of the basal ganglia resulting from a deficiency of GABA in the cerebral cortex, resulting in motor dysfunction and glutamate hyperactivity and dopamine hypoactivity at the D2 receptor have been proposed. Benzodiazepines, especially Lorazepam, are reportedly effective, but reports of other benzodiazepines, Zopiclone and trials of mood stabilisers are documented. Electroconvulsive therapy is the suggested next line of action in case benzodiazepine fail, while the use of antipsychotic in catatonia is inconclusive. We present a case series of catatonia in 1) acute on chronic renal failure, complicated with uraemic encephalopathy and 2) severe depressive disorder with psychotic features. Physicians are encouraged to have a high index of suspicion to forestall the lethal complications.",

      "abstract": "L’insomni es un trastorn caracteritzat per la insatisfaccio en la qualitat i/o quantitat del son, que persisteix durant un considerable periode de temps. Es un son no reparador, amb consequencies diurnes com la fatiga, la irritabilitat o la disminucio de l’alerta, que afecta tant la vida social com laboral de l’individu. Dels diferents trastorns primaris del son, l’etiologia dels quals no es deguda a una malaltia mental, medica o a cap substancia, l’insomni primari te una prevalenca mitjana a la poblacio del 30%. Historicament el tractament farmacologic de l’insomni ha tingut com a principal diana el receptor GABA(A). L’evolucio dels hipnotics que actuen sobre aquest receptor, ha aportat una millora en la seva eficacia i seguretat. Tot i aixi, encara tenen efectes no desitjats com l’insomni de rebot, la dependencia, l’amnesia anterograda o la tolerancia. El nostre objectiu es trobar un candidat que millori els inconvenients dels hipnotics actuals. Seguint una estrategia de cribratge, seleccionar un compost amb: 1) major selectivitat in vitro per la subunitat ?1 del receptor GABA(A), implicada en el son, 2) activitat hipnotica in vivo que no alteri l’arquitectura del son i 3) una absorcio oral rapida i vida mitjana adequada. Dels 1214 compostos que es van cribrar en total, dos van presentar una elevada selectivitat in vitro per la subunitat alfa-1 del receptor GABA(A) major que la del zolpidem, el farmac de referencia mes selectiu que hi ha actualment al mercat. Aquesta selectivitat in vitro dels compostos, es correlaciona amb la selectivitat in vivo, de manera que els compostos mes selectius per la subunitat alfa-1 in vitro, son tambe els que indueixen sedacio in vivo sense efectes no desitjats com la relaxacio muscular associada a la subunitat alfa-2 del receptor GABA(A) Pero l’efecte in vivo no depen nomes de l’afinitat del compost pel receptor, sino tambe del nombre de receptors que el compost ocupa al teixit diana i de la seva eficacia intrinseca per activar-los i generar una resposta biologica. L’ocupacio de receptors s’ha analitzat en estudis ex-vivo i s’ha relacionat amb l’efecte observat en els assaigs de comportament in vivo. Quan es determina l’ocupacio ex-vivo del receptor GABA(A) per part dels compostos en determinades arees del cervell, on predomina una determinada subunitat del receptor, els compostos amb mes afinitat per la subunitat alfa-1 que indueixen sedacio a dosi mes baixa, tambe son els que per norma general requereixen menys dosi per assolir el 50% d’ocupacio ex-vivo dels receptors a cerebel (on predomina la subunitat alfa-1 implicada en sedacio). En el mateix sentit, els compostos menys afins per alfa-2 que requereixen una dosi mes alta per induir relaxacio muscular, son tambe els que per norma general assoleixen el 50% d’ocupacio ex-vivo a medul•la (on predomina la subunitat alfa-2) a una dosi mes gran. Les dades d’ocupacio ex-vivo a cerebel corroboren l’afinitat dels compostos in vitro per la subunitat alfa-1 del receptor GABA(A). En base als resultats presentats en la present Tesi Doctoral, es conclou que s’ha generat i seleccionat un candidat que podria millorar els inconvenients dels hipnotics actuals en els estudis preclinics.",

The diagnostic criteria for mania require the presence of distinct periods of abnormal mood characterized by euphoria, expansiveness, or irritability. The change in mood is accompanied by increased activity or energy as well as other symptoms such as grandiosity, decreased sleep, increased speech, flight of ideas, distractibility, agitation, and increased involvement in risky behaviors. The assessment of bipolar disorder should include a detailed psychiatric history ascertaining the presence of current or previous mood symptoms. Children and adolescents are more likely to present with either rapidly fluctuating or a mixed mood state. Bipolar disorder is associated with high relapse rates, even among those receiving treatment. The first-line medication class is second-generation antipsychotics. Additional psychosocial treatments such as psychoeducation, psychotherapy, and community engagement can also be helpful.",

Also, for both agents there are no prominent physical withdrawal symptoms, except for depression. Almost all addicts become psychotic on one or more occasions. The psychosis is very similar for amphetamine and cocaine and difficult to distinguish from paranoid schizophrenia.

      "abstract": "Stimulant drugs such as amphetamine, nicotine and Ecstasy/MDMA, are taken for positive reasons such as mood enhancement. Yet their repetitive use can lead to a range of psychobiological deficits and psychiatric distress. There are several underlying neurobiological factors for this. Their acute subjective effects are typically positive, with greater alertnessand emotional engagement. However during the post-drug recovery period the opposite states predominate, with feeling of tiredness and sadness. Every recreational central nervous system (CNS) stimulant drug causes this mood fluctuation. They are most evident in drugs with a very rapid onset and come-down, such as cocaine or nicotine. Hence regular smokers report good moods immediately after smoke inhalation, followed by poor moods 30-60 minutes later. This rapidity of these mood changes with nicotine and cocaine, helps explain why they are also the most addictive. Parallel fluctuations occur across many other psychological functions, with impoverished cognitive skills when off-drug. CNS stimulant drugs also adversely affect the HPA axis, impairing sleep and disrupting homeostasis. These core psychobiological problems help explain their adverse psychiatric effects, since fluctuating mood states and disrupted homeostatic stability, can exacerbate any prior psychiatric susceptibilities (for anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, or other disorders). In summary, the repetitive stimulation of the CNS by recreational drugs can be very damaging to the organism, both acutely and chronically.",

      "title": "Secondary headache attributed to exposure to or overuse of a substance",
      "abstract": "Background Secondary headaches attributed to exposure to or the overuse of a substance are classified under chapter eight in the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition. Three distinct sub-chapters consider: 1. Headache attributed to exposure to a substance, 2. Medication overuse headache, and 3. Headache attributed to substance withdrawal. Headache attributed to exposure to a substance refers to a headache with onset immediately or within hours after the exposure, while medication overuse headache is a headache occurring on 15 or more days per month that has developed as a consequence of regular usage of acute headache medication(s) for more than three consecutive months in a patient with a pre-existing primary headache disorder. The withdrawal of caffeine, oestrogen, and opioids is most often associated with the development of headache. Discussion Despite the current headache classification, there is no certainty of a causal relationship between the use of any substance and the development of headache. Some substances are likely to provoke headache in patients that suffer from a primary headache disorder like migraine, tension-type headache or cluster headache, while others were described to cause headache even in people that generally do not get headaches. Toxic agents, such as carbon monoxide (CO) are difficult to investigate systematically, while other substances such as nitric oxide (NO) were specifically used to induce headache experimentally. If a patient with an underlying primary headache disorder develops a headache, in temporal relation to exposure to a substance, which is significantly worse than the usual headache it is considered secondary. This is even more the case if the headache phenotype is different from the usually experienced headache characteristics. Medication overuse headache is a well-described, distinct disease entity with only marginally understood pathophysiology and associated psychological factors. Managing medication overuse headache patients includes education, detoxification, prophylactic treatments and treating comorbidities, which is reflected in available guidelines. Viewing medication overuse headache as a separate entity helps clinicians and researchers better recognise, treat and study the disorder. Conclusion Identification of substances that may cause or trigger secondary headache is important in order to educate patients and health care professionals about potential effects of these substances and prevent unnecessary suffering, as well as deterioration in quality of life. Treatment in case of medication overuse and other chronic headache should be decisive and effective.",

      "abstract": "We present diagnostic criteria for mal de débarquement syndrome (MdDS) for inclusion into the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders. The criteria include the following: 1] Non-spinning vertigo characterized by an oscillatory perception (‘rocking,’ ‘bobbing,’ or ‘swaying’) present continuously or for most of the day; 2] Onset occurs within 48 hours after the end of exposure to passive motion, 3] Symptoms temporarily reduce with exposure to passive motion (e.g. driving), and 4] Symptoms persist for &gt;48 hours. MdDS may be designated as “in evolution,” if symptoms are ongoing but the observation period has been less than 1 month; “transient,” if symptoms resolve at or before 1 month and the observation period extends at least to the resolution point; or “persistent” if symptoms last for more than 1 month. Individuals with MdDS may develop co-existing symptoms of spatial disorientation, visual motion intolerance, fatigue, and exacerbation of headaches or anxiety. Features that distinguish MdDS from vestibular migraine, motion sickness, and persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD) are reviewed. Motion-moderated oscillatory vertigo can also occur without a motion trigger, typically following another vestibular disorder, a medical illness, heightened psychological stress, or metabolic disturbance. Terminology for this non-motion triggered presentation has been varied as it has features of both MdDS and PPPD. Further research is needed into its phenomenological and biological relationship to MdDS, PPPD, and other vestibular disorders.",

A two-compartment model consisting of and dependence was used to clarify clinical features of dependence. was defined by drug liking. Dependence was defined by a compulsion to take a drug, and drug-induced pathological symptoms (withdrawal syndrome and acute disorders) and social disturbance. Nicotine produced a mild or the least degree of drug liking and withdrawal syndrome, without any significant social disturbance, or acute disorders. Thus, differed from other forms of drug in that was not associated with dependence syndrome. This review also introduced other current topics of dependence. First, adolescence is regarded as a risk factor for the development of dependence, whereas the involvement of gender difference (female) in this respect is controversial. Secondly, many smokers feel difficulties in quitting smoking in spite of the weak potential of nicotine, which is known as the nicotine paradox. Several working hypotheses have been presented to explain this phenomenon. For example, has relatively strong conditioning effects and/or liability compared with other drugs of abuse. However, further studies should be carried out to clarify clinical characteristics of the nicotine paradox.",

      "abstract": "A 37 year old woman presented to her general practitioner with a two month history of low mood, poor sleep, and irritability. She was initially treated for depression with sertraline. Her mood improved slightly over six weeks, but, because of continued insomnia and irritability, her medication was changed to citalopram, with no further improvement. Through regular review and the building of a trusting relationship with her doctor, the patient felt able to disclose that she was experiencing intrusive images of past domestic violence. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and referred for trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy; over 15 sessions, this led to a substantial reduction in her symptoms. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe, prolonged, and impairing psychological reaction to a distressing event. The precipitating incident must be “exceptionally threatening or catastrophic”1 and can range from interpersonal violence and combat to accidents and natural disasters; sexual violence is a particularly potent cause.2 Serious illnesses or medical interventions can also precipitate PTSD if the individual perceived their own or someone else’s health or life to be under threat. The individual repeatedly relives the event through intrusive imagery, bodily re-experiencing, nightmares, and flashbacks. Irritability, insomnia, and other symptoms related to increased arousal also occur. Sufferers usually have difficulty remembering aspects of the event and avoid reminders of it (see box of diagnostic criteria). Children may act out the traumatic event through repetitive play, drawings, and stories, and have frightening dreams without recognisable content.3 Adolescents with PTSD can show aggressive or withdrawn behaviour and can find it difficult to relate to their peers. #### Diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) classification of mental and behavioural disorders1)",

This means that it is not an “official” disorder in the DSM, but one on which the American Psychiatric Association request additional research. The DSM diagnostic criteria for addictions to the X-subject generally include: – repetitive use of X, that leads to significant issues with functioning; – preoccupation or obsession with X; – craving/withdrawal symptoms when not dealing with X; – the person has tried to stop or curb X, but has failed to do so; – the person has had a loss of interest in other life activities, such as hobbies; – a person has had continued overuse of X even with the knowledge of how much they impact a person's life; – the person uses X to relieve anxiety related to other issues; – the person has lost or put at risk and opportunity or relationship because of X. I suggest that some sport fans may: – meet the above mentioned criteria; – be subject to over-identification with “their team performances”, superstitious conditioning and loss of self-consciousness that may lead to a full blown addictive syndrome, along with comorbidity with pathological gambling. This seems particularly true in Italy, for example, as far as the phenomenon of ultra football supporters is concerned. I argue that further research might be needed to explore the psycho-social consequences of obsessive sport addiction and how this may impact on a person's overall functioning.",

      "title": "Agenda for specialty section in addiction medicine",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Addictive behavior is any activity or behavior that has become the major focus of a person's life to the exclusion of other activities, or that has begun to harm the individual or others physically, mentally, or socially. Addictive behavior increases the risk of disease and/or associated personal and social problems. They are often experienced subjectively as \"loss of control\", that is, the behavior continues to occur despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use. Addiction implies psychological dependence, physical dependence, and a set of withdrawal symptoms if the substance is unavailable.[1] There are many common characteristics among the various addictive behaviors. First, the individual becomes obsessed (constantly thinks) of the object, activity, or substance and will seek it out, often to the detriment of work or interpersonal relationships. The person will compulsively engage in the activity even if he does not want to. Upon cessation of the activity, withdrawal symptoms of irritability, craving, and restlessness will often occur. The person does not appear to have control as to when, how long, or how much he will continue the behavior. He often denies problems resulting from his engagement in the behavior even though others can see the negative effects of it. Further, individuals with addictive behaviors will usually have low self esteem.[2] BURDEN OF PROBLEM Substance-related disorders have become matters of global concern because of impact on individual health, familial and social consequences, criminal and legal problems, and the effects on national productivity and economy. All the problems from use to dependence and from the most innocuous substance like tea/coffee to the most hard substances, contribute to the cost that the human society or a particular nation has to bear. In India, although alcohol use in ancient times and cannabis/affim (opium) in more recent times have been known and reported for some time, substance use problems have been recognized to have a significant importance as a public health problem only very recently. They are of particular concern among slum dwellers, transport workers, and youth.[3] Tobacco is the substance most easily accessible worldwide as well as in India. About one-fifth of the Indian population abuse tobacco, about 70% of this in the smoking form.[4] Passive smoking is a significant health hazard. There are 700,000 deaths per year due to smoking and 800,000–900,000 deaths per year due to all forms of tobacco use in India. Many of the deaths (>50%) are occurring below 70 years.[5] An estimated 34–42% of adult Indian population reports having used alcohol in their lifetime; 5–7% has been estimated to be abuser of alcohol; and 10–20 million persons have been estimated to be in need of treatment for dependence. A survey in India revealed that medical professionals had a higher rate of use and heavy use than general population.[5] Nearly 20–30% of admissions and consultations are due to alcohol-related problems in different healthcare settings but are under-recognized by primary care physicians.[6] With respect to heroin, India has now changed from being a transit country to a user country. General population surveys in India show opioid abuse rate as high as 24.8%. Another great concern especially with injectable opioids is spread of AIDS. Further, cannabis abuse in general population in India is 33% and abuse of tranquilizers is as high as 54%.[3] Remediation at central level: 'The Drug Deaddiction Program' was started in 1987–88 with the establishment of five deaddiction centers in central institutions, viz. AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi; Lady Harding Medical College and Hospital; New Delhi; JIPMER, Pondicherry; and PGI, Chandigarh. The center at NIMHANS, Bangalore was established later as the sixth center. More recently, in 1999, a separate deaddiction center with inpatient setup was started in Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is mainly involved in providing treatment services to the addicts, whereas the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with other aspects of the problem like awareness creation, counseling, and rehabilitation. From 1992–93, the scope of the scheme was enlarged to include assistance to State Governments/Union Territories for developing deaddiction centers in identified medical colleges/district-level hospitals. WHAT WORKS IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS? Treatment of substance-use disorders typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Techniques for medically assisted detoxification are widespread and effective. The following are the different strategies that are found useful in management of substance dependence.[7] i) Home versus inpatient detoxification Published reports have consistently failed to find any difference in outcome between long and short inpatient detoxification programs. Clients can usually complete home detoxification in 5–9 days. In ideal circumstances they are visited twice daily for the first three days and medication is supervised by a relative. Clients are breathalyzed and medication withheld if they have consumed significant amounts of alcohol. ii) Brief interventions Brief interventions are short, focused discussions (often of less than 15 minutes) that can reduce alcohol consumption in some individuals with hazardous drinking. They are designed to promote awareness of the negative effects of drinking and to motivate change. Brief interventions were shown to be moderately effective in the nontreatment-seeking groups, especially for those with less-severe alcohol problems. iii) Abstinence versus controlled use This is a great debate. The goal of controlled (moderate or nonproblem) drinking usually includes some limit on alcohol consumption (e.g., 4 units/day) provided that drinking does not lead to signs of dependence, intoxication, or social, legal and health problems. This runs contrary to the abstinence-based philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous. Controlled drinking may be an option for young, socially stable drinkers with short, less-severe drinking histories. An individual's belief that controlled drinking is an achievable goal is also a good prognostic factor. Most authors agree that controlled drinking should not be recommended for people with heavy dependence. Controlled drinking is an attractive option for public health strategies aimed at nondependent problem drinking. This principle can also be tried for other substances. iv) Alcoholic Anonymous Based on Minnesota model, they involve the recognition that alcoholism is a relapsing illness that requires complete abstinence. Clients acknowledge the problems due to their alcoholism and are encouraged to attend 90 meetings in 90 days. Participants may engage the support of a sponsor who is an AA member who has been sober for at least one year. Similarly, there is narcotic anonymous for opioid addicts and nicotine anonymous for nicotine dependents. The evidence suggests that this twelve-step approach is at least as effective as most structured psychotherapies but not superior to any alternative treatments. v) Psychological therapies Motivational enhancement therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy Social skills training Community reinforcement approach Social behavior and network therapy Contingency management Cue exposure vi) Therapeutic community It requires prolonged residence (often 12–18 months) and it is extremely expensive. Most studies of therapeutic communities are conducted without control groups and the lack of randomization probably leads to selection bias in favor of more motivated patients. vii) Drug treatments Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. Other drugs which have been used for the same are topiramate, citrated calcium carbimide, SSRIs, tiapiride, nalmefene, metronidazole, and ondansetron. The oldest among these is disulfiram, being used from 1950s. Naltrexone was launched in India in 1998 and acamprosate in 2002. However, none has been proved to be significantly better than the other agents. In other words, all are equally effective.[5] Bupropion has been said to be the first line drug for nicotine craving. Another first line agent is nicotine itself, in the form of gum, inhaler, lozenge, patch, and nasal spray. Clonidine and nortriptyline are said to be the second line drugs. But the success rate with each of these drugs is marginal.[8] Sustained release bupropion is also considered to be effective as anticraving agent in cannabis dependence. Nefazodone also significantly reduces cannabis withdrawal related anxiety and muscle pain, while having no effect on dysphoria. The embryonic work on CB1 selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists such as SR141716 (rimonabant) has demonstrated that it successfully blocks the acute psychological and physiological effects of smoked cannabis in experienced human consumers and is well tolerated. There has been even less work on the use of cannabis agonists. However, this is a promising area for future research as a number of oral and inhaled THC preparations are being developed for medical cannabis trials.[9] Maintenance treatment is increasingly emphasized as the main therapy of opioid dependency. Abstinence-oriented therapy is nevertheless an important alternative, mainly psychological, and has considerable advantages for those benefitting from this strategy. Methadone or buprenorphine in tapering doses are used for detoxification along with α2 adrenergic agonists like clonidine or lofexidine. Time-limited agonist therapy is a specific approach using agonist stabilization as the basis for therapeutic interventions preceding tapering off of the maintenance therapy. The preventive effect of naltrexone and other antagonists is well known but the attrition rate is very high. It is also feasible for addicts to be introduced to naltrexone by detoxification under anesthesia or sedation.[10] ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY As elaborated above, substance use is affecting a disproportionately large section of people of India. The prevalence is more than that of all severe mental disorders combined. When it comes to health problems, it should not be gauged merely by its prevalence, but by the health burden and social cost that it wreaks on the society. Psychiatric comorbidities like mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders are also very commonly associated with substance dependence. Thus drug addiction is a titanic problem that needs special clinical attention. Today we are equipped with an arena of treatment strategies, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. What we need is just an improvisation in its implementation. Treatment can be better systematized when addiction medicine is upgraded as a specialty. The specialty section on addiction medicine needs to fulfill the following aims and objectives.[6] Promote and advance the bio-psycho-social contributions to the science and practice of addiction medicine in all its different manifestations. Promote the improvement of the health of persons directly or indirectly impacted by substance-related problems. Promote prevention, control, treatment, and relief of all substance-related problems, as well as conditions which constitute high risk for potential drug-related problems. This involves encouraging and enabling the members of the society to explore and pursue 'evidence based' treatment strategies and prevention methods. This includes liaison with other stake holders, including but not limited to government agencies overseeing health, social justice and welfare, and finance and human development; nongovernmental agencies involved in direct care of persons with substance abuse. Promote other medical specialties and primary healthcare providers. This also requires sharing the expertise of members of the society and other professionals involved in diverse fields such as school mental health, community based rehabilitation, epidemiology, drug trials, maintaining disease registries, to mention a few. Actively engage in advocacy in order to influence policy making and legislation, keeping in mind that substance-use disorders and their consequences constitute a grave public health disorder which imposes an unacceptably severe burden on the health and well being of the people of India. Formulate and recommend standards of treatment and rehabilitation of persons or populations affected directly or indirectly by substance-use disorders. In addition, it will be necessary to obtain recommendations for syllabi and commission resources for the education and training of medical and nonmedical personnel involved in the field. Safeguard the interest of psychiatrists and fellow professionals engaged in the practice of addiction medicine in India. Promote research in the field of addiction science with a focus on translating the benefits of research to the bedside and propagate the use of evidence-based interventions in the daily delivery of mental healthcare. FUNCTIONING OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY SECTION The following are some of the activities that are being suggested as functions of specialty section of addiction medicine:[6] A web portal, linked to the web page of the Indian Psychiatric Society, which will initially host information of relevance to the practice of addiction medicine in India, with direct and indirect links to published or unpublished scientific papers, databases, treatment protocols, available treatment agencies, online resources, etc; and later e-learning sites for online education and training. Coordinating Continuing Medical Education (CME) pertaining to the aspect of the science and practice of addiction medicine, with special emphasis on underserved areas like the northeastern states, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc. Enabling and commissioning position papers on the impact of substance abuse in India, with a view to influence public policy. Engaging with relevant organizations to promote demand-reduction strategies, such as the police to prevent drinking and driving, primary health providers, and emergency rooms for early detection and brief intervention Pursuing the aim of working to safeguard vulnerable populations, for example, inoculating children and adolescents through skills training and sensitizing physicians and pharmacists to prevent over the counter drug abuse. Examining the possibility of creating a national registry, using standardized data-entry protocols. CONCLUSION Substance-use disorders form more than 20% of the case load of psychiatric practitioners. However, practitioners have an attitude of therapeutic nihilism toward the addicted patient. This may be due to various reasons like lack of education about alcohol and substance abuse, attitude of hostility or aversion toward alcoholics, inability or discomfort to deal with the associated psychosocial issues, and learned pessimism about treatment – especially based on experience treating late stage alcoholics. However for effective outcome, early identification and treatment should be the goal. This is possible with more sophistication in the science of addiction medicine. Thus, evolving of a specialty section of addiction medicine is the need of the day.",

      "abstract": "One of the reasons for the development or worsening of cognitive impairment (CI) may be the use of a number of drugs: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antiarrhythmics, antidepressants, glucocorticosteroids, antitumor drugs and a number of others. The negative effect of drugs on cognitive functions is realized due to many pathophysiological mechanisms: disruption of hormonal regulation, decreased neuronal excitability, increased activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors, decreased cerebral circulation, atrophic changes in the brain; many mechanisms have not been fully established. Risk factors for the development of drug-induced CIs are: old age or childhood, brain damage, chronic diseases, genetic factors, the patient's initial CI, polypharmacy, dose and duration of drug use, acute infectious diseases, metabolic disorders, dehydration, acute urinary retention, etc. To diagnose and differentially diagnose drug-induced CI, it is necessary to establish a connection between the start of taking a suspected drug-inducer and a decrease in cognitive functions. The first step in the treatment of drug-induced CI is the abolition of an inducer drug or a reduction in its dose, in cases where it is impossible to discontinue the drug and there is no replacement, special slow-release dosage forms can be considered. The main measures to prevent drug-induced CI include the use of drugs with the lowest risk of their development, assessment of drug interactions, and the use of modern scales to assess the risk of developing this side-effect (anticholinergic burden scale, etc.).",

The strategy to decrease these dysfunctions is the following: 1) reducing the dose of medication; 2) changing antidepressant: replace SSRI by moclobemid, trazodone, bupropion, mirtazpine, which do not delay ejaculation; switching to another antipsychotic: quietiapine, olanzapine, aripripazol, which do not increase serum prolactin; 3) taking a drug holiday for two or three days and 4) adding another drug such as sildenafil if impotence, or a dopaminergic agonist (aripripazol, a partial agonist) or cabergoline, in case of hyperprolactinaemia.",

Implica la presencia de una serie de síntomas y signos físicos, cognitivos, afectivos y sociales, entre estos se incluye el desarrollo de tolerancia; el síndrome de abstinencia; consumo en cantidades mayores o durante un período más largo de lo que inicialmente se pretendía; esfuerzos infructuosos de controlar o interrumpir el consumo; se emplea mucho tiempo en actividades relacionadas con la obtención de la droga; y se presenta una reducción de importantes actividades sociales, laborales o recreativas debido al consumo. Además, se continúa tomando la sustancia a pesar de tener conciencia de problemas psicológicos o físicos persistentes relacionados al consumo. Desde la perspectiva psicodinámica, los conflictos intrapsíquicos e inconscientes de personalidad son determinantes para el desarrollo del trastorno por consumo de alcohol. Estos conflictos surgen de la necesidad de reducir la tensión y la inhibición de los impulsos instintivos básicos, donde el consumo de la droga sirve como un medio para reducir la tensión, es entonces, un mecanismo de defensa regresivo y de evitación, constituye una conducta desadaptativa, autodestructiva y debilitante.",

      "title": "Serotonin Syndrome: Pathophysiology, Clinical Features, Management, and Potential Future Directions",
      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome (SS) (also referred to as serotonin toxicity) is a potentially life-threatening drug-induced toxidrome associated with increased serotonergic activity in both the peripheral (PNS) and central nervous systems (CNS). It is characterised by a dose-relevant spectrum of clinical findings related to the level of free serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]), or 5-HT receptor activation (predominantly the 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A subtypes), which include neuromuscular abnormalities, autonomic hyperactivity, and mental state changes. Severe SS is only usually precipitated by the simultaneous initiation of 2 or more serotonergic drugs, but the syndrome can also occur after the initiation of a single serotonergic drug in a susceptible individual, the addition of a second or third agent to long-standing doses of a maintenance serotonergic drug, or after an overdose. The combination of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), in particular MAO-A inhibitors that preferentially inhibit the metabolism of 5-HT, with serotonergic drugs is especially dangerous, and may lead to the most severe form of the syndrome, and occasionally death. This review describes our current understanding of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation and management of SS, and summarises some of the drugs and interactions that may precipitate the condition. We also discuss the newer novel psychoactive substances (NPSs), a growing public health concern due to their increased availability and use, and their potential risk to evoke the syndrome. Finally, we discuss whether the inhibition of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), in particular the neuronal isoform (TPH2), may provide an opportunity to pharmacologically target central 5-HT synthesis, and so develop new treatments for severe, life-threatening SS.",

The most common illicit substances seen include cannabis, sedatives, hypnotics, anxiolytics, inhalants, opioids, hallucinogens, and stimulants. The specific factors of substance use disorder consist of abuse, intoxication, and physical/psychological dependence. Different substances can be classified based on their effects on the central nervous system. These effects vary depending on the substance and can produce everything from increased energy and euphoria to profound sedation. In general, while the effects vary significantly, the initial stages of substance use disorders are characterized by positive reinforcement, where individuals experience a sense of well-being or euphoria with use. As physiological and psychological dependence progresses, an individual experiences negative reinforcement where substances primarily relieve dysphoria and unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Article AbstractWithdrawal symptoms commonly occur during tapering and/or after discontinuation of antidepressant drugs, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Withdrawal symptomatology does not necessarily subside within a few weeks and may be associated with other manifestations of behavioral toxicity (loss of treatment efficacy, refractoriness, switch into mania/hypomania, or paradoxical reactions). The oppositional model of tolerance provides a pathophysiologic basis for understanding and managing withdrawal syndromes. Reintroducing the antidepressant that was initially used or switching from one antidepressant to another to suppress symptomatology, as suggested by current guidelines, may actually aggravate the state of behavioral toxicity and be detrimental in the long run. Alternative strategies that do not encompass continuation of antidepressant treatment are required, but there is currently lack of adequate research for guiding the clinical approach. Some tentative suggestions are provided.",

      "title": "Postcardiotomy Delirium: An Overview",
      "abstract": "Any one of a number of psychologic patterns may appear cardiotomy: (1) Some patients may be elated and confident after awakening from anesthesis and have no severe changes of affect or neurologic deficit. Denial seems to be for them an adequate defense against anxiety. (2) Others are disoriented and manifest neurologic disturbance immediately after awakening, without a lucid interval. The sensorium begins to clear five days after surgery. (3) Some patients go into delirium after being lucid for as long as a week and have hallucinations, illusions, and motor excitation for a few days-or over several weeks. Pathologic brain changes that are apparently anatomical correlates of neurologic deficits in delirium include anoxic lesions of the hippocampus, and infarcted foci. Physiologic factors that contribute to this reaction include: long periods of extracorporeal circulation, arterial hypotension during surgery, emboli, and low postoperative cardiac output. Age, and the type and severity of heart impairment are also factors. Psychologic factors to be taken into account include preexisting psychopathology and the failure of denial under the stress of physical symptoms or hospitalization. Delirium is fostered by sensory overload (or deprivation) in the recovery room and intensive care unit, and by staff tension. Modification of the intensive care unit environment, the administration of antipsychotic drugs, and metabolic correctives are recommended. Preoperative psychologic evaluation, with therapy as needed, preliminary familiarization with perioperative procedures, as well as collaboration between psychiatrist and surgeon, can do much to prevent post-cardiotomy delirium.",

Developmental issues1) History of injury at birth may contribute to development of schizophrenia2) Season of birth: more schizophrenics are born in early spring or winter10. Neurochemical considerations a. Dopamine hypothesis: excess of dopamine linked topsychotic symptoms 1) Dopamine-blocking drugs seemed to lessen psychoticsymptoms (antipsychotics) 2) Drugs stimulating dopamine release caused psychoticsymptoms (amphetamine, cocaine) 3) Five types of dopamine receptors: D1, D2, D3, D4,D5 a) D1: located in cerebral cortex and basal ganglia b) D2: located in striatum c) D3 and D4: high concentration in the limbicsystem d) D5: located in thalamus, hippocampus, andhypothalamus 4) Hyperactivity of dopamine system (especially D2receptor): thought important to positive symptoms of schizophreniab. Postmortem findings in schizophrenics 1) Increased dopamine or homovanillic acid in limbicareas and left amygdala (may be consequence of treatment with antipsychotics)c.

Etiology of the syndrome is not yet clear, post-viral and stress hypotheses were not verified. Diagnosis is confirmed in case of new onset of severe fatigue, for six consecutive months or more; fatigue is leading to significant reduction of the activity levels and is accompanied by other four or more of the specific associated symptoms, which are also lasting for six months or longer. The management of the disease is based on cognitive behavioral therapy, graded exercise therapy and pacing; medication plays a minor role in therapy. The occupational status is severely affected, more than half of the cases being unable to work. Full recovery rate is in average of about 5%.",

      "title": "[Classification of long-term clinical course of 'atypical psychosis': a 20-year follow-up study at a medical school hospital].",
      "abstract": "To study the long-term clinical course and outcomes of atypical psychosis, 8 patients diagnosed with atypical psychosis were observed for more than 12 years (mean, 20 years). Retrospective examination was performed, particularly with respect to clinical features at each episode. The overall course of each case was classified as one of the following three types: Type I--\"Recurrent confused state\" type. Patients frequently repeated acute transient confused or dream-like states in a similar way, sometimes and/or for part of the episode accompanied by a floating paranoid-hallucinatory state. Duration of psychotic episode was short, persisting for a few days to about one month. Type II--\"Manic-depressive illness similar\" type. After a long course of disease, the predominantly early middle-aged patients (30- to 40 years-old) demonstrated fewer original characteristic features of acute confused or dream-like states. Instead, manic or depressive episodes tended to predominate. Duration of psychotic episodes exceeded the duration of type I episodes, to a maximum of about 3 months. Type III--\"Appearance of residual state\" type. After several episodes characterized by transient confused state during middle age, residual states consisting of a slight depressive state, reduced spontaneity and flattening of emotions appear. These states become durable and the periodicity of the disease disappeared. We conclude that the core group of atypical psychosis patients presents with confused symptoms as a clinical feature of episodes, and with the recurrent confused state type representing the long-term clinical course. \"Shift to manic-depressive illness similar\" and \"appearance of residual state\" types were considered to be derived from the core group, according to the interplay of personality structure and viable dynamics.",

Postpartum psychosis is much less common than postpartum depression, commonly assumed to affect about 0.1–0.2% of women in the general population. The strongest risk factor for depression during pregnancy is a history of major depressive disorder. Women with a history of anxiety disorder, postpartum depression, or other previous psychiatric disorders are also at an increased risk for postpartum depression. Untreated maternal depression during pregnancy has been associated with poorer maternal physical and psychological health and with a worse quality of life. Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric illness characterized by episodes of depression alternating with sustained episodes of elevated mood and/or irritability, which are classified as either \"mania\" or \"hypomania.\" Hypomania is an attenuated form of mania with no associated functional impairment.",

In this short review, we will focus on the latter, i.e., the mathematical description of the ventilatory controller and some techniques to measure the ventilatory drive. Note that the model(s) we will discuss can be applied to “chemical control of breathing” only. Chemical control of breathing is control dependent on arterial blood gasses (e.g., PaCO 2 , PaO 2 , and pH), and it is active during states of mental relaxation, such as non‐REM sleep, anesthesia, and possibly physical relaxation. The models do not apply to the respiratory effects of exercise or behavioral/emotional activities such as eating, speaking, and playing a musical instrument.",

Discontinuation symptoms are those that are followed by the suspension or reduction of a medication measure. They are high limitated, reversible by the drug’s reintroduction and they cannot be explained by recurrence of the disruption to which the medication was prescribed. These symptoms do not imply the dependence in medicines. Antidepressants, especially tricyclics, are known for being associated to a group of common symptoms during the discontinuation. These symptoms includes: gastric intestinal disruption and/or general factors(nauseas, vomits, abdominal pain, diarrhea, anorexia, shiverrings, malaise, weakness, tiredness, myalgias, cephalea) initial or avarege insomnia, frequently followed by dreams and/or vivid nightmares pain attacks and delirious abnormal movements(acathisia, Parkinson’s disease). The discontinuation symptoms of ive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are several, and the most commons are generalized malaise, nauseas, cephalea, lethargy, anxiety, paresthesias, confusion, tremors, sudorese, insomnia, irritability and memory disorders. The objective of this thesis is to effect a revision of the medical literature with regard to the discontinued syndrome of antidepressants, its prevalence and main symptoms. As a result, it was found a large prevalence of discontinuation symptoms, such of TCAs as of SSRIs. Among them, the ones of shorter middle life, such as paroxetine, have more probability to cause discontinuation symptoms. The employed method consists in a survey carried out by MEDLINE in indexed medical magazines. Through this revision, it is conclude that the discontinuation symptoms of antidepressants are frequent and it can lead to a refusal of the medical treatment.

      "abstract": "Fatigue is the most frequent adverse event encountered in cancer patients and often underestimated by oncologists. This fatigue results in a deterioration of the quality of life physically, psychologically and socio-professionally. We have to distinguish various degrees of fatigue and identify fatigue from chronic fatigue. The acute fatigue appears normal after a physical or psychological effort and requires less than a week of rest to recover; the impact on quality of life is thus minimal. Chronic fatigue is more insidious; the causes are multiple. The patient feels that this fatigue is abnormal and disproportionate. It last several weeks and has a severe impact on the quality of life. Somatic mechanisms of fatigue related to the tumour and/or treatment are: vitaminic or proteic deficiencies due to malnutrition, accumulation of toxic metabolites, infections and septicemia, the abuse of sleeping tablets or antalgics, insomnias, immobilisation, organic insufficiencies or ionic disturbances. Anemia--observed in more than 50% of the cancerous patients--deserves a particular attention. The causes of this anemia are also multiple. It is obvious that anemia interferes with quality of life of the patient, decreases his physical performances and leads to a lack of motivation or energy. Patients with an hemoglobin level higher than 12 g/dl describe significantly less complaints and a higher physical and functional well being. To better assess the treatment of fatigue, it is important to first evaluate if the cause is organic, psychologic or mixed. Among the somatic causes, nutritious deficiencies, pain and anemia, ... all these complications can be treated with appropriate medications. This fatigue is often recognized by the patient as a progression of the tumour or as a treatment failure. Therefore, it is important to inform the patients of the possibility of that adverse event so that it does not generate additional stress and anxiety during the treatment.",

According to the DSM-IV the term mood disorder is used for a group of diagnoses where the primary symptom is a disturbance in mood, or in other words the experience of an inappropriate, exaggerated or limited range of feelings. Mood disorders can mainly be divided into two groups: (1) depressive episode(s) characterised by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, helplessness, guilt, suicidal thoughts, fatigue, appetite changes, concentration problems and troubles engaging in daily living tasks; (2) manic or hypomanic episode(s) characterised by feelings of grandiosity, extreme energy and heightened arousal. Several treatment options are available for mood disorders – e.g. medication, cognitive and/or behavioural therapy – depending on the severity and the evaluation of the health-care provider. Several studies have shown that mood disorders are common in patients with cancer. In a meta-analysis, the point prevalence of major depression was about 16% and that of anxiety was 10% [1]. The exact causes of mood disorders are largely unknown, but it is hypothesised that an imbalance in neurotransmitters is likely to play a role. The mood disorder can be triggered by the cancer diagnosis on its own, or it can be treatment-induced in cases where the aetiology can be found in the physiological effect of a psychoactive drug or chemical substance. These articles provide an overview of the most common mood disorders among cancer patients. First, Dr. Dauchy will discuss the prevalence, predictive factors and treatment options of depression, one of the most under-diagnosed and inadequately treated mood disorders among cancer patients. Second, Professor Caraceni will introduce drug-associated delirium, an altered state of consciousness with reduced awareness of self and the environment, which may go hand in hand with the inability to think and talk clearly and rationally, hallucinations, disorientation and cognitive impairment. Third, Dr. Die Trill will discuss anxiety, one of the most frequently reported reactions to a cancer diagnosis, which may persist throughout the cancer continuum. In addition, she will shine her light on sleep disorders, which are frequently associated with psychological disorders. Finally, Dr. Schagen will describe the chemotherapy-related changes in cognitive functioning, which can result in diminished functional independence and can last throughout the survivorship period.",

Residual cognitive effects were observed in some but not in all tests after prolonged heavy cannabis use. The effects were mostly mild.

Another serious medical complication arising from drug abuse is the withdrawal syndrome, which manifests during abstinence from the drug. Stimulant drugs are a diverse group of chemicals that act primarily through activation of the sympathetic nervous system. They are sometimes referred to as sympathomimetics. In small to moderate doses, they result in an elevated mood, increased energy and alertness, and decreased appetite. During intoxication, they have profound CNS, cardiovascular system, and metabolic effects. In moderate doses, cocaine produces arousal and euphoria but also anxiety and restlessness. Acute intoxication may result in severe psychiatric disturbances, such as acute anxiety, panic attacks, delirium, or acute psychosis.",

Early emergent medical management consists of life support and an etiology survey, and subsequent treatment can be classified into 4 stages: (1) early SE, (2) established SE, (3) refractory SE, and (4) super-refractory SE. For early SE, benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and diazepam, are the agents of choice, given to terminate the seizure activity rapidly. For established SE (20-30 min after SE onset), the therapeutic strategy is to give parental antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin, valproic acid, and levetiracetam. At the stage of refractory SE (1-2 hours after SE onset), the conventional treatment is induction of general anesthesia using midazolam or propofol. Superrefractory SE is defined as SE that continues, or recurs, for at least 24 hours after the onset of anesthetic therapy. In addition to treatments used in established and refractory SE, other potentially effective therapies include ketamine, magnesium, inhalational anesthetics, immunotherapy, ketogenic diet, induced hypothermia, and neurosurgery. The principle of SE therapy is rapid seizure control and correction of underlying problems. Future well-designed clinical trials are mandatory to establish the standard treatment, especially in settings of established, refractory, and super-refractory SE.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Akathisia is a frequently overlooked syndrome characterized by the subjective complaint of restlessness often with objective increase in movements, including pacing, rocking, and inability to sit or stand still. It is usually noticed within days or weeks of either starting or stopping antipsychotic treatment or changing dosage. Its clinical presentation may resemble other conditions such as anxiety and psychomotor agitation. The management of akathisia involves three steps: prevention, antipsychotic drug adjustment, and symptomatic strategies. Risks and benefits of antipsychotics should always be weighed-in to avoid akathisia. Even though second-generation antipsychotics were considered to have reduced risk for akathisia, recent data suggest that using second generation antipsychotics with high risk of akathisia would be as harmful as using any first-generation antipsychotics. Combinations, rapid upward or downward titrations, and sudden discontinuation of antipsychotics should be avoided. Beta blockers, anticholinergics, serotonergic medications, and benzodiazepines can help control the symptoms of akathisia.",

      "abstract": "Vaccines are crucial to ending the COVID-19 pandemic. An mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine can cause mild to moderate side effects. A number of cases of cardiac, gastrointestinal, and psychiatric side effects have been reported as rare side effects associated with the COVID-19 vaccine. This article presents a patient, who after the second injection of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, immediately developed anxiety, nonspecific fear, and insomnia as the prodromal phase of psychosis. Starting from the second week, the patient manifested delusions of persecution, delusions of influence, thoughts insertion, and delusional behaviour, culminating in the suicide attempt. The duration of psychosis was eight weeks, and symptom reduction was observed only after the gradual administration of antipsychotics over four weeks. The investigations of the patient did not support any structural changes of the brain, any severe medical conditions, a neurological abnormality, a confusion or a state of unconsciousness or alterations in laboratory tests. Psychosis due to the use of alcohol or psychoactive substances was excluded. The psychological assessment of the patient demonstrated the endogenous type of thinking, and the patient had schizoid and paranoid personality traits strongly associated with schizophrenia. This case indicates a strong causal relationship between the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine injection and the onset of psychosis. We intend to follow up this case for possible development of schizophrenia and understand that the COVID-19 vaccine could possible play a trigger role in the development of primary psychosis. Longer-term supporting evidence is needed to estimate the prevalence of psychosis following vaccination with the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine.",

      "title": "Las suprarrenales en la hipoxia o anoxia",
      "abstract": "La disminución de tensión de oxígeno (hipoxia) es una situación de emergencia que somete el organismo a un esfuerzo (stress), el cual provoca múltiples modificaciones, algunas específicas o sea debidas a la disminución de oxígeno y otras generales, como ser el síndrome de adaptación. Si el animal sobrevive se observa una evolución de los fenómenos en tres fases: a) aguda o reacción de alarma; b) de adaptación o aclimatación; c ) de desadaptación o desaclimatación o descompensación. El sistema nervioso, estimulado inicialmente por la hipoxia, modifica la función de la corteza y la médula suprarrenal. La acción sobre la corteza se debe a que la acción nerviosa central provoca un aumento de la secreción de adrenocorticotrofina por la pars distalis de la hipófisis. La acción sobre la médula suprarrenal consiste en un estímulo sobre los centros simpáticos superiores (hipotálamo, etc.), que siguiendo la médula espinal y los nervios esplácnicos mayores y menores produce una fuerte descarga de adrenalina. Si la hipoxia es intensa o se provoca la asfixia, la descarga de adrenalina es una de las más intensas que pueden observarse y dura varios minutos. La reacción inicial sobre la corteza se produce al través de la hipófisis y por lo tanto falta en animales hipofisoprivos. La descarga de adrenocorticotrofina produce: a) disminución del ácido ascórbico, colesterol y lípidos de la corteza; b) el aumento de secreción de hormonas corticoadrenales produce disminución del timo y tejido linfático (acción linfolítica); c ) en la sangre, linfopenia y eosinofilopenia; d) aumento de los hidratos de carbono del organismo, en especial el glucógeno hepático, en animales en ayuno expuestos a la hipoxia; e) aumento de excreción de nitrógeno durante dicho ayuno; f) aumento de excreción de los 17-cetoesteroides urinarios. Durante la fase de adaptación o aclimatación vuelven a aumentar las grasas y el colesterol y sube el peso de la suprarrenal. Durante esta adaptación o aclimatación, la hipoxia es mejor soportada y produce menor disminución del ácido ascórbico suprarrenal. El peso corporal que había disminuido vuelve a recuperarse. Varios autores han comprobado que las hormonas activas sobre el metabolismo de los hidratos de carbono producen aumento de resistencia a la hipoxia. No se produjo con el extracto que empleamos y en las condiciones que experimentamos. La suprarrenal parece desempeñar un papel en la resistencia a la hipoxia. Si ésta es permanente o se repite todos los días, se ha encontrado que las ratas suprarrenoprivas no la soportan. No comprobamos esto en la anoxia aguda de 2 horas, ya sea por el corto tiempo de nuestros experimentos o por la raza de ratas empleadas. Es fácil comprender que se adicionen los síntomas de shock producidos por la hipoxia con los que produce la insuficiencia suprarrenal. Es posible producir un aumento de resistencia de las ratas normales o aún suprarrenoprivas, sometiéndolas paulatinamente una vez por día, durante períodos cortos (2 horas) a depresiones cada día mayores. En la hipoxia intensa permanente y prolongada o bien repetida diariamente durante períodos largos, se ha podido comprobar a la larga una pérdida de la adaptación. Se ha observado que reaparecen: la depleción de lípidos en la corteza, la disminución de resistencia a la hipoxia, la hipoglucemia, una tendencia a la temperatura subnormal. etc. En resumen: la hipoxia produce un aumento de actividad del sistema hipofiso-corticosuprarrenal y también, si es intensa, provoca una descarga de adrenalina de la médula suprarrenal por intermedio del mecanismo simpático-méduloadrenal. La presencia de la función suprarrenal favorece la resistencia del organismo durante la hipoxia, como sucede en todos los casos de emergencia. El aumento de las funciones cortical y medular puede cooperar con los demás mecanismos de resistencia del organismo, en una proporción que es difícil de precisar cuantitativamente.",

It is characterized by a tremor accompanying muscle activity, and interesting, when complete, the two upper limbs, the head and the voice, with variable degree of severity. Its progression is very slow. The diagnostic criteria are only clinical, but require ruling out iatrogenic and metabolic causes. 2) Tremor in Parkinson's disease is opposed point by point to essential tremor. However, confusion may occur due to some intermediate clinical situations. In these cases, pharmacology or DaTSCAN data can help to distinguish between the two conditions. 3) Other causes are considered, giving the priority to practical and therapeutic aspects. The psychological consequences of tremor should be taken into account to improve the quality of life of patients with tremor. Terms which stigmatize, such as senile tremor, or terms which minimize the relational and social consequences of tremor, such as benign tremor, should be discarded.",

      "abstract": "Panic disorder is one of the anxiety disorders, characterized by sudden and unexpected attacks of panic. Usually occurs with agoraphobia. \r\nTypical signs of a panic attack include: palpitations, sweating, trembling, breathlessness, feeling of suffocation, pain or discomfort in the chest, nausea , dizziness or light-headedness.Fear of losing control, fear going mad, fear of death, tingling in the body, overwhelming heat or cold, feeling that the environment has changed, feeling as if the person has been changed or is separated from oneself. A panic attack usually lasts a few minutes. It can also occur during sleep, so the person wakes up in terrible fear. When attacks occur in certain situations (eg. Ride the bus, elevator, stay in a larger group of people), it may happen that a person begins to avoid such situations, which leads to limited functioning and consequently lead to isolation. Fear of possible new attacks have been increased, there have been changes in the normal schedule and increasingly severed daily activities. Before the diagnosis of panic disorder, due to very unpleasant and many physical symptoms, such people usually undergo extensive and long-term physical treatment, and there are frequent visits to the emergency department related to the feeling of fear that is associated with such disorders. \r\nPanic disorder typically develops at an earlier age and is more common in women. The cause of the attack can be a specific event, a specific situation, activity (in the case of phobias), but attacks can occur quite unexpectedly, without a clear cause. As possible causes are important different life events (loss of a close person, divorce, job loss, etc..). \r\nAccording to cognitive-behavioral theories of anxiety, panic is a response to external stimuli, which are learned from closest people (usually a parent).\r\n According to psychodynamic theory, panic attack is unsuccessful defense against impulses that stimulate anxiety (in the background there is a need for separation and independence) or anxiety is the result of unconscious mental conflict between repressed desires that are usually transformed into some physical symptoms. Treatment of this disorder is individual and combined drug therapy with psychotherapy. The duration of treatment is different (a few weeks, and sometimes more than a year). Antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are the first choice in the treatment of panic disorder. anxiolytics and tricyclic antidepressants are also used. Sometimes just an explanation of the reasons for the occurrence of symptoms leads to improvements.\r\n Commonly prescribed is the combination of an antidepressant and / or anxiolytic compounds from the group of benzodiazepines. Psychotherapy can help change the way of thinking that leads to the emergence of panic attacks or disorder. \r\nIt's important to start treatment of this disorder in order to prevent further complications that impaire functioning of people and significantly affect quality of life.",

Central nervous system stimulants and depressants are classified according to whether they increase or decrease cortical arousal; anxiolytics and tranquillizers are designated by their effects on emotional arousal; antipsychotic drugs and antidepressants have specialized effects on arousal and sleep systems, and these systems are also affected by a wide range of other drugs from antihistamines to antihypertensive agents. This chapter considers some drugs used therapeutically for their effects on arousal: central nervous system depressants, classed as hypnotics, sedatives, and anxiolytics; and certain stimulants, the sympathomimetic amines and xanthines.",

      "title": "Zolpidem Extended-Release: A Single Insomnia Treatment Option for Sleep Induction and Sleep Maintenance Symptoms",
      "abstract": "It is imperative that primary care clinicians have a thorough understanding of insomnia, because they are often the first point of contact for patients who seek assistance when they have difficulty sleeping. Insomnia may appear with different presentations: sleep onset, sleep maintenances, sleep offset, nonrestorative sleep, or a combination of these symptoms. Untreated symptoms result in clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of following-day functionality. Physicians, pharmacists, and other clinicians should be aware of the conditions that contribute to, are antecedent to, and associated with insomnia. These pathophysiological conditions include advanced age; female gender; respiratory, gastrointestinal, vascular, and rheumatologic pain syndromes; and other conditions such as depression and/or anxiety. Additional health factors contributing to insomnia include chronic pain, stressors, grief reaction, pharmacotherapeutic side effects, lifestyle contributors such as social/recreational drugs, phytopharmaceuticals, and ethanol use. The pharmacotherapy focus in this article is a modified-release formulation of the BZ1 (omega1) receptor agonist zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety studies that compare 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release (Ambien CR™CIV) and 10 mg original zolpidem were initially conducted in healthy volunteers to assess the potential for an improved clinical profile. Zolpidem extended-release (12.5 mg and 6.25 mg extended-release dosage forms) is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance. Zolpidem extended-release is devoid of any short-term use limitation and can be prescribed for the duration of medical necessity. The modified-release zolpidem is a two-layer tablet with a biphasic release profile, releasing the first layer immediately, whereas the second layer is released at a slower rate. Plasma concentrations are maintained for a longer period of time versus the immediate-release zolpidem formulation. Pharmacokinetic analysis has also demonstrated that the time to maximum concentration (tmax) and terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release are similar to those of 10 mg zolpidem indicating a similar rapid onset of action and an elimination profile that reduced the risk of next-day decrements in performance. Zolpidem's CYP 450 hepatic metabolism uses as a substrate CYP3A4 (major) and 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6 as minor pathways. Zolpidem extended-release dosage forms diminish sleep latency, number of awakenings, and wakefulness after sleep onset and augments total time asleep.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Occupational stress was perceived to be a problem only in jobs with high pressure and low pay, such as teaching and social services. Today, occupational stress has become an epidemic spreading like wildfire. Organizations lose much money in stress-related accidents, lost productivity, absenteeism, and medical insurance costs. Physical symptoms of occupational stress are: headaches, digestive problems, sleep deprivation, rashes or hives, heartburn, night sweats, diminished sexual desire, menstrual irregularities, chronic back pain, muscle tensions, loss of appetite, weight gain. Emotional or mental symptoms of occupational stress are: increased anger, frustration, depression, moodiness, anxiousness, problems with memory, fatigue, and increased use of nicotine, alcohol and drugs. Work related symptoms are: increased absenteeism, accidents on the job, and complaints from coworkers, decrease in work productivity, and difficulty in understanding office procedures, job absenteeism, and taking long coffee breaks, excessive personal time on the telephone or internet. Many attempts have been made to identify causes of stressful job events. There are essentially three different, but overlapping, approaches to the definition and study of stress. The engineering and physiological approaches are obvious among the earlier theories of stress, while the more psychological approaches characterize contemporary stress theory.",

      "title": "[The role of folates in the diverse biochemical processes that control mental function].",
      "abstract": "A variety of studies indicate that folate deficiency is associated with the appearance of problems of a neuromuscular or neurological nature such as depression, muscular and mental fatigue, states of confusion and non-senile dementia, and that these processes improve fully or partly when the deficiency is corrected. Because of the role of folates in the reactions in synthesis of neuro-transmitter and elements of neuron structure, it is not surprising that a deficiency is associated with depression and other mental problems. Folates are involved in the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) which is the main contributor of methyl groups in the nervous system and whose action as an antidepressive agent is confirmed. They are also involved in the synthesis of glutamate which is an excitant neurotransmitter, and in the formation of puric and pyrimidic bases. An alternative mechanism for explaining the etiopathogenesis of folate deficiency in depression and other mental disorders involves the regeneration of tetrahydrobiopterin (THB) which is an essential cofactor in hydroxylation process in the brains of mammals. Folate deficiency is a common nutritional problem in many groups of the Spanish population and, given the role of this vitamin in the operation of the nervous system, we might consider the possibility that, in some case, folate deficiency may cause or aggravate some alterations to mental function.",

      "abstract": "The World Health Organization reported a lifetime prevalence of 2.4% for BD-I, BD-II and sub-threshold types of bipolar disorder (BD). Depressive episodes are more common than manic episodes for many BD patients. Studies show that depressive mood persists in 2/3 of life, even if they are under treatment. It may be difficult to diagnose BD in the event of depression in the first episode. The correct diagnosis and the treatment can be delayed for 6-8 years, and even longer if disorder starts in adolescence. It is reported that 40% of the patients who were initially diagnosed as unipolar were later diagnosed as BD. The features that enable us to diagnose BD depressive episode: 1) family history of BD or psychosis 2) early onset with depression 3) cyclothymic temperament characteristics 4) four or more depressive episodes in 10 years 5) agitation, anger, insomnia, irritability, excessive talkativeness or other 'mixed' or hypomanic features or psychotic symptoms during depressive episode, 6) clinical 'worsening' caused by the appearance of mixed symptoms after AD treatment 7) suicidal thoughts and attempts 8) substance abuse 9) hypersomnia in the depressive episode or sleeping too much during the day, overeating, psychomotor agitation. The number of studies conducted on BD depressive treatment is limited, the information was obtained by excluding this group from the studies or by compiling the information obtained from the treatment of unipolar depression. In this review, acute and maintenance treatment of the depressive episodes of BD will be discussed according to the treatment algorithms.",

What the authors observed was the same spectrum of psychic symptoms repeatedly reported from withdrawal reactions to alcohol or other sedativehypnotic drugs. \"Acute brain syndrome due to drug withdrawal\" is a much more precise phrase. Psychotic symptoms have not been prominent in the relatively few withdrawal reactions to benzodiazepines reported in the medical literature since our first experimental study (<i>Psychopharmacologia</i>2:63-68, 1961). These reactions are modified in severity and attenuated over time because of the long persistence of the drug and its active metabolites in the body. Withdrawal reactions are dependent on high dosage of drug sustained rather constantly over time, with rapid rate of disappearance of the drug when it is discontinued. Drugs such as the benzodiazepines (or phenobarbital)",

      "title": "Steps Following Attainment of Remission",
      "abstract": "Article Abstract Depressive disorders require long-term treatment with antidepressants, psychotherapy, or both. The goal of antidepressant therapy is complete remission of symptoms and return to normal daily functioning. Studies have shown that achieving remission and continuing antidepressant therapy long after the acute symptoms remit can protect against the relapse or recurrence of the psychiatric episode. Many patients, however, inadvertently or intentionally skip doses of their antidepressant, and even discontinue it, if their symptoms improve or if they experience side effects. Antidepressant discontinuation may increase the risk of relapse or precipitate certain distressing symptoms such as gastrointestinal complaints, dizziness, flu-like symptoms, equilibrium disturbances, and sleep disorders. Documented with all classes of antidepressants, these reactions may emerge within a couple of days, or even hours, after the abrupt discontinuation of an antidepressant with a short half-life. These distressing responses may be mistaken for a relapse or recurrence. It is important to recognize the potential for these sequelae and educate patients about the need to take all antidepressants at the doses prescribed, warning them of the symptoms that may occur if they skip doses or stop their medication too quickly. Antidepressants should be tapered slowly over a period of days, weeks, or even months, depending on the dose, duration of treatment, and pharmacologic properties of the agent, as well as the patient's individual response. This article reviews the risks and reactions associated with discontinuation of antidepressants. It offers guidelines for distinguishing relapse and recurrence from discontinuation responses as well as for prevention and management of the antidepressant discontinuation syndrome.",

Various methods are used and each has its disadvantages. Residual symptoms of abstinence from opiates are present in all methods and there is a prolonged period of convalescence which seems to be one of the causes of relapses to addiction. Vitamin E however- has given remarkable results in aiding recovery from the withdrawal symptoms. With vitamin E the period of treatment is shortened, abstinence symptoms are bearable and the convalescent period is eliminated. Patients treated with vitamin E solely are in good health and spirits and appear contented. This treatment also seems to reduce 1he number of relapses. The administration of vitamin E after a complete withdrawal from opium probably compensates Some of the opium's effects on the nervous system, and remedies the hypoxia of the tissues, thus restoring the patient to a normal physiological state.",

      "title": "Alcohol withdrawal syndrome: how to predict, prevent, diagnose and treat it.",
      "abstract": "(1) When people who are physically dependent on alcohol stop drinking, they experience an alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The symptoms generally resolve spontaneously within a week, but more severe forms may be associated with generalised seizures, hallucinations and delirium tremens, which can be fatal. (2) We carried out a literature review in order to obtain answers to the following questions: how to predict or rapidly diagnose a severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome; how to prevent and treat this syndrome; how to manage severe forms; and how to deal with the risk of vitamin B1 deficiency. (3) The main risk factors for severe withdrawal syndrome are: chronic heavy drinking; a history of generalised seizures; and a history of delirium tremens. (4) Anxiety, agitation, tremor, excessive sweating, altered consciousness and hallucinations are signs of a severe withdrawal syndrome. (5) Individual support and effective communication seem to reduce the risk of severe withdrawal syndrome. (6) Oral benzodiazepines are the best-assessed drugs for preventing a severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly the risk of seizures. When given for a maximum of 7 days, the adverse effects are usually mild. (7) Clinical trials of other antiepileptics suggest they are less effective than benzodiazepines, and their addition to benzodiazepine therapy offers no tangible advantage. (8) Betablockers increase the risk of hallucinations, and clonidine increases the risk of nightmares, and the efficacy of these two drugs is not well documented. Neuroleptics increase the risk of seizures. There are no convincing data to support the use of magnesium sulphate or meprobamate (the latter carries a risk of serious adverse effects). Acamprosate, naltrexone and disulfiram are not beneficial in alcohol withdrawal. (9) Gradual withdrawal, i.e. ingestion of decreasing amounts of alcohol, has not been compared with other methods but is generally not recommended. (10) There are no specific recommendations on hydration. Note that excessive water-sodium intake carries a risk of pulmonary oedema in patients with heart disease. (11) As vitamin B1 deficiency is frequent and can lead to serious complications in alcohol-dependent patients, oral vitamin B1 supplementation is widely recommended, despite the absence of comparative trials. High doses must be used to compensate for poor absorption. Intravenous administration is best if patients have very poor nutritional status or severe complications such as Gayet-Wernicke encephalopathy (a medical emergency), even though rare anaphylactic reactions have been reported after vitamin B1 injection. (12) Planned alcohol withdrawal in specialised hospital units has been extensively studied. Outpatient withdrawal may be more appropriate for patients who are at low risk of developing severe withdrawal syndrome. (13) A large proportion of alcohol-dependent patients were excluded from trials of withdrawal strategies. These include elderly patients, patients with serious psychiatric or somatic disorders, and patients who are also dependent on other substances. (14) An oral benzodiazepine is the best-assessed treatment for a single episode of generalised seizures or hallucinations during alcohol withdrawal. (15) In randomised comparative trials benzodiazepines were more effective than neuroleptics in preventing delirium-related mortality. Currently, with appropriate fluid-electrolyte support, continuous monitoring of vital signs, and respiratory support if necessary, the mortality rate for delirium tremens is under 3%. (16) In practice, patients who are attempting to stop drinking alcohol need close personal support and communication, and a reassuring environment, as well as regular monitoring for early signs of a withdrawal syndrome; the latter may require benzodiazepine therapy.",

      "abstract": "It is well known that continued excessive alcohol consumption can lead to the development of physiological dependence. When drinking is abruptly terminated or substantially reduced in the dependent individual, a characteristic withdrawal syndrome ensues. As with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, withdrawal symptoms associated with cessation of chronic alcohol use are opposite in nature to the effects of intoxication. Thus, clinical features of alcohol withdrawal include signs of heightened autonomic nervous system activation (e.g., tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, diaphoresis, tremor), CNS hyperexcitability that may culminate in motor seizures, and, in its most severe form, hallucinosis and delerium tremens (1–3). In addition to physical signs of withdrawal, a constellation of symptoms contributing to psychological discomfort (e.g., irritability, agitation, anxiety, dysphoria) constitute a significant component of the withdrawal syndrome (4–7). The overall intensity of the withdrawal syndrome is presumed to reflect the degree of physiological dependence developed during the course of chronic alcohol use/abuse.",

      "title": "Safety Challenges of Using High Dose Baclofen for Alcohol Use Disorder: A Focused Review",
      "abstract": "Since the early 2000s, the gamma-aminobutyric acid type B (GABA-B) receptor agonist baclofen has been extensively used for treating alcohol use disorder (AUD). In some countries, like France, Australia, or Germany, baclofen has been used at patient-tailored dose regimens, which can reach 300 mgpd or even more in some patients. The GABA-B-related pharmacology of baclofen expose patients to a specific profile of neuropsychiatric adverse drug reactions (ADRs), primarily some frequent sedative symptoms whose risk of occurrence and severity are both related to the absolute baclofen dosing and the kinetics of dose variations. Other frequent neuropsychiatric ADRs can occur, i.e., tinnitus, insomnia, or dizziness. More rarely, other serious ADRs have been reported, like seizures, manic symptoms, or sleep apnea. However, real-life AUD patients are also exposed to other sedative drugs, like alcohol of course, but also benzodiazepines, other drugs of abuse, or other sedative medications. Consequently, the occurrence of neuropsychiatric safety issues in these patients is essentially the result of a complex multifactorial exposure, in which baclofen causality is rarely obvious by itself. As a result, the decision of initiating baclofen, as well as the daily dose management should be patient-tailored, according the medical history but also the immediate clinical situation of the patient. The overall safety profile of baclofen, as well as the clinical context in which baclofen is used, have many similarities with the use of opiate substitution medications for opiate use disorder. This empirical statement has many implications on how baclofen should be managed and dosing should be adjusted. Moreover, this constant patient-tailored adjustment can be difficult to adapt in the design of clinical trials, which may explain inconsistent findings in baclofen-related literature on AUD.",

There are two primary features of addiction to all forms of natural and pharmacological stimuli. First, the rewarding stimulus associated with the addiction is a compelling motivator of behavior at the expense of behaviors leading to the acquisition of other rewarding stimuli. Thus, individuals come to orient increasing amounts of their daily activity around acquisition of the rewarding stimulus to which they are addicted. Second, there is a persistence of craving for the addictive stimulus, combined with an inability to regulate the behaviors associated with obtaining that stimulus. Thus, years after the last exposure to an addictive stimulus, reexposure to that stimulus or environmental cues associated with that stimulus will elicit behavior seeking to obtain the reward.",

Serotonin syndrome is not an idiosyncratic drug reaction. methamphetamine is a psycho stimulant drug which produces increased wakefulness and focus in association with decreased fatigue and appetite. A methamphetamine overdose is rarely fatal but can lead to a number of different symptoms, including psychosis, chest pain, and hypertension. It is among agents with moderate potency to produce Serotonin syndrome. Here we present the first reported case of serotonin syndrome after a single ingestion of high dose methamphetamine (body staffer of 2gr amphetamine) in 28 year-old previously healthy man without any drug history, 2 hours prior to admission. Clinical manifestation included hyperthermia, hypertension, tachycardia, sweating, dilated pupil, agitation, overactive reflexes (greater in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs) and clonus. complete blood count was normal except for severely elevated white blood cell count of 22.3 ×103/µL (22.3 ×10 9 /L) with 74% neutrophils and 24% lymphocytes. His serum blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, liver function tests, and electrolytes were normal. Mildly elevation in Serum creatinine kinas was seen. Coagulation studies and Urine analysis were normal. Serum glucose was 210 mg/dL. An arterial blood gas shows respiratory alkalosis. We intubated him by Rapid Sequence Intubation (RSI) method and then took an emergent abdominal CT scan for any need for surgical intervention; we admitted him in ICU ward and did supportive care including the control of agitation, hyperthermia and autonomic instability. After 2 days we could extubate him and after 5days he discharged from hospital. clonus in moderate cases may be greater in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs. Mental status changes include hyper vigilance and agitation (1). Severe symptoms include severe increases in heart rate and blood pressure that may lead to shock. Temperature may rise to above 41.1 °C (106.0 °F) in life-threatening cases. Other abnormalities include metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, seizure, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation; these effects usually arise as a consequence of hyperthermia (1,3).",

ASD can be diagnosed if a person has been exposed to a traumatic event in which the person experiences feelings of dissociation, reexperiences symptoms, shows marked avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event, and experiences hyperarousal. For the diagnosis of ASD to be given, the distress must be present for a minimum of two days and a maximum of four weeks and must occur within four weeks of the traumatic event. Other common reactions to extreme stressors include physical complaints, such as chronic pain, fatigue, stomach pains, breathing problems, and headaches, and self-destructive or impulsive behavior, such as alcohol or drug abuse, high-risk sexual behavior, suicidal impulses, and fast or reckless driving.",

Antidepressants and mood stabilizers, the medications commonly used to treat depression or bipolar illness, do not produce dependence and have no potential for abuse. They are safe for individuals in recovery from alcoholism or drug dependence. Depression is no longer attributed simply to too little neurochemicals such as serotonin or norepinephrine. Instead, depression is associated with a dysregulation of neurochemical firing patterns. Antidepressants treat specific symptoms of depression such as depressed mood, sadness, fatigue and suicidality, and they also regulate the altered brain chemistry that may contribute to these symptoms.",

      "abstract": "The selective serotonin-1A receptor partial agonist anxiolytics represent a new class of pharmacologic agents that have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). These compounds offer a completely different pharmacologic approach to this disorder from previous medications. The selective 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A (5-HT1A) anxiolytics buspirone, gepirone, ipsapirone, and SM-3997 have several important new and unique features that will be reviewed in this paper. These features include no cross-tolerance with alcohol or benzodiazepines, no evidence of abuse or misuse potential, and no withdrawal symptoms or rebound anxiety on cessation of therapy. The 5-HT1A anxiolytics have no muscle relaxant, sedative, or anticonvulsant properties and do not impair psychomotor functioning. They do have a slower onset of effect than standard benzodiazepines – clinical response is usually noted in 1–3 weeks. The side effect profile is quite different from that of the benzodiazepines. It includes gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and diarrhea, headache, dizziness, and restlessness. Some patients with GAD who have received chronic ( > 1 month) benzodiazepine therapy may not respond as well to these compounds initially as will patients with no prior benzodiazepine treatment, especially if the benzodiazepine has been discontinued only recently. These compounds, buspirone in particular, have been shown to have excellent maintenance and prophylactic properties and to be well tolerated with long-term therapy ( > 3 months). Because of their unique mechanism of action and side effect profile, and no evidence of misuse or abuse potential or interference with mental acuity, these compounds represent a definite advance in the pharmacologic management of GAD.",

      "abstract": "Saher (Insomnia) or sleeplessness is a sleep disorder in which there is an inability to fall asleep or to stay asleep or both, as long as desire. According to current researches, it has been noted that many people all over the world are suffering from one or more symptoms of insomnia. Depending on duration of problem, it may be classified as transient insomnia, short term insomnia and chronic insomnia. Insomnia is described as saher in ancient classical Unani literature. The causes of insomnia are stress, depression, anxiety, medical conditions, drugs, irregular schedule, caffeine, etc. According to Unani system of medicine, health is attributed to the equilibrium of Akhlat (Humors), beside this, there is Asbab sitta zarooriya (Six essential factors) there are air, food and drinks, bodily movement and repose (Harkat sukoon badni), mental activity and repose, (Harkat wa sukoon nafsani), sleep and wakefulness (Naumwayaqza) and retention and excretion (Ahtabas wa Istefrag); any imbalance any of the above factors is likely to cause the disease. Normal sleep is thought to be because of rutubat wa broodat i.e., wetness and cold in our body, and if there is derailment of balance in sleep and wakefulness, it implies the predominance of yaboosat wa hararat i.e. dryness and hotness extensive in the brain. Dalak (Massage) is a systematic manipulation of body tissues with the hand. Several varieties of dalak have been recommended in Unani system of medicine, e.g., Dalak e sulb (hard) Dalak e layyan (soft), etc. Keywords: Dalak, sahar, insomnia, regimental therapy Cite this Article Moteseem Ahemad, Patel Mohd.

      "abstract": "Five cases of dependence on popular analgesics containing barbiturates as the active ingredient have been presented. In all of these cases the patient developed the habit of using the drugs in the second or third decade of life in order to accomplish relief from headache. A rapid increase in tolerance took place in a few months, with most of the patients eventually requiring several times the usual dose. Symptoms of chronic intoxication were often milder than those with other habituating drugs. No antisocial acts as a result of the abuse were observed. Headaches as a manifestation of chronic intoxication may be considered to have played a role in establishing analgesic dependence. The abstinence syndrome developed a few hours after withdrawal: a generalized convulsion occurred first, followed by various disturbances of consciousness and then by a hallucinatory-delusional state. These symptoms cleared up in three days to a week, while a corresponding course was followed by the EEG findings. Withdrawal symptoms didn't appear at the time when allopyrabital as the active ingredient of popular analgesic preparations was replaced with cyclopyrabital but did appear in four cases at the very time when bromvalerylurea was substituted as the active principle of these preparations. Even at that time such a syndrome was not manifested in one case, suggesting the possibility of a cross-reaction of allobarbital and cyclo-barbital and of barbiturate and bromvalerylurea.",

      "abstract": "To review current knowledge on blood pressure variability.Blood pressure variability has a time-course ranging from a few seconds or minutes (short-term variability) to 24 h (long-term variability) or 1 year (seasonal variations). The variability is influenced by physiological factors such as physical and mental activity (posture, exercise, talking) or behavioral and environmental factors (salt, caffeine, alcohol), and by pathological conditions. In patients with essential hypertension, the day-night pattern of blood pressure change is generally similar to that of normotensives, with a significant nocturnal blood pressure fall (dippers), except that the entire profile is shifted upwards. Nevertheless, in some essential hypertensives the nocturnal fall in blood pressure is absent or reversed (non-dippers), in spite of a decrease in the nocturnal heart rate. In several forms of secondary hypertension (pheochromocytoma, renal failure) and other clinical conditions (sleep apnea syndrome, diabetes mellitus, cardiac transplantation) the nocturnal fall in blood pressure is also absent or reversed.Blood pressure variability and the blunted nocturnal fall in blood pressure may be clinically relevant. Several studies have demonstrated that subjects whose 24-h variability was higher than the group average were more likely to have target-organ damage. Moreover, hypertensive women with a blunted nocturnal fall in blood pressure (non-dippers) are more likely to suffer morbid cardiovascular events than dippers. On theoretical grounds, therefore, antihypertensive treatment that reduces blood pressure variability and preserves the nocturnal fall in blood pressure will help to protect target organs in hypertension. So far, this has not been demonstrated in clinical trials.",

The symptoms disappeared after the medication was reintroduced but recurred after rediscontinuation. When the dosage was diminished very gradually the symptoms were mild. The depression did not recur. Such withdrawal symptoms are most prevalent after discontinuation of paroxetine but can occur after use of all selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The withdrawal syndrome includes both physical and psychiatric symptoms and needs to be distinguished from a relapse of the psychiatric disorder. Good information and gradual discontinuation of the antidepressant after long-term use are adequate measures to prevent severe withdrawal symptoms.",

More commonly, acute episodes of cannabis induced-psychosis manifest immediately following exposure, are precipitated after the use of large amounts of cannabis, resolve with abstinence, and are of shorter duration than those observed with primary psychotic disorders. Cannabis withdrawal symptoms usually manifest when heavy, prolonged consumption of this substance is interrupted or significantly reduced. The withdrawal syndrome may include sympathetic autonomic hyperactivity, irritability, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and reduced appetite. On the other hand, cases of psychosis induced by cannabis withdrawal are rare. In this case, we present a 32-year-old healthy woman without personal or family psychiatric history who showed a heavy and continued consumption of cannabis since she was 10 years old, without developing any psychiatric symptoms. However, recently she experienced two brief psychotic episodes with disorganized behavior and persecutory delusions, both episodes happening a week after discontinuing cannabis consumption.",

Moreover, somatic problems can interfere with a loss of motivation; loss of motivation is frequent with exhausting chronic diseases, cognitive impairment and it facilitates the social withdrawal. In elderly, loss of motivation blunts the intensity of moral pain. Depressions with conative disorders can move in a dysexecutive syndrome. Even if, owing to the treatment, the cognitive disorders disappear, several years after, an authentic dementia can be diagnosed. With aging process, elderly must cope with losses, less or more balanced: affective, physical and financial losses, triggering the reject of any personal commitment. Aging process also concerns brain amines, especially dopamine, exposing old persons to depression. It alters by a similar way others brain neuro-mediator, such acetylcholine, involved in dementia. Both loss motivation and executive disorders have to be systematically assessed. An antidepressant therapeutic is necessary in case of doubt, improving patients thymic status, quality of life of patients and their family, and sometime of frontal dysfunctions.",

Symptoms of withdrawal include autonomic hyperactivity such as tremor in the hands, insomnia, visual, tactile and auditory hallucinations. One of the factors that increase the level of alcohol consumption is sex, young age, aggression, anxiety, sweating, and depression.

Signs reach their maximum on day 5 and usually resolve within 2 to 3 weeks. Withdrawal syndrome is more common with short half-life drugs (paroxetine, fluvoxamine). The intensity of the clinical signs depends on the daily dose and how long the drug has been given. The main signs are dizziness, vertigo, headache, nausea, and flu-like symptoms as well as anxiety, confusion, irritability, excessive dreaming and insomnia. Risk factors usually stressed are poor treatment compliance, previous withdrawal syndrome with another drug, concomitant medication and alcohol consumption. The syndrome can be prevented by tapering off the dose and patient education. When a withdrawal syndrome is present, it is advisable to reintroduce the drug then withdraw gradually.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCCIÓN Los 2C (popularmente conocidos como tusi o cocaína rosa) son un grupo de sustancias pertenecientes a las fenetilaminas con efecto psicoestimulante y alucinógeno. Su uso, por vía oral o esnifada, se ha visto incrementado en los últimos años, con efectos psicopatológicos variables. CASO CLÍNICO Presentamos el caso clínico de un varón de 22 años, que inicia seguimiento recientemente en su centro de salud mental, observándose rasgos narcisistas de personalidad. Es traído a Urgencias por sobreingesta medicamentosa e intento de ahorcamiento. Reconoce consumo frecuente de tusi o cocaína rosa, refiriendo además sentirse muy inquieto, nervioso y con ideas de muerte y autolesión, llegando a ingerir cantidades excesivas de lormetazepam o intentarse ahorcar en casa, de forma muy impulsiva y sin otro desencadenante aparente. El screening de drogas de abuso resulta negativo para las sustancias estudiadas. DISCUSIÓN Los efectos clínicos del 2C se encuentran entre lo estimulante y lo psicodélico, con sensación de bienestar, euforia, incremento de la sociabilidad, y a más dosis, alteraciones sensoperceptivas. Se ha descrito la aparición de síntomas psicóticos tras su consumo. La aparición de marcada ansiedad, impulsividad y conducta suicida podría estar relacionada con el consumo de esta sustancia, con consecuencias graves. CONCLUSIÓN Se necesita estudiar con mayor profundidad los efectos clínicos, psicopatológicos y especialmente sobre la conducta suicida del consumo de fenetilaminas, cuyo uso va en aumento, según los últimos datos. La correcta anamnesis en los hábitos de consumo debe ocupar un lugar primordial, y estar en alerta al no ser siempre detectada en los tests de drogas de abuso habituales.",

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guidelines for Assessment and Management of Patients with Substance Intoxication Presenting to the Emergency Department",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, revision 10 (ICD-10) describes intoxication as \"a transient condition following the administration of alcohol or other psychoactive substance, resulting in disturbances in level of consciousness, cognition, perception, affect or behavior, or other psychophysiological functions and responses.\"[1] Intoxication is generally an acute phenomenon, the intensity and effects of which wear off with time and disappear completely in the absence of further use of the substance. While most episodes of intoxication do not need medical attention, intoxicated patients may sometimes present to the emergency department.[1] The reasons for seeking medical attention may either be due to the substance use itself (e.g., extreme agitation or violent behavior that may endanger the patient or others around them) or due to an adverse consequence of substance use (e.g., head injury in a road traffic accident that occurred due to driving while intoxicated). Common substances of intoxication encountered in the emergency setting in India are alcohol, cannabis, opioids, and benzodiazepines. Cases of intoxication from other substances like inhalants, stimulants, hallucinogens, and newer psychoactive substances including synthetic cannabinoids and club drugs may also present to the emergency unit. Often the substance of intoxication may be unknown or falsely reported due to fear of legal ramifications or there may be use of more than one intoxicating substance, thereby complicating the clinical picture. Patients may present with decreased levels of consciousness, vomiting, seizures, or other symptoms that may resemble other medical or surgical emergencies. It is, thus, imperative that psychiatrists attending to patients in the emergency department be well-versed with identification, assessment, and management of patients with substance intoxication.[2] Caring for intoxicated patients in the emergency department comes with various other issues that require a psychiatrist's time and effort. These patients may be brought into the emergency department against their wishes and refuse medical care. They may also be brought in for medical attention by law enforcement authorities with no available identification details and reliable history or even in association with an alleged crime or illegal activity, making it essential for the emergency care provider to be competent in dealing with the medicolegal aspects of intoxication and providing optimum medical services to the patient along with safeguarding the legal procedures. The present clinical practice guidelines deal with the assessment and management of patients with substance intoxication presenting to the emergency department. The guidelines present the general considerations while attending to a substance intoxicated patient, followed by general signs of intoxication. Thereafter, details of intoxication with specific substances are discussed, namely, alcohol, cannabis, opioids, benzodiazepines, and other substances. Features of intoxication, assessment, and management are discussed for each of these substances. Multiple substance intoxication is also discussed in the guidelines. Special populations are referred to in the guidelines, including children and adolescents, women, and the elderly population. The guidelines do not cover nicotine or caffeine intoxication (these are unlikely to be encountered in a clinical setting). Accidental ingestion of substances of use is not catered to in these guidelines. We also do not go into details of intoxication presenting with additional psychiatric and/or medical illnesses and each such case is likely to be unique with its own specific constraints and challenges in management. General considerations while attending to a substance intoxicated patient Patients with intoxication with a substance of abuse present several challenges during assessment and management [Figure 1]. One of the foremost concerns is the potential unreliability of history. Patients with substance intoxication may give inaccurate or unreliable history. This may be partly attributable to patients trying to minimize their substance use, not recollecting details adequately due to cognitive impact of the substance, concealment of the details of substance use from the family, or avoiding sharing details to prevent legal ramifications. Thus, multiple sources of information can be referred to obtain a more comprehensive account of the patient's condition. Friends, family, and previous treatment records can be useful sources of collateral information about the patient. In some circumstances, physical examination and mental status examination of an uncooperative patient can be helpful to get a clearer clinical picture of the patient (e.g., injection track marks can hint at opioid overdose in an otherwise comatose patient).Figure 1: Challenges in assessment and management of patients with substance intoxicationAnother challenge that comes across in patients with intoxication is the occurrence of agitation or violence. Some of the intoxications with substances like alcohol and stimulants like cocaine may be associated to aggression. Aggression may be due to disinhibition and impaired judgement associated with substance use. Furthermore, substance use disorder may be associated with other psychiatric or medical illnesses that may individually contribute to the state of agitation or aggression. Addressing aggression promptly is required to prevent harm to the self and others. Other relevant guidelines of the Indian Psychiatric Society may be referred to while addressing aggression and violence when patients with substance intoxication present to the emergency department. A related issue is the consumption of substances or presentation with substance intoxication when the patient intends to kill themself. This may be a presenting feature in patients with overdose of opioids or sedative-hypnotics. Sometimes, patients may also consume large amounts of alcohol when they have an intent to die. Thus, self-harm should be considered as a possibility when patients present with substance intoxication, and suitable assessment measures should ascertain risk to self and the presence of concurrent psychiatric disorder. If required, additional treatment should be instituted for the patient. A relevant aspect of consideration is to determine the line between simply the use of a substance or substance intoxication. Description in the ICD-11 mentions substance intoxication as occurrence of \"clinically significant disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behavior, or coordination that develop during or shortly after the consumption or administration.\"[3] Hence there is a leeway for the clinician to determine what is considered as \"clinically significant\". One way to simply operationalize is to consider any clinical encounter with a patient having a recent history of substance use which has resulted in the abovementioned mental or neuropsychiatric disturbances and are brought to the emergency/clinical setting as \"clinically significant\" (those situations where these disturbances are expected by the person and are found to be pleasurable would be considered simply as use). The disturbances are described as transient and reversible, and hence they are expected to abate with time. Patients with substance intoxication may have an issue related to their mental competence. Substance use may result in impairment of judgement or consciousness. This may result in impairment of competence, that is, the ability of the person to comprehend choices, decide a course of action, and communicate their choice back. This lack of competence has a bearing on treatment choices that should be instituted and promulgation of coerced treatment. It is generally accepted that when a person is not found to be competent, the nominated representative can be the proxy decisionmaker for the person. The treatment providers can also institute emergency treatment in the best interests of the patient. Furthermore, substance intoxication is a reversible process, so if emergency treatment is not required, then one can wait for the patient to re-attain competence as the substance intoxication wanes. A clinical consideration for patients with substance use disorders is the concurrent use of many substances together. This may lead to the clinical picture being altered or complicated by features of intoxication or withdrawal from different substances. For example, a patient with opioid dependence may experience sedation during intoxication. If benzodiazepines or alcohol are used concurrently with opioids, then the sedation may be accentuated. In such a patient, reversal using naloxone may offset the features of intoxication from opioids, but not reverse the effects of benzodiazepines. Similarly, intoxication from cocaine and other stimulants may lead to paranoia, which may be accentuated by the consumption of higher than usual amounts of cannabis. Thus, a clinician needs to be open to the idea of multiple substance consumption in a patient with substance intoxication. Another issue in the clinical management of patients with substance intoxication in the emergency setting is the potential lack of social support in the treatment process. Patients may be consuming substances alone, or it is possible that casual acquaintances do not intend to help or are not in a position to help (due to their own intoxication as well). Family and friends may be disinclined or burnt out due to the substance use disorder and hence may not be forthcoming in engaging with the care process. Thus, the ancillary supports available in the treatment process of patients with substance intoxication may be few. Sometimes, police or other bystanders may bring a patient with substance intoxication to the emergency unit and the identity of the patient may be unknown to them. Thus, clinicians may have to work with limited information on occasions. There may be legal concerns with the consumption of certain substances considered illegal under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. This may make patients hesitant to disclose use of some of the substances; for example, heroin. Treating psychiatrists might also be apprehensive about documentation. However, it should be reiterated that clinicians can help patients better if they are able to get a reliable history of the patient. Thus, it would be preferable to gather detailed information and document suitably while ensuring confidentiality of the treatment records and providing reassurance about this to the patient. It might also be prudent to perform urine or blood testing for substance abuse, ensuring a safe chain of custody of the sample. It is unlikely that such treatment records are referred to by the legal process, but a psychiatrist may need to present the relevant information to courts when requested through due processing. General signs of intoxication As specified in the ICD-11,[3] intoxication from one or more psychoactive substances may be suspected in cases where the following features are present: Transient, but clinically significant disturbances occur in consciousness, coordination, perception, cognition, affect, or behavior that develop during or shortly after the consumption/administration of the substance(s) The symptoms are in accordance with the known pharmacological effects of the substance. The intensity of the symptoms is closely related to the amount of substance consumed/administered. The symptoms are time-limited and subside as the substance is cleared away from the body. The symptoms cannot be better explained by another medical condition or another psychiatric disorder. Table 1 enumerates signs and symptoms of intoxication with different substances.Table 1: Features of intoxication with common psychoactive substancesGeneral management of intoxicated patients in the emergency setting As mentioned earlier, patients presenting with intoxication may prove challenging to manage. Intoxicated behavior may often be confused with other disease conditions and vice versa. A brief outline on general management of a patient presenting with intoxication is given in Figure 2.Figure 2: General management of intoxicated patients in an emergency settingALCOHOL INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Alcohol (primarily) is a widely used psychoactive substance globally and in India. In people aged 20–39 years, approximately 13.5% of global deaths are attributable to alcohol. More than 200 disease and injury conditions are related to alcohol use. Data from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program of United States, which included non-fatal emergency department visits from facilities in 49 states and Washington, DC, indicated that in 2020 1.8% of the total annual emergency visits were related to alcohol use. Of the many alcohol related disorders presenting to the emergency department in India, a vast majority presents with road traffic accidents due to driving under intoxication followed by acute alcohol poisoning, which is defined as ingestion of a large amount of alcohol in a short duration of time.[4] Clinical features of alcohol intoxication Alcohol is a global central nervous system (CNS) depressant. Acute ingestion generally results in elevation of mood, disinhibition, and increased confidence, leading to argumentative or combative behavior. In addition to those mentioned in Table 1, some features of alcohol intoxication seen with increasing blood alcohol concentration (BAC) are discussed in Table 2. In naïve drinkers, BAC of 150–250 mg per 100 ml result in clinically apparent intoxication; BAC of 350 mg per 100 ml cause stupor and coma; while levels more than 450 mg per 100 ml can be fatal. Regular users of alcohol often develop tolerance and are significantly less likely to manifest symptoms/signs of intoxication at the same BAC than non-regular drinkers.[5] Effects can last from 2 to 3 hours after a few drinks to up to 24 hours after heavy drinking.Table 2: Effects of increasing blood alcohol concentrationAssessment of alcohol intoxication An asssessment of a patient presenting with alcohol intoxication aims at identifying the immediate risks to the patient and attendants and uncovering maladaptive patterns of alcohol use that may require specialized management and care. Acute alcohol intoxication may result in several metabolic abnormalities, like hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. Thus, these may be required on an urgent basis. Alcohol can cause acute effects on the cardiovascular system, such as atrial and ventricular tachy-dysrhythmias. Hence, an urgent electrocardiogram (ECG) may be required. Further discussed are the assessment measures for alcohol intoxication: Clinical history Elicit details of current episode of alcohol use: amount, preparation, duration, mixing with other substances, etc. Ask for similar details about previous drinking episodes. Elicit, wherever possible, events of high-risk behavior under intoxication: driving, operating heavy machinery, self-harm, or violence toward others. Attempt should be made, wherever possible, to identify alcohol dependence or harmful use pattern. Physical Examination Assess levels of consciousness (the Glasgow Coma Scale may be used), cardiac and respiratory parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac rhythm, respiratory rate), and urine output, if possible, with hourly intervals until parameters begin to normalize. Unresponsive patients may suffer from an occult head injury that may be identified from increased intracranial pressure. It is thus advised to perform a direct ophthalmoscopy looking for papilledema, which is a clinical sign for increased intracranial pressure. Papilledema without increased intracranial pressure may also be seen in methyl alcohol poisoning. Thus, imaging (CT/MRI) may be required to determine definitive management. In responsive patients, rule out diplopia and assess eye movements in all cardinal positions, any muscle weakness, and sensory deficits. Observe for any abnormal or involuntary movements. Check for other physical injuries and bleeding from the ear, nose, or mouth. Mental status examination Assess for speech and behavioral abnormalities; pay special attention to aggressive behaviors, and ensure patient and staff safety. Assess thought and perceptual disturbances. Assess orientation to time and place: immediate, recent, and remote memory, insight, and reality testing. Rule out other causes of altered sensorium: Metabolic causes such as hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, hyperosmolar hypoglycemic state, diabetic ketoacidosis, and metabolic acidosis may be detected by laboratory investigations including blood glucose, renal function tests, and arterial blood gases. Cerebral trauma, cerebrovascular events, and meningitis may be identified by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Encephalopathies and toxicity from other substances (methanol, lithium, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and isoniazid) may be identified through laboratory investigations for serum ammonia, and levels of suspected agents in the blood. Higher serum levels than the therapeutic window indicates toxicity. The abovementioned assessments and investigations are based on individual case considerations and clinical suspicion. MANAGEMENT OF ALCOHOL INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Individuals with some symptoms of alcohol intoxication (mild and moderate cases, i.e., without impairment of consciousness or significant medical issues) can be managed in relatively simple surroundings without much medical intervention. Those who are severely intoxicated should be admitted and further managed in a setting where high-dependency or intensive care can be provided.[4,6] Treatment for acute alcohol toxicity is largely supportive. The first priority is airway protection and maintenance of breathing as respiratory depression due to alcohol intoxication may result in death. Alcohol acts as a diuretic; thus, patients with signs of dehydration (dry lips and mucosae and poor urine output) may be provided with intravenous fluids. Checking glucose is important, as many individuals with alcohol use disorder may have depleted glycogen stores. Hypoglycemia needs to be corrected with 5% dextrose intravenously. Routine use of vitamins is not necessary for all cases of alcohol intoxication. However, thiamine supplementation is needed for patients with alcohol dependence to prevent the occurrence of Wernicke encephalopathy. Thus, prophylactic thiamine may be administered to patients who appear at risk of developing thiamine deficiency (prolonged use of alcohol, poor nutritional status, confused mental state, gait abnormalities, and ophthalmoplegia).[7] Usual dose should be at least 250 mg of thiamine daily intramuscularly for 3–5 days, followed by oral thiamine 100 mg daily.[8] It is important to remember that in an emergency setting, thiamine is to be administered before glucose replenishment so that the glucose is utilized in ATP generation (which utilizes thiamine as a co-factor), preventing sequestration of the already limited thiamine which may precipitate Wernicke's encephalopathy. A brief schematic flowchart for management of alcohol intoxication in the emergency setting is presented in Figure 3.Figure 3: Management of alcohol intoxication in an emergency setting General management Maintain airway, breathing, and circulation. Provide intravenous fluids to counter dehydration and maintain urine output. Hypoglycemia should be corrected with oral glucose, if conscious level permits, or else with 5% or 10% intravenous (IV) dextrose. Maintain ambient room temperature, with quiet surroundings and minimal disturbance. At least one electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained for all heavily intoxicated patients and for those with known cardiovascular conditions. \"Holiday heart syndrome\" characterized by new-onset arrhythmias/atrial fibrillation can occur following alcohol ingestion. Serial ECG monitoring should be done if arrhythmia is detected. As intoxication abates, ECG changes should resolve, but if the changes persist an alternate cause should be considered. In the case of altered mental status, when a full history cannot be elucidated from the patient, a CT scan of the head can be considered for detecting intracranial pathology contributing to the patients' mental status (e.g., subdural hematoma). MRI can also be considered for select cases. If suicidality is expressed, then psychiatric evaluation should be considered. Laboratory investigations Blood glucose, plasma electrolytes, and blood gases should be measured as frequently as possible in patients with altered sensorium until recovery is assured. Urine toxicology may be performed, if needed, to check for presence of narcotics and sedatives, if suspected. Complete blood counts can be done to detect megaloblastic anemia. Liver function tests should be done when prolonged harmful pattern of alcohol use is suspected. Renal function tests should be done in cases of altered sensorium, poor urine output, or if behavioral features are out of proportion to the amount of alcohol consumed. Blood alcohol levels may be required in medicolegal cases when reliable history is not available or when behavioral features are out of proportion to the amount of alcohol consumed. Whole blood thiamine levels may be measured in patients at risk of or suspected to develop Wernicke's encephalopathy. Symptomatic management Control aggression by adopting a concerned and non-threatening demeanor. Sedatives should be used judiciously to avoid over-sedation. Metadoxine (given as a single IV/intramuscular [IM] injection of 300–600 mg) may be used to accelerate the elimination of alcohol in adults leading to faster recovery from intoxication. In cases of agitation or violence, antipsychotics (haloperidol 5 mg with promethazine 50 mg) should be considered. In-patient admission of a patient with alcohol intoxication can be considered when there is severe intoxication, medical complications such as Wernicke's encephalopathy, alcoholic hepatitis, dysrhythmias or convulsions, persistent disorientation, continued abnormality in cardiopulmonary parameters, known chronic systemic illnesses that require medical attention independently, prolonged aggressive behavior, or perceptual abnormalities. The specialty under which the patient needs to be admitted can be determined according to the indication for admission. CANNABIS INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Cannabis is the most common illicit substance of abuse in India. Cannabis intoxication sometimes presents to the emergency setting after consumption (either inhalational or oral) of high amounts of cannabis. It usually presents in those who have never tried cannabis before and experience severe psychiatric or medical manifestation of cannabis consumption. Sometimes, regular cannabis users may also experience symptoms and signs of cannabis intoxication when they are introduced to a cannabis product of higher potency. Cannabis intoxication manifests with several symptoms as mentioned in Table 3.[9] There can be several physical symptoms of cannabis intoxication. These include tachycardia, tachypnea, increased blood pressure, dry mouth, nystagmus, increased appetite, and, rarely, precipitation of arrhythmias, angina, or myocardial infarction. Rarely, deep inhalation or breath holding may lead to pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. Marked perceptual and mental status changes can be observed in cases of cannabis intoxication. These can include alteration in perception of time, with the perceived time being faster than clock time. Music is perceived as more engrossing and colors may appear brighter. There may be hallucinations, primarily auditory ones. There can be a sense of depersonalization. One may become more self-conscious, and may manifest paranoid thinking or delusions (persecutory, referential, or grandiose). Cannabis intoxication affects cognition and psychomotor performance as well. There may be motor incoordination and impaired attention and concentration. Judgment may be impaired due to cannabis intoxication.Table 3: Features of cannabis intoxicationThe cognitive and psychomotor features of intoxication may not be immediately apparent and may manifest up to three hours after consumption of the cannabis product. This may lead novice users to consume higher amounts and experience dysphoria, anxiety, perceptual alterations, and cognitive changes to a higher than anticipated extent. These features of intoxication may last even for 12 to 24 hours after the consumption of cannabis due to accumulation in the adipose tissue and gradual release afterwards. Assessment of patients with cannabis intoxication The assessment of cannabis intoxication is through elaboration of the history and conduct of the examination, supplemented with urine drug screening. Patients presenting to the emergency department with panic attacks or psychotic symptoms after cannabis usage can describe their psychopathology. Attempts should be made to assess the consumption of cannabis products prior to occurrence of such symptoms. Sometimes, friends and family members can provide corollary information. A physical examination that reveals bilateral conjunctival injection without itchiness or pain may indicate cannabis intoxication. A high degree of suspicion may be necessary as the patient may not be forthcoming with proper history, fearing legal or social repercussions. Urine enzyme-linked immunodorbet assay (ELISA) tests might provide objective information about consumption of cannabis, as cannabis remains in the body and is excreted in the urine for at least three days in infrequent consumers and for an even longer duration for regular users. One has to be cautious about urine false positives for cannabis due to efavirenz and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen and naproxen. Differential diagnosis of cannabis intoxication may include intoxication with other substances of use like cocaine, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), MDMA (ecstasy), amphetamines, and synthetic cannabinoids. When a patient presents with psychiatric symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, or panic attacks, one should evaluate for the exacerbation of a preexisting psychiatric illness like schizophrenia, acute and transient psychotic disorder, or panic disorder. Management of cannabis intoxication in the emergency setting Management of cannabis intoxication in the emergency setting can be initiated with placing the patient in a dimly lit space, reassuring them, and decreasing stimulation. In most cases, the intoxication would fade in a few hours. The patient may be given benzodiazepine orally if the patient is accepting the medication orally. Clonazepam 0.5 mg or lorazepam 1 mg can be given in such a situation. If the patient is agitated or violent, then appropriate measures should be taken for the management of agitation or violence. This may include use of antipsychotics (like haloperidol 5 mg with promethazine (Phenergan) 25 mg, given intravenously or intramuscularly), or cautious and limited use of restraints. In cases of chest pain, the patient should be evaluated for cardiac or pulmonary etiological causes. These may focus on myocardial infarction, angina, arrhythmia, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum, or evaluation of exacerbation of asthma. ECG or X-rays coupled with referral to cardiologists/pulmonologists or medicine specialists would be useful. Once the patient recovers from cannabis intoxication, they should be debriefed and offered counseling, providing information about harms associated with cannabis use. If a cannabis use disorder is identified (harmful use or dependence), then the patient should be suitably referred for further treatment of substance use disorder. OPIOID INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Opioids are highly dependence-producing substances. Opioids used commonly include both pharmaceutical ones (used generally in the form of medications such as methadone, buprenorphine, tramadol, and pentazocine), and non-pharmaceutical ones (generally used for recreational purposes like heroin and raw opium). Intoxication with opioids can be intentional (a patient may be taking increased amounts of opioids to experience a more intense high or as an attempt to harm oneself) or unintentional (a patient may be unable to know the potency of street heroin and hence may inject higher doses of it). There are several risk factors for opioid intoxication or overdose that have been reported in the literature.[10] These include escalating doses of opioids, combination of opioids and sedative drugs, use of opioids after a period of cessation, and presence of comorbid conditions like HIV, depression, and liver disease. Opioid intoxication is defined as a condition of transient and clinically significant disturbances in consciousness, perception, behavior, cognition, affect, or coordination that develop during or shortly after the consumption or administration of opioids. Presenting features include somnolence, stupor, psychomotor retardation, slurred speech, mood changes (euphoria followed by dysphoria), respiratory depression, and impaired memory and attention. Pupillary constriction is generally present. The intensity of these symptoms is related to the amount of opioids consumed, and in severe intoxication, coma may occur. These symptoms are not better accounted by the presence of another medical condition or presence of intoxication or withdrawal of another substance. Opioid intoxication can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe on the basis of the level of psychophysiologi",

      "abstract": "The cognitive system is structured from sets of schema, patterns of neural activity that allow the assimilation or accommodation of new experiences and so, by a process of consolidation, the gradual development of knowledge and understanding. As well as schema for purely cognitive processes, there are similar structures that enable individuals to deal with sexual behaviour and affectual relationships (e.g. hedonia, self-esteem, personal preferences and body image). In depression, there is a well established disruption of cognitive function that results in anhedonia and a loss of pleasure, including that from sexual activities. Many antidepressants also have a direct pharmacological action on the central nervous system and disrupt cognitive function, so increasing anhedonia and impairing sexual function. Drug actions on cognitive structures, which in turn increase anhedonia and reduce sexual libido, are over and above any direct pharmacological effects on the more overt behavioural activities associated with sex, including orgasm, erectile function, potency and ejaculation. The tricyclic antidepressants, for example, destroy the cognitive structures that are vital to maintain normal libido as well as disturbing overt sexual behaviours. Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; paroxetine and sertraline) are associated with behavioural activation that is also responsible for an impairment of sexual function. However, there are clear differences between the SSRIs, and fluvoxamine (relative to the other SSRIs) has little effect on objective measures of cognition or on cerebral and behavioural components of Sexual function.",

Insomnia is commonly classified according to different criteria including the time of onset during the night (beginning, middle or end), its course of evolution (occasional, short term or chronic) and the severity of the complaint. The presence of associated signs is a decisive feature in characterising insomnia: it may be isolated or associated with other symptoms. Thus insomnia may evolve in its own right or be part of the framework of a somatic disorder (algic or dyspnoeic, for example) or psychiatric (anxiety disorder, mood disorder, psychose, state of confusion or dementia).",

Esta entidad esta asociada a coomorbilidad psiquiatrica, por lo que las caracteristicas clinicas se hacen mas complejas con el paso del tiempo. El manejo fundamental se basa en la suspension del medicamento sobre el que se centra el abuso (analgesicos, ergotamina, triptanes y opioides). Sin embargo, es necesario tomar en consideracion que la suspension de estos medicamentos puede asociarse a otros problemas como “cefalea de rebote”, sindrome de abstinencia o convulsiones epilepticas; incrementando las tasas de recaida en estos pacientes.

SUMMARY The medication overuse headache (MOH) is define as daily or almost daily headache (15 days or more) in patients with history of primary headache who takes excessive medications. This pathology is associated with psychiatric conditions, reason why with the time the clinical characteristics become more complex. The basic treatment is stopping the medication (analgesic, ergotamine, triptans or opioids), but this could bring us another problem called “rebound headache”, withdrawal sindrome or epileptic convulsions. These symptoms could increase the relapsing rate on this patients.",

      "abstract": "When stress overwhelms the body or persists for a long time (chronic stress), the body is affected by it in a number of ways. Stressors can trigger a variety of stress reactions, including psychological, physiological, and behavioural ones. A multitude of health problems that impact most of the body's systems are brought on by prolonged exposure to such stress. Both physical and mental health is impacted by stress. Perhaps not everyone's bodies react to stress in the same way. Depending on the person's genotype, sex, age, physiological conditions, and prior experiences, it might be different. However, some of these effects apply to everyone. Additionally, stress may work in conjunction with other pathogenic factors to induce gastrointestinal illness. Higher amounts of corticoids and adrenaline are primarily responsible for the effects. Disrupted eating habits, acid reflux, diarrhoea, or constipation are common indications of stress. Stress should be managed by making tiny changes to attitude and way of life, even though it is impossible to escape stress in day-to-day existence.",

      "title": "BURNOUT SYNDROME AS A MANIFESTATION OF TEACHER'S PROFESSIONAL DEFORMATION",
      "abstract": "Professional deformation is the destruction that occurs during work activity and negatively affects its performance. In addition, the destructions generate professionally undesirable qualities changing both professional and personal behaviour. Furthermore, professional deformation has the greatest impact on the personal characteristics of representatives of those professions whose work relates to people (teachers, psychologists, social and medical workers, officials, leaders, police officers, etc.). One of the significant signs related to professional deformation of teachers is the emotional burnout syndrome. Burnout syndrome is viewed as a process of gradual loss of emotional, cognitive and physical energy, which is characterized by the symptoms of emotional and mental exhaustion, as well as physical fatigue, personal isolation, depersonalization, and reduced satisfaction in performance. It is mainly regarded as the result of stress which has not been successfully dealt with at the workplace. Above all, there are three main symptoms of emotional burnout syndrome: extreme exhaustion, detachment from clients (patients, pupils, students) and from work, a sense of inefficiency and lack of achieving high-performance goals. Recent research suggests five key groups of symptoms regarding burnout syndrome. These include both physical, emotional, behavioural, social symptoms and intellectual state. As a result, scientists came to the conclusion that personal, role and organizational factors play an essential role in professional burnout. This paper gives an overview of diagnostic criteria and methods of prevention for burnout syndrome, which are of primary importance for representatives of all professions, especially those who are at risk.",

One of the direct consequences is poorer quality sleep. It has also been proven that sleep-related symptoms correspond to significant changes in the respiratory center, airway resistance, and muscle contractility. The main sleep disorder that these patients may present is Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS), which is characterized by repetitive airway obstruction during sleep with complete or partial cessation of airflow. This alteration can have effects on the circadian rhythm of the sleep-wake cycle, such as a desynchronization of the light-dark cycle or endogenously desynchronized, resulting in: insomnia, fatigue, and poor performance in daily activities and symptoms such as insomnia or hypersomnia, common in patients with circadian sleep disorders, although there are other causes to which they can be attributed and that must be excluded before making the diagnosis of a circadian sleep disorder. In a patient without another sleep pathology, a daily record of activities, meals, exercise, naps, and bedtime is an essential tool to evaluate circadian sleep disorders.",

      "title": "ATP1A3-Related Neurologic Disorders",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders represent a clinical continuum in which at least three distinct phenotypes have been delineated: rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP); alternating hemiplegia of childhood (ACH); and cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss (CAPOS). However, some affected individuals have intermediate phenotypes or only a few features that do not fit well into one of these major phenotypes. RDP has been characterized by: abrupt onset of dystonia over days to weeks with parkinsonism (primarily bradykinesia and postural instability); common bulbar involvement; and absence or minimal response to an adequate trial of L-dopa therapy, with few exceptions. Often fever, physiologic stress, or alcoholic binges trigger the onset of symptoms. After their initial appearance, symptoms often stabilize with little improvement; occasionally second episodes occur with abrupt worsening of symptoms. Rarely, affected individuals have reported a more gradual onset of symptoms over weeks to months. Anxiety, depression, and seizures have been reported. Age of onset ranges from four to 55 years, although a childhood variation of RDP with onset between ages nine and 14 months has been reported. AHC is a complex neurodevelopmental syndrome most frequently manifesting in infancy or early childhood with paroxysmal episodic neurologic dysfunction including alternating hemiparesis or dystonia, quadriparesis, seizure-like episodes, and oculomotor abnormalities. Episodes can last for minutes, hours, days, or even weeks. Remission of symptoms occurs with sleep and immediately after awakening. Over time, persistent neurologic deficits including oculomotor apraxia, ataxia, choreoathetosis, dystonia, parkinsonism, and cognitive and behavioral dysfunction develop in the majority of those affected; more than 50% develop epilepsy in addition to their episodic movement disorder phenotype. CAPOS (cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss) syndrome is characterized by episodes of ataxic encephalopathy and/or weakness during and after a febrile illness. Onset is between ages six months and four years. Some acute symptoms resolve; progression of sensory losses and severity vary. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis of an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder is established in an individual with the clinical features of RDP, AHC, or CAPOS syndrome and/or by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A3. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment of visual disturbance, hearing loss, seizure disorders, cardiac arrhythmia, and cardiomyopathy. Consideration of CPAP or BiPAP for those with sleep apnea. Those with severe dysphagia may require a gastrostomy tube. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy for motor dysfunction, ataxia, and dysarthria. Acute spasms may respond to chloral hydrate or other medication that induces sleep. Dystonia can be treated with benzodiazepines, dopamine agonists, or levo-dopa. Psychotherapy and standard pharmacotherapy for those with mood disorder or psychosis. Early referral for developmental support / special education. Prevention of primary manifestations: Prophylaxis for AHC episodes may include flunarizine, topiramate, a ketogenic diet, and sleep. A trial of high-dose benzodiazepines may be considered in individuals with RDP and AHC. Triggers that lead to acute attacks should be avoided. Prevention of secondary complications: When dystonia is present, physical therapy to prevent contractures in the hands and feet. Surveillance. Affected individuals should be monitored for the development of dysphagia (RDP and CAPOS syndrome), seizures (RDP and AHC), and psychiatric symptoms (RDP). Agents/circumstances to avoid: RDP. Triggers including alcohol, fever, psychological stress (e.g., childbirth), excessive exercise. AHC. Triggers including psychological stress / excitement; environmental stressors (e.g., bright light, excessive heat or cold, excessive sound, crowds); water exposure (e.g., bathing, swimming); certain foods or odors (e.g., chocolate, food dyes); missed meals; excessive or atypically strenuous exercise; illness; irregular sleep (missing a nap, delayed bedtime). CAPOS syndrome. Febrile illness, pregnancy. Pregnancy management: Affected pregnant women should be monitored for the development of symptoms of RDP. The number of pregnant women with RDP is small, but several reports of childbirth as a trigger have been noted. Exposure to anti-seizure medication may increase the risk to the fetus of adverse outcome; that risk, however, is often less than the risk to the fetus associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given anti-seizure medication during pregnancy should ideally take place before conception. Genetic counseling ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. ATP1A3 pathogenic variants may be inherited or occur de novo. In contrast to initial reports a familial history is not required for a diagnosis of RDP. In AHC, pathogenic variants are more commonly de novo than inherited; in both RDP and CAPOS syndrome both inherited and de novo pathogenic variants have been observed. Each child of an individual with an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant in the family is known. The variability of presentation within a family with a known ATP1A3 pathogenic variant further complicates genetic counseling. Lifelong asymptomatic individuals who harbor a heterozygous ATP1A3 pathogenic variant have been reported in families with RDP.",

Both tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors cause similar syndromes, most commonly characterized by gastrointestinal or somatic distress, sleep disturbances, mood fluctuations and movement disorders. Most symptoms related to tricyclic antidepressant withdrawal are believed to be caused by rebound excess of cholinergic activity after prolonged anticholinergic effect on cholinergic receptors. (This situation is analogous to the adrenergic rebound that occurs after beta-blocker withdrawal.) Treatment involves restarting the antidepressant and tapering it more slowly. Alternatively, tricyclic antidepressant withdrawal symptoms often respond to anticholinergics, such as atropine or benztropine mesylate. Three case reports of antidepressant withdrawal are presented, including one featuring akathisia (motor restlessness) related to withdrawal of venlafaxine.",

      "abstract": "Akathisia is a syndrome characterized by the unpleasant sensation of \"inner\" restlessness that manifests itself in the inability of sitting still or not moving. Many types of medicaments can cause akathisia as an adverse event of their use and they include: antipsychotics, antidepressants, antiemetics, antihistamines, and psychoactive substances. We will present the case of a 50 year old patient, treated on two occasions for psychotic depression. During the second hospitalization it is possible that antipsychotic treatment combined with an antidepressant caused akathisia or there were symptoms of agitated depression and akathisia present at the same time, which is very difficult to determine in everyday clinical practice. We can conclude that in this case, as in many others, akathisia as a possible adverse effect of psychopharmacs was very hard to identify. Therefore, it is necessary to have akathisia in mind when using certain medicaments, especially when combining several that use the same enzymatic system and consequently raise levels of at least one of them.",

      "title": "Management of acute extrapyramidal effects induced by antipsychotic drugs",
      "abstract": "The management of acute extrapyramidal effects (EPEs) induced by antipsychotic drugs is reviewed. EPEs associated with antipsychotics include acute dystonias, pseudoparkinsonism, and akathisia. Acute dystonias consist of abnormal muscle spasms and postures and usually occur three to five days after antipsychotic therapy begins or the dosage is increased. Acute dystonias should be treated with anticholinergic medications or benzodiazepines. Antipsychotic-induced pseudoparkinsonism has the same clinical appearance as idiopathic parkinsonism. Symptoms generally appear within the first three months. Pseudoparkinsonism is managed by lowering the anti-psychotic dosage or by adding an anticholinergic agent or a mantadine; switching to a low-potency agent or an atypical antipsychotic may also help. Akathisia is characterized by subjective feelings of restlessness and anxiety and objective signs of motor activity, such as inability to sit still. This EPE appears days to weeks after antipsychotic exposure begins and can be difficult to manage. If reduction of the antipsychotic dosage or a switch to a less potent antipsychotic is not practical or effective, an anticholinergic, beta-blocker, or benzodiazepine may be added. Lipophilic beta-blockers, especially propranolol and metoprolol, appear to be the most effective treatments. Anticholinergic agents are commonly given to prevent acute dystonias, especially in high-risk patients, but long-term prophylaxis is controversial. Atypical antipsychotics may have less potential to induce EPEs. Options in the management of antipsychotic-associated EPEs include using the lowest effective dosage of antipsychotic, treating the reactions with medications, and changing the antipsychotic to one with less potential for inducing EPEs.",

An unanticipated opportunity for King David to peep at Bathsheba led him to a train of Biblical woes and Nathan's rebuke. According to old lore, Tom's peeping at Lady Godiva led God to blind him. The stories of King David and Tom are presented as examples of “sinful,” not pathological, behavior. Neither story provides enough details to permit a diagnosis of voyeurism for either man. Voyeurism as a diagnosis came later. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000), voyeurism requires more than isolated episodes of peeping. The DSM‐IV‐TR diagnosis of voyeurism has three criteria; (1) The patient must have recurrent sexual fantasies, urges, or acts of observing an unsuspecting person naked, in the process of undressing, or having sex; (2) The patient must have had these recurrent fantasies, urges, and acts for at least six months; and (3) Either the patient has engaged in peeping or, if not, is having personal or interpersonal difficulties as a result of voyeuristic interests.",

      "title": "Cocaine-Positive Patients Undergoing Elective Surgery: From Avoiding Case Cancellations to Treating Substance Use Disorders",
      "abstract": "See Article, p 308 The impact of substance use disorders (SUDs) on the management of anesthesia for patients undergoing surgical procedures covers a broad spectrum, from the acute effects of intoxication to chronic effects such as altered anesthetic drug metabolism or a predisposition to perioperative organ injury.1 SUDs, which are characterized by the persistent use of a substance despite adverse consequences, including health problems, are extremely common. For example, in the United States, the 12-month prevalence of alcohol use disorder is 13.9%.2 For the less common substances encompassed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) SUD definition (amphetamines, cannabis, club drugs, cocaine, hallucinogens, heroin, nonheroin opioids, sedative/tranquilizers, and/or solvent/inhalant use disorders), the 12-month prevalence is still 3.9%.3 The immediate dilemma for the anesthesiologist presented with a urine toxicology result that is positive for cocaine, or any of the substances included in the DSM-5 SUD definition, is then whether to (1) postpone the elective surgery or (2) proceed with the anesthetic while anticipating potential problems associated with the urine toxicology result. While option (1) may seem the \"safest\" from a provider's point of view, unanticipated cancellations of surgery come at steep costs. In addition to the financial implications of unused operating room time, prolonged patient suffering, worsened patient experience, and treatment delays resulting in worsened clinical outcomes due to disease progression represent potential consequences to case cancellations.4 The higher prevalence of SUDs in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations5 with limited access to care makes a decision to postpone an elective procedure even more consequential. The acutely cocaine-intoxicated patient may display hypertension, tachyarrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and convulsions, and management of anesthesia in such patients has been described for parturients, fetuses, and neonates.6 Cocaine-using patients presenting in a clinically nontoxic (asymptomatic) state, defined as normal blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and normal or unchanged electrocardiogram, have been shown to receive general anesthesia safely for scheduled elective surgery in a prospective cohort study including 40 cocaine-positive patients.7 In the current issue of the Journal, Moon et al8 report on a single-center prospective cohort study evaluating the association of a positive preoperative urine test for cocaine and intraoperative hemodynamic events in a cohort of 327 asymptomatic patients with a history of cocaine use. Hemodynamic events were defined as a mean arterial blood pressure of <65 or >105 mm Hg, or a heart rate of <50 or >100 beats per minute. They found that the 173 asymptomatic cocaine-positive patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia had similar percentages of intraoperative hemodynamic events when compared to 154 cocaine-negative patients. Moon et al's8 current study adds to a growing body of literature suggesting that urine toxicology results positive for cocaine, per se, may not reflect an absolute contraindication to proceeding with a surgical procedure.7,9,10 While this is undoubtedly a critical conclusion, we would like to contextualize these results with respect to (1) the prevalence of polysubstance use, particularly multiple stimulants, and (2) the effectiveness of in-hospital interventions on SUD trajectories in general. POLYSUBSTANCE USE A complicating factor for patients with cocaine use disorder is the concomitant use of other substances. Accordingly, patients with polysubstance use (except marijuana) were excluded from Moon et al's8 study. However, a patient presenting with a urine toxicology result positive for cocaine plus an additional substance may be quite common. For example, in a sample of 706 rural methamphetamine users in the United States, 35% reported using both methamphetamines and cocaine.11 The example of concurrent cocaine and amphetamine use (which could also be present among cocaine users who use prescription stimulants) illustrates why surgical patients with polysubstance use may demand a more conservative approach. Since both substances can lead to a hypermetabolic state, including tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia, the risk for adverse perioperative outcomes is amplified in these patients. Specific conditions such as serotonin syndrome may further be triggered by preoperatively administered medications and pose a unique risk to polysubstance users. An isolated positive urine toxicology result for cocaine in an otherwise asymptomatic patient may lead to alterations in the anesthetic care plan, but not necessarily postponement of the surgical procedure. However, the detection of other substances in addition to cocaine may still merit delaying an elective procedure, even if the patient appears asymptomatic. Obtaining urine toxicology results as a part of the preoperative assessment in patients at risk for SUD is a requirement to make an informed decision on whether or not to proceed with surgery. IN-HOSPITAL INTERVENTIONS ON SUDS SUDs may have contributed to the presenting complaint that necessitated a surgical procedure and pose challenges to the recovery process after anesthesia and surgery. Hospitalizations, in general, offer the opportunity to administer interventions beyond the primary admission diagnosis, especially in populations that are otherwise unlikely to seek regular primary care. The standard of care in this setting is screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT), which quickly assesses the severity of a patient's substance use, identifies the appropriate level of treatment, and attempts to increase insight regarding substance use and motivation for behavioral change. SBIRT can be implemented by a wide range of health care personnel with varied backgrounds. The efficacy of SBIRT has been well described for common SUDs. A Cochrane review on the effectiveness of interventions for smoking cessation in hospitalized patients found that only high-intensity behavioral interventions that began during a hospital stay and lasted a minimum of 1 month after discharge were effective.12 Interestingly, interventions of low intensity or shorter duration were not successful in this study. Yet, brief interventions administered in the preadmission clinic before elective surgery have shown success in reducing smoking rates at 1 year with a number needed to treat of 5.9.13 Similarly, for perioperative alcohol use, a recent Cochrane review summarized the results of 3 clinical studies.14 The authors found that alcohol cessation interventions significantly increased the number of participants who quit drinking alcohol during the intervention period and likely reduced the number of postoperative complications.14 SBIRT approaches have been successfully implemented across a variety of different health care sites, including emergency departments and urgent care centers, inpatient hospital settings, and outpatient and community-based clinics, and have shown success in regard to reducing cocaine use specifically.15 SBIRT has also been shown to improve functioning in other domains that may have been associated with the initial complaint that brought the patient to medical attention, including general health, mental health, employment, housing status, and criminal behavior.15 Thus, postoperative hospital-based intervention for SUDs following a positive urine toxicology result for cocaine or another substance may decrease future substance use and increase the likelihood that patients adhere to postoperative care recommendations and do not require subsequent readmission. FUTURE DIRECTIONS The study by Moon et al8 may help anesthesiologists who must make a challenging decision when faced with the dilemma of canceling versus proceeding with a scheduled case in a patient with cocaine use disorder and an isolated positive urine toxicology result. In addition to safely shepherding our patients through the intraoperative course, opportunities for expansion of our practice exist. Future study may focus on how to best manage patients presenting with polysubstance use, as well as hospitalization-based interventions geared at the long-term reduction of illicit drug use in these patients.

Ces stimulus étaient l'apomorphine, l'émétine, la scoline et le choc électrique. Rien n'indique à l'évidence que ces méthodes sont plus efficaces que les autres, non excitantes, pour traiter les alcooliques. L'échec de ces méthodes est parfois attribuable à des modes de conditionnement défectueux. Ainsi, (1) la difficulté qu'on éprouve à régler l'intervalle entre la présentation du stimulus conditionné (SC) (alcool) et la survenance du réflexe non conditionné (RNC) (nausée et vomissements). L'intervalle critique (de 0 à 5 secondes) entre le SC et le RNC est d'une extrême importance dans le conditionnement classique; (2) L'effet hypnotique souvent produit par les drogues productrices de nausées, qui peut rendre difficile le processus du conditionnement. Cependant, même lorsqu'un réflexe de répugnance à l'alcool est bien conditionné, il peut ne pas suffire à produire des modifications du comportement chez le buveur. Rien non plus ne vient prouver l'efficacité thérapeutique particulière du LSD.L'auteur met en lumière la difficulté d'évaluation de la plupart des études passées en revue et il expose les conditions minimales qui président à des études bien faites. Il propose d'accorder plus d'attention, dans la future recherche, aux variables que présentent les sujets et les modes d'administration, ainsi qu'aux méthodes de postcure.",

Terapijske preporuke: Lijecenje treba zapoceti niskom dozom (pola pocetne doze u odraslih osoba) i polagano titrirati. Lijek prvog izbora je iz skupine SIPPS jer ga starije osobe dobro podnose, a dokazana im je ucinkovitost kod depresija u osoba starije životne dobi. Ako uz maksimalnu dozu ne dođe do zadovoljavajuceg poboljsanja, potrebno je promijeniti lijek unutar skupine SIPPS-a. Sljedeci je korak promjena lijeka u antidepresiv iz skupine inhibitora ponovne pohrane serotonina i noradrenalina. U slucaju rezistencije i kžd prisutnih psihoticnih simptoma dodaju se antipsihotik i stabilizator ri%položenja. Kod jetrenih ostecenja biramo tianeptin i mirzaten.

      "title": "Sedative-Hypnotics: Addiction and Current Research Status",
      "abstract": "Central nervous system depressants, e.g. alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines, have a wide spectrum of activity in human and animals. These depressants produce varying degrees of CNS depression, depending mainly upon the dose used. In small doses, they can alleviate anxiety and/or reduce spontaneous activity; in moderate doses, they induce sleep; with large doses, severe CNS depression progresses to anesthesia, coma or even death. This graded, dose-dependent CNS depression is a common feature of these agents. In addition to causing CNS depression, these agents also possess other pharmacological properties, e. g. muscle relaxation, Anticonvulsant activity, respiratory depression, hypothermia, etc. Tolerance-dependence developing to sedative-hypnotics is a common feature following continuous administration of sedative-hypnotics. Tolerance is defined as a decreasing response to repeated administration of the same dose of a sedative-hypnotic or as a necessary increase of the dosage to obtain the initial response. There are two types of tolerance-one dispositional (pharmacokinetic), the other functional (pharmacodynamic). Dependence is defined as a modification of physiological functions that require continuous drug adiministration to prevent the appearance of withdrawal symptoms. Abrupt withdrawal from long-term usage of these drugs may produce anxiety, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, insomnia, muscular twitching, hyperthermia, delirium, tremors, convulsions, and death. Evidence accumulated suggests that some of the pharmacological actions exerted by sedative-hypnotics, e.g benzodiazepines, barbiturates and alcohol, may be mediated through the GABA system by mimicking GABAergic transmission. However, the mechanisms of the actions of these agents on the GABA system remain to be elucidated. Benzodiazepines have been demonstrated to have receptors which are parts of the GABAA receptors (GABA benzodiazepine receptor chloride ionophore complexes). Although a definitive barbiturate binding site has not yet been identified, the available evidence strongly suggests that barbiturate binding sites and convulsant binding sites are separate but allosterically affect each other. As far as ethanol is concerned, it is likely that multiple neurotransmitter systems are affected. Therefore, it is still unclear how alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines are functionally associated with the GABA system. The evidence summarized demonstrates that the GABA synapse plays an important role in the pharmacologic effects of barbiturates, alcohol and benzodiazepines. There are similarities and differences in the effects of these CNS depressants on the pharmacology and biochemistry of the GABA synapse. The effects of alcohol, barbiturates and benzodiazepines on GABA synapses are different in different brain regions. Furthermore, the results which have been reported in the literature are inconsistent. This may be due to differences in (a) animal models used, (b) brain regions used, (c) protocols used in treating the animals (dose, duration, form and route of administration, etc.) and/or (d) techniques used (pharmacological, biochemical, physiological, etc.)",

The inclusion criteria were: a) vertigo or balance disorders absent before drug administration; b) appearance of dizziness or imbalance during or just after drug administration; c) persistent symptoms for at least three months; d) dysequilibrium confirmed by abnormal dynamic posturography, and/or e) labyrinthine lesion demonstrated by spontaneous or postheadshake nystagmus, saccades as response to Halmagyi test or hypofunction observed by nystagmographic recording of caloric tests. Results Eight patients were included. In all cases, toxic effect was observed only on posterior labyrinth while cochlear symptoms were absent. All patients complained of feeling of dizziness and unsteadiness. Drugs involved were antibiotics in 4 patients, anti-tuberculosis medicinal products in 2 patients, chemotherapeutic agents in 1 and tamoxifen in the last one. All patients had abnormal dynamic posturography, while caloric tests were normal in 2 and abnormal in 6 patients. A remarkable improvement of clinical status was achieved in 7 patients, while one subject, despite improving her symptoms, continued to have a serious imbalance at the end of follow-up period. Conclusions Dizziness and imbalance as vestibulotoxic effects induced by some drugs are symptoms, likely underdiagnosed, that limit the physical activity and cause a decrease in quality of life of the affected patients. Early detection of these symptoms might allow, in some cases, to replace the vestibulotoxic medication by less toxic or non-ototoxic drug. In those cases with serious diseases, it is not possible to avoid the use of certain drugs but physician might prescribe other compounds to prevent or reduce their ototoxic effect.

      "abstract": "Introdução: Cefaleia representa um problema de saúde pública, podendo ser primárias, quando são por si só a patologia ou secundárias quando são apenas um sintoma de uma outra patologia de base. Objetivos: Revisar as características e pontos principais da migrânea. Materiais e Métodos: revisão narrativa realizada em bases de dados digitais, livros e informações de organizações de referência mundial. Resultados: A migrânea é um tipo de cefaleia primária de alta prevalência, sendo mais comum em mulheres. Pode ser com ou sem aura – sintomas neurológicos focais que precedem a dor – ou crônica. Caracteriza-se por cefaleia pulsátil, unilateral, de intensidade de moderada a grave, associada a náusea, vomito, foto ou fonofobia e que se agrava com atividades físicas rotineiras. Deve ser diferenciada de outras cefaleias primarias e, quando na presença de sinais de alarme, também das secundárias, em especial se na terceira idade. Fatores como odores e luzes fortes, consumo de bebida alcoólica, certos alimentos, jejum prolongado, distúrbios do sono e ciclo menstrual podem desencadear uma crise. Seu tratamento pode ser farmacológico ou não, além de envolver medidas gerais; e pode ser sintomático ou profilático – mais indicado em casos mais graves ou refratários. Dentre os medicamentos utilizados durante as crises há os específicos (triptanos e derivados da ergotamina) e não específicos (analgésicos e anti-inflamatórios não esteroidais). Conclusão: Conclui-se que a migrânea deve ser reconhecida e diagnosticada correta e precocemente, objetivando uma terapêutica adequada e individualizada para que se alcance uma melhora na qualidade de vida do paciente.",

A case of catatonia is reported which occurred after alcohol withdrawal.Catatonia occurred 48 hours after alcohol withdrawal in a 54-year-old woman who had stopped all her treatment (in the context of a type II bipolar disorder). A dramatic improvement of symptoms was observed after oral administration of zolpidem.This case seems to confirm that catatonia can represents a nonspecific response to stress factors. The withdrawal of multiple medications was already described as a basis for catatonia. Alcohol withdrawal could constitute an additional risk factor for catatonia. The zolpidem test is a useful diagnostic and therapeutic test.",

We report two cases suffering from visual and auditory hallucinations: Case 1 abruptly stopped taking paroxetine (20 mg/day), and Case 2 discontinued paroxetine after reducing the dose from 20 mg/day to 10 mg/day for 5 months. Both cases experienced visual and auditory hallucinations in addition to dizziness, headache, insomnia, and nausea a couple of days after paroxetine discontinuation. These observations suggest that hallucinations are a part of the discontinuation syndrome that results from paroxetine discontinuation. Physicians should be aware of this symptom.",

      "title": "Primary Dysmenorrhea: Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, and Treatment Updates",
      "abstract": "Primary dysmenorrhea (PD) is a common, disregarded, underdiagnosed, and inadequately treated complaint of both young and adult females. It is characterized by painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which start shortly before or at the onset of menses and which could last for 3 days. In particular, PD negatively impacts the quality of life (QOL) of young females and is the main reason behind their absenteeism from school or work. It is suggested that increased intrauterine secretion of prostaglandins F2α and E2 are responsible for the pelvic pain associated with this disorder. Its associated symptoms are physical and/or psychological. Its physical symptoms include headache, lethargy, sleep disturbances, tender breasts, various body pains, disturbed appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea, and increased urination, whereas its psychological symptoms include mood disturbances, such as anxiety, depression, and irritability. While its diagnosis is based on patients' history, symptoms, and physical examination, its treatment aims to improve the QOL through the administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hormonal contraceptives, and/or the use of non-pharmacological aids (e.g., topical heat application and exercise). Patients must be monitored to measure their response to treatment, assess their adherence, observe potential side effects, and perform further investigations, if needed.",

We report two cases of neurologic complications requiring hospitalization in patients when atomoxetine was added to other psychoactive drugs. A 9-year-old taking clonidine and dextroamphetamine developed psychosis, abnormal involuntary movements, and insomnia. An 18-year-old also initiating venlafaxine developed facial tics, tremors, and speech disturbance. Acute symptoms did not respond to diphenhydramine in either case, but resolved after atomoxetine and other medications were discontinued. Possible explanations include atypical atomoxetine effect, excess atomoxetine or metabolites due to poor metabolizer status (CYP 2D6 polymorphism/deficiency), a drug-drug interaction leading to elevated drug levels or to excess synaptic norepinephrine or dopamine. Serotonin syndrome is a possibility in the second case, but not the first. Clinicians should be aware of emergent dyskinesias when combining atomoxetine with dopaminergic, noradrenergic, or serotonergic medications.",

Treatment can vary from none at all (eg, in the child with a single febrile seizure) to the use of more than one drug and the ketogenic diet (eg, in poorly controlled atypical absence, atonic, and some myoclonic disorders). When drug therapy is required, an appropriate agent is started and the dosage increased as needed to control seizures. If seizures persist or toxicity occurs, another drug should be substituted. When the patient has been seizure-free for a year, the drug can be slowly decreased and eventually discontinued.

      "title": "What attitude towards a patient with somatoform disorder?",
      "abstract": "The diagnosis of a somatic symptom disorder must be based on both a negative approach - eliminating another psychiatric or non-psychiatric disorder that would better explain the symptoms - and a positive one, which is, based on the search for characteristic thoughts, emotions or behaviours as well as biological or psychological factors that may promote, trigger or sustain the disorder. Additional tests and specialized medical consultations should not be prescribed solely to reassure the patient; they may actually worsen the condition. The management will move away from the outdated notion of \"medically unexplained symptoms\" to rely on: the acknowledgment of the painful, debilitating and involuntary nature of the symptoms; the proposal of a positive diagnosis acceptable by the patient and an explanatory model compatible with his or her representations, aimed at putting an end to dysfunctional health care utilization; the proposal of therapeutic objectives aimed at functional rather than symptomatic recovery; the negotiation of pharmacological (selective or mixed serotonin reuptake inhibitor if necessary) and non-pharmacological interventions, especially when it comes to limiting the factors that sustain the disorder; the coordination of the various healthcare professionals.Le diagnostic de trouble somatoforme doit reposer sur une démarche tout autant négative – éliminer un autre trouble psychiatrique ou non psychiatrique qui expliquerait mieux les symptômes – que positive, c’est-à-dire fondée sur la recherche de pensées, d’émotions ou de comportements caractéristiques et de facteurs biologiques ou psychologiques pouvant favoriser, déclencher ou pérenniser le trouble. Examens complémentaires et avis médicaux spécialisés ne doivent pas avoir pour seul but de rassurer le patient ; ils peuvent en effet s’avérer iatrogènes. La prise en charge doit se détourner de la notion désuète de « symptômes médicalement inexpliqués » pour s’appuyer sur : la reconnaissance du caractère pénible, invalidant et non volontaire des symptômes ; la proposition d’un diagnostic positif acceptable et d’un modèle explicatif compatible avec les représentations du patient, visant à mettre un terme à l’errance diagnostique ; la proposition d’objectifs thérapeutiques visant un rétablissement fonctionnel plus que symptomatique ; la négociation des moyens pharmacologiques (inhibiteur sélectif ou mixte de recapture de la sérotonine si nécessaire) et non pharmacologiques, en particulier la lutte contre les facteurs d’entretien du trouble ; la coordination des soins entre les divers intervenants",

Anxiety sensitivityAnxiety sensitivity (AS) refers to individual differences in the fear of anxietyrelated sensations and the expectation that such sensations can have harmful consequences (Reiss, 1997;Reiss & McNally, 1985).Just as some people are afraid of spiders, some individuals fear the sensations that accompany anxiety.This construct AS can be measured with the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) (Peterson & Reiss, 1992;Reiss, Peterson, Gursky, & McNally, 1986).AS has been proposed as a risk factor for the development of anxiety disorders, specifically PD (Reiss, 1991).Besides AS, trait anxiety is also regarded as a vulnerability factor for the de- Chapter 2Reactivity to a 35% CO2 challenge in healthy first-degree relatives of patients with panic disorder Background: The effects of a 35% CO2 challenge were examined in healthy firstdegree relatives of panic disorder patients and in healthy control subjects matched for age and gender.Methods: One single inhalation of a 35% CO2 / 65% O2 challenge was administered to 50 first-degree relatives of panic disorder patients and 50 control subjects.Results: The first-degree relatives were more reactive to the 35% CO2 challenge than the control subjects.Conclusions: These findings indicate that being a member of a family with a panic disorder patient is, in itself, an important factor in CO2 hypersensitivity among subjects who have never experienced a panic attack.Both panic disorder patients and their first-degree relatives have a tendency to be more reactive to the CO2 challenge.van Beek, N., & Griez, E.

It is a normal state and a spur to action, but readily exceeds normal limits in intensity, duration and appropriateness to the stimulus or situation. Anxiety is manifest by the mood of fearfulness, behaviour marked by restlessness and avoidance of situations, increased arousal with insomnia, excessive preoccupation with thoughts on the theme of insecurity, and a wide range of somatic symptoms which are based on muscular tension, hyperventilation leading to paraesthesiae and faintness, and symptoms based on overactivity of the autonomic nervous system. Excessive anxiety and situational avoidance leads to diminution of performance and limitation of endeavour. In the context of physical illness, anxiety increases the distress of symptoms, may confuse diagnostic procedure, prolong recovery time from acute illness, cause failure to comply with effective treatment and promote destructive habits such as reliance on alcohol or excessive use of sedative drugs.",

      "title": "Forensic psychiatry approach to mental disorders resulting from substance abuse",
      "abstract": "In the last few decades, mental disorders resulting from substance abuse have become a frequent phenomenon, which features diverse forms and degrees of severity. In addition to being a medical and extremely harmful social phenomenon, substance abuse (commonly known as drug or narcotics abuse) is frequently a subject matter of research in many sciences or scientific disciplines, such as medicine, psychology, sociology, legal science, etc. Drug abusers may develop diverse mental disorders, which largely depends on the type of psychoactive substance which is being abused and the method of taking narcotics (including frequency, daily dose, mode of administration, etc.). In this paper, the author provides an overview of different types of mental disorders according to the applicable International Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders. The disturbance of mental functions due to drug abuse (which may or may not result in the development of a mental disorder) changes the perception and behaviour of drug users. The disturbance of mental functions becomes particularly prominent in the circumstances where substance abuse has turned into a drug addiction; the basic characteristic of the dependence syndrome is an irresistible urge (craving or even compulsion) to take the substance in order to enjoy its effects again or to avoid/relieve the drug addiction crisis or the abstinence syndrome, which may be extremely painful and agonizing. As a consequence of these mental disturbances and other disorders arising from drug addiction, human behaviour may be disrupted to such an extent that a person may demonstrate some criminal conduct, which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant in the field of criminal law. Given the fact that the criminal offender is a drug abuser who may have different forms of mental disorders, there is a need to consider the offender's mental capacity (sanity), which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant from the point of view of forensic psychiatry. The author's primary goal in this paper is to present the basic postulates underlying the perception of drug abuse and drug addiction in forensic psychiatry, both from the theoretical and practical point of view. In exploring the practical aspect of this issue, the author focuses on presenting the basic principles of forensic-psychiatric expertise of criminal offenders who have been diagnosed as having mental disorders caused by drug abuse. The expertise includes different aspects of assessing mental disorders: giving professional opinions on the offender's mental capacity (sanity), assessing the potential danger of recidivism or commission of a more serious criminal act, and giving proposals for relevant of security measures concerning the mandatory treatment of drug addicts both in outpatient clinics and in other relevant in-patient medical institutions. Given the fact that mental disorders stemming from drug abuse frequently have numerous financial, family and professional implications, the author presents some forensic psychiatric attitudes pertaining to the assessment of contractual capacity of these persons, the assessment of their working capacity (including the remaining working ability or temporary inability to work), the assessment of mental capacity for exercising the parental right or custodianship rights. In that context, the author provides the forensic psychiatric aspects of these mental disorders from the aspect of civil law. Drug abuse and drug addiction involve serious and complex socio-pathological problems which are difficult to treat/cure. This paper is the author's contribution to casting light on these issues, primarily from the aspect of forensic psychiatry.",

      "abstract": "FIFTEEN to 20 million Americans suffer chronically from the tyranny of insomnia. Over-the-counter medications, the first line of defense, have little impact on sleep beyond placebo effects. Ironically, antihistamines in them can increase daytime drowsiness and may enhance the person's belief that sleep is getting worse. When these drugs fail, the chronic sufferer often turns to the physician, who is expected to be ready with medically proved answers. Twenty-seven million prescriptions were written for hypnotics in 1976. Barbiturates, accounting for 20% of these prescriptions, lead to a predictable cycle of dependence, tolerance, and escalating doses. These medications also disrupt the sleep structure. Rapid eye movement (REM) and slow-wave sleep (stages 3 and 4) are suppressed, and the EEG shows increased β activity. Physical and psychological dependence, withdrawal reactions, and \"REM rebound\" reactions (severe nightmares and sleep more disturbed than before taking medication) often accompany attempts to stop using these drugs.",

      "title": "Seizures in alcohol withdrawal syndrome",
      "abstract": "Alcohol withdrawal syndrome develops in individuals with alcohol dependence who discontinue or reduce alcohol intake after long-term or binge drinking. Withdrawal symptoms usually occur 6–8 hours after the last alcohol consumption and peak between 24–72 hours. Typical manifestations include tremor, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, agitation, and excess sweating. Complicated withdrawal syndrome may manifest with seizures (including cluster seizures), status epilepticus, acute psychosis and delirium, when hallucinations are accompanied by disorientation in time, place and situation. About 10–15% of patients develop complicated withdrawal syndrome. The seizures in alcohol withdrawal syndrome are triggered in the brain stem and have a mechanism other than that of classic epileptic seizures. Benzodiazepines, which are more effective than other classes of anticonvulsants (they primarily reduce the frequency of convulsions in the first two days after alcohol discontinuation and significantly reduce the risk of death), are the gold standard for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The Clinical Institute of Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale (CIWA-Ar) is a helpful tool for making decisions on treatment initiation or discontinuation. It should be noted that chronic use of benzodiazepines in the secondary prevention of alcohol withdrawal seizures is not recommended due to the addictive potential of these agents and a more severe course of alcohol withdrawal seizures with benzodiazepine co-dependence.",

      "title": "Buspirone Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury in a Child Who Is Highly Sensitive to Adverse Effects of Psychotropic Medications",
      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury can produce various neuropsychiatric impairments and a high susceptibility to adverse effects of psychotropic medications. A 6-year-old boy developed symptoms of ADHD after head trauma at age 30 months. Three different psychostimulants, three tricyclic antidepressants, clonidine, bupropion, fluoxetine, and propranolol were either ineffective or produced adverse effects. Side effects mainly consisted of organic mood syndrome (despite the lack of apparent genetic or organic mood disorder), sympathomimetic intoxication, and sympathomimetic hallucinosis. Buspirone (10 mg q.i.d.) produced significant improvement in impulsivity and hyperactivity, but not in attention deficits. Methamphetamine (5 mg every morning), added to the buspirone, was effective in treating the remaining attentional symptoms. These treatments were readily tolerated, and the child has remained stable for 2 years on buspirone and methamphetamine. The symptoms of mood disorder were present only during stimulant or antidepressant treatment, and therefore the diagnosis of organic mood disorder did not apply. Apart from medication side effects, the child appeared to have an \"organically-based pharmacological vulnerability to mood disorder\" and postinjury ADHD (although comorbid neuropsychiatric conditions might have contributed to the complex clinical picture). This single case study was uncontrolled, did not involve drug withdrawal design, and used clinical observations rather than standardized measures. Further study is needed before buspirone can be viewed as safe or effective for treating TBI, but buspirone may be an attractive alternative for managing certain behavioral problems following brain injury, especially in patients sensitive to adverse effects of psychotropic medications.",

Dabei handelt es sich um eine Restklasse der Restklasse, der auch andere, wenig mit ihr gemein habende Störungen, wie z.B. die Pyromanie, die Kleptomanie und die Trichotillomanie zugerechnet werden. Psychopathologische Analysen sowie klinische Erfahrungen zeigen, dass es sich beim pathologischen Spielen um eine weit über eine Impulskontrollstörung hinausreichende Erkrankung handelt; viele der an ihr leidenden Menschen weisen alle Zeichen einer Abhängigkeitsstörung auf. Es wird daher vorgeschlagen das pathologische Spielen und Wetten in den ICD–11 den Abhängigkeitserkrankungen zuzuordnen und nach folgenden Kriterien zu diagnostizieren: 1. Ein starker Wunsch oder eine Art Zwang zu spielen bzw. zu wetten. 2. Verminderte Kontrollfähigkeit bezüglich des Beginns, der Beendigung und der Dauer des Spielens bzw. Wettens. 3. Auftreten eines Entzugssyndroms bei Beendigung oder Reduktion des Spielens bzw.

      "abstract": "Abstract: The negative symptoms of schizophrenia represent an impairment of normal emotional responses, thought processes and behaviors, and include blunting or flattening of affect, alogia/aprosody, avolition/apathy, anhedonia, and asociality. Negative symptoms contribute to a reduced quality of life, increased functional disability, increased burden of illness, and poorer long-term outcomes, to a greater degree than positive symptoms. Primary negative symptoms are prominent and persistent in up to 26% of patients with schizophrenia, and they are estimated to occur in up to 58% of outpatients at any given time. Negative symptoms respond less well to medications than positive symptoms, and to date treatment options for negative symptoms have been limited, with no accepted standard treatment. Modest benefits have been reported with a variety of different agents, including second-generation antipsychotics and add-on therapy with antidepressants and other pharmacological classes. Recent clinical research focusing on negative symptoms target novel biological systems, such as glutamatergic neurotransmission. Different approaches include: enhancing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor function with agents that bind directly to the glycine ligand site or with glycine reuptake inhibitors; influencing the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR2/3) with positive allosteric modulators; and stimulating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In conclusion, the lack of clearly efficacious pharmacological treatments for the management of negative symptoms represents a significant unmet need, especially considering the importance of these symptoms on patient outcomes. Hence, further research to identify and characterize novel pharmacological treatments for negative symptoms is greatly needed.

      "title": "Change In Mental Status",
      "abstract": "The evaluation and management of altered mental status are broad and require careful history and physical examination to eliminate life-threatening situations. Changes in consciousness can be categorized into changes of arousal, the content of consciousness, or a combination of both. Arousal includes wakefulness and/or alertness and can be described as hypoactivity or hyperactivity, while changes in the content of consciousness can lead to changes in self-awareness, expression, language, and emotions .Changes in mental status can be described as delirium (acute change in arousal and content), depression (chronic change in arousal), dementia (chronic change in arousal and content), and coma (dysfunction of arousal and content) . Delirium is typically an acute confusional state, defined by impairment of attention or cognition that usually develops over hours to days. Some patients may experience rapid fluctuations between hypoactive and hyperactive states, that may be interjected with periods of intermittent lucidity. A nearly pathognomonic characteristic of delirium is sleep-wake cycle disruption, which leads to “sundowning,” a phenomenon in which delirium becomes worse or more persistent at night .Depression is characterized by personal withdrawal, slowed speech, or poor results of a cognitive test. Patients rarely have a rapid fluctuation of symptoms and are usually oriented and able to follow commands . Dementia is a slow, progressive loss of mental capacity, leading to deterioration of cognitive abilities and behavior. There are multiple types of dementia, but the most common are idiopathic (also referred to as Alzheimer disease) and vascular dementia. Idiopathic dementia is defined by the slow impairment of recent memory and orientation with remote memories and motor and speech abilities preserved. As the disease progresses, patients exhibit decreased performance in social situations, the inability to self-care, and changes in personality. Vascular dementia is similar to Alzheimer disease, although patients may have signs of motor abnormalities in addition to cognitive changes, and may exhibit a fluctuating step-wise decline, as multiple vascular events have an additive effect on the patient’s function .Coma is a complete dysfunction of the arousal system, in which patients do not respond to basic stimuli but often retain brain stem reflexes .",

      "title": "Anxiety in older adults often goes undiagnosed.",
      "abstract": "Anxiety disorder in the elderly is twice as common as dementia and four to six times more common than major depression. Anxiety is associated with poorer quality of life, significant distress and contributes to the onset of disability. Mortality risks are also increased, through physical causes, especially cardiovascular disease, and suicide. Diagnosing anxiety disorders in older adults remains a challenge because of the significant overlap in symptoms between physical disorders (shortness of breath; abdominal and chest pain; palpitations) and depression (disturbed sleep; poor attention, concentration and memory; restlessness). Good history taking is crucial in elucidating whether the complaint is of new onset or a recurrence of a previous disorder. The presence of comorbid depression should be clarified. If present, its temporal relationship with the anxiety symptoms will indicate whether there is an independent anxiety disorder. A medication review is warranted, as a number of drugs may be causative (calcium channel blockers, alpha- and beta-blockers, digoxin, L-thyroxine, bronchodilators, steroids, theophylline, antihistamines) or may cause anxiety in withdrawal (e.g. benzodiazepines). Substance and alcohol abuse should be excluded, as withdrawal from either may cause anxiety. A new or exacerbated physical illness may be related to anxiety. Medical investigations will help clarify the extent to which a particular somatic symptom is the result of anxiety.",

Depression is a serious mental disorder that manifests with depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, low energy, and poor concentration. Mania is the opposite of depression; it is a state of abnormally elevated or irritable mood, arousal, and/or energy levels.

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

Although not frequently reported, they might significantly affect the lives of people with SUD. For instance, chorea, tics, and stereotypies are hyperkinetic movements reported in people taking amphetamines. Symptoms usually manifest within the first hours of drug use, subsiding thereafter. In some patients, however, movement disorders can have a chronic course, persisting even after the end of amphetamine misuse. This chapter reports the diversity of movement disorders in SUD and their clinical implications, focusing on the manifestations outside the intoxication phase.",

      "title": "The Neuropharmacology of Sleep Disorders: Better Sleeping Through Chemistry?",
      "abstract": "Sleep and wake states involve interaction among many brain centers via multiple neurotransmitters, including dopamine, norepinephrine, hypocretin, acetylcholine, histamine and serotonin (wake promoting), and γ amino butyric acid (GABA) and melatonin (sleep promoting). Most medications for insomnia or hypersomnia act on elements of these neural systems. Initial treatment of insomnia includes sleep hygiene measures. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia is useful. Medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration for insomnia act on GABA receptors or on melatonin receptors. A frequent cause of insomnia is restless legs syndrome, which is linked to reduced dopaminergic activity in brain structures; idiopathic restless legs syndrome is best treated with dopamine agonists such as ropinerole or pramipexole. Excessive daytime sleepiness is most often due to insufficient sleep hours or sleep apnea but is also caused by medications, illnesses, narcolepsy, or idiopathic hypersomnia. Stimulants generally act through enhanced dopamine action (amphetamines, methylphenidate) or acetylcholine action (caffeine). Modafinil may act through enhanced central histamine, hypocretin, and possibly dopamine action. A newer agent, γ -hydroxybutyrate (GHB), acts on GABA and GHB receptors to consolidate sleep, improving daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy. Improving knowledge of sleep/wake mechanisms should lead to more specific and rational treatments for sleep disorders.",

Changes in energy levels, sleep patterns, ability to focus, and other features can dramatically impact a person’s behavior, work, relationships, and other aspects of life. Most people experience mood changes at some time, but those related to bipolar disorder are more intense than regular mood changes, and other symptoms can occur. Some people experience psychosis, which can include delusions, hallucinations, and paranoia. Objectives Through this research we aimed to identify all the special features of bipolar depression which will help the clinical psychiatrists in easier diagnosis and management of the disorder. Methods Literature review (PubMed) Results Clinical Characteristics in Favour of Bipolarity in Depression: psychomotor retardation, history of psychotic depression,history of psychotic depression shortly after giving childbirth, frequent catatonic symptoms, atypical depressive features, severe impairment in interpersonal relationships, inconsistency in business life, history of hypomania, mania or mixed episode,common feeling of numbness and anhedonia; less common sadness and feelings of guilt, mood instability, volatility in temperament, frequent change in affect, daydreaming during the episode and daily life, short duration of depression &lt;3 months, poor cognitive functions during depressive episode, generally similar symptom severity during the day and night etc. Conclusions This leads to misdiagnosis of bipolar depression as unipolar depression, which in turn leads to delayed correct diagnosis and treatment and may severely affect the patient’s entire life.

      "title": "“This Is Not the Original Timeline”: A Case Report of an Extended Dissociative Episode in a Healthy Young Male Accompanied with Severe Decline in Mental State",
      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

Accidental poisoningThis is usually a problem of the young child or toddler, with a mean age of presentation of 2.5 years.Accidental poisoning usually occurs when the child is unsupervised, and there is an increased incidence in poisoning following recent disruption in households, such as a new baby, moving house or where there is maternal depression. Intentional overdoseSuicide or parasuicide attempts are usually made by young people in their teens; however, sometimes they may be as young as 8 or 9 years old.These children or adolescents should undergo psychiatric and social assessment. Drug abuseAlcohol and solvent abuse are among the commonest forms of drug abuse in children. Iatrogenic drugsThe commonest offender is diphenoxylate with atropine (Lomotil).This combination is toxic to some children at therapeutic doses.The most frequently fatal drug is digoxin. Deliberate poisoningRarely, symptoms are induced in children by adults via the administration of drugs.A history of poisoning will often not be given at presentation.

      "abstract": "A neuropsychiatric and -psychological update of the crime \"profile\" and \"signature\" is a necessary addition to the traditional sociopsychological model likely to miss limbic system dysfunctioning. Thus, occurrence of a brief (c. 20 minutes) limbic seizure has been proposed based on behaviors of 12 white male homicidal loners, who showed a dozen symptoms and signs: Limbic Psychotic Trigger Reaction. Readily overlooked can be (a) a transient psychosis (hallucinations and/or delusions), (b) autonomic hyperactivation (e.g., loss of bladder control, nausea, ejaculation), (c) motiveless, out-of-character, unplanned, and well-remembered homicidal acts, (d) committed with a flat affect (not emotionally or impulsively provoked), (e) typically involving a stranger who happened to provide an objectively harmless and only subjectively important stimulus. (f) Such an individualized stimulus triggered the memory revival of mild to moderate but repeatedly experienced hurts. Such a specific sequence of events implicates the specific mechanism of limbic seizure, \"kindling,\" which does not necessarily involve motor convulsions. Repetition of such limbic episodes with \"criminal acts\" is conceivable under specific circumstances including cases in which the triggering stimulus is associated with pleasurable delusions (e.g., of grandiose power or wealth) or constitutes a specific aspect of a basic drive motive. For example, eating or sexual activities might be planned but degenerate into a limbic episode with a specific core symptomatology.",

The 1-hour time period described in the definition refers to the duration of the terminal event leading to cardiac arrest. Following cardiac arrest – the clinician's synonym for sudden death, biological death may ensue within minutes, or alternatively, due to community-based interventions and life support systems, may be delayed for a long period of time and even aborted altogether.

Alcohol Related Emergencies: It is maladaptive behavior after the recent consumption of alcohol. Blood serum alcohol levels range from 10-20 mg/dl in patients who have pathological intoxication to 400- 500 mg/dl or more in patients who are obtunded or near death. Others include:- Delirium Tremens, Psychiatric Emergencies in Disaster Survivors, Rape and Sexual Abuse etc.",

      "abstract": "A 23-year-old male patient, complaining of insomnia for the last two years, has been unresponsive to several trials of sedatives and hypnotics.Moreover, he has experienced multiple fluctuating symptoms of dysphoric mood, isolation, anhedonia, and easy provocation; accordingly, he was prescribed a dosage of escitalopram (20 mg/day per day) and quetiapine (50 mg/day), at night.Later, the symptoms were resolved, except for insomnia.Consequently, other trials of psychotropic medication were received, without any improvement till he presented with delusion of persecution, auditory hallucinations (second person with ordering type), television broadcasting, and depersonalization.At that time, olanzapine 20 md/day, in addition to depakine chrono (500 mg, BID) and risperidone (2 mg/day), were prescribed; but, he showed minimal improvement.This case indicates that a possibility of insomnia, to be the prodromal symptom for psychosis, should be given considerable attention in young patients, with resistant insomnia.",

Three additional criteria from the following seven items should also be present: a chronological relationship of pruritus with one or several life events that could have psychological repercussions; variations in intensity associated with stress; nocturnal variations; predominance during rest or inaction; associated psychological disorders; pruritus that could be improved by psychotropic drugs; and pruritus that could be improved by psychotherapies.",

      "title": "Management of Acute Onset Catatonia Postpartum in a Patient With a History of Major Depressive Disorder With Psychotic Features: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

      "abstract": "Clarithromycin-induced psychosis is a rare phenomenon; however, over the previous two decades, there has been increasing evidence linking psychotic episodes to the use of clarithromycin. The exact aetiology of this remains unclear, but several key hypotheses have arisen, including gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA-A) antagonism and active clarithromycin metabolites altering brain neurotransmitters such as glutamate. Recent evidence describes a broad range of symptoms, including delusions and catatonic states. Prior psychiatric comorbidities are a substantial risk factor. This case report describes the development of clarithromycin-induced psychosis in an 86-year-old patient with no prior psychiatric medical history, cognitive or functional impairment, and no other pathology found accountable for this neuropsychiatric disturbance. By acknowledging this rare adverse effect of clarithromycin and discontinuing the drug, the patient's psychotic symptoms resolved within 24 hours. Given the widespread use of clarithromycin, this case report demonstrates the importance of being aware of its rare neuropsychiatric adverse effects to diagnose this relatively unusual presentation.",

      "title": "Catatonia and Alcohol Withdrawal: A Complex and Underestimated Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Aims: Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by alterations in motor behavior, vigilance, thought and mood. Catatonia syndrome occurs in many neuropsychiatric and medical conditions, but it is very rarely mentioned as occurring during alcohol withdrawal. We think that this co-occurrence could be underestimated in clinics because alcohol withdrawal symptoms may distract from its identification. Methods: We report the case of a patient presenting with catatonia during the benzodiazepine reduction period of alcohol detoxification. Results: A 65-year-old woman presented with a 15-year history of alcohol dependence and developed catatonic episodes several times during alcohol withdrawal treatment. Misdiagnosis delayed specific treatment. Symptoms of episodes dramatically improved 48 h after treatment with diazepam and revealed an anxiety disorder. Conclusion: This report confirms that catatonia is a non-specific response to psychological, physical and psychosocial stress factors. Recent alcohol withdrawal may sensitize the patient to benzodiazepine withdrawal catatonia, and this phenomenon is probably underestimated. Catatonia Rating Scales can be useful when diagnosis is complicated as in alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal. In that situation, misdiagnosis is common and may delay specific treatment.",

(1) Bipolar and unipolar depression display similar symptoms, making correct diagnosis difficult. The differential diagnosis is especially problematic in patients suffering a first major depressive episode, when there is no clear history of mania or hypomania. Nevertheless, bipolar depression does have telltale signs--remembered with the mnemonic WHIPLASHED--to guide diagnosis. (2-8) Worse or wired when taking antidepressants. The patient complains of feeling antsy or being agitated or unable to sleep when taking traditional antidepressants. Look for numerous failed antidepressant trials, apparent tolerance to antidepressants that does not resolve with increased dose, and antidepressant-induced mania or mood cycle acceleration. Hypomania, hyperthymic temperament, or mood swings in a patient's history. Patients with hyperthymic temperament show persistent traits such as intense optimism, increased energy, reduced need for sleep, extroversion, and overconfidence. Ask about periods of elevated mood or energy that might not fit formal DSM-IV-TR criteria for hypomania--such as episodes that last only a day or two. Mood lability in younger patients can be especially dramatic and poorly demarcated. Irritable, hostile, or mixed features. Some patients show one or more hypomanic features, such as racing thoughts when depressed. Psychomotor retardation appears more common in bipolar I depression than in unipolar major depression. Psychomotor agitation, however, is more likely in bipolar II than in unipolar major depression. Loaded family history of mood swings, frank bipolar disorder, or affective illness. A family history of comorbid mood disorder and alcoholism may also point to bipolarity.

Slowing of the heart rate and weight gain are distinguishing features of tobacco withdrawal. Although nicotine withdrawal may not produce medical consequences, it lasts for several weeks and can be severe in some smokers. Like most other drug withdrawals, nicotine withdrawal is time‐limited, occurs in non‐humans, is influenced by instructions/expectancy and abates with replacement therapy and gradual reduction. Unlike some other drug withdrawal syndromes, protracted, neonatal or precipitated withdrawal does not occur. Whether nicotine withdrawal is associated with tolerance, acute physical dependence, greater duration and intensity of use, rapid reinstatement, symptom stages, cross‐dependence with other nicotine ligands, reduction by non‐pharmacological interventions and genetic influences is unclear. Whether nicotine withdrawal plays a major role in relapse to smoking has not been established but this is also true for other drug withdrawal syndromes.",

Notably, behavioral sensitization persists for weeks or months after a moderate treatment regimen of repeated psychostimulant administration (2,4). The relative permanence of behavioral sensitization has resulted in frequent use of behavioral sensitization as an animal model of addiction, specifically the enduring changes in behavior that are associated with a diagnosis of psychostimulant addiction, such as the development of craving-mediated drug seeking and paranoia (5, 6).",

      "abstract": "Approximately 10% of the U.S. population 12 years and older reported using illicit substances in 2015. This article reviews the clinical effects and treatment of persons who use cocaine, methamphetamines, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), synthetic cannabinoids, and synthetic cathinones (\"bath salts\"). Cocaine blocks the reuptake of the monoamine transporters dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Immediate clinical effects include increased energy and euphoria, as well as hypertension and arrhythmias. Acute myocardial infarction, seizures, hallucinations, hyperthermia, and movement disorders are among the possible adverse effects. Like cocaine, methamphetamine blocks reuptake of monoamine transporters, but also stimulates dopamine release and has a longer duration of action. Methamphetamine misuse is associated with severe dental problems. MDMA is a stimulant and psychedelic with a chemical structure similar to serotonin. Adverse effects include serotonin syndrome, hyponatremia, long-term memory impairment, and mood disorders. Synthetic cannabinoids can have a more intense and long-lasting effect than natural cannabis. Acute intoxication may cause severe cardiac and respiratory complications and seizures. Synthetic cathinones are marketed as cheap substitutes for other stimulants. Their effects are similar to those of other stimulants, and they are addictive. Psychosocial intervention is the main form of treatment for addiction to these substances. Promising therapies include disulfiram and substitution therapy for cocaine misuse disorders, and mirtazapine for methamphetamine use disorder.",

      "title": "Overreaching/Overtraining",
      "abstract": "Are you struggling with your exercise/conditioning routine or feeling a bit washed out, stale, and drained? Perhaps your muscles are persistently feeling heavy, stiff, a bit sore, and your exercise program has ceased to be enjoyable. If so, you may be suffering from a condition referred to as \"overreaching\" or, in more severe cases, \"overtraining syndrome.\" Overreaching is broken into functional and nonfunctional states, both of which respond to extra rest. Nonfunctional overreaching leads to a more extended period of decreased performance than functional overreaching and is accompanied by neuroendocrine and/or psychological symptoms. Overtraining is considered severe nonfunctional overreaching that results in a prolonged performance decrement (>2 months) and more severe symptoms. Effective conditioning requires a balance between intense training sessions and periods of rest/recovery. Too much overload and/or not enough recovery can result in both physiological and psychological symptoms that limit performance and may cause one to cease participation in a previously enjoyable activity. In many noncompetitive exercisers, the condition is often the result of inadequate rest/recovery because of busy work lives, family, work and health stressors, meal skipping, and poor sleep. Exercise can become addictive because of the effects of endorphins, dopamine, and other exercise-generated factors on the brain. This addiction can easily result in frequent intense training sessions that are not interspersed with adequate recovery periods. This phenomenon, especially when combined with the increasing popularity of intense multievent endurance competitions and intense group training programs, places individuals at increased risk for developing a nonfunctional state and, in more severe cases, overtraining syndrome. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS More than 125 signs and symptoms have been identified in published literature, making a definitive diagnosis challenging. The most common symptoms include: • Persistent heavy, stiff, and sore muscles • Persistent fatigue, washed-out feeling • Decreased performance and ability to maintain the training regimen • Increased susceptibility to infections, colds, headaches • Nagging and somewhat chronic injuries • Sleep disturbances • Decreased mental concentration and restlessness • Increased irritability • Depression • Tachycardia and, in some cases, bradycardia • Loss of appetite and weight loss • Bowel movement changes • Absence of menstruation TREATMENT AND PREVENTION The primary treatment is rest and, with more severe cases, an extended break from training. Improved quality of sleep, appropriate nutrition and hydration, and addressing nonexercise stressors are essential for full recovery. In some cases, your physician may choose to rule out other potential organic causes related to a variety of illnesses and health conditions. Prevention of nonfunctional overreaching and overtraining is critical to continued enjoyment of and benefit from your exercise training program. Following are a few key tips: • Listen to your body and take extra recovery time as indicated. • Follow the 10% rule; don't increase training volume and/or intensity by more than 10% at a time. • Follow a periodization format; intersperse periods of intense/high-volume training with extended periods of rest/recovery and/or cross-training. • Recovery/rest between intense workouts is critical because this is when muscle tissue repair and growth occur; usually 24 to 72 hours depending on the intensity and volume of the session. • You shouldn't feel wiped out following a hard workout; you should feel like you could do more; if not, you are doing too much. • Proper nutrition and hydration are important; consulting a sports dietician may be helpful. • Quality sleep is essential. • Variety in your training is healthy; don't do the same thing all the time. Maintaining a training log can be helpful in identifying periods of overreaching and the need for extra recovery. Include variables such as your resting heart rate, sleep, weight (for weight loss), mood, workout intensity/duration, and how muscles and joints respond. With appropriate recovery and using a periodization plan for your long-term training, you will be able to minimize the risk of overtraining and keep your exercise and competitions fun and enjoyable.",

      "abstract": "Background: Sleep is vital for adolescents’ physical and emotional development; however, sleep disturbances and disorders frequently occur in this age group and affect their health and well-being. In this review, we investigated the prevalence, etiology, diagnosis, clinical characteristics, and treatment of sleep disorders observed among adolescents.Current Concepts: The diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder among adolescents include difficulties in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or waking up too early and feeling unrefreshed, which are observed at least 3 days per week over 3 or more months. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia typically includes identifying and addressing negative thoughts and behaviors associated with sleep and establishing a consistent sleep-wake schedule. Delayed sleep phase syndrome is diagnosed in individuals in whom sleep onset and wake times are persistently delayed by 2 or more hours beyond the desired or existing sleep schedule, which leads to excessive daytime sleepiness or impaired functioning. Behavioral interventions comprise sleep hygiene education, relaxation techniques, and phototherapy. Symptoms such as pronounced snoring, apnea observed by others, and gasping or pauses in breathing during sleep may indicate sleep apnea. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy is an effective treatment strategy for sleep apnea. A history of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy suggests narcolepsy, and treatment options include pharmacotherapy, behavior modification, and lifestyle adjustments. Restless leg syndrome treatments include behavioral therapy, as well as anticonvulsant and dopamine receptor agonist administration.Discussion and Conclusion: Addressing sleep disorders is important to promote optimal health and well-being of adolescents and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Early detection, accurate diagnosis, and individualized treatment improve sleep and overall health outcomes and promote academic and social success.",

      "title": "Catatonia",
      "abstract": "Catatonia is a clinical syndrome characterized by a range of psychomotor abnormalities. It was first described in 1875 by Kahlbaum (1) who reported 25 patients with a \"brain disease\" characterized by four of the following signs: long periods of immobility, mutism alternating with verbigeration, staring, withdrawal and refusal to eat or drink, negativism, posturing and grimacing, echolalia, echopraxia, stereotypy, and waxy flexibility (see Table 1). Kahlbaum observed that these otherwise immobile patients could become very agitated or excited and were often found to have extremes of mood disturbance in the form of \"melancholy\" or \"mania.\" This phenomenon of marked, polar alterations in the predominant psychomotor state eventually led to division of the syndrome into retarded and excited types (2). The excited form has been much more difficult to characterize and distinguish from mania (3). In rare instances, patients with severe motor excitement develop fever, autonomic disturbances, stupor, and rhabdomyolysis and may succumb to cardiovascular collapse. This clinical state has been referred to as lethal or malignant catatonia (4,5) and the clinical and laboratory similarities to neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has generated considerable interest and discussion (6,7).",

The most common cause of NAS are opioids such as heroin, codeine and morphine and is commonly termed as opioid withdrawal syndrome but also other legally or illegally sold substances over the counter can contribute to this syndrome. Infants also develop some kind of addition in the womb when exposed to some antidepressants such as barbiturates and benzodiazepine. There are two kinds of NAS that exist, prenatal NAS which is as a result of the termination of medication being used with a pregnant mother and postnatal NAS which occurs as a result of the termination of drugs directly to the infant. The most frequently occurring syndrome consists of tremor, insomnia, perspiration, Common syndrome according to the frequency includes tremor, high-pitched sneezing sound, increased muscle tone, regurgitation and emesis, loose stools, s, excoriation, mottling, nasal congestion low-grade fever, and tachypnea. Opioid withdrawal symptoms can be a reflection of other symptoms of other conditions in a new-born, such as infections, hypoglycaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypothyroidism, and brain complications (eg., cerebral palsy). The need and time frame of treatment is reduced by breastfeeding. All NAS babies need to be followed up regularly. Not all infants will require treatment with pharmacotherapy, but all should receive non-pharmacologic interventions.

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a clinical syndrome characterized by psychomotor, neurological and behavioral changes. The clinical picture of catatonia ranges from akinetic stupor to severe motoric excitement. Catatonia can occur in the setting of a primary psychiatric condition such as bipolar disorder or secondary to a general medical illness like autoimmune encephalitis. Importantly, it can co-occur with delirium or coma. Malignant catatonia describes catatonia that presents with clinically significant autonomic abnormalities including change in temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate. It is a life-threatening form of acute brain dysfunction that has several motoric manifestations and occurs secondary to a primary psychiatric condition or a medical cause. Many of the established predisposing and precipitating factors for catatonia such as exposure to neuroleptic medications or withdrawal states are common in the setting of critical illness. Catatonia typically improves with benzodiazepines and treatment of its underlying psychiatric or medical conditions, with electroconvulsive therapy reserved for catatonia refractory to benzodiazepines or for malignant catatonia. However, some forms of catatonia, such as catatonia secondary to a general medical condition or catatonia comorbid with delirium, may be less responsive to traditional treatments. Prompt recognition and treatment of catatonia are crucial because malignant catatonia may be fatal without treatment. Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with malignant catatonia, intensivists should familiarize themselves with this important and under-recognized condition.",

Patients were divided into two groups depending on the form of alcohol abuse: 1) periodic (drunk), 2) permanent. Alcohol dependence with a drunken form of alcohol abuse was characterized by the presence of more than one spontaneous or socially conditioned remission (more than one month of sobriety) for a year, a short period of hard consumption of alcohol before the development of a psychotic disorder, a shorter period or no control period of consumption alcohol. On the contrary, in patients with permanent drinking, in some cases, up to the development of a psychotic episode, patients could independently stop drinking. Psychotic disorders were more often observed in patients with the periodic (drunk) form of alcohol abuse. A provoking factor in the development of psychotic disorders (the presence of somatoneurological) disease, was more often more signifi cant in the group of patients with permanent form of alcohol abuse. In the case of a drunken form of alcohol abuse, more expressive vegetative signs of withdrawal syndrome (tachycardia, arterial hypertension, hyperhidrosis) were noted in the structure of the of alcoholic delirium. These patients had more expressive aff ective (mostly anxiety) and psychomotor agitation. Productive psychotic symptomatology (delusion, hallucinations) had a more signifi cant eff ect on the behavior of patients with a drunken form of alcohol abuse. In patients with permanent alcohol abuse, visual hallucinations were more often associated with tactile hallucinations. In this group, a prolongation of the psychotic disorder occurred more frequently due to the exacerbation of somatoneurological diseases, which often had at these patients.",

      "title": "Lithium for Bipolar Disorder: A Re Emerging Treatment for Mood Instability: Low Dosage, Slow Titration Might Mitigate Side Effects",
      "abstract": "Lithiwn is among the most effective therapies for bipolar disorder (BD), and enthusiasm for this simple molecule is waxing. The history of lithium is fascinating, (1) and recent considerations include that this element, the third on the periodic table, has few, if any, industry champions. The recent renaissance is caused by a groundswell of appreciation for the clinical efficacy of lithium and an increasing number of providers who are willing to manage patients with lithium. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Target: Bipolar disorder The target illness for lithium is BD, a spectrum of mood disorders with characteristic features of unstable mood and affect. Shifts in mood include recurrent episodes of mania, which are pathologically energized states with misguided volition and behavior with intoxicating euphoria (or irritability).(2) Psychomotor activity is elevated and out of character; speech and body movements are revved up, with a diminished need for sleep. The social, personal, and vocational consequences often are disastrous. The most common mood state of BD is depression. Depressive episodes consist of pathologically compromised energy and volition with a slowing of bodily functions, most prominently cognition and concentration; a pervasive depressed or sad mood is common but not always present. Presence of mixed states, when features of depression and mania are present simultaneously, is one of the many challenges of treating BD; an elevated volitional or energized state may occur with a depressed, dysphoric mood. Evidence for lithium Efficacy studies of lithium have focused on managing mood disorders, treating mania and depression, and prevention or maintenance care. (3) Most were performed during the 1970s and 1980s, (3) but recent studies have been comparing lithium with other mood stabilizers (4-7) and searching for a genetic basis for lithium response.(8-10) Other researchers have examined the use of lithium to prevent suicide. (11) Some have suggested a neuroprotective effect of lithium, which may have profound implications for neuropsychiatry if valid. (12-14) Results of additional studies, which are at different stages of completion, will clarify lithium use, (15), (16) and characterize the genetic makeup of individuals who respond to lithium. (17) The primary evidence for lithium, however, is for maintenance treatment of BD and for preventing manic and depressive episodes. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Biochemistry and physiology of lithium. rhe biochemical and physiological effects pf lithium are complex, wide-ranging, ind likely to affect hundreds, if not thou-;ands, of genes and gene products. The mechanisms of action remain a focus of aca-lemic pursuit (for a review of hypotheses 7elated to these mechanisms see Goodwin and Jamison(2) and Can et al (18)) Lithium is involved in cell signaling pathways that involve complex molecular mechanisms of inter- and intracellular communication; (19) some neural receptors are down-regulatee (20) and others show inhibition (21) which is thought to be a mechanism of lithium. The hypothesized neuroprotective effect of lithium (22) may be mediated through an increased level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in brain tissue. (14) Recently, investigators using induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons have shown that patterns of calcium-related cell signaling in bipolar neurons are affected specifically by lithium in the culture media. (23) There likely are many mechanisms through which lithium's effects are mediated, including a series of dynamic pathways that vary over time and in reaction to the internal and external environments of the cell and person. The lithium renaissance In the past decade, there has been an increase in interest and use of lithium because clinicians recognize its efficacy and advantages and can monitor serum levels and gauge the patient's response and side effects24 against the lithium level. …",

      "title": "Neurobiological bases for impulsive and compulsive behaviour: Implications for pharmacological and psychological interventions",
      "abstract": "Pathological impulsivity and/or compulsivity charcterize a wide range of mental disorders, including impulse control disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, personality disorders, substance use disorder and behavioural addictions. Impulsivity is a complex, multidimensional personality trait which consists of at least two dimensions: disinhibition (impulsive actions) and impulsive decision-making or impulsive choice, with an underestimation of potentially dangerous consequences (e.g., aggression, pathological gambling, hypersexuality). Compulsivity refers to repetitive, ritualized behaviours that are performed according to a certain rule and in a certain manner, most often in order to reduce anxiety or discomfort. Impulsivity and compulsivity share an inability to stop or delay repetitive behaviour. Over time, impulsive behaviour can become compulsive (when it loses the excitement characteristic), and compulsive behaviour can become impulsive (enhanced by habituation). Many psychiatric disorders include elements of both compulsivity and impulsivity, showing a different predominance during the various stages of the disorder (e.g. in substance use disorder impulsivity usually dominates in the early stages of the disorder, and compulsivity in the later stages). The neurobiological basis for impulsivity and compulsivity may include excitatory neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine and glutamate, or inhibitory neurotransmitters such as serotonin and gama-aminobuteryc acid, as well as dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex and limbic system. Increased activity of the frontal lobes can lead to compulsive disorders, and reduced activity can lead to impulse control disorders. Results of neurobiological studies suggest that there is a hereditary and/or environmentally conditioned predisposition to lower receptor availability of dopamine in the midbrain, a neurotransmitter whose imbalance is involved in behavioural disinhibition and pathological hypersensitivity to time delayed rewards, i.e. discarding the time delay for immediate reward, which is the basis for impulsive behaviour. On the other hand, compulsive behaviour is primarily associated with serotonin dysfunction, but this disregulation may indirectly affect the functioning of the dopaminergic and other neurotransmission systems. This paper presents an overview of clinical and neurobiological similarities and differences in impulsivity and compulsivity through a wide range of mental disorders, with implications for pharmacological and psychological interventions.",

It has long been recognized that physiological arousal is a basic and important factor in health and behavior. Stress has been extensively studied with regard to the increases in arousal that it produces and the adverse effects on health that it can have. In addition, a substantial literature identifies and studies drugs that contribute to arousal. In particular, these include caffeine, which is arguably the single most common source of increments in arousal. Heightened arousal has widespread physiological and behavioral consequences. Increments in arousal are associated with elevations in anxiety, hostility, and irritability; chronically high arousal may contribute to anxiety, somatoform, and depressive disorders, among others.

      "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, characterized by emotional, behavioral, cognitive and/or social disability, is an important condition to those providing mental health treatment worldwide. With no safe level of alcohol consumption found during pregnancy, symptoms at the severe end of the spectrum can be obvious, easily diagnosed and extremely debilitating; at the mild end of the spectrum the disabilities may be subtle, and often attributed to other causes. Common symptomatology in an individual with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders includes: attention problems, impulsivity, mood disorders, conduct and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms, drug and alcohol problems, impaired executive functioning, memory disturbances, learning disabilities, poor social skills and reduced ability to function independently as an adult. Because of the lack of widespread knowledge of this disorder by mental health providers, especially in the absence of mental retardation or dysmorphic features, individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are often not identified as having an organically based mental health, and/or cognitive disorder; thus reduces their ability to qualify for special support services found to improve long-term outcome. Despite the great need for neuropsychiatric treatment research that could lead to improved fetal alcohol spectrum disorders targeted multilevel mental health, and social support services, there is much the mental health professional can provide at this time to improve the lives of these individuals. Accordingly, the mental health community needs to be prepared, as the disorder becomes more widely recognized by affected patients and their families; they will be requesting formal diagnoses and sensitive, creative options to prenatal alcohol related problems in all areas of neuropsychiatric treatment.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation training for adults diagnosed with schizophrenia: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this review is to systematically search, appraise and synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) in the human responses of adults with schizophrenia and no positive symptoms of disease, in any setting, regarding anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, sadness, conversation, and well-being. More specifically, the review will focus on the following question: What is the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation training on anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being in adults with schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is often characterized by a long prodromal phase and a gradual change in psychosocial functioning, with symptoms that could include changes in affect (such as anxiety, irritability and depression), cognition (such as difficulty in concentration or memory), thought content (such as preoccupation with new ideas), physical changes (such as sleep disturbance and loss of energy), social withdrawal and impairment of role functioning.1,2 Anxiety is a prominent symptom, early in the course of schizophrenia, and is viewed both as a co-morbidity and a clinical expression of schizophrenia.3 Anxiety can be a stress factor that worsens existing prodromes or symptoms, leading to a vicious circle of growing stress and increased symptoms.4 Overall, the consequences alone or in combination of these components of anxiety generate a reduced efficiency of behaviour. The anxious individual, in addition to avoiding or escaping from situations, also shows inhibition in many other activities such as establishing contact and performing professional activities outside his/her routine.5,6 The physiological and cognitive aspects can create a vicious circle with negative thoughts leading to sympathetic changes, which are themselves interpreted in a negative way. The result can be a spiraling of anxiety.6 “Stress is an everyday fact of life, and we can't avoid it”.8(p.1) “Nervous tension is a more frequent ailment than the common cold. It is a greater danger because tension can reduce your efficiency, destroy your health and shorten your life”.7(p.1) We consider that day-to-day living confronts the person with a continuous stream of potentially stressful situations. If stress is acknowledged as reasonable, it becomes propulsive, constituting an impulse that causes the individual to make decisions, solve problems, and improve his/her functioning and abilities. In this sense, stress will help motivate the individual to achieve desirable goals, giving some flavor to life and providing an incentive for personal and professional achievement.8,9 We can experience stress from four basic sources: the Environment (the environment besieges you with demands to adjust); Social Stressors (the demands of the different social roles we play); Physiological Sources (transitions affecting our body); and Thoughts (our brain interprets and perceives complex changes in our environment and body, and determines whether they are a problem for us and when to turn to “emergency responses”).8 The anxiety experienced in day-to-day life situations is, therefore, interpreted as a complex set of emotions, and a personality trait or a state of the individual which combines three components: cognitive, vegetative, and motor. The cognitive component relates to all thoughts and feelings developed by someone who is anxious, and relates to what the person states that he/she feels. The vegetative component translates the physiological arousal of the individual when he/she is anxious. This activation is specific to each person so it may present great variability of responses such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, changes in gastric motility, urinary emergency, sweating, and increased muscle tension. The motor component refers to the previously addressed avoidance and escape responses determined by anxiety, limiting the individual's purview expressed through tense postures and different types of unrelaxed activities.5 One way of breaking the anxiety circle would be to reinterpret bodily changes in a positive thoughts form (cognitive approach). Another way would be to use relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation (physiological theory). A third way would be to introduce graded exposure to the feared situation (behavioural approach).6 Relaxation is conceptualized as a complex response class involving motor, visceral, observational responses and verbal behaviour. Motor behaviour involves action of the skeletal muscles. Visceral responding is concerned with homeostatic functions including breathing, temperature, and muscle tension. Observational responses seek out stimuli in the environment (e.g. a quiet park setting) or generate discriminative stimuli (e.g. “seeing” a quiet park setting). Verbal behaviour is concerned with overt or covert vocal behaviour (e.g. “I am tense”) in relation to relaxed behaviour.10 Many relaxation techniques aim to increase awareness of areas of chronic unconscious muscle tension. They often involve a conscious attempt to release and relax during exhalation. Frequently, habituation occurs with repeated exposure, but some people continue to react as if they were seeing this particular stressor for the first time. Mental escape techniques, such as imagery or relaxation therapy, can help decrease arousal, but learning is essential to adaptation. Most relaxation techniques are enjoyable, and many healthy individuals practice them without having particular health problems.11,12 There are two general purposes of tension control: prophylactic and therapeutic. By learning to relax differentially 24 hours a day, a person can increase the likelihood of preventing a stress or tension disorder. For a person already thus victimized, clinical PMR can often ease or eliminate the condition.11 Most relaxation techniques need to be practiced daily. Typically, patients learn a relaxation technique over the course of eight weekly classes, each lasting an hour or so. Between classes, they practice by themselves for 15 to 30 minutes a day. After the course is over, patients are encouraged to continue on their own, though they may take further classes to learn advanced techniques or to maintain group support.12 PMR was originally developed by Edmund Jacobson, and his original method required dozens of sessions where the participant was taught to relax 30 different muscle groups. Training consisted of successive tensing and relaxing of muscle groups, beginning with the upper body and proceeding to the lower parts.13 Based on different sources, we can state that recently there has been a growing interest in relaxation techniques in the multidisciplinary treatment of patient's response to schizophrenia symptomatology. The only existing revision, within this topic, “Progressive muscle relaxation in persons with schizophrenia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials”, aims to assess the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) on psychological distress and anxiety symptoms and on response/remission for people with schizophrenia. The three selected randomized controlled trials (RCT) involved 146 patients, and authors concluded that PMR can acutely reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being. No studies investigated the evidence for PMR as an add-on treatment for psychopathology, or for positive or negative symptoms, or for relapse prevention. This review demonstrates that PMR might be a useful add-on treatment to reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being in persons with schizophrenia. It further demonstrates that PMR may be offered in both acute and chronic inpatient treatment settings.6 The recent research “Acute effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety and subjective well-being in chronic Bulgarian patients with schizophrenia” aimed to provide evidence on the effectiveness of PMR as means of alleviating the state anxiety and psychological distress and a way to increase subjective well-being in chronic patients with schizophrenia. Sixty-four schizophrenia patients underwent two PMR sessions which were offered once a week and lasted approximately 25 minutes13 Results revealed significant decreased state anxiety and psychological stress, and increased subjective well-being within the experimental group, and it is noteworthy that both groups differed significantly in all post-measures. Therefore, this study provides scientific evidence for the use of PMR in patients with schizophrenia in chronic psychiatric settings, offering an easy method to learn healthy alternatives to cope with subjective stress and state anxiety. A recent RCT on effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety aimed to examine the efficacy of a single progressive muscle relaxation session compared with a control condition on state anxiety, psychological stress, fatigue and subjective well-being in patients with acute inpatient schizophrenia. Sixty-four patients were randomly assigned to either a single progressive muscle relaxation session of 25 minutes or a resting control condition with the opportunity to read for an equal amount of time.14 The results show that the 27 PMR group participants showed decreased state anxiety, psychological stress and fatigue and increased subjective well-being. Between-group differences in post scores were found for state anxiety, subjective well-being and psychological stress, but not for fatigue. The authors state that PMR is highly effective in reducing acute feelings of stress and anxiety in patients with schizophrenia. A reduction in stress and state anxiety is associated with an increase in subjective well-being.14 Another recent RCT on efficacy of progressive muscle relaxation training in reducing anxiety assigned 18 randomized patients to experimental and control groups. The experimental group received PMR training and the control group received a placebo intervention. Results show that the anxiety level improvement was significantly higher in the PMR training group after intervention and at follow-up, and the mean Beck Anxiety Inventory score fell from moderate anxiety on the pre-test to normal anxiety on the post-test.15 Therefore, the authors state that PMR training is a potentially effective nursing intervention to reduce anxiety in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, depending on the quality of their mental status at the time of intervention.15 The recent research about development of self-control strategies and stress management aimed to verify the impact of self-control skills and a stress management programme. During nine months, 14 participants with schizophrenia took part in a psycho-educative programme based on the relaxation principles of Jacobson, Shultz, and Desoille.16 Significant differences were found between pre- and post-test evaluations, revealing a decrease in stress levels and an increase in coping strategies, especially related with “self-control”, “assuming responsibility”, and “positive re-evaluation”. Furthermore, it is relevant to comprise all possible limitations of this therapy. Despite the fact that PMR sessions were experienced with satisfaction and wellness, a certain degree of motivation is necessary to embrace the regular use of this technique on a daily or weekly basis. Most publications indicate that adverse events resulting from relaxation techniques seem to be extremely uncommon; however, patients with heart and cardiovascular diseases, as well as patients with psychiatric disorders who present positive symptoms and risk of disorientation or confusion should be treated carefully. Although there already exists a systematic review on this topic, it only includes RCT design studies, and the outcomes of psychological distress and anxiety. In this JBI protocol for Systematic Review, we intend to go beyond that, as defined in the inclusion criteria, and consider any quantitative study design, setting, and outcome that will include all scientific/standardized assessments (questionnaires or scales) of anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being. Thus, this systematic literature review is considered to be timely and relevant.",

The prevalence is significantly higher in people with psychiatric disorders. Insomnia in psychiatric patients may be affected by particular disorders, the illness severity, and the treatment approaches. Mood and anxiety disorders are especially likely to be comorbid with insomnia; however, many other psychiatric disorders increase the probability of sleep disturbances. Insomnia frequently is the first symptom heralding an episode of depression, and it may continue as a residual symptom following the resolution of the mood disturbance. Many different sedating substances and medications have been used with the intention of improving sleep. The insomnia treatment medications currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration comprise a variety of benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics and a single selective melatonin receptor agonist. The prescribing guidelines of the recently approved medications have no implied limitation on their duration of use and specify whether they are indicated for sleep onset and maintenance. There are significant safety concerns or inadequate efficacy evidence for the treatment of insomnia with many alternative pharmacologic strategies, including herbal preparations, over-the-counter antihistamines, and the off-label use of antidepressants and antipsychotics. Advances in understanding the regulation of the sleep–wake cycle now are leading to new pharmacologic targets to treat insomnia and related sleep disorders.",

      "title": "Primary fibromyalgia syndrome: A new holistic approach [abstract]",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Primary fibromyalgia syndrome (PFS) is a psychogenic form of rheumatism characterized by nonspecific persistent chronic pain for at least six months at the trigger points (8 to 30 Trigger Points), short-term memory loss, difficulty concentrating, morning muscle rigidity, restless leg syndrome, cramps, neuro-vegetative disturbance, weakness, change in sleep pattern, anxiety, reactive depression, functional colopathy disturbance, sexual disturbance, persistent low-grade fever, interstitial cystitis, postural instability with vertigo and tinnitus. They present: a)viral etiology from: Epstein-Barr virus with pyscho-somatic substrate. b)Immune factors: inflammatory cytokine IL-1, T.N.F. alpha. c)Organic etiology: alteration of biochemical and morphological markers, metabolic oxidative stress. d)Psychological or traumatic stress : anxiety, reactive depression, panic attacks whiplash. e)Environmental factors : change in electromagnetic fields, geopathic stress, pesticide poisoning with multiple chemical syndrome, mercury poisoning. f)Dietary factors : presence of glutamate in food. g)Gulf war syndrome : 30% of soldiers develop P. F. S. MATERIAL and METHODS: The patient is evaluated from a psychological point of view (psychological trauma), associated with the use of Acetyl-L-Carnitine, Naltrexone hydrocloride low dose and Cell Food-S-Adenosin Methionine. With additional therapies : Mineralogram , Chelation Therapy , Viral Seriology with Labò Live , Micro-immunotherapy (with homeopathic interleukin), Dr. Pierpaoli protocol with the use of vitamins A, D, E, C, Melatonin, Glutathione, Ubiquinone. Protocol: -Infiltration of the Trigger Points, mix of oxygen-ozone (O2O3) concentration 15-10 mcgrg/mL in cycles assessed with the Kinesiology Test (K.T.) -Minor Autohemotherapy (PAET) : concentration 20-15-10 mcgr/mL in cycles (K.T.) -Major Autohemotherapy (GAET) : concentration 20-15-10 mcgr/mL in cycles (K.T.) -Rectal insufflation (R.I.) : concentration 20-15-10 mcgr/mL in cycles (K.T.) From 1988 to 2017, I have treated 900 cases with this method, with the following results : significant symptom remission in the secondary form in around 60-70% of patients treated with infiltration of the Trigger Points and PAET. In more resistant cases, I have used homotoxicology, psychological counseling, Dr. Pierpaoli protocol and micro-immunotherapy RESULTS: These method results in good symptom remission in 50-60% of the cases treated. CONCLUSIONS: In the multi-factor genesis of PFS, an early diagnosis is important to prevent the pain occurring alongside psycho-somatic disturbances, which lead the subject into a reactive-depressive state. In the complex symptom variety, the obtained percentage results have improved with this additional method, as, by alleviating the symptoms, you assure a better quality of life for the patient.",

      "title": "New psychoactive substances—Synthetic stimulants",
      "abstract": "The expression “New Synthetic Stimulants” include classes of psychoactive compounds that share subjective effects in humans such as boosted mood or euphoria, feelings of empathy or compassion, increased sociability and sex drive, perceived increased ability to learn and focus, increased energy and alertness, with unpleasant outcomes like increased blood pressure and heart rate, paranoia or aberrations, decreased appetite, raised body temperature, clenched jaw or grinding teeth, dry mouth, insomnia, hallucinations, and aggressive or violent behavior. Synthetic stimulants act in the brain by increasing concentrations of neurotransmitters, mainly dopamine and serotonin. Dopamine is involved in attention, reward, and motivation whereas serotonin is involved in generating feelings of happiness and pleasure. Synthetic stimulants act on the two brain systems to different extents, accounting for their range of effects. Noradrenaline release is also stimulated by these compounds, but to a minor degree. In any case, long‐term use of synthetic stimulants exhausts dopamine and serotonin systems in the brain. The nerve cells become desensitized to the drugs, which makes them resistant to the brain's own signaling molecules. This leads to tolerance and dependence, which can easily turn into addiction. Like classic stimulants (e.g., cocaine, methamphetamine), new synthetic stimulants can be highly addictive. This article is categorized under: Toxicology &gt; New Psychoactive Substances",

      "abstract": "Background COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread psychosocial distress. In addition to pandemic associated psychological distress, there is increasing evidence to suggest direct effects of the COVID- 19 virus itself and the subsequent host immunologic response on Central Nervous System manifesting in the form of wide range of neuropsychiatric complications in both acute and post recovery phase. Neuropsychiatric manifestations The data available from similar epidemics of SARS and MERS CoV, revealed common neuropsychiatric manifestations including (a) Neurological: Headache, Impaired sensorium ranging from mild drowsiness to delirium and coma, dysfunction of olfaction and taste sensation, seizures, encephalitis, encephalopathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), acute cerebrovascular events, narcolepsy and other neuromuscular and demyelinating processes (b) Psychiatric: Depressed mood, anxiety, impaired memory and insomnia in acute phase and even in post-illness stage, depressed mood, insomnia, anxiety, irritability, memory impairment, fatigue, traumatic memories and sleep disorder were frequently reported. A diverse group of presentations, increasingly referred to as “long Covid,” is also being described in patients who reported with wide variety of symptoms including disabling fatigue and cognitive difficulties, persisting for many months after acute infection. Psychoneuroimmunology of COVID-19 Though exact neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown , the present available data based on laboratory studies on SARS-CoV-2 and research on its taxonomically similar coronaviruses such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV suggest its potential to enter the CNS via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptors. Other mechanisms causing CNS dysfunction include cytokine driven inflammatory responses and wider systemic effects such as endotheliopathy, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and clotting abnormalities. Additional mechanisms for neuropsychiatric disorders include autoimmunity and psychological trauma of life threatening illness and pandemic related socioeconomic stressors. The relative contributions of these mechanisms to neuropsychiatric sequelae remain largely unknown. Role of psychiatrist Psychiatrist has an important role in not only managing concerns, fears, and misconceptions at the local community and broader public level but also in early identification, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19 related neuropsychiatric manifestations, and hence should be an integral part of COVID-19 treating team. Management The management of neuropsychiatric complications of COVID requires a multidisciplinary team input due to the multisystemic nature of the illness, particularly in severe cases. Adopting bio-psychosocial strategies and judicious use of psychotropic medications is essential for better results. Conclusion Covid-19 is likely to have important neuropsychiatric effects in both the short and longer term. Although the mechanisms to neuropsychiatric complications is still under study, the better understanding will not only augment screening of at-risk individuals but also help in prevention and management of these neuropsychiatric complications.",

      "abstract": "Trichotillomania is categorized as an Impulse-Control Disorder. The following article brings to light that this disorder man not be as rare as some clinicians think. The following discussion delineates Trichotillomania in terms of its descriptive characteristics, onset and course, associated disorders, relationship to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and treatment. Research indicates a combination of psychopharmacology and cognitive-behavioral therapy as the choice of treatment for this disorder. Following the content discussion of Trichotillomania is a transcript of an interview with one of the authors (K. A.) who was previously diagnosed with Trichotillomania. INTRODUCTION Trichotillomania is categorized as an Impulse-Control Disorder and is defined by the following five criteria listed in the DSM-IV (1994): a) recurrent pulling of one's hair resulting in noticeable hair loss, b) an increasing sense of tension immediately before pulling out the hair or when attempting to resist the behavior, c) pleasure, gratification, or relief when pulling out the hair, d) the disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental disorder and is not due to a general medical condition, e) the disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. (p. 621) This article seeks to provide an overview of Trichotillomania in terms of its history and descriptive characteristics, onset and course of illness, associated disorders, its relationship to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and the treatment of choice for Trichotillomania. HISTORY AND DESCRIPTIVE CHARACTERISTICS History In 1889 a French dermatologist, Hallopeau, described a man who pulled out his hair in large amounts (Swedo, 1993). Hallopeau used the term trichotillomania to describe this behavior. Before Hallopeau's encounter with his client, references to hair-pulling had already been documented. In 1779, Baudament reported on a 16-year-old boy who pulled out his hair and actually ate it. Eventually, this ingestion of hair led to gastrointestinal problems because the boy developed hair balls in his stomach (Christenson & Mackenzie, 1994). Once thought to be rare, this disorder is far from uncommon. It has been estimated that approximately eight million Americans are afflicted with this disorder (Azrin & Nunn, 1978). A survey conducted by Rothbaum, Shaw, Morris, and Ninan (1993) revealed that of the 490 college freshman respondents, 10% reported compulsive hair-pulling. Despite these statistics, the literature is very scarce regarding this disorder. Characteristics Trichotillomania is predominately found in the female population. Christenson, Mackenzie, and Mitchell (1991) found that 93% of 60 adult chronic hair-pullers were women. Likewise, Swedo and Leonard (1992) found that 70% of 43 sampled children, adolescents, and adults who were chronic hair-pullers were female. Christenson and Mackenzie (1994) found a more equal sex ratio in children under the age of six. Hair-pulling can occur from many body locations. A study done by Swedo and Leonard (1992) found that the most common area from which hair is pulled is the scalp, followed by eyelashes, eyebrows, pubis, body (arm/leg), and face (beard). Most individuals pluck hair from at least two sites, with sites varying over time. Those diagnosed with this disorder typically think that the hair that is pulled is somehow different from other hair. For example, chronic hair-pullers may pluck kinky or course hair so that they may feel right about their hair, thus reducing anxiety (Swedo & Rapoport, 1991.). After the hair is pulled, other ritualistic acts can follow. For instance, some individuals will play with or twirl their extracted hair, while others may brush it against their cheeks or lips. Some individuals will even go as far as ingesting their hair (trichophagia), possibly leading to gastrointestinal difficulties or even death (Swedo & Leonard, 1992). …",

Perceptual alteration showed some distinct features that were different from acute symptoms of schizophrenia, and was accompanied by mood changes such as severe anxiety and agitation and, in one of the patients, also by extrapyramidal symptoms. Perceptual alteration, as well as mood changes and extrapyramidal symptoms, responded well to an anticholinergic drug, biperiden. Recent studies have shown that SEPA occurred not only in schizophrenic patients but also in patients on long‐term neuroleptic medication for treating other mental disorders. These findings suggest that SEPA is associated with dopaminergic hypoactivity in the brain, which is induced by long‐term neuroleptic medication.",

      "abstract": "Caffeine is the most commonly used psychoactive substance worldwide, being daily consumed by approximately 80% of the world's population. It may be found not only in the form of beverages and food but also as pharmacologic preparations. Caffeine's consumption is implied in many psychiatric manifestations, from anxiety bursts to psychosis. This symptomatic variation is not only dose-dependent but also affected by various individual factors. Caffeine is a methylxanthine that exerts its primary action in the Central Nervous System (CNS) as an antagonist of the adenosine receptors A 1 and A 2A , altering the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and glutamate. It also interferes with olanzapine and clozapine's hepatic metabolism, increasing its seric levels. Caffeinism is considered when the daily dosage of caffeine consumed is 600–750mg. Some studies report that dosages above 750mg/daily may precipitate or exacerbate psychotic symptoms, as well as increase the resistance to neuroleptic treatment. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that patients diagnosed with schizophrenia have significantly larger consumptions of caffeine than other diagnostic groups. Different factors may sustain this, as the relief of side effects due to neuroleptic medication and as a social facilitator.",

One valuable aspect of a definition of alcoholism is that it enables us to answer by scientific enquiry the question of whether or not it is an illness. The kind of disease which those alcoholics who support the disease concept have in mind is something which would describe a condition preceding their drinking, something constitutional, that is to say, present from their earliest days, and therefore likely to be in the nature of a biochemical or psychological abnormality.

      "title": "Pharmacological Treatment of Psychosis",
      "abstract": "Psychotic symptoms may be the primary characteristic of a specific disorder such as schizophrenia, occur secondary to a mood disorder such as major depression, or be due to a known causative factor such as a drug-induced paranoid reaction. Schizophrenia is the best studied disorder in terms of pharmacological treatment, and schizoaffective disorder is often included in these medication trials. Although antipsychotics have often been prescribed for major mood disorders with psychotic features, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has dramatically expanded their approved uses in recent years. Several of these agents are now indicated for bipolar and unipolar disorders, even in the absence of psychosis. Antipsychotics are also often prescribed off-label, but limited data are available to guide their appropriate use. For example, they are widely administered to older patients experiencing behavioral disturbances or psychosis associated with dementia. The potential risks of such off-label use are underscored by an FDA-mandated box warning for all antipsychotics, primarily due to an increased incidence of cardiovascular events and the related morbidity and mortality. Because individuals with schizophrenia may experience subtle changes in behavior and cognition for long periods prior to their first acute psychotic episode, early diagnosis and intervention are increasingly emphasized. Recognition of impending or subtle signs of psychosis and introduction of an antipsychotic to reduce duration of untreated symptoms may have a substantial impact on long-term outcome. For example, a recent meta-analysis found that limiting the duration of untreated psychosis to less than 9 months was associated with a substantially greater reduction in negative symptoms (Boonstra et al. 2012). Imaging studies indicate that during the early years after illness onset, a subset of patients with schizophrenia may demonstrate significant decreases in gray matter and white matter, as well as increases in cerebrospinal fluid (Andreasen et al. 2011). The use of antipsychotic drugs in this population, however, is complicated by conflicting reports of an association between exposure to them and either neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects (Lewis 2011). Although antipsychotic drug therapy is used for several FDA-approved and unapproved indications, the existing evidence base for these medications is strongest for their role in managing multiple-episode schizophrenia, which is the focus of this chapter. (For management of first-episode patients, see Chapter 8, \"Early-Stage Schizophrenia.\") In this chapter, data for both acute and long-term management are considered. Because inadequate response and treatment resistance are common in this population, strategies to augment standard antipsychotics or to serve as alternatives are also reviewed. Throughout the chapter, an emphasis is placed on the value of a risk-benefit assessment that takes into account the substantial safety and tolerability issues associated with this class of psychotropic medications.",

      "title": "Seizure Headaches in Children",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Six children with paroxysmal headaches resulting from seizure disorders are reported. The clinical picture of seizure headaches includes the following features: they are usually diffuse or bifrontal; they begin abruptly at any time and last for minutes or several hours; in the majority of cases they are accompanied by nausea and vomiting and followed by postictal lethargy or sleep; there are no precipitating factors; they respond to anticonvulsants. The factors which differentiate between seizure headache and migraine are discussed. Seizure headache can be the sole clinical manifestation of seizure foci in the limbic system and other parts of the cortex. Some of these patients will have other autonomic phenomena such as pallor and abdominal pain; nearly all have nausea and vomiting. RÉSUMÉ Six cas de céphalées paroxystiques chez l'enfant, provenant de troubles comitiaux sont présentés. L'allure clinique des cephalées critiques présente les caractères suivants: elles sont habituellement diffuses ou bi‐frontales, elles commencent brutalement à n'importe quel moment et durent de quelques minutes à plusieurs heures. Dans la majorité des cas, elles sont accompagnées de nausées et de vomissements et suivies d'une léthargie post‐critique ou de sommeil; il n'y a pas de facteurs annonciateurs; les médications anticomitiales sont actives. Les facteurs qui différencient céphalées critiques et migraines sont discutés. Les céphalées critiques peuvent être la seule manifestation clinique de foyer comitial dans le système limbique et les autres parties du cortex. Quelques sujets présentent d'autres manifestations végétatives telles que pâleurs et douleurs abdominales. Presque tous ont des nausées et des vomissements. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Es wird über sechs Kinder mit paroxysmalen Kopfschmerzen infolge eines Krampfleidens berichtet. Das klinische Bild der Krampf‐Kopfschmerzen bietet folgende charakteristischen Befunde: Die Schmerzen sind gewöhnlich diffus oder bifrontal, sie beginnen abrupt, können zu jeder Zeit auftreten und dauern Minuten bis einige Stunden an. In der Mehrzahl der Fälle klagen die Patienten über Übelkeit, erbrechen und fallen anschliessend in einen postiktalen Dämmerzustand oder Schlaf; es gibt keine ursächlichen Faktoren; die Kopfschmerzen sprechen auf die Behandlung mit Antikonvulsiva an. Auf die unterschiedlichen Befunde bei krampfbedingten Kopfschmerzen und bei Migräne wird ausführlich eingegangen. Krampfebedingte Kopfschmerzen können die einzige klinische Manifestation von Krampffoci im limbischen System und anderen Teilen des Cortex sein. Bei einigen Patienten treten auch andere vegetative Symptome wie Blässe und Bauchschmerzen auf. Nahezu alle Kinder Klagen über Übelkeit und Erbrechen. RESUMEN Se aportan seis casos de niños con cefaleas paroxísticas a consecuencia de enfermedades con crisis agudas. El cuadro clínico de los ataques de cefalea incluye los datos siguientes: son por lo general difusas o bifrontales; empiezan abruptamente en cualquier momento y duran desde minutos a varias horas; en la mayoría de los casos se acompañan de nauseas y vómitos y se siguen de letargia postictal y sueño; no existen factores desencadenantes y responde a los anticonvulsilantes. Se discuten los factores diferenciales entre la crisis de cefalea y la migraña. Los ataques de cefalea pueden ser la única manifestación de crisis focales en el sistema límbico y otros puntos del córtex. Algunos de estos pacientes pueden tener otros fenómenos vegetativos tales como palidez y dolor abdominal; casi todos tíenen nauseas y vómitos.",

      "abstract": "Psychoactive drugs are chemical substances with a distinct physiological effect that changes the function of the brain resulting in a temporary change of perception, mood, consciousness, or behavior. Such substances are often used recreationally, which may consequently lead to mental and/or physical addiction. Psychological addiction is a state of internal coercion for occasional or regular consumption of addictive drugs to create feelings of comfort or to avoid discomfort, and represents a sign of loss of control. Physical dependence is the state of adaptation of the organism to the addictive agent and manifests itself with characteristic disorders of physical and psychological nature at the cessation or significant reduction of the intake of psychoactive substances. There are numerous theories on addiction to psychoactive substances, from biological through socio-cultural to psychological ones. Psychological causes of addiction to psychoactive substances include the cognitive-behavioral theory, the psychodynamic interpretation of addiction, various stressful life events, traumas from early childhood and adolescence, as well as the influence of the family, peers, and the environment on the addict. Although the psychological aspects of addiction are a very important part of a later emergence of addiction to psychoactive substances, by shaping the personality of the addict, very little attention is paid to them in the treatment process. The aim of this work is to briefly consider each of the theories of psychoactive substance dependence, with a particular focus on the psychological aspects, their prevention, and treatment potential. In the end, three recent researches dealing with issues of family influence, stressful life events, and personality traits on later abuse of psychoactive substances are presented.",

      "title": "The Alcohol Drinking History",
      "abstract": "The American Psychiatric Association (DSM-III, 1980) has defined alcoholism and abuse as follows: alcoholism (or dependence) is pattern of pathological use or impairment in social or occupational functioning due to alcohol, and either tolerance or withdrawal. A simplified interpretation of this definition is presented in Figure 91.1. Alcohol abuse is defined as a pattern of pathological use for at least month that causes impairment in social and occupational functioning.Few definitions in medicine have incited as much discussion as that of alcoholism, mainly because excessive drinking may manifest as medical problem (e.g., withdrawal seizures), psychiatric problem (e.g., depression), or social problem (e.g., involvement in an automobile accident). On the other hand, person with single episode of an alcohol-related problem is not necessarily an alcoholic; in such case, the condition may be better termed alcohol abuse.",

      "title": "First-episode psychosis induced by pregabalin withdrawal: a case report",
      "abstract": "Pregabalin is a novel isomer of gamma-aminobutyric acid that functions as a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. It is used daily in medical practice for treating neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, generalized anxiety disorder, and partial seizures. Due to its anti-glutamatergic effects, it poses a potential addiction risk. For example, an abrupt discontinuation of this substance may cause patients to exhibit physical withdrawal symptoms, such as insomnia, nausea, headache, and diarrhoea. However, there is no information in the literature that addresses whether the rapid discontinuation of pregabalin can cause psychosis to occur. Here we presented a 20-year-old patient with his first episode of psychosis that was likely attributable to his withdrawal from a high dosage pregabalin. He lacked physical signs of withdrawal; however, a psychiatric examination was conducted. It was determined that the patient was experiencing paranoid ideation, auditory hallucinations, and mutism. Furthermore, he had engaged in self-mutilative actions and had attempted suicide. Due to the short time frame between the rapid discontinuation of a relatively large dose of pregabalin and the onset of the patient's first episode of psychosis, it is likely that the psychotic episode was triggered by the cessation of the medication. This is the first known case of psychosis that was caused by the rapid withdrawal of pregabalin to be discussed in the literature. The results of this clinical case may guide clinicians to recognize the symptoms of acute pregabalin withdrawal.",

      "title": "Mood Stabilizers in the Treatment of Substance Use Disorders",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Individuals suffering from drug addiction may also manifest features of bipolar spectrum disorders. Hyperthymic and cyclothymic temperaments may render individuals vulnerable to later development of substance abuse. Bipolar disorders themselves may be altered or precipitated by substance use, most notably by stimulants (amphetamines), alcohol, and cannabinoids.The clinical usefulness of mood stabilizers, particularly antiepileptics, has been established as safe and effective in substance abusers with and without comorbid mood disorders. Most studies on this issue have been of short duration and focused on the resolution of a currently manifest period of illness. Few studies have been conducted on the usefulness of these drugs on the long-term longitudinal course of these diseases, such as frequently encountered recurrent relapses into states of agitation, impulsivity, and/or dissatisfaction. As opposed to the clinical experience with traditional antidepressants and neuroleptics, antiepileptics do not induce counter-polar states (depressed patients abruptly turning manic or hypomanic; nor patients currently hypomanic or manic turning abruptly depressed). Many clinicians consider antiepileptic mood stabilizers to be the preferred category of medications for the treatment of such patients. Valproate appears to be a potentially fruitful medication to study in these dual diagnosis patients due to preliminary evidence demonstrating its anticraving efficacy.",

      "title": "A Case of Interdose Discontinuation Symptoms With Venlafaxine Extended Release",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Venlafaxine extended release (XR) is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that, like many other antidepressants, may be associated with a discontinuation syndrome. Discontinuation syndromes are, in part, related to drugs with short half-lives1 (eg, for venlafaxine and its metabolite, 5 and 11 hours, respectively). Venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms have been clinically reported as soon as 6 hours2 and as long as 9 days3 after discontinuation of the drug, but typically emerge in 1–4 days.4 In one study, the prevalence of typical discontinuation symptoms with venlafaxine XR (eg, dysphoria, headaches, nausea, irritability, emotional lability, sleep disturbance) was 27%.5 However, discontinuation symptoms may be severe6,7 in up to 5% of cases.8 In addition, unexpected symptoms may emerge such as “shock-like sensations,”9 gait difficulties,10 palinopsia (persistent visual images),11 delirium,12 suicidal ideation,13 and hypomania14 or mania.14,15 In the following case, we describe a patient who experienced routine venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms within hours of daily dosing.\r\n\r\nCase report. In December 2009, Ms A, a 41-year-old white woman with a history of hypertension and palpitations, was prescribed venlafaxine XR 37.5 mg/d by another primary care provider for the treatment of depression. With a change in primary care providers in January 2011, Ms A promptly discussed her concerns with venlafaxine XR. According to the patient, approximately 2 months after the onset of the venlafaxine XR trial, she began to experience a number of side effects in the absence of any other changes in medication, including nausea, irritability, emotional lability, and, most troublesome, “electrical brain shocks.” Oddly, all of these symptoms occurred on a daily basis, and they consistently emerged approximately 8–10 hours after the administration of the daily dose of venlafaxine XR. Symptoms would then promptly resolve after Ms A took the next dose of venlafaxine XR.\r\n\r\nBecause the patient seemed to be experiencing discontinuation symptoms, she was switched to regular-release venlafaxine 37.5 mg in January 2011, which was dosed twice per day. The regular-release venlafaxine was well tolerated. Within 2 weeks, the patient confirmed that most, if not all, of her symptoms had subsided.\r\n\r\nAlthough discontinuation symptoms from venlafaxine XR have been clinically described by one author in as few as 6 hours after the last dose,2 we are unaware of any actual case reports of venlafaxine XR interdose discontinuation symptoms. This phenomenon may be related to individual genetics and the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system. Specifically, venlafaxine XR is metabolized by the 2D6 isoenzyme, which is subject to broad genetic polymorphism. In this regard, Zhou16 has described 4 genetic variants: ultrarapid metabolizers, extensive metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, and poor metabolizers, which constitute 3%–5%, 70%–80%, 10%–17%, and 5%–10% of white individuals, respectively. It is possible that our patient was an ultrarapid metabolizer and briskly eliminated venlafaxine XR through the 2D6 isoenzyme, resulting in interdose discontinuation symptoms.\r\n\r\nAs for clinical approaches to interdose discontinuation symptoms, venlafaxine XR or regular-release venlafaxine may be dosed twice per day, or a patient might be switched to an antidepressant that is less dependent on 2D6 metabolism, such as sertraline, citalopram, or mirtazapine.17 To conclude, to our knowledge, this is the first case report of interdose discontinuation symptoms with venlafaxine XR.",

      "title": "REVIEW: Behavioural assessment of drug reinforcement and addictive features in rodents: an overview",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Some psychoactive drugs are abused because of their ability to act as reinforcers. As a consequence behavioural patterns (such as drug‐seeking/drug‐taking behaviours) are promoted that ensure further drug consumption. After prolonged drug self‐administration, some individuals lose control over their behaviour so that these drug‐seeking/taking behaviours become compulsive, pervading almost all life activities and precipitating the loss of social compatibility. Thus, the syndrome of addictive behaviour is qualitatively different from controlled drug consumption. Drug‐induced reinforcement can be assessed directly in laboratory animals by either operant or non‐operant self‐administration methods, by classical conditioning‐based paradigms such as conditioned place preference or sign tracking, by facilitation of intracranial electric self‐stimulation, or, alternatively by drug‐induced memory enhancement. In contrast, addiction cannot be modelled in animals, at least as a whole, within the constraints of the laboratory. However, various procedures have been proposed as possible rodent analogues of addiction’s major elements including compulsive drug seeking, relapse, loss of control/impulsivity, and continued drug consumption despite negative consequences. This review provides an extensive overview and a critical evaluation of the methods currently used for studying drug‐induced reinforcement as well as specific features of addictive behaviour. In addition, comic strips that illustrate behavioural methods used in the drug abuse field are provided given for free download under http://www.zi‐mannheim/psychopharmacology.de",

      "title": "3,4-metilenodioximetanfetamina (‘éxtasis’): efectos emocionales y cognitivos a largo plazo y depleción serotoninérgica",
      "abstract": "The main objective of this study is to describe the different neuropsychological deficits associated to the consumption of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'ecstasy'), as well as the growing evidence that attributes these deficits to the selective axonal damage to serotoninergic cells brought about by this substance.MDMA is an amphetamine derivative that, like its precursor, has properties as a stimulant. Part of its chemical structure is similar to that of the hallucinogen mescaline with which it shares the capacity to alter perception. Nevertheless, the primary pharmacological effect of this substance, which is what usually leads to its use and abuse, is chiefly linked to an intense positive emotional state. This effect on the individual's mood is also usually accompanied by numerous feelings of empathy, sociability and closeness, which turn this drug into a powerful entactogenic agent (a term used in psychotherapy to describe a state of wellbeing, closeness and emotional self-awareness produced by certain compounds). The antidepressant and entactogenic effects induced by an acute dose of MDMA can be accounted for by the notable increase in serotonin bioavailability triggered by the drug. Repeated consumption of MDMA, however, ends up affecting many functions that have been related to the serotoninergic systems, such as sleep, appetite, attention and memory, or one's emotional state.Most of the neuropsychological disorders found in individuals who take ecstasy on a regular basis can be explained by the selective neurodegeneration processes that the drug appears to produce in the serotonin terminals of the brain in the long run.",

      "title": "Lacosamide induced aggression in a patient with seizure disorder",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, The commonest psychiatric side effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are aggression and irritability.[1] There are serious behavioral and psychological repercussions caused by the changes in the Gamma Amino Butyric Acid (GABA)-ergic and glutamatergic activity caused by AEDs on certain regions of the brain such as the amygdala, frontal cortex, and hypothalamus.[2] There are modifications in the GABA receptors and GABAergic neurons in an epileptic brain, which cause medications that enhance GABA neurotransmission to potentially trigger or exacerbate aggression, as opposed to their effect of decreasing aggression in subjects without epilepsy.[2] A 23-year-old male patient was admitted to the psychiatry ward with complaints of laughing inappropriately, irrelevant talk, overfamiliarity, over-talkativeness, inappropriate behavior towards women, irritability with the use of abusive language without provocation, and decreased sleep. These complaints have been present intermittently for the last 3 years. The patient was diagnosed with a seizure disorder at 6 months of age. His last seizure was 10 months before admission, after which a significant worsening of symptoms was noted, especially inappropriate laughter, irrelevant talk, and inappropriate behavior with women. Physical examination was unremarkable. Mental Status Examination showed a kempt, cooperative patient, in touch with reality, who laughed without provocation and behaved inappropriately with the examiner, by attempting to undress. During treatment in the hospital, the patient suffered a generalized tonic-clonic seizure in the ward. The neurologist also prescribed a tab of lacosamide (LCM) 100 mg twice daily. After 2 days of starting the patient on LCM, a sudden increase in aggressive behavior was noted, in a patient who previously showed no aggressive behavior in the ward or before admission apart from intermittent irritability. The patient broke the railing of a bed and attacked his mother and doctors in the ward, threw a metal stool in an attempt to injure another patient, and was verbally and physically abusive towards relatives, doctors, and other ward staff, requiring chemical and physical restraint. No such aggressive behavior was observed when the patient was previously on carbamazepine (CBZ) and lamotrigine. The aggression was therefore attributed to the addition of LCM and the same was stopped. Following this, the patient's aggression decreased and then stopped within 72 hours. The patient was discharged on: T. Oxcarbazepine 450 mg twice daily, T. Divalproate 750 mg twice daily, T. Risperidone 2 mg twice daily, and T. Clonazepam 0.5 mg twice daily. On review after a month, his mother reported no aggressive behavior. While the exact mechanism behind behavioral problems that are seen in seizure disorders is still unclear, its occurrence can be attributed to many factors such as the neuropathology of epileptic syndromes, functional damage caused by the seizure, comorbid developmental disorders, anti-epileptic drugs, etc.[3] The changes that occur in the central GABAergic activity due to LCM play a contributory role in drug-induced behavioral changes.[2] The effects of the CBZ, levetiracetam (LEV), perampanel (PER), and LCM on aggression were studied using the Buss–Perry Aggression Questionnaire in 266 consecutive outpatients with epilepsy. The LEV group had a significantly higher aggression score as compared to the CBZ and LCM groups. Based on these results the authors concluded that LEV increased aggression, while CBZ and LCM reduced aggression.[1] Our patient, however, showed the opposite findings. A thorough psychiatric history and any history that indicates a propensity for aggression must be taken from patients and their caregivers. While this may not stop the prescription of anti-epileptic drugs, drugs that are more likely to result in such behavior may be regulated, while also looking out for these side effects that are considered rare. There is limited knowledge on aggression and personality changes caused by using LCM, requiring further investigation to prescribe appropriate anti-epileptic drugs.

      "abstract": "Objetivo: Analisar as características do Transtorno de Estresse Pós-Traumático (TEPT). Revisão bibliográfica: O TEPT é uma doença psicológica que pode surgir depois que uma pessoa experimenta um ou mais eventos traumáticos, como combate militar, trauma físico devido a lesão ou outros acidentes, como violência doméstica, estupro, trauma de infância, negligência ou abuso. Este se manifesta com sintomas dramáticos de hiperexcitação, lembranças memoriais intrusivas, pesadelos e flashbacks somatossensoriais. É frequentemente acompanhado por comorbidades psiquiátricas, como depressão, abuso de substâncias ou transtornos de ansiedade, o que leva a um alto nível de incapacidade funcional. Considerações finais: O TEPT consiste no desenvolvimento de sintomas relacionados ao estressor após um ou mais eventos traumáticos. Seus sintomas geralmente são classificados em três grupos: intrusão, evitação, e excitação com efeitos preponderantes no sono com insônia e pesadelo. O tratamento farmacológico é feito com Inibidores Seletivos de Recaptação de Serotonina ou Inibidores Seletivos de Recaptação de Norepinefrina, cujos efeitos colaterais são bem tolerados. Nesse sentido, é essencial um diagnóstico precoce e um tratamento multidisciplinar com um médico psiquiatra e um psicólogo a fim de minimizar os impactos do transtorno.",

      "title": "Use of Benzodiazepines and Hypnotic Medications in Psychiatry Older Adult Outpatients",
      "abstract": "Benzodiazepines have anxiolytic, hypnotic, anticonvulsant, and muscle-relaxing properties, therefore, a widely prescribed treatment for anxiety and insomnia. They bind to gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors, which are responsible for most of the inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system and these receptors are a major target of alcohol, barbiturates, muscle relaxants, and other medications with sedative effects, resulting in tolerance and dependence [1]. Benzodiazepines are categorized into short (15 to 30 minutes), intermediate (30 to 60 minutes), and long-acting agents (one hour or longer).\r\nBenzodiazepines are frequently prescribed for elderly patients living in the community and for those in hospitals and institutions. Prolonged use of benzodiazepines is particularly likely in old age for the treatment not only of insomnia and anxiety, but also of a wide range of nonspecific symptoms. Long term users are likely to have multiple concomitant physical and psychological health problems [2].\r\nBenzodiazepines produce dependence, reduce attention, memory, and motor ability. They can cause disinhibition or aggressive behavior, facilitate the appearance of delirium, and increase accident and mortality rates in people older than 60 [3].\r\nAccording to Maudsley guidelines, benzodiazepines use in elderly are poorly supported for their link to cognitive decline, increase risk of falls and hip fractures [4]. And, if indicated, short acting agents should be avoided. Long acting agents should be started in low doses and patients need to be followed and reassessed regularly. Zolpidem or melatonin are indicated for insomnia, clonazepam and diazepam for agitation and pregabalin for generalized anxiety disorder [5].",

Outcome can be psychological and physiological disturbances that can slow down progress or even downgrade performance.\r\n Prevalence of the syndrome is higher among professional runners because of setting higher demands on their bodies, indispensable for achieving top results. But syndrome also targets beginners or recreational runners.\r\n Excessive physical overload is considered to be the main cause of overtraining syndrome, but every other psychological and social stressors can atribute. In fact, accumulation of all the stressors causes collapse of the adaptation mechanisms and long term negative symptoms occur. Individual capacity for stress plays an important role in the development of the syndrome.\r\n Diagnosis of the overtraining syndrome is clinical and accomplished through history, which should demonstrate the following: (1) decreased performance persisting despite weeks and months of recovery, (2) disturbances in mood, and (3) lack of signs and symptoms or diagnosis of other possible causes of underperformance.\r\n Recovery last for weeks, often even months.\r\n It is hard to predict which runner will develop overtraining. Therefore, prevention is the key.\r\n Main components of prevention are education and follow up.\r\n Balance between optimal training and recovery is a strategy of success.\r\n Right amount od training overload and enough time to rest will result in an additional motivation, as psychological, and as physiological set out for new triumph.",

      "abstract": "#### The bottom line\n\nDelusional infestation (previously also known as delusional parasitosis or Ekbom’s syndrome) is a rare disorder, but it commonly poses disproportionate practical problems to healthcare systems.1 It is characterised by a patient’s fixed belief that his or her skin, body, or immediate environment is infested by small, living (or less often inanimate) pathogens despite the lack of any medical evidence for this.1 Delusional infestation is neither a single disease nor a single diagnostic entity. The classic form, primary delusional infestation, develops without any known cause or underling illness and meets criteria for a persistent delusional disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision)) or delusional disorder somatic type (DSM-5 ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fifth edition)). Approximately 60% of patients, however, have secondary forms of delusional infestation2 that occur in the context of substance misuse (such as cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis), dopaminergic medications, antibiotics, or during physical or psychiatric illnesses (such as delirium, dementia, depression, schizophrenia, stroke, and other medical conditions that affect the brain or cause pruritus).1 2\n\nThe neurobiology of delusional infestation is not fully understood.

      "abstract": "Abstract Cyclothymic disorder is characterized by two or more years of recurrent and intermittent mood episodes in which the individual oscillates or “cycles” between periods of depression and hypomania, with or without normal periods interspersed between the depressive and hypomanic states. Cyclothymic depressions include symptoms such as sadness, anhedonia, low energy, pessimism, poor concentration, and sleep and appetite changes resembling those observed in episodes of major depression. Cyclothymic hypomanic periods involve symptoms such as euphoria, high energy/activity, talkativeness, high self‐confidence and grandiosity, decreased sleep, and impulsive, reckless behaviors typically observed in mania. However, unlike major depression and mania, both types of cyclothymic mood episodes are of subsyndromal intensity and duration (two to three days on average). Cyclothymic disorder can present as predominantly depressed, predominantly hypomanic, or balanced with approximately equal proportions of high and low periods (Goodwin &amp; Jamison, 1990).",

      "title": "Daytime Drowsiness",
      "abstract": "Drowsiness is common in those with DLB and PDD, and can interfere with thinking and memory, as well as quality of life. There are a variety of potential reasons for this, many treatable. Getting a little sleepy during a boring task or napping after lunch on the weekend is not a sign of a medical problem. However, daytime drowsiness should draw attention in certain circumstances: 1. More than one nap most days, or near-daily naps that span 2 to 3 hours 2. Falling asleep during conversations or eating 3. Frequently falling asleep during reading, watching TV, doing computer work or other vigilant tasks 4. Returning to sleep after breakfast These are signs that could indicate that nighttime sleep was not adequate (nonrestorative) but could have other explanations. Daytime drowsiness has limited causes: 1. Insomnia at bedtime 2. Awakening during the night 3. Insufficient time spent in bed at night 4. Poor quality sleep at night (despite adequate time in bed) 5. Daytime medications inducing drowsiness 6. A primary sleep disorder directly causing drowsiness (which may be DLB or PDD related) We will explore each of these possible causes and how they might be diagnosed and treated. If a person with DLB or PDD is excessively drowsy, at least one of these could be the problem. Inability to get to sleep at bedtime can translate into sleepiness during the daytime. Many people with DLB or PDD who experience insomnia benefit from nighttime carbidopa/levodopa doses. The benefits of carbidopa/levodopa dosing at bedtime for Lewy-related insomnia were addressed in Chapter 9. Various other factors, however, may contribute to insomnia. Sometimes medications taken in the evening are alerting. Such drugs include duloxetine (Cymbalta) or venlafaxine (Effexor), used for depression and often dosed twice daily. Elimination of all but the morning dose may allow sleep in such cases. Other drugs for depression from the Prozac class (SSRIs; see the list in Chapter 18) may also cause insomnia if taken at bedtime. A simple strategy is to simply switch to morning dosing on a trial basis. The tricyclic antidepressants, such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, or protriptyline, should not cause insomnia; they may induce sleep. Occasionally, sleepy people are prescribed stimulants with long-acting properties, such as extended-release methylphenidate (Concerta), modafinil (Provigil), or armodafinil (Nuvigil).",

The most common of these cognitive effects is drug-induced sleepiness occurring during waking. Unfortunately, the terminology describing daytime sleepiness, generally considered to be 'the subjective state of sleep need,' is poorly defined, interchangeably including such contextual terminology as sleepiness, drowsiness, languor, inertness, fatigue, and sluggishness.2 Waking consciousness is not a univariate state, changing cyclically during the day from focused alertness, to states characterized by associative thought, drowsiness, and even 'altered' states such as meditation, hallucination, or hypnosis.3 The subjective behavioral complaint of 'sleepiness' often does not accurately reflect the results of tests for physiological sleepiness.4 The effects of sleepiness on daytime performance can be assessed by tests of complex reaction and coordination, or by tests that assess complex behavioral tasks likely to be affected by sleepiness (i.e. tests of driving performance).5 These data have been shown to correlate with epidemiological studies demonstrating that several groups of drugs known to induce daytime sleepiness are associated with increased rates of automobile accidents (e.g. sedating antihistamines, long-acting benzodiazepines, and sedating antidepressants).6,7 Such performance tests have not generally been used for the assessment of daytime performance for a majority of drugs noted to induce sleepiness as a side effect.",

Generally there is an increased vitality, a state of hyperæsthesia, an increase in the activity of the brain, generally of the whole brain, and we must believe that these states will not so easily end in complete resolution as the condition of merely depressed action, or rather no action, which obtains in melancholia—I mean in melancholia generally, and not those states of acute melancholia which are supposed to be closely allied to the state which in other brains and under other subjective circumstances would give rise to mania from a pathological point of view. If this increased activity does not rapidly terminate in resolution, one of two things must occur—either exhaustion or atrophy, resulting in death or dementia, will supervene, or abnormal tissue will invade or replace healthy nerve paths or areas, and chronic aberration of mind ensue.",

They are used therapeutically for anxiety and insomnia and are used nonmedically for their psychoactive effects. An estimated 1.8 million Americans are current nonmedical users of sedatives. Many sedatives act on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor, producing depressed cortical function and disinhibition. Toxicity is characterized by slurred speech, impaired judgment, and unsteady gait; overdose results in stupor, coma, respiratory depression, and vasomotor collapse and may be fatal. Withdrawal symptoms include agitation, restlessness, insomnia, anxiety, and seizures. Sedative use should be suspected in individuals with clinical signs of toxicity. Benzodiazepines and barbiturates can be detected in standard urine drug tests. Cognitive impairment and increased risk of accidental injury and falls are the most serious medical complications. Prescribed sedatives can be tapered slowly over weeks to months. Acute withdrawal can be treated with a taper of a long-acting benzodiazepine or phenobarbital. There are few data on long-term treatment of sedative use disorders.",

According to the DSM‐IV‐TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), the diagnosis applies to individuals who develop a requisite number of symptoms after experiencing, witnessing, or being confronted with an event that involved perceived or threatened loss of life, serious injury, or loss of physical integrity and that evoked fear, helplessness, or horror (e.g., military combat, sexual or physical assault, serious accidents, and major disasters). DSM‐IV‐TR organizes the symptoms of PTSD under three clusters: (1) reexperiencing (e.g., intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, and psychophysiological reactivity to reminders of the trauma), (2) avoidance and emotional numbing (e.g., avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma and inability to experience a full range of emotions), and (3) hyperarousal (e.g., hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and sleep disruption). By definition, these symptoms must persist for more than 1 month after the trauma and produce clinically significant distress and/or impairment.",

TRD is a clinically heterogeneous entity, with significant comorbidities from personality traits or disorders, substance use disorders, chronic medical/physical issues, misdiagnosed bipolar illness, and anxiety or psychosis issues. For optimal treatment planning and to maximize response and symptom resolution, treatment resistance needs to be differentiated from the above-mentioned comorbidities. Strategies for pharmacologic treatment when a first-line antidepressant regimen fails include switching to another antidepressant (inter- or intraclass switching), augmentation with a mood stabilizer or atypical antipsychotic, or use of thyroid hormone. Drugs with glutamatergic actions, such a ketamine, have proven very promising in addressing TRD symptoms and will likely see widespread use in the next few years.

      "abstract": "Agitation is a nonspecific constellation of symptoms seen in a variety of psychiatric disorders, ranging from psychotic exacerbations in patients with schizophrenia to behavioral disturbances associated with organic factors. Its treatment must be individualized and based on the etiology of the psychomotor disturbance. Certain categories of drugs are broadly effective. Sedation and control of disruptive and dangerous behavior are the initial goals in stabilizing acutely agitated patients. Sedation is necessary during the lag period before antipsychotic and mood‐stabilizing drugs take effect. Barbiturates and chlorpromazine, initially given to control agitated behavior, are largely supplanted by higher‐potency antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and, recently, a combination of these two agents. Agitation is generally controlled within hours to days, whereas remission of affective or psychotic symptoms often requires weeks to months. Once remission is obtained, sedation is no longer desired and may be a barrier to optimal patient function and compliance. Thus, for long‐term treatment, strategies are used to minimize sedation, such as reducing dosages, changing administration to bedtime, or adding antidepressants or stimulants where appropriate.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Discontinuation syndromes have been noted for various classes of psychotropic medication and have now been observed for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other new serotonergic antidepressants. REVIEW SUMMARY SSRIs and other new antidepressants are increasingly being used for neurologic disorders as well as for depression and anxiety, which frequently coexist with these illnesses. Recently, a discontinuation syndrome was identified after abrupt and even tapered withdrawal from these agents. The syndrome presents with somatic symptoms of disequilibrium, gastrointestinal symptoms, flu-like symptoms, disrupted sleep, and sensory disturbances as well as psychological symptoms of irritability, crying spells, and anxiety or agitation. These symptoms, which usually appear within 1 to 3 days after the last dose, are usually mild and transient but can be more severely distressing and debilitating and lead to disruption of social or occupational activities. When intervention is required, the primary strategy entails reinstituting the SSRI and, if appropriate, commencing a slow and gradual tapering schedule. We review the cases of three patients with SSRI discontinuation syndrome who presented to the clinic with neurologic complaints. CONCLUSION The primary prevention strategy for discontinuation syndrome is to avoid abrupt discontinuation of antidepressant medication, particularly for agents demonstrating a pharmacologic profile of a short half-life and no active metabolites. Awareness of SSRI discontinuation syndrome facilitates rapid identification and effective intervention as well as improved prevention through patient education. (THE NEUROLOGIST 6:348-352, 2000)",

The merits of the method are not only due to the beneficial effects of the relaxant itself; the anaesthetic, that is invariably administered at the same time, plays an essential part in the procedure. Every phase of the treatment is greatly improved. Anxiety, which so often develops during unmodified E.C.T., is greatly reduced if not abolished altogether. There is no cry or other noise that might disturb other patients awaiting treatment; the convulsion is attenuated to a reaction that may be varied at will from a mild modified convulsion to a mere flicker of facial muscles or complete absence of muscular activity. Cyanosis is absent and the colour remains good throughout, and—perhaps most important of all from the therapeutic point of view—there is no restlessness or confusion after the treatment, the patient sleeping quietly after the treatment until he wakes up without any unpleasant sensations or memories.",

The decline in all those mental capabilities would be due to the abnormal changes in neuronal architecture with increasing age, chronic oxidative stress and inflammatory state of the tissue, nutritional deficiency. Nootropics or smart drugs enhance memory, attention, creativity, and cognitive performance by affecting the synthesis and receptor binding of neurotransmitters in the brain, especially dopamine, serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid, glutamate, and acetylcholine. Nootropics have shown their positive effects in parkinson's, autism, alzheimer's, huntington's disorders, where impaired memory is the primary concern. Synthetic class of nootropics has limitations and reported exacerbation of other brain disorders (off label effects) or therapeutic failure in some instances. Nutraceuticals are dietary derived vitamins, minerals, herbal products, proteins, marine products, and probiotics. The health benefits derived from Nutraceuticals are increasing brain blood flow, reducing inflammation in nervous tissues, detoxifying toxins from the brain, balancing neurotransmitter turnover rate, correcting neuronal and receptor damages and facilitating synaptic transmission, good antioxidant properties and power of improving neuroplasticity of the brain that combat neurodegeneration. The demands for effective nootropics will remain high as the number of cases are increased tremendously.",

Mood, guilt, work, and interest, as well as psychic anxiety, are consistently identified across validated subscales of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale as prevalent and sensitive to change with existing treatments. A major limitation of these antidepressant therapies is their narrow spectrum of action. While the core “mood and interest” symptoms have been the main focus of attention, the associated symptoms listed above are often unaffected or exacerbated by current treatments. Careful clinical evaluation should address all of these dimensions, recognizing that improvement may occur sooner in some symptoms (eg, mood) compared with others (eg, sleep disturbance).",

      "abstract": "The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia and psychosis originated from observations of the dopamine-blocking actions of early neuroleptic drugs. These results support the dopamine hypothesis, however, only on the assumption that the drugs act by reversing an underlying disease mechanism (or part of it). An alternative explanation is that the drugs work by inducing a state of neurological suppression that reduces the intensity of symptoms. Although stimulant drugs are known to induce episodes of psychosis, the mechanism for stimulant-induced psychosis has not been clarified, and stimulants are known to affect many neurotransmitters other than dopamine. Recent imaging studies suggest that there may be increased dopamine release in response to amphetamine administration compared to controls. Some studies indicate increased uptake of L-dopa in parts of the striatum, but some do not. The potential confounding effects of factors associated with dopamine release--such as movement, arousal, attention, stress, and smoking--have rarely been examined, and prior medication use may also have influenced results in some studies. Comparable research on other psychiatric conditions associated with increased arousal, stress, and physical activity is sparse. Research on dopamine concentrations in postmortem brain tissue, on homovanillic acid concentrations, and on dopamine receptors has been negative or inconclusive. Therefore, the idea that the symptoms of psychosis or schizophrenia are caused by the overactivity of dopamine is not supported by current evidence.",

      "abstract": "We experienced a case showing various psychotic symptoms following cessation of alcohol consumption. The symptoms included depressive state, delusion, confusion, psychomotor excitement and delirium, all of which disappeared in about two months. At first, we regarded all the symptoms as alcoholic hallucinosis, by a clinical standpoint, in spite of no auditory hallucination in this case. However, taking the overall clinical course into consideration, withdrawal syndrome could have been affected by some factors. One of the possibilities is that delusion might have been induced by aripiprazole. There still may be some other unknown influential factors on withdrawal, which are indicated by previous papers.",

This results in dose-related cognition impairment, particularly in complex cognitive skills, as well as causing disorders such as mood changes, hallucinations, altered perception amd memory loss. MDMA reduces the level of these neurotransmitters within the neural synapses by reducing the number of intraneural transporters to the synaptic clefts, increasing deactivation with the synapse and/ or increasing degradation with the pre- and postsynaptic neurons. Users may have varied reasons for MDMA use and therefore require help and support from their families or friends, and knowledgeable and well-skilled healthcare professionals for successful abstinence, avoidance of further psychological damage and a reversal of adverse health effects or reduction in their severity.",

      "abstract": "Compliance is generally defined as the extent to which a patient adheres to a treatment regimen and, specifically, takes medication as prescribed. While little research is available about the number of patients who consistently skip antidepressant doses, the literature indicates that about 30% of patients discontinue treatment suddenly within the first month. Both missed doses and abrupt stoppage of treatment place a patient at risk for experiencing discontinuation symptoms. A variety of reasons ranging from forgetfulness to lack of knowledge about the importance of taking every dose may lead to nonadherence to an antidepressant regimen. By spending time on patient education, providing reasons why patients should take every antidepressant dose, discussing alternative treatments, and conveying empathy, support for, and understanding of the patient, physicians may be able to minimize noncompliance and consequently decrease the likelihood that a patient may experience discontinuation symptoms. Discontinuation of an antidepressant can cause a patient to be irritable, experience severe dizziness, or act emotionally absent, which may have a sustained adverse impact both on job performance and on family and social relationships.",

Profoundly affect the quality of life and even put it at risk. The aim of this study was to analyze sleep disorders in childhood . Literature Review: A review was made on aspects of normal sleep ontogenesis and management of sleep disorders most prevalent in childhood. Were selected scientific articles in SciELO database, using the keywords sleep disorders and childhood. Second, the literature studied can classify the sleep disorders in four clinical groups: a) are those in which primary sleep disorder is the main or only symptom, eg, nightmares, night terrors, insomnia, hypersomnia, sleep paralysis and narcolepsy b) secondary sleep disorders is only one aspect of a complex clinical change, such as schizophrenia, depression or thyroid dysfunction c) parasomnias activities are not indicative of pathology when awake, but they are certainly not during sleep as sleepwalking, bedwetting, bruxism and nocturnal jactatio capitis d) clinical changes that can be influenced by sleep, but little influence, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. In pediatric clinic the most frequent parasomnias and changes primary sleep. The insomnia generally results from poor educational practice and / or emotional disturbances. Remember that children with obstructive sleep disorders have worse results in the test of learning and memory. Conclusion: Sleep disturbances are very frequent complaints in pediatric outpatient clinics, and a correct diagnosis is essential for the establishment of appropriate therapy. In most cases, clinical history is sufficient for the diagnosis and assuring parents the mercy of the problem, and the best treatment.",

      "title": "Overtraining Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Definitions Functional overreaching (FOR): intensified training results in a temporary decline in performance. When appropriate periods of recovery are provided, a positive \"supercompensation\" effect occurs, with the athlete exhibiting enhanced performance. Nonfunctional overreaching (NFOR): an accumulation of training and/or nontraining stress resulting in short-term decrement in performance capacity with or without related physiological and psychological signs and symptoms of maladaptation in which restoration of performance capacity may take from several days to several weeks. Overtraining syndrome (OTS): same as NFOR, except decrement is long-term and restoration takes several weeks or months. Key point: the difference between NFOR and OTS is the amount of time needed for performance restoration; therefore, the diagnosis of OTS can often only be made retrospectively (3). Pathophysiology Unknown, biochemical/hormonal hypotheses include the following: glycogen depletion, central fatigue/branched chain fatty acid depletion, glutamine depletion/immune dysfunction, autonomic imbalance, oxidative stress, hypothalamic dysregulation, and cytokine release/inflammation (1,2). The mechanism triggering these changes often involves a training error that results in imbalance between energy expenditure load and recovery. This typically occurs in combination with a complex set of psychological factors and environmental stressors (e.g., monotony of training, excessive competitions, sleep disturbances, interpersonal difficulties, academic/occupational stressors, illness, altitude exposure, heat or cold injury, etc.). Epidemiology Most commonly seen in endurance events such as swimming, cycling, or running Prevalence and incidence data for true OTS are lacking; the lifetime prevalence of NFOR/OTS is estimated to be approximately 30% for nonelite endurance athletes and 60% for elite athletes (2,3). Important Differential Diagnoses NFOR/OTS is a diagnosis of exclusion (1). Common: caffeine withdrawal, environmental allergies, exercise-induced bronchospasm, infectious mononucleosis, insufficient sleep, anemia, performance anxiety, inadequate carbohydrate or protein intake, mood disorder, psychosocial stress, upper respiratory infection. Less common: dehydration, diabetes mellitus, eating disorder, hepatitis, hypothyroidism, lower respiratory infection, medication side effect (antidepressant, anxiolytic, antihistamine, β-blocker), post-concussive syndrome, pregnancy, substance abuse. Rare but important: adrenocortical insufficiency or excess, congenital or acquired heart disease, arrhythmia, bacterial endocarditis, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, human immunodeficiency virus, malabsorption syndrome, chronic lung disease, Lyme disease, malaria, malignancy, neuromuscular disorder, chronic renal disease, syphilis. Evaluation Thorough history including chief complaint, training program, diet, medications, nutrition, illness, review of systems, and assessment of training goals. Hallmark feature in history: athletes with NFOR/OTS are usually able to start a normal training sequence or a race at their normal pace but are not able to complete the training load they are given or race as usual (3). Initial laboratory examinations: complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate/C-reactive protein, thyroid-stimulating hormone, iron studies, creatine kinase, urinalysis, and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin. Consider monospot, hepatitis panel, Lyme titer, toxicology screen, and chest x-ray. Prescribe absolute rest for 2 wk. ○ If mood is adversely affected with full rest, consider relative rest with well-defined expectations. If improved at follow-up, focus on adjustments to training and prevention (as follows). If no improvement, consider NFOR/OTS: ○ Will require prolonged training rest and further workup ○ Consider consulting with a sports psychologist and nutritionist. ○ Sequence of advancing activity should focus on frequency, then duration, then intensity (1,2). Monitoring Monitor performance in time trials and standard exercise challenges. There are currently no good practical biomarkers for NFOR/OTS (2). Psychiatric indicators may be most useful. Examples include the Profile of Mood States and Recovery-Stress Questionnaire for Athletes (1). A two-bout maximal exercise protocol has shown differences in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal response for athletes with FOR, NFOR, and OTS and may have prognostic value (2). Prevention Considerations for coaches, athletic trainers, and health care providers (2,3): Maintain accurate records of performance and encourage athletes to keep a diary of training load. Emphasize adequate rest and \"time out\" periods when performance declines, when an athlete complains of fatigue, or after illness or injury. Individualize and supervise training program. Avoid monotony of training. Encourage and reinforce optimal nutrition, hydration, and sleep. Be aware of life stressors, and communicate with athletes about physical, mental, and emotional concerns. Consider regular psychological questionnaires. Schedule regular health checks with a multidisciplinary team.",

Not surprisingly, because of the illegality of these substances, many of these individuals die while in the custody of law enforcement. In fact, forensic pathologists have often divided these drug-related custody deaths into four different categories: (a) death during arrest and transport or soon thereafter; (b) death within 12 hours of arrest: (c) death after 12 hours, but within a few days to weeks; and (d) death after days to weeks of incarceration (2). Death within 12 hours of arrest is commonly associated with massive drug overdose, such as can occur with smugglers who conceal drugs within body cavities, an act that is known as \"body packing.\" Deaths that occur days to weeks or longer after incarceration can be associated with drug withdrawal or other natural causes related to drug use (2).",

Briefer (4 days or more), mild episodes of mood elevation define bipolar II disorder; lengthier (7 days or more), more severe episodes (or those requiring hospitalisation), with or without psychotic features, define bipolar I disorder. Depressive periods are more common and lengthier than manic or hypomanic states, and are the main cause of disability. Bipolar depression may respond poorly to antidepressants and these medications may destabilise the illness. The diagnosis of bipolar disorder should be considered when a patient with depression is treatment resistant. Irritability is a common symptom in bipolar disorder, particularly during mixed states (during which patients have features of mood elevation and depression concurrently) or when there is rapid cycling of mood (more than four episodes of mood disorder per year). Alcohol misuse and use of illicit drugs may simulate mood changes in bipolar disorder.

However, research has shown that sleep is also required for other vital processes such as memory consolidation and normal physiological functioning. Extensive research has shown that the areas that control our sleeping behaviour are the hypothalamus, brain stem, midbrain, and amygdala. These areas coordinate events during the non-REM and REM phases of sleep-wake cycles. GABA and adenosine, two chemical neurotransmitters, are also involved and play an important role in our sleep cycle. Insomnia has caused a slew of psychological and physiological issues such as fatigue, decreased mental concentration, irritable nature and a higher risk of heart attacks and stroke. It has reduced the patient's quality of life of the patient and have a social impact on them. Primary insomnia is defined as the inability/absence of proper sleep and impaired daily life functioning. Secondary insomnia, on the other hand, is believed to result from pre-existing medical conditions, substance abuse, or as a side effect of certain drug therapy. Insomnia is diagnosed through physical examination and the use of electrical devices to monitor sleep behavior.",

      "title": "States of consciousness: new insights and further questions",
      "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of a severe brain injury survivors are usually in coma, which is characterised as a state of unresponsiveness without any understanding or purposeful functions, although reflex responses can still be elicited. If the injury is severe enough but not fatal, the coma can persist for days or weeks, but it is nonetheless recognised to be a transient condition which evolves into other defined conscious states. Consciousness may be regained, but if not signs of a persistent vegetative state (also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) or a minimally conscious state develop. Both the latter are characterised by spontaneous or induced eye opening and sleep wake cycles, with additional responses such as apparent crying, laughing, or smiling. In the minimally conscious state there are also reproducible if inconsistent visual, verbal, or gestural responses to particular stimuli. In both these states, signs depend on relatively intact brain stem function, contrasting with the locked-in syndrome, a condition in which brain stem dysfunction prevents a conscious person from demonstrating their awareness.1, 2 Recognition of the two states of reduced consciousness has informed treatment and management decisions. Families and others who can see obvious signs of improvement, in that a person is no longer completely unresponsive or comatose, often expect further recovery. Standard advice is that in adults and children the potential for recovery from the persistent vegetative state, and the time to allow, depends on the cause: significant improvement can still occur up to 12 months after traumatic injury, but only up to 3 months after a non-traumatic injury, such as near-drowning. The potential for recovery from a minimally responsive state may be better, but it is not clear by how much, or if the time scales differ. One group reported that in the first 3 months there is a good chance of reasonable recovery but this falls sharply with longer durations, especially after non-traumatic injuries. In the latter groups survivors may continue to improve in terms of responsiveness but most remain severely disabled.1, 3, 4 However, problems remain. Detailed definitions of the clinical features of the two states differ.3 Distinguishing the two states is clinically difficult, although specific scales increase diagnostic precision.2 It seems logical to expect that in some patients with additional brain stem damage a state of reduced consciousness might co-exist with a degree of locked-in syndrome. In addition, from personal experience some patients do not show spontaneous eye opening or sleep-wake cycles despite other responses suggestive of a minimally conscious state. Such cases are not defined or studied in the medical literature. Finally over the last few years functional neuroimaging studies, mostly in adults, have shown that some patients have much more cortical responsiveness than clinically suspected, meaning that some thought to be in a persistent vegetative state may be at least minimally conscious.5 In one study 13 out of 41 patients classified by a standard scale as being in the vegetative state showed activity compatible with a minimally conscious state on neuroimaging between 3 weeks and 8 years after the injury. Twelve months later some clinical improvement in consciousness had occurred in most, usually to a minimally conscious state. One, assessed approximately 5 weeks after a traumatic injury, had recovered fully but the other survivors were still severely disabled.5 Ideally perhaps patients should now all be assessed by functional neuroimaging, but that may be impractical. The predictive value of more accessible modalities such as EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation are still being explored. For all these, it would be clinically helpful if outcome studies followed a standard format to report the state and how it was assessed at fixed times after the injury, such as 3 months and 6 months, and the prognosis at 12 months or thereafter, subdivided into traumatic and non-traumatic groups. In the meantime all patients in such states should be assumed to have some awareness some of the time, which means for example that there must be adequate analgesia for painful conditions or procedures, and that further discussion is needed on the relationship between responsiveness and awareness. In children these difficulties are even more marked. There is limited data on both the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and outcome, especially in the very young age groups.1 Clinical scales have not been validated in children. Some studies of functional imaging have included children or young people but do not always report their data separately. Patient and medical groups should lobby for standardized outcome studies in children, which should be large enough to provide useful data for smaller subgroups.",

The interviewer should make sure that any “yes” response is not simply caused by exposure to a certain situation or object (Specific Phobia), being the focus of attention (Social Anxiety Disorder/Social Phobia), being separated from parents (Separation Anxiety), and so on. If the child gives examples that are the result of another anxiety disorder, or elaboration of the response to Question 1b suggests that the child does not seem to understand Question 1a, then the interviewer may ask Question 1c to reassess presence of “unexpected” panic attacks. DSM-5 defines a panic attack as a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which at least four of the symptoms listed develop abruptly and reach a peak within minutes of onset. To meet the criteria for Panic Disorder, the child must report recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, at least one of which has been followed for a month by one or more symptoms.",

As a general rule, sexual activity can be resumed when the patient can walk a kilometre at a comfortable pace or climb two flights of stairs without undue breathlessness. Sexual patterns and positions used prior to the heart attack should be continued. Symptoms that occur during sexual intercourse or any other exercise should be reported to a doctor. Taking more than two alcoholic drinks or eating a large meal may hinder sexual activity. Psychological problems that interfere with sexual function can develop in patients or their partners. Anxiety and depression are the most common causes of reduced libido, impotence and frigidity. Some people abandon sex after a heart attack because they feel they have aged significantly as a result of their illness. Doctors should ask post-myocardial infarction patients about sexual activity when inquiring about other symptoms and well-being. Given support, understanding and attendance to any associated problems, most patients will recover their normal sexual function after a heart attack. (author abstract)",

Current guidelines recommend tricyclic antidepressants or SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) as first-line therapies to treat the multiple symptom domains. Until recently, however, there were no licensing authority approved treatments for FMS. The alfa 2 delta modulator pregabalin has anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and antinociceptive properties which has prompted its investigation in FMS. In a series of short-term randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of 8-14 weeks duration, pregabalin proved effective in reducing the pain and accompanying symptoms of FMS and improved quality of life domains. A 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated the durability of its effects on pain and a variety of secondary measures such as fatigue and sleep disturbance. Overall, pregabalin was well tolerated with no new adverse events emerging that have not been reported with its use in other indications.",

      "title": "Organic cerebral reactions in alcoholism: psychobiological aspects of treatment.",
      "abstract": "The paper considers the rational biological basis for treatment of alcohol withdrawal reactions, alcoholic hallucinosis and the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Both clinical and experimental data indicate that the alcohol withdrawal reaction reflects a state of hyper-reactivity of the central nervous system. The evidence comprises physiological, electrophysiological and biochemical findings. Magnesium, vitamins and antipsychotics are not specific in the treatment of the alcohol withdrawal reactions per se; rational treatment comprises drugs that may substitute for the suppressive effects of alcohol in the CNS during readaptation to the alcohol free condition (e.g. barbiturates or benzodiazepines). Alcoholic hallucinosis is characterised by acutely developed auditory hallucinations of an evil or reproachful nature. The condition may develop during or shortly after excessive alcohol consumption in chronic alcoholics. Suggestibility and unclear consciousness is not part of the condition. Tentatively three subgroups are suggested to occur: a) a withdrawal reaction; treatment with sedatives is recommended; the prognosis is good, b) a toxic reaction occurring during the drinking bout; this condition should be treated with antipsychotics until symptoms have disappeared. The prognosis is fairly good, c) a schizophreniform condition. Long-term treatment with antipsychotics must be applied. The Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is described. The condition often occurs during or shortly after an acute withdrawal reaction. The biochemical role of the etiological factor thiamine in glucose metabolism suggests that precautions (thiamine treatment) must be taken when giving a glucose load to alcoholics. Finally focus is set on the recent suggestion that the syndrome may in some cases result from an inborn enzymatic abnormality comprising low binding of thiamine pyrophosphate to transketolase. Psychobiological aspects of treatment in alcoholism may apply to a very large spectrum of conditions involving symptoms of cerebral, hepatic, gastrointestinal, cardial and peripheral nervous system origin. In the present expose we shall concentrate on organic cerebral reactions partly or exclusively presenting with psychiatric symptoms and signs. Thus the review will consider the rational biological basis for treatment of alcohol withdrawal reactions (including delirium tremens), alcoholic hallucinosis and the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.",

The authors review certain exogenous factors that seem capable of triggering attacks and/or increasing their frequency and intensity: self-administered pharmacologic agents (caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, over-the-counter cold preparations, cannabis, cocaine); habits (sleep deprivation, diet, exercise, relaxation, hyperventilation); and aspects of the environment (fluorescent lighting, life stressors). There may be a specificity to the action of some of these factors, because certain factors previously thought to trigger panic attacks (e.g., pain, hypoglycemia) have been proved not to have this effect. Although the clinical significance of many of the exogenous factors discussed still awaits empirical confirmation, attention to such factors during the initial evaluation of a patient with panic disorder may be helpful in formulating a successful treatment plan.",

This article is based on material presented in: Kumar S, Oakley-Browne M. Panic disorder. Clinical Evidence 2002; 8: 1003–9. For this review, Clinical Evidence searched and appraised material published until May 2002. Studies with follow up periods of less than 6 months were excluded. A panic attack is a period in which there is sudden onset of intense apprehension, fearfulness or terror, often associated with feelings of impending doom. Panic disorder occurs when there are recurrent, unpredictable attacks followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern about having another panic attack; worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attacks, or a significant behavioural change related to the attacks.1 The term “panic disorder” excludes panic attacks attributable to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition, substance or another mental disorder. Panic disorder is sometimes categorised as “with” or “without agoraphobia.”1 Alternative categorisations focus on phobic anxiety disorders and specify agoraphobia with or without panic disorder.2 Panic disorder often starts around 20 years of age (between late adolescence and the mid-30s).3 Lifetime prevalence is 1–3%, and panic disorder is more common in women than in men.4 An Australian community study found 1 month prevalence rates for panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) of 0.4% using International Classification of … [1]: /embed/graphic-1.gif",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders can be broadly classified into: (a) insomnia, (b) parasomnia, (c) sleep disorders associated with psychiatric, neurologic and other medical disorders, and (d) proposed sleep disorders (e.g. pregnancy and menstrual related sleep disorders).1 Insomnia is a common encounter in primary care consultations2 and constitutes the commonest sleep problem3,4 that presents to the general practitioner. Based on the National Center for Sleep Disorders Research Classification,5 insomnia symptoms can be defined as subjective complaints of difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early awakening and non refreshing sleep despite an adequate opportunity to sleep. An important consideration is whether the presence of one or more of these symptoms causes significant impairment to the patient’s social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Insomnia can be due to primary or secondary causes. Primary insomnia refers to insomnia that appears to be unrelated to any identifiable underlying medical or psychiatric disorder.6,7 Secondary causes of insomnia include conditions where another disorder contributing to or aggravating the insomnia can be diagnosed (Table1). The diagnosis of sleep disorders is often based on obtaining a detailed sleep history, a neuropsychiatric evaluation, a physical examination looking for medical and other disorders, mental status examination and relevant investigations.

      "abstract": "Psychomotor seizures are epileptic manifestations occurring either alone or in combination with other types of seizures. The attacks are characterized by motor and/or psychic activity which is purposeful but irrelevant for the time and place, and the patient is amnesic afterward for the events that transpired during the seizure. There are no convulsive movements of either tonic or clonic nature during psychomotor seizures. Synonyms for the term psychomotor seizures are epileptic equivalents and epileptic fugue states. Psychomotor seizures occur in late childhood or adult life; they have a frequency approximating that of major convulsions, and the individual attack lasts from one to five or more minutes. On the basis of these clinical facts the differentiation from petit mal epilepsy is not difficult. The activity of the patient during psychomotor seizures is quite distinct. The following examples drawn from the clinical material in this report illustrate the types of activity. A",

      "title": "Serotonin syndrome following introduction of venlafaxine following withdrawal of phenelzine: implications for drug washout periods",
      "abstract": "We report here a case of serotonin syndrome (SS) following initiation of venlafaxine 2 weeks after withdrawal of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), phenelzine, and also following repeated retrials of venlafaxine initiation. The case has clinically important implications regarding the period of time necessary for monoamine oxidase biosynthesis following use of an irreversible MAOI.\r\n\r\nSS is characterized by the presence of autonomic nervous system symptoms (such as hyperthermia, diaphoresis, mydriasis, nausea, shivering, hypertension, tachycardia, and diarrhoea), mental status changes (such as agitation, hypomania, and confusion), and neuromuscular abnormalities (such as myoclonus, incoordination, hyperreflexia, tremors, clonus, and muscle rigidity [Sternbach, 2003]). SS can be a life-threatening condition and occurs acutely due to markedly increased serotonin levels in brain, often following a coprescription or overdose of serotonergic drugs. These drugs can increase serotonin levels by inhibiting metabolism (such as MAOI), increasing formation (such as l-tryptophan), inhibiting reuptake (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), or tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)), increase release (such as amphetamines) or increasing postsynaptic receptor sensitivity (such as lithium). Overdose with a SSRI alone results in mild SS in about 15% of people but does not usually lead to severe toxicity [Isbister et al. 2007]. The occurrence of the syndrome is highest with a combination of SSRIs and MAOIs, though it is also reported with other serotonergic drug combinations.\r\n\r\nSternbach described criteria to diagnose SS (Table 1) and highlighted the importance of identifying it since it is usually reversible following discontinuation of the offending drug(s), supportive treatment and addition of a serotonin antagonist (such as cyproheptadine or chlorpromazine) in more severe cases [Sternbach, 1991]. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1.\r\n\r\nSternbach’s criteria [Modified after Sternbach 1991].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere have been previous case reports of patients who experienced an SS when a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) has been introduced after the traditionally recommended 2-week washout from an irreversible MAOI [Sternbach, 2003]. However, we have been unable to identify any instance in the literature where a patient has been rechallenged with a SRI (such as an SSRI, SNRI or a TCA) after a further period of washout following the occurrence of SS.",

Ketamine has been shown to cause transient mood elevation or euphoria, dissociative symptoms and psychotomimetic effects when administered in unipolar or bipolar depression. Still, it has not been shown to cause an affective switch resulting in persistent hypomania/mania or a manic-like state. We report the case of a 47-year-old man who developed a switch to mania while receiving a sub-anaesthetic dosage of ketamine intravenously for his third episode of recurrent, non-psychotic severe major depression with suicidal ideation. This case indicates that a polarity switch should be acknowledged as a possible side effect when using ketamine for depression.",

      "title": "Insomnia – A Heterogenic Disorder Often Comorbid With Psychological and Somatic Disorders and Diseases: A Narrative Review With Focus on Diagnostic and Treatment Challenges",
      "abstract": "Patients with insomnia complain of problems with sleep onset or sleep maintenance or early morning awakenings, or a combination of these, despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep. In addition, to fulfill the diagnostic criteria for insomnia the complaints need to be associated with negative daytime consequences. For chronic insomnia, the symptoms are required to be present at least 3 days per week for a duration of at least 3 months. Lastly, for insomnia to be defined as a disorder, the sleep complaints and daytime symptoms should not be better explained by another sleep disorder. This criterion represents a diagnostic challenge, since patients suffering from other sleep disorders often complain of insomnia symptoms. For instance, insomnia symptoms are common in e.g., obstructive sleep apnea and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. It may sometimes be difficult to disentangle whether the patient suffers from insomnia disorder or whether the insomnia symptoms are purely due to another sleep disorder. Furthermore, insomnia disorder may be comorbid with other sleep disorders in some patients, e.g., comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA). In addition, insomnia disorder is often comorbid with psychological or somatic disorders and diseases. Thus, a thorough assessment is necessary for correct diagnostics. For chronic insomnia disorder, treatment-of-choice is cognitive behavioral therapy, and such treatment is also effective when the insomnia disorder appears comorbid with other diagnoses. Furthermore, studies suggest that insomnia is a heterogenic disorder with many different phenotypes or subtypes. Different insomnia subtypes may respond differently to treatment, but more research on this issue is warranted. Also, the role of comorbidity on treatment outcome is understudied. This review is part of a Research Topic on insomnia launched by Frontiers and focuses on diagnostic and treatment challenges of the disorder. The review aims to stimulate to more research into the bidirectional associations and interactions between insomnia disorder and other sleep, psychological, and somatic disorders/diseases.",

The most familiar are the \"visionary psychodysleptics\" which produce prominent visual and somatic distortions and hallucinations. Complex emotional changes ranging from ecstasy to terror may occur, as well as alterations in thinking. Examples of such drugs are LSD, mescaline, and tryptamine derivatives such as dimethyltryptamine (DMT). The imagery-producing psychodysleptics such as cannabis and various coumarins (e.g., from Calea zacatechichi) potentiate visual imagery and produce characteristic distortions in time perception, body-image, and thought. Trance-producing psychodysleptics (such as lysergic acid amide (obtained from Rivea corymbosa) ololiquhqui, turbicoryn, and corymbosine), as their names suggest, produce trance-like states. Finally the deliriants (e.g., atropine) produce clouding of consciousness and amnesia, as well as hallucinatory effects.",

These associated symptoms include restlessness, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, or sleep disturbances (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep).

      "abstract": "The history of antipsychotics began with the discovery of chlorpromazine in the 1950s. Since then this group of medications has become one of the most important element of the armamentarium of psychopharmacology. While initially these pharmacons were used in the treatment of psychotic states (including psychotic mania) in the last approximately 10-15 years new indications - such as treatment of depressive, manic and mixed states and also mood-stabilization in bipolar disorder and also the treatment of major depressive disorder - for several second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) agents have been introduced. Taking this fact into consideration it is not surprising that the market of SGAs has been broadened in several countries. At the same time, safety issues have been raised related to some SGAs, mainly because of their adverse cardiometabolic effects (e.g. weight gain; dyslipidemia; disturbances of glucose metabolism). Related to this, it is worthy of note that the lifespan of patients with serious mental illness (SMIs, such as schizophrenia; bipolar disorder; major depression) is shorter than their healthy counterparts and that somatic comorbidities (mainly cardiovascular disorders) of these patients are primarily responsible for this fact. In this paper, firstly we briefly discuss the history and features of APs then we present data on the shorter than expected lifespan of patients with SMIs and also the possible background mechanisms of it (including the supposed role of AP treatment). Then we provide a short discussion on endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), their role in cardiovascular system and related clinical relevance. Eventually, we also discuss our pilot study with the aim to reveal whether there is any effect of AP therapy on the number of CD34/KDR double-positive EPCs.",

Folgende kognitive Defizite sind kennzeichnend: Storungen der kognitiven Flexibilitat, des Arbeitsgedachtnisses, des freien Abrufs von Gedachtnisinhalten, der geteilten Aufmerksamkeit und von Teilbereichen der selektiven Aufmerksamkeit.\nDie Bundesanstalt fur Strasenwesen (BASt) und wissenschaftliche Forschungsarbeiten konnten eine Reihe an Leistungs- und Personlichkeitsmasen identifizieren, welche eine ausreichende psychische Leistungsfahigkeit im Strasenverkehr gewahrleisten sollen. Obwohl sich die hierbei hervorgehobenen kognitiven Leistungsfunktionen nahezu umfassend mit den Defizitbereichen bei depressiven Storungen uberschneiden und bisher kein rein linearer Zusammenhang zwischen der Schwere der depressiven Symptomatik und dem Auspragungsgrad kognitiver Beeintrachtigungen gefunden werden konnte, besagt die aktuelle Rechtslage, dass lediglich bei schweren depressiven Episoden die Fahreignung anzuzweifeln sei.\nZiele der vorliegenden Arbeit: Zum einen sollte uberpruft werden, ob sich die in der Literatur berichteten Unterschiede zwischen depressiven Patienten und gesunden Vergleichspersonen in der kognitiven Leistungsfahigkeit, bei der Fahrkompetenz, bei der Selbstbeschreibung und im Risikoverhalten finden lassen. Zum anderen wurde zu bestimmen versucht, welche dieser Mase hauptverantwortlich fur Unterschiede in der Fahrkompetenz sind.\nMethode: Hierzu bearbeitete eine Gruppe stationar-psychiatrischer Patienten mit unipolarer Depression jeweils unmittelbar nach stationarer Aufnahme und bei Entlassung (neuro-) psychologische Testverfahren. Daruber hinaus wurde zeitnah zu den Testungen eine praktische Fahrerprobung in einem Fahrschulauto durchgefuhrt. Ein dritter Schwerpunkt der vorliegenden Arbeit bestand darin, die wissenschaftliche Gute dieser praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe zu uberprufen. Alle Untersuchungen wurden parallel auch mit einer Kontrollgruppe korperlich und psychisch gesunder Probanden durchgefuhrt. \nErgebnisse: Die Fahrverhaltensprobe konnte strenge wissenschaftliche und verkehrspsychologische Anforderungen erfullen. Es zeigte sich, dass sich die Patienten neben dem Ausmas ihrer subjektiven und objektiven Depressivitat, auch in einer Reihe von Leistungs- und Personlichkeitsmasen von den Kontrollpersonen unterschieden. Es liesen sich sowohl einzelne wie auch Kombinationen an Variablen identifizieren, die bereits fur die eher geringe Stichprobengrose der Studie die Fahrkompetenz der Probanden mit einem zufrieden stellenden Mas an Sensitivitat und Spezifitat vorhersagten. \nDiskussion: Mit dieser Arbeit wurde erstmals bei Patienten mit mittelschwerer Depression sowohl anhand neuropsychologischer Testverfahren als auch mit Hilfe einer praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe untersucht, welche Auswirkungen deren Erkrankung auf die Fahrkompetenz hat. Vorangegangene Studien konnten aber bereits die Annahme der BASt, dass nur bei schweren depressiven Episoden die Fahreignung fraglich sei, deutlich in Frage stellen. Die vorliegende Studie stutzt die bisherigen Erkenntnisse und zeigt zusatzlich auf, dass auch bei einer praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe, die den Anforderungen der BASt entspricht, nicht von vergleichbaren Leistungen bei depressiven Patienten und gesunden Kontrollen auszugehen ist. Die geringe Stichprobengrose lasst allerdings eine Generalisierung der Ergebnisse nicht zu. Weitere Forschungsarbeit in dieser Richtung ist erforderlich.",

At that point, however, the discerning clinician must differentiate prolonged concussion symptoms from the evolution of persistent symptoms from comorbid neurologic conditions or emerging mental health symptoms or disorders. Too often, prolonged or persistent symptoms are not considered in the context of initial concussion injury and symptoms, proper return to activity, or emerging comorbid conditions that can also lead to persistent symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Narcolepsy with cataplexy is a specific syndrome of daytime sleepiness, disrupted nocturnal sleep, and episodes of sudden loss of muscle tone—provoked by the anticipation of emotions (in particular laughter)—leading to a tendency to fall, mouth opening, dysarthria or mutism, and facial muscle jerking. It is associated with loss of hypocretin (orexin) neurons in the hypothalamus, hypocretin concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid below 110 pg/ml, and the HLA genotype DQ B1*0602. A less common form of narcolepsy without cataplexy probably has a different, as yet unknown, pathogenesis. Once established, narcolepsy is lifelong; spontaneous recovery does not occur. Symptomatic treatment—which is essential for school performance, work, driving ability, and quality of life—is with stimulant (e.g. amphetamine) and anticataplectic (e.g. clomipramine) drugs. More recently, sodium oxybate, an anaesthetic, has been used to induce deep sleep overnight, resulting in improvements in all symptoms.",

Dopamine blocking agents such as antipsychotics and antiemetics, may induce akathisia. Particular care must be taken to distinguish akathisia from psychotic agitation and restless legs. The prevalence of akathisia in patients using classical antipsychotics is 20-30% and for users of clozapine, olanzapine and quetiapine (atypical antipsychotics) it is lower. Risk factors are a high dosage of antipsychotics, akathisia in a previous treatment, and diabetes mellitus. The treatment of akathisia starts, if possible, with the antipsychotic being withdrawn or the dose administered being lowered. Another treatment possibility is switching to clozapine, olanzapine or quetiapine, or adding a beta-blocking agent, an anticholinergic or mianserin.",

In all these cases, dopaminergic treatment can be helpful. However, many other nonmotor (and motor) symptoms will have no correlation with dopamine; therefore, they require different treatments, very often with little efficacy, as in apathy or cognitive decline.",

Despite some controversy over the effectiveness of cobalamin therapy, there is growing evidence that subjects with low serum cobalamin levels suffering from dementia, displayed significant cognitive improvement and/or resolution of their cognitive defects after prolonged cobalamin therapy. Early detection of low levels of cobalamin is imperative for cobalamin replacement therapy to be effective. Treatment of the deficiency, however late may prevent the symptoms from getting worse.",

Familial : This could be an important cause as individuals from families with a history of any kind of addiction are more likely to develop addiction.. The family scenario is again a driving force e.g. history of alcoholism in the parents may become an important cause. Surroundings: Again as the Children are brought up by alcoholic or drug addicted parents gets family environment becomes a causative factor. Individuals from countries where use of a certain substance is not imposed as an illegal sanction have higher role to play as the causative factor. Exploitation: Individuals who experienced sexual, psychological, emotional or physical exploitation are more likely to become addicts. The addiction becomes a coping mechanism in them.High Emotions: Emotional disorders such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder often increase the risk of substance abuse. In them the insecurity feeling flares up the urge to use to drugs. Action of drug: Certain substances are more addictive than others, and risk of full-blown addiction is higher for drugs such as opioids, alcohol & tranquilizer because of their ability to create dependence after just a quick time.Low Frustration Tolerance: One common factor found amongst addicts of all types is a low frustration tolerance. Addicts are highly susceptible to the negative effects of stress, having a low threshold of facing the disturbances. They become easily upset over everyday stress factors, creating a need for escape. They find this escape in their addiction.Absentism at school: Frequently missing classes or missing school, a sudden disinterest in school or school activities, and a drop in grades may be indicators of drug use.Weak All of a Sudden : Lack of energy and motivation may indicate that child is using certain drugs.Listless appearance: Adolescents are generally concerned about how they look. A lack of interest in clothing, grooming or looks may be a warning sign of drug use.c",

      "title": "Depression and resilience: insights from cognitive, neuroimaging, and psychopharmacological studies",
      "abstract": "Abstract The symptoms of depression include persistent low mood, feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, and anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure. Mood is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic, social, environmental, and other factors, such as substance abuse. Depression is further characterized by dysfunctional attitudes and negative automatic thoughts or ruminations. Psychiatric diagnostic criteria distinguish patients who experience only depressive episodes (unipolar depression or major depressive disorder, MDD) from patients who experience depressive episodes but also manic ones (bipolar disorder, BD). The symptoms of mania, on the other hand, include euphoria, over-activity, distractibility, socially inappropriate behaviour, increased appetite, and impaired insight. Thus, the emotional states of patients with depression and mania can be considered to represent two polar extremes on a mood spectrum. The states manifested in depression and mania are pathological in that they are extreme, disrupt quality of life, and are persistent and often recurrent. This chapter examines not only depression in MDD, but contrasts it with the, at times similar but at times diametrically opposed, symptoms of other disorders, such as BD, to achieve better insight. It also examines resilience in healthy individuals, i.e., how can mood remain normal despite factors such as adverse life events. Research on resilience has focused on determining the protective factors that allow some individuals to have more positive outcomes, despite being exposed to a variety of stressors.",

ED could be operationalized as a multidimensional maladaptive pattern of exercise, leading to clinically impairment or distress. Its criteria are: tolerance, withdrawal effects, lack of control, reductions in other activities, impaired psychological, social or physical functioning. For primary ED, the physical activity is an end in itself; for secondary ED, motivation is extrinsic--to control or alter body mass and shape. Estimates of the prevalence of ED range from 2-3% to 20-30%. Hypotheses of ED development concentrate on beta-endorphin, sympathetic arousal, affect regulation or some psychological explanations (e.g., exercise as distractor).",

Cravings are mediated by brain activation in the amygdala region. Cravings can be activated by exposure to drug cues via classical conditioning. Memories associated with substance use can trigger a craving. Usually, cravings decrease in frequency and intensity as recovery progresses and the client abstains from substance use. The objectives of this chapter are to help the client identify and label a craving to use substances, to teach the client to monitor and rate the level of intensity of cravings, to identify internal and external factors that trigger cravings, and to teach cognitive, behavioral, environmental, and interpersonal strategies to manage alcohol or drug cravings.",

These results seem consistent with these mechanisms of pain-depression comorbidity; (1) a trait of susceptibility to both dysphoric physical symptoms (including pain) and psychological symptoms (including depression), and a state of somatosensory amplification in which psychological distress amplifies dysphoric physical sensations (including pain); (2) psychological illness and behavioural dysfunction being interrelated features of a maladaptive response to pain evident early in the natural history of the condition, and often resolving during an early recovery phase; (3) pain constituting a significant physical and psychological stressor that may induce or exacerbate psychological distress. Thus, pain and psychological illness should be viewed as having reciprocal psychological and behavioural effects involving both processes of illness expression and adaption, as well as pain having specific effects on emotional state and behavioural function.",

      "abstract": "The legal and illegal use of psychoactive drugs, including stimulants, hypnotics, tranquilizers, and hallucinogens, is markedly increasing. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) may cause severe acute or chronic symptoms; one cannot predict adverse reactions or relate them to frequency and length of LSD use. Among its effects are acute psychologic changes, including psychosis; and chronic alterations, such as apathy, psychosis, and \"flashback.\" Chlorpromazine is recommended for treatment of symptoms; psychotherapy and education help prevent further LSD use. Chronic amphetamine use may lead to toxic psychosis, confusion, or brain damage; acute withdrawal may lead to depression, with suicidal ideation, and increases in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep with nightmares and insomnia. Chronic use of barbiturates and nonbarbiturate hypnotics may lead to mental impairment, motor incoordination, and depression. Withdrawal produces weakness, irritability, and occasionally convulsions or psychosis. Amphetamines and hypnotics should be withdrawn gradually and patients educated as to possible physiologic alterations, both those patients dependent on large doses and those who have taken therapeutic doses for some months. Withdrawal of these drugs leads to marked increases in REM sleep, nightmares, and insomnia, which may lead to drug dependency. Marijuana may change time sense and visual and auditory perceptions. Chronic use frequently indicates underlying psychologic disturbances needing psychotherapy. Psychoactive drugs differentially affect responses of various autonomic systems. Central nervous system (CNS)-active drugs do not induce only one condition and cannot be simply classified as excitants or depressants. The physiologic alterations produced by psychoactive drugs are basic to drug dependency as are personality factors.",

He developed a cholinergic rebound syndrome including delirium and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). The delay included time spent in two different medical hospitals: one awaiting psychiatric bedspace, and secondly, when the patient's cholinergic rebound syndrome was misdiagnosed as acute alcohol withdrawal. Once the etiology was recognized, he was promptly treated with anticholinergic medication (benztropine) and retitrated to his outpatient dose of clozapine leading to the resolution of symptoms including delirium and EPS.

Additional literature was obtained from relevant books and monographs.The mean elimination half-life for methamphetamine is approximately 10 hours, with considerable inter-individual variability in pharmacokinetics. Direct effects at low-to-moderate methamphetamine doses (5-30 mg) include arousal, positive mood, cardiac stimulation and acute improvement in cognitive domains such as attention and psychomotor coordination. At higher doses used typically by illicit users (> or =50 mg), methamphetamine can produce psychosis. Its hypertensive effect can produce a number of acute and chronic cardiovascular complications. Repeated use may induce neurotoxicity, associated with prolonged psychiatric symptoms, cognitive impairment and an increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease. Abrupt cessation of repeated methamphetamine use leads to a withdrawal syndrome consisting of depressed mood, anxiety and sleep disturbance. Acute withdrawal lasts typically for 7-10 days, and residual symptoms associated with neurotoxicity may persist for several months.",

      "abstract": "The adjustment disorders (ADs) are one of the subthreshold disorders that has undergone a major evolution since the original Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association of 1952. The essential characteristics of AD is the presence of clinically significant emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable psychosocial stressor. Although the issue of boundaries in mental disorders is obviously profound and common, the issue of defining boundaries is especially problematic in the subthreshold diagnoses, for example AD, in which there are no symptom check lists, algorithms, or guidelines for the \"quantification of clinical features.\" There are six AD subtypes: (1) depressed mood; (2) anxiety; (3) mixed anxiety and depressed mood; (4) disturbance of conduct; (5) mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct; and (6) unspecified. In addition there is an acute form (persistence of symptoms less than 6 months) and a chronic form (persistence of symptoms for more than 6 months) after the termination of the stressor or its consequences. Etiologically, the ADs are in the stress-related category of mental disorders and treatment often involves attempting to eliminate or mitigate the stressor(s), or to enhance coping with them. The AD diagnosis in children and youth has been related to more serious mental illness in adulthood. In adults the subthreshold disorder usually remits after the cessation of the putative stressor: Counseling and psychotherapy may be employed with more refractory patients.",

With repetitive use comes attribution of salience to the drug. Associated environmental items become conditioned stimuli that drive further, repetitive drug-seeking behaviour.",

      "abstract": "SYNOPSIS Migraine has been hypothesized to be the clinical expression of a deficiency in pain modulating mechanisms. Abnormalities in opiate receptor responsiveness may be an aspect of this dysfunction. In migraine patients, i.v. administration of pentazocine (15 mg), a kappa and sigma opiate receptor agonist, provoked: (1) disturbances in visual and/or body image perception in 9 of the 24 treated patients, different from controls where these phenomena were never observed; (2) other symptoms which were also reported by controls; (3) miosis, without differences from controls. No differences between common and classical migraine sufferers were found. In patients complaining of perceptive disorders from pentazocine the other symptoms were longer lasting and miosis less intense than in the remaining patients, who responded to the drug as controls did. Two subgroups of patients could be defined, with and without pentazocine‐induced perceptive disturbances, the former abnormally, the latter normally reacting to the drug. Pretreatment with naloxone (0.4 mg): (a) prevented pentazocine‐induced perceptive disturbances, (b) shortened duration of the other symptoms in both patients and controls, (c) antagonized pentazocine‐induced miosis in controls but not in patients. It was discussed whether reduced miosis in patients with pentazocine‐induced perceptive disorders depends on a hyporesponsiveness of kappa receptors, or may be attributed to the sigma opiate receptor hyperreactivity upon which the perceptive disturbances seem to depend.",

      "title": "STRESS COMBINED WITH EXTINCTION PREVENTS COCAINE RELAPSE BY DISRUPTING MEMORY",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Drug addiction is a chronic and recurrent brain disease. Addictive substances can cause changes in brain circuits and may be integrated into the memory system. Drug addiction consists of different phases, beginning when recreational use escalates to compulsive use and then cycles through withdrawal, and relapse. A relapse is a return to drinking or drug use after attempts have previously been made to stop. The prevention of relapses is perhaps the most fundamental task in addiction recovery. Repeated retrieval by the cue without reward stimulant reduces the behavioral response through a process called extinction. This learning is the fundamental principle underlying many cognitive- behavioral psychotherapeutic treatments. Yet behavioral change may be difficult to sustain, and relapse is not uncommon, even after successful treatment. Memory updating was applied to substance use problems by weakening the ability of drug-associated triggers to elicit substance use[1]. Stress can potentially affect all cognitive phases involved in memory function such as the process of memory storage, retrieval or/and consolidation. Stress prior to extinction might not only enhance the consolidation of extinction memory, like post-extinction stress does, but also make it less context- dependent[2]. Aims &amp; Objectives 1) Whether stress combined with extinction learning disrupts consolidated memory to suppress cocaine relapse. 2) What is the mechanism of stress combined with extinction learning suppressing drug seeking behavior. Method The self-administration of cocaine was used as an animal model for addictive memory. A combination of techniques, including immunofluorescence, fiber optic recording, brain slice patch-clamp recordings, and Golgi staining, was employed to explore the mechanism of stress combined with extinction in addictive memory. Results (1) The drug-priming test following self-administration extinction training suggested that rats exposed to footshock before extinction training (FE group) had a lower number of active nosepokes compared to extinction group (E group). Interestingly, in conditioned place avoidance test, footshock did not elicit an aversive response. (2) Fiber optic recording results showed excitatory neuron in LHb were more active in FE group during drug-priming test. Electrophysiological in vitro results suggested a significant increase in action potential firing and reduction of the threshold of the injected current to trigger the action potential in LHb. (3) Chemogenetic activation of neuron activity in LHb combined with extinction training effectively facilitated the elimination of cocaine addiction memory and reduced psychological craving. (4) Chemogenetic activation of neuron activity in LHb increased cfos expression in RMTg. Activation of LHb-RMTg also facilitated extinction and inhibited relapse. Activation of LHb-RMTg circuit could mimic the effect of stress combined with extinction in inhibiting relapse. Discussion &amp; Conclusion This study demonstrateed that stress combination with extinction training may promote the extinction of addictive memory and inhibit relapse by reshaping activity of neurons in the LHb-RMTg circuit.

The perception of these drugs as safe and harmless has make that they were able to reach an important peak between the young population in the last years for their utilisation with recreational aims but their use can lead to a high number of psychiatric and organic complications. The toxic dose is in the rage of the used as recreational. The worst risk of these drugs is due to the ignorance of the substances that are being taken, the dose given and' the variability of the individual response to them. It has to be added to these risks, the high frequency of consumption among them and with other drugs, mainly tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, cocaine and hallucinogens. Other factors that may cause an influence in the damage caused are the surround of consume (closed locals, high temperature...) and the particular characteristics of the consumer. To all this it has to be added the increased risk of traffic accidents related with changes in concentration and perception (visual mainly) under their effects. At this moment, it is demonstrated the capacity of this group of substances to produce neurotoxicity and, although we don't have definitive data to establish their irreversible nature, the experimentation with laboratory animals is showing more and more evidence in this direction.",

      "title": "An Initially Unsuspected Case of Baclofen Overdose",
      "abstract": "Intentional or accidental overdose of baclofen can cause central nervous system depression including coma, hypotonia, respiratory depression, and seizures, as well as cardiovascular effects such as bradycardia. These authors report a case of surreptitious baclofen intoxication in a patient with seizures and coma.Baclofen, a derivative of γ-aminobutyric acid, is used for symptomatic relief of skeletal muscle spasm and spasticity, particularly in patients with multiple sclerosis.1 Although its exact mechanism is not fully understood, its main effects at the spinal end of upper motor neurons are thought to cause muscle relaxation. Adverse effects of baclofen at usual doses include drowsiness, headache, dizziness, and, occasionally, orthostatic hypotension.2 Intentional or accidental overdose of this drug can cause profound central nervous system depression, including coma, hypotonia, respiratory depression, seizures, and cardiovascular effects such as bradycardia. Because baclofen is a commonly used antispasticity agent and its use as a recreational drug has been reported,3 clinicians should be ever vigilant for patients who may have overdosed on this medication. We report a case of surreptitious baclofen intoxication in a patient with seizures and coma.A 48-year-old, 80-kg man was transferred from a community hospital and admitted to the general intensive care unit of a referral tertiary care teaching hospital after members of his family found him at home unresponsive and having a grand mal seizure. The patient had no history of seizure disorder and had been seen awake and responsive approximately 2 to 2 ½ hours before the seizure. When found, he was apneic and incontinent of both bladder and bowel. He reportedly had vomited. Emergency responders intubated him at his home.Initial testing upon arrival at the community hospital included a basic metabolic panel (including serum electrolytes and creatinine), complete blood cell count, and liver function tests (including transaminases, albumin, bilirubin, and serum ammonia); all results were within the reference range. Computed tomography of the head showed no evidence of hemorrhage or other abnormality. A urine toxicology screen was positive for tetrahydrocannabinol and benzodiazepines (however, emergency medical personnel had administered diazepam because of continuing seizure activity) and negative for amphetamines, cocaine, barbiturates, and opioids. Blood alcohol level was zero. Vital signs upon admission were within the reference range except for blood pressures, which ranged from 174 to 207 mm Hg systolic and 99 to 119 mm Hg diastolic. These values decreased over the next several hours to normal without treatment.The patient's medical history was significant for a previous back injury for which he had taken pain medications long-term, specifically morphine in the past year, but he had reportedly stopped taking this drug about 1 month before the admission. He was not taking any other known medications at the time of hospitalization. He also had a history of alcohol abuse (he reportedly had quit drinking 8 years earlier). He received no treatment for suspected drug overdose at the outlying hospital.Upon transfer to the intensive care unit at the referral hospital, approximately 8 hours after the onset of the seizure, the patient was nonresponsive to verbal stimuli and manifested a decerebrate posture upon deep pain stimuli. Vital signs were normal, including blood pressure 130/70 mm Hg, heart rate 75/min, and temperature 37.2°C. His pupils were 3 mm in diameter and unresponsive to light. Pulses were +1/4 bilaterally with coolness in the lower extremities. The Babinski sign was negative, and the rest of a physical examination revealed no other abnormalities. The patient had no clonus. The results of repeat laboratory studies in the intensive care unit were within the reference range, including normal serum levels of sodium, creatinine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Results of the initial arterial blood gas analysis of samples obtained while the patient was receiving intermittent mechanical ventilation (fraction of inspired oxygen 0.60, positive end-expiratory pressure 5 cm H2O, respirations 12/min) were pH 7.40, PCO2 38 mm Hg, PO2 180 mm Hg, bicarbonate 23.3 mmol/L, and oxygen saturation 94%. All other laboratory values were within the reference range. Electroencephalography showed a burst-suppression pattern. The results of a computed tomography angiogram of the head and a lumbar puncture did not indicate any abnormalities.At this point, detailed questioning of the patient's family members and investigation of his medical records were undertaken to determine if he had access to or was exposed to any toxic substance. These inquiries revealed that in the past year he had been prescribed the muscle relaxant baclofen. On the basis of this new information, approximately 12 hours after admission to the intensive care unit and 16 hours after the onset of the seizure, a serum sample was sent to a reference laboratory for determination of the baclofen level. No specific treatment for baclofen overdose, including use of activated charcoal, was initiated.About 24 hours later, movement of the patient's extremities (left greater than right) was noted; the movement was determined to be nonpurposeful. Forty-eight hours later, the patient had a dramatic improvement in consciousness. He became alert and awake with his eyes opened. He was able to follow commands and was extubated about 12 hours later. Upon questioning, he revealed that he had attempted suicide by taking an entire bottle (unknown total quantity) of baclofen. He was eventually transferred to the inpatient psychiatric ward for treatment of major depression. The results of the serum assay for baclofen, which was received about 1 week after the patient's transfer to the psychiatric unit, was 1.2 μg/mL (reference serum level for treatment of spasticity is 0.08–0.4 μg/mL).2Although our patient had baclofen intoxication and, in hindsight, had many of the signs and symptoms associated with baclofen overdose, the correct diagnosis was not suspected until a detailed investigation of his medication history was done. The serum level of baclofen in a blood sample obtained approximately 16 hours after the onset of his signs and symptoms was roughly 3 times the upper limit of the reference range for the drug.2Using MEDLINE, we found only 2 reports4,5 published in the past 25 years on the pharmacokinetics in baclofen overdose. In the first report,4 baclofen pharmacokinetics were determined in a patient after an intentional overdose of 1230 mg; in this case, the elimination half-life was 4.58 hours. In the second report,5 a patient ingested more than 2 g of the drug; in this case, the elimination half-life was 8.6 hours. The authors of the second report did not find evidence of saturable kinetics in baclofen overdose.Interestingly, with chronic oral dosing, baclofen has an elimination half-life of about 6.5 hours.6 On the basis of this information, if we assume that the patient was found after most of the drug had been absorbed and we extrapolate back to the time of ingestion (and assume that maximum plasma concentrations occur about 2 hours after ingestion),1 we can estimate that the peak serum level ranged from 5.2 to 18.2 μg/mL (a standard first-order elimination equation was used for this calculation: CO = C x e−kT). If this estimation is accurate, the patient had a significantly higher serum level than has been usually reported in cases of baclofen overdose, though the pharmacokinetics of this drug in higher doses than those described is not known.3In a case series of adolescent boys who overdosed on baclofen, Perry et al3 noted that serum levels of the drug were linearly correlated with duration of mechanical ventilation. One patient with a serum level of baclofen of 0.85 μg/mL 14 hours after ingestion of the drug required 61 hours of mechanical ventilation. Our patient's serum level at 16 hours after ingestion was higher at 1.2 μg/mL, and correspondingly he required about 100 hours of mechanical ventilation. Of course, serum elimination half-life may not reflect a slower elimination rate from the central nervous system, a situation that may explain a significantly longer time on mechanical ventilation than the toxicokinetic data would suggest.Profound central nervous system depression is a recurring finding in patients who have baclofen poisoning, including a patient who had deep coma with no deep tendon, corneal, or gag reflexes.7 In one case,7 a patient ingested approximately 1800 mg of baclofen in addition to acetaminophen with codeine and oxazepam during an 18-day period. With supportive care, the patient was extubated and fully recovered within a week of the ingestion. A teenager who ingested about 500 mg of baclofen had central nervous system depression and coma, bradycardia, and hypertension.8 With supportive care, he also recovered fully about 48 hours after the ingestion. Other reports9,10 of baclofen overdose describe other cardiac conduction abnormalities such as supraventricular tachycardias, premature atrial contractions, and first-degree heart block. Encephalopathic manifestations, including seizures and respiratory depression, in cases of baclofen overdose also have been reported.11Management of baclofen overdose is primarily supportive. Activated charcoal would be expected to bind to the drug in the gut and is a reasonable course of action. A report12 from Taiwan described the use of hemodialysis in a patient who had been taking baclofen for leg muscle soreness. In this patient, serum levels of baclofen had decreased from 3.84 μg/mL to 0.82 μg/mL after a single 4-hour session of hemodialysis. This case suggests that hemodialysis may be an option for baclofen overdose, though more data are needed to make this procedure a routine recommendation. As our case and other cases illustrate, the prognosis is excellent if adequate supportive care (including mechanical ventilation) is provided.Our patient had many of the features of baclofen overdose described in the literature, including profound coma, seizure activity, hypotonia, and respiratory depression. Our case also highlights the need for a thorough investigation into possible ingestants in a patient with signs and symptoms similar to those of our patient. Baclofen is not routinely detected in urine toxicology screens, and clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for baclofen overdose in patients with a history of muscle spasms or chronic low back pain.In conclusion, our patient had surreptitious baclofen intoxication. Despite being in a deep coma and having hyporeflexia, respiratory depression, and seizures, he made a complete recovery. Healthcare personnel should consider baclofen overdose in any patient whose history and signs and symptoms are similar to those of our patient.",

Insomnia can significantly affect daytime functioning, leading to waking up in the morning tired, reduced productivity, a tendency to make mistakes and have accidents, inability to concentrate, frequent daytime sleep and a poor quality of life. The etiology and pathophysiology of insomnia include genetic, environmental, behavioural and physiological factors. Although insomnia can affect any gender and age group, women and the elderly are more vulnerable and are more likely to develop insomnia. A detailed sleep history is key to assessing insomnia. Clinicians must be able to recognise sleep disturbances and rule out other sleep-related disorders. The aim of treating insomnia is to improve sleep and alleviate the distress or dysfunction caused by this disorder. Psychological therapy methods, drug therapy, or combinations of these methods can be used to treat insomnia. Some behavioural interventions are feasible in primary care, but lack of training in these methods limits theiruse. Various natural and over-the-counter drugs, such as melatonin-based drugs, are used as sleeping pills. Melatonin has been evaluated as a sleeping pill in different doses, demonstrating a small but significant effect on sleep latency.",

Confusing nomenclature and a paucity of clinical research, however, have had clinicians wondering whether this syndrome may be both under-recognized and undertreated. Treatment options, including antidepressants, levodopa, and dextromethorphan/quinidine, may show promise in ameliorating symptoms for patients plagued with disorders of emotional expression.",

      "title": "Exercise for depression",
      "abstract": "Depression is a common clinical condition, affecting over 120 million people worldwide. People experience pervasive, sustained feelings of sadness and hopelessness, persistent loss of interest, enjoyment and motivation as well as disruptions in areas such as appetite, sleep, concentration and energy levels. It is an important cause of morbidity and mortality and produces a greater decrement in health than chronic diseases such as arthritis, diabetes and angina. Conventional treatments centre largely on pharmacological and psychological strategies, either on their own or in combination; but these are not acceptable to everyone. Antidepressant treatment can be complicated by side effects and drug interactions, and psychological therapies require motivation from the participant. Patients may also reject both antidepressants and psychological therapy because of perceived stigma. For several decades, exercise has been investigated as an alternative therapy for depression and several mechanisms have been proposed for its potential efficacy. It may provide distraction from negative thoughts or enhance a sense of self-efficacy through mastering a new skill. Social contact through exercise may also have a positive impact on mood and, from a more biological perspective, changes to circulating monoamines or endorphins, or reductions in the stress hormone cortisol, may also play a role. This review set out to conduct a meta-analysis of randomized trials of the effect of exercise in people with depression. We included studies comparing exercise with no treatment, as well as those that compared exercise with psychological or antidepressant approaches. The current version updates the earlier Cochrane Review, first published in 2009. We included trials of adults with a diagnosis of depression as defined by the original researchers. In assessing the intervention, we were guided by the American College of Sports Medicine definition of exercise as \"planned, structured and repetitive bodily movement done to improve or maintain one or more components of physical fitness\". We identified 39 trials, recruiting approximately 2300 participants, drawn from a variety of sources including inpatient and outpatient populations, as well as from the general public by media advertising. A diagnosis of depression was made either by structured diagnostic interview or through the use of rating scales, such as the Beck Depression Inventory or the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. The included trials varied widely with respect to the type of exercise, as well as its duration and frequency or the overall \"dose\" of exercise. Of the 39 trials, 32 provided aerobic exercise such as running, cycling, walking or dance; with 4 providing muscle-strengthening resistance training. Other trials provided a combination of aerobic and resistance training. There were further differences with respect to whether exercise was conducted alone or in groups, indoors or outdoors, supervised or unsupervised. Our main finding was that when compared to a control intervention, there was a moderate clinical effect in favour of exercise. However, this should be interpreted with caution, as when we analysed the six trials that were considered high quality, the effect size was clinically small and not statistically significant. A series of subgroup analyses suggested that a larger number of exercise sessions may have a greater clinical effect on mood and that resistance training or a mixture of aerobic and resistance training may be more efficacious than aerobic training alone. When exercise was compared with antidepressant medication, there was no statistical difference between the two interventions. Likewise for psychological therapy, our findings revealed no difference between this and an exercise intervention. The nature and extent to which exercise may have an effect on mood remains uncertain. Most included trials were small and many had methodological weaknesses. One inherent difficulty in these studies is that it is not possible to blind participants allocated to exercise. A further potential source of bias is that outcome measures for depression are often gathered from self-rated scales of depression, completed by the participants themselves before and after the intervention. The evidence in this review would be strengthened by further large-scale, high-quality studies, where all participants are diagnosed with depression through structured clinical interview and receive exercise as a stand-alone intervention. Further research comparing exercise with either anti depressant medication or psychological therapies, would also help resolve uncertainties about the choice between these options.",

Puede generar déficit notables en funciones psicológicas importantes como la ejecutiva, la atención o la memoria y evolucionar hasta un cuadro de pseudodemencia susceptible de mejorar con tratamiento antidepresivo.Objetivo: describir el funcionamiento de la memoria explícita en el trastorno depresivo mayor. Materiales y métodos: se hizo una búsqueda en la base de datos PUBMED con las palabras clave “major depression” (depresión mayor), “explicit memory” (memoria explícita) y “recollection memory” (memoria de recolección); se tomaron los artículos publicados después del año 2000; adicionalmente se incluyó bibliografía científica relevante para el cumplimiento del objetivo. Desarrollo: en la neuroanatomía del trastorno depresivo mayor se encuentran implicadas redes fronto-subcorticales (como las áreas prefrontales, tálamo, ganglios basales, hipocampo, entre otras). Estas estructuras pueden presentar atrofias que explicarían la persistencia o cronicidad de algunos de los síntomas cognitivos de la depresión. Las alteraciones en la memoria explícita, declarativa o de recolección, son de particular importancia por ser las más frecuentemente encontradas en sujetos con uno o más episodios depresivos mayores, y la estructura cerebral que se ha correlacionado más directamente con alteraciones en el almacenamiento de la memoria explícita es el hipocampo. Se ha observado actividad continua de neurogénesis en el hipocampo de animales adultos, la cual es especialmente susceptible cuando hay exposición prolongada a situaciones de estrés grave. Esto se evidencia en estudios que han encontrado reducido su volumen en sujetos con trastorno depresivo mayor, en comparación con individuos sanos. De todas maneras, aunque no se encuentre una reducción marcada del volumen, se sugiere que hay una alteración de su funcionamiento.Conclusiones: la memoria explícita es un proceso psicológico con base biológica precisa, cuya estructura y funcionamiento se alteran en presencia de una condición menos precisa como la depresión mayor.",

When these symptoms continue for ≥1 month and are associated with daytime dysfunction or distress, they reach the status of an insomnia disorder. Roughly 10% of adults in the United States have an insomnia disorder (hereafter referred to as insomnia), ie, that which is present on most nights and lasts ≥4 weeks. Insomnia can be primary, in which the sleep disturbance exists in the absence of co-existing medical or psychiatric disorders, or comorbid, when it is accompanied by one of these disorders. Although a diagnosis of insomnia requires difficulty with sleep, insomnia is a 24-hour disorder. Individuals with insomnia describe difficulties with concentration, fatigue, and mood, which both influence, and are influenced by, the sleep disturbance. In addition, insomnia is associated with a substantially elevated risk of incident major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder, and substance abuse disorders. There is also emerging evidence that insomnia increases the risk for incident hypertension and diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Alcohol dysphoria is a pathognomonic, severe, and therapeutically resistant syndrome considerable for alcohol and drug-addicted patients. The term “dysphoria” (from Greek δυσφορέω to suffer, torment, annoy) means an abnormally low type of mood, characterized by anger, gloom, irritability, feelings of hostility to others. In addictology, it is often identified in the withdrawal syndrome structure. Objectives To develop innovative improvement in treatment for alcohol dysphoria. Methods Valid clinical diagnostic, laboratory, biochemical, electrophysiological, psychological (scaling, testing), statistical methods identifying alcohol dependence complicated by dysphoria. Results The proposed method involves a complex of anti-affective, anti-abstinence, anti-craving pharmacological agents and drug-free methods, and differs from those conventional, along with psychotherapeutic potentiation, by additional targeted pharmacological triad (peroral Carbamazepine 200 mg twice a day: in the morning and in the evening; intramuscular Halopril (Haloperidol) 1 ml (5 mg) daily; oral Sonapax 1 tablet (25 mg) three times a day for 3-5 day treatment) used for a new purpose. 17 patients experienced this method. Efficacy: alcohol dysphoria acute manifestations were relieved by our method within 3-5 days that 37.8% exceeds conventional treatment. In 15 minutes, patients decreased irritability, motor restlessness, stress, cravings for alcohol. In 30 minutes, the patients fell asleep. Sleep lasted 3.5 hours on average. Subsequently, patients denied craving for alcohol, calmed down emotionally and psychomotorically, wished to be treated for alcoholism. No dysphoric relapses were observed. Conclusions The proposed multimodality method alleviates alcohol-induced dysphoria, involving pharmacotherapeutic triad along with psychotherapeutic potentiation.",

A relatively high risk of depression should always be considered when pharmacotherapy applied, especially if current depressive episodes, positive family history, or neurotic personality traits increasing susceptibility to depressogenic effects. Prior to start of medical treatment, the potential effectiveness of the given drug should be precisely evaluated, and alternative medical and non-medical treatment options should also be carefully considered. In addition, monitoring patients during treatment for signs of depressive or anxious symptoms is necessary. Orv. Hetil., 2013, 154, 1327–1336.",

Symptoms associated with use are often indistinguishable from those encountered with a primary mental illness and also include aggression, confusion, and anxiety. For these patients, clinicians rely on physical presentation, symptom(s) onset, and episode duration when evaluating patients.An adult man was involuntarily admitted to inpatient status secondary to reports of bizarre behaviors that included paranoia and psychomotor agitation. Because of the severity of the symptoms, he was unable to participate in the admission assessment. On day 2, he reported having smoked a substance provided by a friend. In addition, he admitted to previous SC use on 3 occasions, with each occasion resulting in an involuntary admission to inpatient status. The course of this admission was unremarkable.A brief overview of psychiatric signs and symptoms of SC use and information to help clinicians are included. The presentation of psychotic symptoms secondary to SC may be consistent with those of psychosis or other substances of abuse. Because of the variability in the symptoms produced by SC use, clinicians are encouraged to consider SC use in the diagnostic evaluation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Delirium is acute onset &amp; fluctuating disturbance in mental state that causes patient appear confused, disoriented or with difficulty to focus and with decline in cognitive function (memory, orientation, speech), circadian disturbance and behavior of patient either agitated or sleepy,in other words sudden confusion. Delirium, also known as acute confusional state, is an organically-caused decline from a previously baseline level of mental function that develops over a short period of time (hours to days). Delirium is not a disease itself, but a syndrome encompassing disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. It may also involve other neurological deficits, like psychomotor disturbances (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed), impaired sleepwake cycle, emotional disturbances, and perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations and delusions). Objective To determine incidence of post-operative delirium in geriatric patients undergoing hip replacement surgery using pre-operative haloperidol. Patients and Methods This study is conducted through geriatric patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and the incidence of pre.&amp; post-operative delirium. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted post-operative surgical ICU in Demerdash hospital which was closed unit and had the same well-established pain, sedation and delirium assessment practices. A delirium was monitored through CAM score in their stay in ICU (max. for &amp;7 days from admission post-operative). Results Several trials stated that the usage of Haloperidol pre-operative decrease the duration and the severity of Delirium rather than the incidence of delirium. In our trial we will detect the incidence of delirium with using prophylactic haloperidol in geriatric patients undergoing Hip replacement surgery. In our study revealed that using prophylactic pre-operative haloperidol decrease the incidence of delirium among geriatric patient as well as decreasing both the duration and the severity of delirium among the study group. Conclusion Our study and results revealed that Haloperidol as antipsychotic drug have beneficial effect on reduction of incidence of delirium in post-operative geriatric patients, also it showed effect on duration of delirium and severity of the disease as well as ICU stay.",

Klagen über Ein- und Durchschlafstörungen, frühmorgendliches Erwachen und damit verbundene Beeinträchtigung der Befindlichkeit während des Tages betreffen etwa 10 % der Bevölkerung in den meisten westlichen Industrienationen. Ursächlich für chronische Schlaflosigkeit können körperliche Erkrankungen, psychische Erkrankungen, die Einnahme von Medikamenten, Genussmittel oder Drogen sein. Ein Drittel aller chronischen Insomnien wird als primäre Insomnie oder insomnische Störung bezeichnet, wenn keiner der oben genannten Faktoren ursächlich identifiziert werden kann. Üblicherweise werden chronische Insomnien in der ärztlichen Praxis medikamentös mit Hypnotika oder anderen sedierenden Substanzen, wie etwa sedierenden Antidepressiva behandelt. In den letzten 20 Jahren hat sich gezeigt, dass kognitiv-verhaltenstherapeutische Ansätze (KVT) bei chronischen Insomnien auch unabhängig von der Ursache erfolgreich eingesetzt werden können. Zu den Methoden der kognitiven Verhaltenstherapie gehört die Aufklärung über Schlaf und Schlafhygiene (Psychoedukation), Entspannungstechniken wie etwa die progressive Muskelentspannung, spezifische verhaltenstherapeutische Techniken wie etwa die Stimuluskontrolle oder die Schlafrestriktion sowie kognitive Techniken zur Reduktion nächtlicher Grübeleien. Aufgrund von mehreren, in den letzten Jahren veröffentlichten Meta-Analysen können diese Techniken insbesondere in ihrer Applikation als Kombinationstherapie, als evidenz-basiert und der pharmakologischen Therapie als kurzzeitig gleichwertig und langfristig überlegen angesehen werden. Die kognitiv-verhaltenstherapeutischen Techniken der Insomniebehandlung können von darin geschulten Ärzten und Psychotherapeuten mit Erfolg eingesetzt werden.",

      "abstract": "Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is an affective disorder of emotional expression characterized by frequent uncontrollable outbursts of laughing or crying. It is usually associated with stroke, traumatic brain injury, and other neurological conditions. This disorder can present a challenge to clinicians to distinguish this from mood disorders or to diagnose this disorder in the context of underlying mood disorders. In addition, the delay in the diagnosis can impact patients' quality of life. We describe a 48-year-old man who presented with frequent episodes of sudden, frequent, uncontrollable laughing two years after his recurrent stroke. The patient initially had his first stroke about three years ago and had a recurrent stroke eight months after his first stroke. A few days after getting discharged after his second stroke, the patient was admitted to the psychiatric unit after his family members reported aggressive behavior. The patient also reported symptoms of depression and was discharged on escitalopram for mood and divalproex for his aggressive behavior. Unfortunately, the patient was not compliant with these medications with no resolution of his symptoms. The patient was then treated with dextromethorphan-quinidine, escitalopram, and divalproex, resulting in significant improvement in his mood and aggressive behavior with a resolution of uncontrollable laughing spells. Clinicians are encouraged to inquire about symptoms of pseudobulbar affect in the context of stroke or other neurological disorders. Appropriate management of this condition can help improve patients' symptoms and positively affect their wellbeing.",

Withdrawal includes all manifestations of the \"abstinence sickness\" except delirium. Common symptoms include anxiety, restlessness, irritability, insomnia, and impaired attention. Withdrawal delirium is a complication of certain substance-specific withdrawal syndromes associated with dependence on alcohol or hypnotic-sedative-anxiolytic drugs. Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium is a serious withdrawal complication occurring in about 5% of cases and occasionally leading to death from intercurrent illness. In cases involving dependence on a short-acting barbiturate, the pentobarbital challenge test helps to establish the degree of barbiturate tolerance and determine the initial pentobarbital requirement. In mild-to-moderate Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication, if the patient is conscious and ambulatory, the management is primarily directed to monitoring the vital signs and controlling agitation or aggressiveness.",

PTSD is characterized by three symptom clusters: (1) reexperiencing of the traumatic event; (2) avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event and emotional numbing; and (3) hyperarousal symptoms (1). PTSD results in significant distress and morbidity. For example, following an assault a person may experience intrusive thoughts of the assault, suffer from nightmares of threat or assault, or experience flashbacks of all or some portions of the assault. Avoidance of reminders is common and may include, for example, avoidance of the site of the assault or similar places, avoidance of people who are similar to the perpetrator, or avoidance of conversations about community or domestic violence. Following a traumatic event, emotional numbing such as a sense of being unable to have loving feelings, feeling detached from others, or having decreased interest may occur. Difficulty falling asleep, being easily startled, irritability, and hypervigilance are common hyperarousal symptoms (see DSM-IV for criteria) (1).",

Nocturnal withdrawal symptoms may lead to an increased duration of wakefulness, and to tachycardia and sweating in the second half of the night. It is not known by which mechanism alcohol affects sleep; however, effects do not appear to depend on the stimulation of benzodiazepine receptors or the antagonism at adenosine receptors. Alcohol can exacerbate primary sleep disturbances such as sleep apnea and nocturnal myoclonus, and thereby contribute to excessive daytime sleepiness. The sleep of alcoholic patients is characterized by increased sleep latency, and reduced sleep efficiency, total sleep time, slow wave sleep and non-REM sleep. Even during abstinence, the changes in sleep architecture can persist for months or years, and might contribute to a relapse into alcoholism. The use of benzodiazepines or other hypnotics to treat alcohol-related sleep disturbances is not recommended.",

A diagnosis of “Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominantly Inattentive type’’ was made according to the diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM IV) and long-acting methylphenidate treatment was started. Gastrointestinal side effects such as anorexia and nausea due to the drug occurred with 36 mg/day long-acting methylphenidate treatment and methylphenidate was discontinued. Atomoxetine treatment was started at 25 mg/day in the first week, 40 mg/day for 2 weeks and then 60 mg/day (1.2 mg/kg/day) maintenance. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms such as symmetry obsession, not being sure of having done something, and constant need for approval occurred after the use of 60 mg of atomoxetine per day. A diagnosis of ADHD + Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) was made according to DSM IV-TR following a re-evaluation.

Articles were classified according to a four-tiered level of evidence scheme. Recommendations were based on the evidence. <b>Results and Conclusions: </b> 1. Early falls, poor response to levodopa, symmetry of motor manifestations, lack of tremor, and early autonomic dysfunction are probably useful in distinguishing other parkinsonian syndromes from Parkinson disease (PD). 2. Levodopa or apomorphine challenge and olfactory testing are probably useful in distinguishing PD from other parkinsonian syndromes. 3. Predictive factors for more rapid motor progression, nursing home placement, and shorter survival time include older age at onset of PD, associated comorbidities, presentation with rigidity and bradykinesia, and decreased dopamine responsiveness. Future research into methods for earlier and more accurate diagnosis of the disease and identification and clarification of predictive factors of rapid disease progression is warranted.",

      "title": "Delayed post-hypoxic parkinsonism with leukoencephalopathy associated with carbon monoxide poisoning",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy is a rare disorder that occurs following any event that causes prolonged cerebral hypo-oxygenation.[1] The earliest cases of this condition were associated with carbon monoxide (CO) exposure, which continues to be the most common inciting agent.[2] However, delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy is also associated with cardiac arrest, strangulation, anesthetic or surgical complications, benzodiazepine or opiate overdose, and hemorrhagic shock.[3-7] Although its exact incidence is unknown, it is likely to increase due to the decreased fatality rate resulting from improved medical care of the aforementioned causes; for example, the mortality rate with CO poisoning has decreased from 33% to 3% since the early 19th century.[8] Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy characteristically presents in two phases: altered sensorium followed by complete recovery and a subsequent acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome with or without associated features such as parkinsonism, mutism, hyperreflexia, and frontal release signs. The lucid interval typically lasts 1–3 weeks (with a range of 2–40 days).[2] Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain reveals diffuse symmetrical anterior predominant cerebral white matter demyelination. A typical history with MRI findings that exclude alternative possibilities is sufficient for diagnosis. Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent unnecessary and unwarranted investigations and treatment. We present a case of delayed post-hypoxic parkinsonism and leukoencephalopathy following CO poisoning to emphasize the importance of early diagnosis. A 39-year-old man, with no prior comorbidities or addictions, was discovered unconscious in his room by his brother. The patient had not experienced any previous symptoms of fever, headache, or seizures but had slept in his room with burning logs of coal for warmth the previous night. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he received a Glasgow coma scale score of E3V1M5 (9/15) and was intubated for airway protection. There were no signs of meningeal involvement. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed nonspecific changes [Figure 1], and his cerebrospinal fluid examination and routine investigations were within normal ranges. He was treated with high-flow oxygen and showed improvement over the next five days, following which he was extubated. He gradually regained near baseline status and was discharged after ten days. However, one week after his discharge, he developed a sudden onset of worsening behavioral symptoms (aggression and verbal abuse), generalized stiffness, and slowed activities (required more time to do tasks such as washing, eating, and conducting daily living activities). He also exhibited intellectual abnormalities (inability to understand spoken words, producing incomprehensible sounds, and forgetfulness regarding navigating around the house). Therefore, he was referred to our facility for further management. Upon examination, he appeared drowsy with mask-like facies and displayed cog-wheel rigidity, bradykinesia, and hyperreflexia in all limbs (without asymmetry). He did not exhibit tremors, his extra-ocular movements were normal, and he did not experience postural instability. A detailed cognitive and sensory assessment was not possible, and he did not present with any focal neurological deficits.Figure 1: Axial T2-WI (a, c) images show nonspecific multiple hyperintense foci in the deep frontal white matter (arrows in a) and bilateral centrum semiovale (c). These lesions are hyperintense on DWI (arrows in b and d) without any diffusion restriction in the ADC maps (not shown)The routine blood investigations were normal. The MRI brain revealed widespread bilateral white matter hyperintensities, without any restriction in diffusion and with patchy contrast enhancement [Figure 2]. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed a slightly increased protein level (83 mg/dl) with no presence of cells and normal sugar levels. Viral markers for HIV, hepatitis B and C, serum and CSF autoimmune and paraneoplastic panel, extractable nuclear antigen panel, blood and urine toxicology screen, and CSF-venereal disease research laboratory all yielded negative results. The electroencephalogram revealed a diffuse delta slowing of brain waves.Figure 2: Follow-up MRI displays diffuse confluent symmetrical white matter hyperintensity T2-WI (a, b) and diffusion-weighted images (c, d) without any diffusion restriction in the ADC maps (e, f). Multiple foci of hyperintensities (arrows in b) are observed within the bilateral centrum semiovale, Following gadolinium administration, no enhancement is seen except for a few enhancing foci in the left centrum semiovaleBased on the patient's clinical presentation and the results of the investigations, a diagnosis of delayed post-hypoxic neurological deterioration was established. The patient was managed conservatively with the administration of atypical antipsychotics (quetiapine), levodopa-carbidopa, and baclofen. He continued to improve gradually and approached the baseline status over 6 months. Our patient developed delayed post-hypoxic neurological deterioration caused by CO poisoning resulting from sleeping in a closed room with biofuel combustion. CO binds tightly and preferentially to hemoglobin, thereby preventing oxygen binding and causing anemic hypoxia.[1] In addition, it inhibits cytochrome oxidase activity, inhibiting aerobic respiration.[1] Hypo-oxygenation and associated energy depletion of cerebral white matter lead to delayed apoptosis of oligodendrocytes due to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity.[9] CO poisoning can also occur from the use of gas geysers in domestic settings.[10] Correia et al.[10] reported cases of 26 patients developing unexplained neurodeficits while bathing in ill-ventilated bathrooms with gas geysers. Thirteen of these patients presented with acute CO intoxication, and two of them later developed parkinsonian features. Lee and Marsden reported cases of delayed post-hypoxic neurological manifestations as typically conforming to either parkinsonism or akinetic mutism along with the neuro-behavioral syndrome.[11] The patients who develop parkinsonism develop varying combinations of short-steppage gait, decreased arm swing, rigidity, bradykinesia, mask-like facies, and a stooped posture.[11] Certain patients even develop concomitant dystonic posturing of the limbs. Approximately 60% of the patients improve with supportive treatment and recover independent ambulation within 10–148 days after sequelae onset.[11] In our case, the patient had developed typical parkinsonian features (i.e., rigidity, bradykinesia, mask-like facies with hypokinetic dysarthria) and responded well to conservative management with levodopa and low doses of antipsychotics. The patient recovered his baseline status at the 6-month follow-up visit. Alternative diagnoses were ruled out through imaging, blood tests, and CSF testing. The prompt diagnosis and treatment prevented unnecessary resource utilization, such as brain biopsy or other invasive procedures, and provided symptomatic relief. Acknowledgment None.

Deficiency of postsynaptic excitatory neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin and a surplus of presynaptic inhibitory neurotransmitters such as GABA and glutamate (mainly a postsynaptic excitatory and partly a presynaptic inhibitory neurotransmitter), can be found in the involved brain regions. However, neuropeptide alterations (galanin, neuropeptide Y, substance P) also play an important role in its pathogenesis. A neural network is described, including the alterations of neuroactive substances at specific subreceptors. Currently, major depression is treated with monoamine reuptake inhibitors. An additional therapeutic option could be the administration of antagonists of presynaptic inhibitory neurotransmitters or the administration of agonists/antagonists of neuropeptides.",

It is important to distinguish these from the symptoms of an ongoing or latent medical or psychiatric condition that are magnified in the premenstrual period. A number of preexisting psychiatric conditions may worsen premenstrually, including: affective disorders (depression and mania), anxiety disorders, bulimia, substance abuse, and the psychoses. The physical symptoms are reported to occur cyclically in premenstrual dysphoric disorder or premenstrual syndrome: fatigue, headache, bloating or swelling, breast tenderness, changes in appetite, insomnia, hypersomnia, weight gain, backache, and, more rarely, acne, gastrointestinal upset, vertigo, fainting, heart palpitations, flushing, clumsiness. The complex downstream effects of cycling estrogen and progesterone are believed to account for the multitude of possible manifestations of these disorders as well as for the exacerbation of certain medical and psychiatric conditions in relation to the menstrual cycle.",

Post concussion syndrome is a constellation of symptoms that may follow a mild to moderate closed head injury. Symptoms of post concussion syndrome include headache, depression, irritability, memory impairment, alcohol intolerance, dizziness or vertigo, attention and concentration difficulties, and loss of libido. Concussion, minor head injury, and minor traumatic brain injury are difficult to define, compared with moderate or severe injury, in which structural damage is evident. The American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine defined minor traumatic brain injury as “a traumatically induced physiological disruption of brain function” with at least one of the following: (1) any period of loss of consciousness; (2) any memory loss for events just before or after the accident; (3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the accident; and (4) focal neurologic deficits that may or may not be transient (Packard, 1999).",

We present a case of cocaine-induced excited delirium in a cocaine \"body packer\" or a \"mule\", specifically an individual who attempts to smuggle cocaine within the body. Investigators at the scene initially suspected homicide due to the victim's sharp and blunt force injuries. Three rubber packets containing cocaine were removed from the victim's rectum. Blood toxicological analysis revealed an alcohol concentration of 0.016 g/100 and cocaine >1 mg/L. The forensic pathologist should consider cocaine-induced excited delirium when an individual exhibits aggressive behavior, unexpected strength, and resistance to pain who dies suddenly. Further analysis should be performed during the scene investigation and autopsy for evidence of body packing.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To quickly diagnose migraine without aura in a busy practice clinical in India and other developing countries. Background: Differentiating migraine from episodic tension type headaches is difficult if one strictly follows International classification of headache disorders- 3rd edition beta version (ICHD 3 Beta), as there are many overlapping statements. Another problem is applying criterion E, not better accounted for by another ICHD 3 beta diagnosis. Duration, presence of head pain and associated migraine diagnostic symptoms except vomiting and nausea are not mandatory to diagnose Episodic syndromes that may be associated with migraine (ICHD 3 Beta code 1.6) or Periodic syndromes (ICHD2) that are commonly precursors of migraine. Methods: A retrospective chart review was done on 6,200patients. All were diagnosed as Migraine without aura, Probable migraine or Benign secondary headaches, and the following four common features were identified- recurrent headaches / activity affected / absolutely normal in between episodes/ no red flags present. History of two more additional helpful diagnostic features was also noted - Common migraine triggers precipitating these headaches and family history of migraine or its synonyms. Exclusion criteria include aura, autonomic manifestations, headaches lasting more than 3 days, headaches with migraine features that are not activity dependent, post dromal symptoms, fever and other systemic disorders. Results: 92% of patients fulfilled the four simple migraine diagnostic features. 88% had one of the common migraine triggers precipitating their headaches and 91% had family history of migraine. Conclusion: Recurrent activity affected headaches with absolute normality in between episodes and without any red flags, should lead one to consider the diagnosis of migraine without aura.",

      "title": "Understanding depression beyond the “mind‐body” dichotomy",
      "abstract": "In both the ICD-11 and the DSM-5, the core symptoms of depression are reported to be depressed mood (e.g., feeling sad, down or hopeless) and markedly diminished interest or pleasure in activities. However, in the ICD-10 diagnostic guidelines, a third core symptom was also identified: \"fatigue or low energy\". In two regions of the world (Latin America and East Asia), \"fatigue\" is the most commonly experienced depressive symptom1. In a third region (Southeast Asia), \"issues with the heart\" are the most commonly reported depressive symptoms, along with depressed mood1. Do people in these regions just \"somatize\" what is primarily a \"psychological\" experience? Do \"somatic\" symptoms just represent a \"mask\", as implied some decades ago by the concept of \"masked depression\"2? An alternative view may be that the core of the depressive syndrome, at least in part of the cases of this heterogeneous condition, is neither only \"psychic\" nor only \"somatic\", but consists of an actual \"depression\" of the individual's psychic/physical tone, energy, drive and/or response to rewarding stimuli (partially captured by the constructs of depressed mood, fatigue, and diminished interest or pleasure), along with an overwhelming feeling of psychic/physical pain (which has a complex and probably variable relationship to the cognitive component of the syndrome). The way these core phenomena are perceived, elaborated and verbalized by the affected person likely depends upon how that person generally functions and appraises her functioning (e.g., how rich and articulated her cognitive life is, or how much she is focused on her body and its functioning), upon the influence of the cultural environment in which she is immersed, and upon the pattern of predisposing and precipitating factors at work in that individual case. Feelings involving the heart (\"heavy heart\", \"heart pain\"; chest tightness, weakness or excessive tension; palpitations) do not appear in textbook descriptions of depression, but are more frequently experienced by depressed individuals than we use to believe1. Ordinary people sometimes refer to depression as \"broken heart\", and we tend to regard this as a metaphor. But, the acute \"broken heart syndrome\" – which has the same precipitating factors as depression and, similarly to the heart involvement in depression, is ascribed to a sympathetic overactivation – is now a recognized clinical entity3. An intrinsic cardiac nervous system (\"a brain in the heart\") has been recently described4, including a multitude of nervous ganglions consisting not only of neurons receiving sympathetic and parasympathetic input, but also of intracardiac interneurons which act as processors of information. Indeed, the heart conveys to the brain more information than the brain sends to the heart, and ascending fibres in the vagus nerve are more numerous than descending ones. Could the above dynamics be an under-recognized factor contributing to the frequent coexistence (\"comorbidity\") and complex interaction between depression and heart disease? That many patients with a diagnosis of depression do not respond adequately to two subsequent antidepressant medications (\"treatment resistance\") is not surprising. Clinical trials of both medications and psychotherapies for depression have aimed during the past few decades to document the \"equivalence\" of any new experimental intervention to an already consolidated one, while \"differences\" in the profiles of action of those interventions have usually not been a focus of attention. Consequently, antidepressants and evidence-based psychotherapies for depression are regarded by treatment guidelines as essentially all \"equivalent\" to each other. It is only recently that secondary analyses of large trial databases, conducted using innovative methodologies, have started to focus again on the \"differences\" between the various antidepressants, and between antidepressants and evidence-based psychotherapies, with respect to their profiles of action5, 6. On the other hand, it is not common in ordinary practice that a patient with a diagnosis of depression receives a detailed clinical characterization beyond that diagnosis, guiding the choice of treatment. It is therefore understandable that a person may receive two or more antidepressants that, although validated for depression tout court, are not among the most appropriate for her specific case, and consequently may not elicit an adequate response. Furthermore, medications do not work in a vacuum: a variety of \"aspecific\" factors (e.g., the therapeutic relationship, family dynamics, the socio-cultural context) may affect the outcome of an intrinsically efficacious intervention. The concept of \"pseudo-resistance\" does not adequately consider at the moment these factors (not to mention problems with the definition of what is an \"adequate response\" to an antidepressant, difficulties in ascertaining the adherence to the antidepressant regimens that have been used, and the basic incongruence of defining a case as \"treatment-resistant\" when one group of therapies currently regarded as first-line in the treatment of depression, i.e. psychotherapies, have not been tried). In this issue of the journal, two papers and a Forum deal, respectively, with the lived experience of depression7, with its multiple \"physical comorbidities\"8, and (in a critical vein) with \"treatment-resistant depression\" and its management9. I think these contributions should be welcome by the scientific community, by people with depression and their families, and by the public at large. A \"depression\" of the individual's psychic/physical tone, energy, drive and/or response to rewarding stimuli may be the outcome of repeated and inescapable adverse events, but also of a disruption of circadian rhythms, a non-psychiatric disease, or the use of certain medications. Or it may occur in the absence of any such evidence as far as the person is aware of, as often happens in bipolar disorder. Perhaps research should more actively focus on those core phenomena, building on the reports of experts by experience and exploring their biological correlates, without any prejudice about whether they are primarily or essentially psychic or physical in nature. The effects of the various antidepressant medications could perhaps be explored – beyond current stereotypes – in the same light (are they psychophysical \"tonics\"?; do they have energizing or disinhibiting properties?; do they affect reward responsiveness?; do they impact psychic/physical pain?), through a more in-depth and nuanced reconstruction of patients' experiences of \"response\" to those agents, and a more targeted investigation of their biological correlates. The same may apply to the effects of other interventions, from physical exercise and behavioural activation to neurostimulation techniques. Neuroscientific explorations of depression should probably look at the autonomic as well as the central nervous system (and at their interactions with the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems in addition to the immune and endocrine ones). Finally (or first of all), some more psychopathological sophistication should perhaps be added to the current conceptualization and description of \"depression\".",

Minor depressive disorder is more prevalent in primary care than major depressive disorder. Failure to adequately treat this condition may have far-reaching impact on the health, functional status, quality of life, and cost of care for patients who have it.

According to it, anxiety is conceptualized as a negative or unpleasant emotion characterized by subjective distress, high physiological activation, unadapted motor responses; at the same time, anxiety is linked to individual differences in certain situational areas (specific traits). Anxiety reactions appear due to subject perceives that a certain situation seems threating (situation's appraisal), with no apparent solution due to a lack of resources (coping abilities). For somebody, certain consummatory behaviors such as eating, alcohol consumption, smoking, or drug abuse could relieve distress symptoms or reduce physiological activation producing by anxiety. However, such consumption behaviors could become more and more necessary in order to alleviate anxiety symptoms or avoiding the withdrawal, which is a clinical syndrome including intense anxiety manifestations. The possibility to stop the consumption is interpreted as a threatening situation which provokes more anxiety; the only coping response available is to maintain consumption. Regarding addiction treatments, there are significant interactions between type of treatment x type of patient. Anxiety is on of the variables evaluated in order to design more effective treatments matched with the characteristics of the patient.",

      "title": "The effectiveness of preferred or familiar music listening on behavioural and psychological symptoms of institutionalised older adults with dementia: a systematic review",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective Is preferred or familiar music listening effective in reducing behavioural and psychological symptoms of institutionalised older adults with all types of dementia? For institutionalised older adults with all types of dementia what is the evidence about the: Frequency of use of preferred or familiar music listening; Length of preferred or familiar music listening per session. Background Dementia is a severe public health problem affecting over 35 million people worldwide1. Dementia is a syndrome of cognitive deterioration which may result in changes in personality and interfere with activities of daily living and social functions2. According to the Progressively Lowered Stress Threshold model (PLST), older adults with cognitive impairment caused by wide range of psychological reactions, psychiatric symptoms, and behaviors which may be disruptive, unsafe and impair the care of patients with dementia in a given environment4. Specific symptoms may include apathy, agitation, aggression, depression, anxiety, wandering, psychotic symptoms and others5. Of those diagnosed with dementia, more than two-thirds experience BPSD6. BPSD may cause significant impairment of social or occupational functioning in those with dementia2 and place tremendous burden on family caregivers and nursing staff in the care of those with dementia as well as a strain on health care resources7. BPSD in older people with dementia are typically managed with the use of psychotropic medications, but these treatments present risks for adverse effects8. Use of psychotropic medications in those with dementia has to be cautious due to the unwanted side effects9, and a further study concludes that the adverse effects of antipsychotics, including an increased risk of stroke and death, offset its potential advantages10. Given the concerns associated with the use of antipsychotic medications for BPSD, a wide range of non-pharmacological strategies have been suggested to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms. One approach is modifying environmental factors that place too much demand or pressures on the individual and this has been suggested as one of the most effective interventions in reducing behavioural problems of those with dementia in residential care facilities11. Introducing a sense of familiarity into a new environment or maximising familiarity in an existing environment can enhance the functional abilities of those with dementia12, 13. Using aspects of prior familiar environments can modify unpleasant and external stimuli in the environment and prevent anxiety in those with dementia14. One other non-pharmacological care approach which has been frequently suggested to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms is use of music15. Music has been shown to positively influence a broad range of outcomes including alleviating anxiety, promoting relaxation, improving mood, reducing pain, decreasing agitation, improving exercise performance, and increasing food intake among various populations16. Listening to preferred music in particular has been suggested to effectively manage agitated behaviours of older adults with dementia15, 17-19. Familiar music from the past can assist in memory recall and elicit memories associated with positive feelings15. Researchers indicate that the areas of the brain that respond to music are the last to deteriorate in dementia and suggested that music may be one form of communication that remains preserved in people with dementia who respond to music20. Older people are usually fond of music that was popular during their youth21. Music from religious services, patriotic ceremonies or cultural events would have specific meaning to the person's life15. Music that elicits positive memories from the past can have a soothing effect, and these positive feelings, in turn, will prevent or reduce agitation in people who are aged 65 or above with dementia15, 21. Listening to familiar or preferred music can enhance the sense of familiarity into a new environment or maximise familiarity in an existing environment for those with dementia to stimulate their memories associated with pleasant feelings and thereby induce relaxation22 and reduce anxiety23 and enhance their functional abilities12, 13. music is proposed to be accessible, relatively inexpensive, and easy to use with those with dementia28, 29. Several reviews have focused on the use of music for older people with dementia and found beneficial effects on their behaviours and social interaction30-34. Some reviews on music and dementia research included different types of music activities and various outcomes. For example, Vink et al33 reviewed randomised controlled trials related to effects of music therapy on behavioural problems, social, cognition, and emotion, and concluded that there is no substantial evidence to support nor discourage the use of music therapy in the care of older people with dementia. In Sheratt et al's review34, they included different types of music therapy, such as group music activities or individual or group listening to all types of music, and concluded that music have the potential to reduce problematic behaviours and provide engagement in meaningful activity. However, these reviews limited the generalisability of findings as they failed to differentiate which type of music activities worked for which outcomes in older adults with dementia. Sung and Chang29 conducted a review of eight studies which specifically focused on preferred music on agitated behaviours of older adults with dementia and reported that the evidence was inconclusive due to small sample sizes and variations in the application of the preferred music intervention across the studies. In addition, previous reviews only included studies written in English and published in English journals, and did not include studies which were published in other languages. This review will focus on studies determining the effects of preferred or familiar music listening or comparisons of preferred or familiar music listening with other types of interventions for managing behavioural and psychological symptoms in older adults with dementia, and will include published studies written in English or Chinese. This review will be a joint review conducted by the Queensland Centre for Evidence Based Nursing & Midwifery and the Taiwanese Centre for Evidence-based Health Care. One reviewer from each centre, who is competent in reading, writing, and speaking both in English and Chinese, will conduct the searching, relevance checking and quality appraisal of the studies written in English or Chinese. Inclusion criteria Types of participants This review will consider studies that include adults aged 65 or older and diagnosed with all types of dementia who exhibit behavioural or psychological symptoms living in long-term care institutions. Behavioural or psychological symptoms to be included: agitation; aggressive behaviours; aggression, disruptive behaviours, anxiety; depression. Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest This review will consider studies that evaluated preferred or familiar music listening interventions for the prevention or reduction of behavioural or psychological symptoms of older adults with dementia. This review will consider studies that include the following outcome measures: behavioral and psychological symptoms, agitation, agitated behaviours, aggressive behaviours, aggression, disruptive behaviours, anxiety, or depression. Types of studies This review will consider any randomised controlled trials (RCT); In the absence of RCT's, other research designs such as non-randomized controlled trials and before and after studies will be considered for inclusion. In addition to excluding studies that were not reported in English or Chinese, this review will exclude studies with patients receiving music listening without considering music preferences and familiarity. Observational, cohort, case-control, and qualitative studies will be excluded. Search strategy The search strategy aims to find published studies in peer review journals written in English and Chinese from 1990-2010. A three-step search strategy will be utilized in each component of this review. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL will be undertaken followed by analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe article. A second search using all identified keywords and index terms will then be undertaken across all included databases. Thirdly, the reference list of all identified reports and articles will be searched for additional studies. Additional hand search in music journals will also be conducted. The databases to be searched include:PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsyInfo, PsychArticles, Cochrane Library, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, Music Index (via EBSCOhost) as well as Chinese publication databases. The Chinese databases will include: (1) http://www.ceps.com.tw (2) http://www.cetd.com.tw (3) http://www.ncl.edu.tw/journal/journal_docu01.htm Initial keywords to be used will be‘preferred music’, ‘individualized music’, ‘familiar music’, ‘behavioural and psychological symptoms’, ‘agitated behaviours’, ‘agress*’, ‘agitat*’, ‘anxiety’, ‘depress*’, ‘dementia’, ‘Alzheimer's disease’, ‘preferred music and dementia’, ‘preferred music and Alzheimer's disease’, ‘familiar music and dementia’ and ‘familiar music and Alzheimer's disease’. Assessment of methodological quality Quantitative papers selected for retrieval will be assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardised critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) (Appendix I). Any disagreements that arise between the reviewers will be resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. the review question and specific objectives. Data synthesis Quantitative results will, where possible be pooled in statistical meta-analysis using the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI). All results will be subject to double data entry. Odds ratio (for categorical data) and weighted mean differences (for continuous data) and their 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for analysis. Heterogeneity will be assessed using the standard Chi-square. Where statistical pooling is not possible the findings will be presented in narrative form. None",

      "title": "[Pharmacological treatment in alcohol-, drug- and benzodiazepine-dependent patients - the significance of trazodone].",
      "abstract": "Currently detoxification of drug and alcohol dependent patients is pharmacologically unresolved, and long-term treatment following the acute phase is also not very successful including a high number of relapses. We would need medications that on the short term cease: the severe vegetative symptoms, the pain, the extremely distressing psychosyndrome characterised by restlessness, anxiety or acute depressive symptoms, and the craving. The optimal would be if there was one medication capable of simultaneously alleviating or diminishing all the above symptoms without causing dependency and preventing relapse in the long-term. Dependency is almost all cases accompanied by primary and/or secondary mood disorder or sleep disorder which should also be treated. It should be considered, however, that following withdrawal of the agent benzodiazepine dependency often develops. The serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI) trazodone is effective in the treatment of depression accompanied by sleeping disorder and it has also shown efficacy in alcohol and benzodiazepine-dependency. Its administration may improve the efficacy of detoxification and treatment of following conditions, may decrease medication load and the risk of the development of benzodiazepine dependency. In our clinical practice we frequently use this agent to treat our patients simultaneously suffering from depression and addiction problems, gaining experience comparing it to other pharmacotherapies (benzodiazepines or other antidepressants). The medication is not approved for alcohol and drug dependence, however, treatment t of comorbid conditions is not against to the official recommendations. Our aim was, in addition to reviewing the literature, to share our experience which, although cannot be considered an evidence based study, we deemed worthy of publishing. We cannot, at this point, put forward a protocol addressing all related scientific problems and problems of off-label treatment, and we could not so far treat enough patients with trazodone so that our results would be statistically proven. \"Acute\" and long term treatment of dependency is not sufficiently effective with a substantial relapse rate, which is in part related to the lack of specific medication also for long term treatment. Among the available psychopharmacons, trazodone is a possible choice, since, as based on patients' reports and clinical observations, improvement of their depressive conditions and sleep problems potentially decreases the risk of relapse of drug and alcohol dependence.",

The adaptations that are responsible for these effects are different from those that underlie addiction. These adaptations are described in detail in this chapter. The chapter is based on DSM-IV definitions whenever dealing with prevalence rates.

Many psychotropic drugs and their active metabolites, if any, have very long half-lives that extend for 2 days or longer. Examples are chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, fluoxetine, vortioxetine, aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, cariprazine, penfluridol, donepezil, and memantine. Other drugs with long half-lives that psychiatrists may prescribe include levothyroxine and zonisamide. Psychotropic drugs with long half-lives take long to reach steady state; this is seldom a problem. They also take long to wash out; this is an advantage because the risk of drug withdrawal or discontinuation syndromes is small, and a disadvantage if rapid washout is desired for any reason, including the experience of drug adverse effects or toxicity, or the discovery of an unplanned pregnancy. Other clinical issues related to drugs with long half-lives include the relevance of occasional missed doses, the possibility of once-weekly dosing, and the need for pregnancy planning.",

      "title": "Not the Function of Eating, but Spontaneous Activity and Energy Expenditure, Reflected in “Restlessness” and a “Drive for Activity” Appear to Be Dysregulated in Anorexia Nervosa: Treatment Implications",
      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa (AN) is uncommon as a syndrome, despite widespread dieting or voluntary food restriction, especially among female adolescents. This suggests that restriction of caloric intake might not be the only component driving weight loss in AN. Historical observations and experimental evidence from energy expenditure studies and recordings from movement sensors reviewed in this paper reveal that AN is associated with motor activity levels and with an energy output not significantly different from that in normal-weight healthy age-matched controls. By contrast, other conditions of prolonged caloric under-nutrition are typically associated with loss of energy, slowing of movements and a decrease in self-initiated activity and well being. Several hypotheses can be inferred from the findings : a) that long term severe caloric restriction fails in downregulating movements and energy expenditure in AN. b) Clinically and subjectively observable as mental and physical restlessness and continued motor activity, this restless energy, differering in intensity, seems to serve as the permissive factor for and possibly to drive exercise and hyperactivity in AN. c) Such restless energy and increased arousal, generated sometime in the course of the weight loss process, appear to enhance the person's self -perception and wellbeing, to heighten proprioception, to intensify body awareness and to improve self-esteem. d) Restlessness and continued motor activity may constitute a phenotype of AN. The therapeutic value of the concept of an abnormality in the energy regulatory system, likely the result of a host of genetic and epigenetic changes in AN, lies primarily in its heuristic and explanatory power and its potential for disease prevention. Restless energy as a permissive and important component for the development and in the maintenance of AN, does not fundamentally alter treatment, since prolonged food deprivation is the principal causal factor for the development of AN. Renutrition within a structured treatment plan, to include individual and family therapy remains the most effective symptomatic treatment for AN. Corroboration of the concept of restless activation will require the patient's cooperation and input to identify and capture more precisely the experiences, sensations and changes that allow the emaciated patient to remain mobile and active.",

Negative symptoms occur alongside positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations in acute psychotic episodes, where they generally respond to treatment with antipsychotic medication, but for the 15-20% of patients for whom negative symptoms are enduring,1 2 current treatment strategies have modest benefits at best.\n\nA critical but often difficult clinical distinction is between primary and secondary negative symptoms,3 The former constitute an enduring deficit state within schizophrenia, whereas the latter can be manifestations of depressive features or medication side effects such as bradykinesia (as part of drug induced parkinsonism), or the consequence of positive symptoms (for example, social and emotional withdrawal may be a response to persecutory delusions or reflect a patient’s avoidance of social stimulation to minimise the provocation of intrusive psychotic experiences). Irrespective of cause, persistent negative symptoms disproportionately limit recovery4 and are associated with poorer occupational and social functioning in the community, including a reduced likelihood of living independently.5 6\n\nFindings from studies that have tested drug strategies for negative symptoms in the context of acute psychotic episodes may not be generalisable to those with persistent symptoms.

      "abstract": "Depression represents the predominant mood pole in bipolar disorder. Bipolar depression typically has a poor response to antidepressant medication, and also involves the risk of polarity shifts, induction of mixed states, and / or rapid cycle induction. The diagnosis of bipolar depression can be delayed by 8 to 10 years. The reason for this delay is mainly the fact that both manic and hypomanic episodes appear lately in the course of the disorder. It is therefore necessary to diagnose this clinical entity as early as possible versus monopolar depression in order to treat it more effectively. This differential diagnosis is based on certain clinical features of bipolar depression, which are often difficult to be distinguished from those of monopolar depression and therefore it is necessary to know specific criteria that differentiate them to some extent qualitatively and / or quantitatively. Such characteristics are daily mood swings, multiple physical complaints, psychomotor retardation, psychotic elements (delusions and perceptual disorders mood congruent or noncongruent), the disturbance of certain bodily functions, including circadian rhythms, sexual desire, appetite, and disorders of sleep architecture. The treatment of bipolar depression is based on the options known from monopolar depression (such as the use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and certain antiepileptic agents) and their combinations, while in recent years it has been enriched with new pharmaceutical agents and non-pharmacological approaches. New glutaminergic regulators dominate the new pharmacological agents' research, and among them the antidepressant effect of ketamine and esketamine at sub-anesthetic doses is being extensively investigated during recent years. Non-pharmacological approaches include methods such as electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), sleep deprivation, and phototherapy.",

In addition, persons with insomnia are at higher risk of developing a new psychiatric disorder, particularly major depression, within a year of the onset of insomnia. Psychiatric disorders can give rise to insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or parasomnias (eg, nightmares or sleep terrors) (Boxes 11–1 and 11–2).. It has been estimated that a third to a half of cases of chronic insomnia are associated with a psychiatric condition. Changes in sleep architecture include a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency that is seen with depressive episodes, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Schizophrenia (psychosis) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by both “positive symptoms” (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and “negative symptoms” (eg, affective flattening, avolition [limited goal-directed behavior], and alogia [restricted thought and speech production]). This disabling condition has a median age of onset between 15 and 25 years of age. Course is chronic with significant impairments in self-care, interpersonal interactions, and work performance.",

      "abstract": "Summary Depression is still underestimated, despite its high incidence, and its impact on subjective quality of life. To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

Recreational use of ketamine and the number of illicit seizures of ketamine have increased in recent years, prompting a review of current evidence on its toxicity. Recreational ketamine use is associated with a number of toxic effects, both acute and chronic. Predominant among the acute effects are psychotic symptoms, hallucinations and aggression, which can lead to serious injuries. Chronic ketamine use leads to intractable urological problems and neuropsychiatric problems, Long-term effects also include gastrointestinal problems such as abdominal pain and liver function abnormalities.

      "title": "SUPPRESSION OF TENEURIN-4 IN THE NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS ALLEVIATES METHAMPHETAMINE-INDUCED DOPAMINE RELEASE AND BEHAVIORAL ALTERATIONS IN MICE",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background According to the World Drug Report 2022 from United Nations, amphetamine-type stimulants take third place in worldwide drug addiction, primary methamphetamine (METH) [1]. And over 30,0000 people died from drug overdoses induced by stimulants combined with other drugs [2]. METH is recognized as a widely distributed psychostimulant with a strong addictive potential that impacts the central nervous system and body health [3]. METH predominantly exerts its influence on the limbic system through the stimulation of the release of various neurotransmitters, including dopamine, within the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a critical element of the brain's reward circuitry. Both short-term and prolonged METH use can result in lasting physical and mental health complications, some of which may endure indefinitely. Over the last decades, significant social problems associated with METH have gotten worse over the past few decades, especially after COVID-19 [1, 2]. Aim &amp; Objectives Our previous data revealed several genes associated with METH, including Odz4 gene. The Odz4 gene encodes teneurin-4 (TENM4) protein which belongs to one subtype of type II transmembrane teneurin proteins (TENM1-4) [4]. Genetic studies have indicated a correlation between teneurin proteins and developmental issues, neurological disorders, and drug residence [5]. Recently, some clinical research found that the Odz4 gene has an abnormal mutant in the brain of patients with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia [6, 7]. Based on the aforementioned research, it is suggested that TENM4 might play a role in the progress of drug addiction. Here we investigated the performance of TENM4 knockdown in METH-induced dopamine release of NAc shell and behavior alterations in mice. Method We administered METH or saline subcutaneously to mice for six consecutive days. Two hours after the final injection of METH, we sacrificed all mice and preserved them under 80°. Then we investigated the changes in Odz4 mRNA and protein levels using RT-qPCR and WB, respectively. Subsequently, we injected AAV-carrying Odz4-targeting gRNA involved CRISPR-Cas system into the NAc After four weeks of the injection, we assessed the time response of dopamine in NAc by in vivo microdialysis and alteration of conditioned place preference induced by METH. Results We found a significant increase in Odz4 mRNA and TENM4 protein levels in the NAc region after continued METH administration. We confirmed the knockdown effect by AAV injection of the NAc of mice. The TENM4 knockdown exhibited an attenuated response of dopamine and place preference induced by METH. Discussion and Conclusion These results indicate the association between TENM4 and the pharmacological effects of METH in NAc region of mice. However, addiction behaviors affected by the knockdown of TENM4 and its specific mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear and require further investigation.

      "title": "Treatment Options for Insomnia-Pharmacodynamics of Zolpidem Extended-Release to Benefit Next-Day Performance",
      "abstract": "Background: Insomnia can manifest as difficulty in falling asleep, in maintaining sleep throughout the night, or waking up too early, with symptoms often unpredictably changing over time. Pharmacologic options for insomnia treatment include prescription hypnotics, such as y-amino butyric acid-receptor agonists, sedating antidepressants, over-the-counter antihistamines, melatonin-receptor agonists, and alternative therapies. A concern with insomnia medications is the risk of next-day residual effects, which can impair memory and ability to perform certain tasks, such as driving, and may increase the risk of accidents and falls, especially in the elderly. Objectives: To describe the impact of current insomnia treatments on next-day performance.Results: The longer-acting benzodiazepines are associated with next-day “hangover” effects and, as a result, have been largely replaced by agents in the nonbenzodiazepine class, which typically have shorter half-lives. The hypnotic, sedative activities of these classes of drugs depend on variations in binding characteristics to the a, subunit of the γ-amino butyric acidA- receptor, which inhibits neuronal activity in broad areas of the brain and is found in areas of the brain responsible for sleep/wakefulness and sedation. However, nonbenzodiazepines with a rapid onset of action and short half-life have shown limited efficacy for maintaining sleep throughout the night. These properties have contributed to the development of modified-release formulations. Zolpidem extended-release is a bilayer tablet that retains the fast onset of action of its parent compound Zolpidem while extending the duration of hypnotic activity, owing to a slower-release portion of the tablet. Conclusions: Based on clinical evidence, the risk of residual next-day effects of Zolpidem extended-release is limited, mainly due to the similarly short half-life in its extended-release formulation.",

      "abstract": "This perspective presents a new comprehensive proposal for sleep bruxism management. Sleep bruxism latest definition, epidemiology and etiologyIn accordance with the latest consensus, sleep bruxism (SB) is defined as a masticatory muscle activity during sleep, characterized as rhythmic (phasic) or non-rhythmic (tonic), and is not considered a movement disorder or a sleep disorder in otherwise healthy individuals. 1It is estimated to occur in up to 15% of the human adult population. 2 Despite many years of research, SB still constitutes a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.There are various risk factors that can contribute to SB: exogenous risk factors, such as smoking, heavy alcohol intake, caffeine, medications, or illicit drugs; psychosocial factors, including perceived stress and anxiety; sleep disorders, involving sleep arousal; and comorbidities, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). 3Recent research also indicates that SB may be related to the neurotransmission of the serotonin and/or dopamine pathway. 4,5Severe SB seem to co-occur with lower serotonin blood levels, but is not correlated with the blood levels of the enzymes involved in the serotonin synthesis pathway. 5There are also studies supporting the genetic background of SB.The latest studies suggest that the polymorphisms occurring within the genes encoding dopamine and serotonin receptors may be linked with predisposition to SB and SB pathogenesis, and may contribute to the association between SB and OSA in adults. 6Similar associations with regard to the genes encoding dopamine receptors have been observed in children. 7In children, the additional factors increasing SB are the consumption of sugar, screen-time and sleeping habits. 8,9",

      "title": "The benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome",
      "abstract": "Abstract Physiological dependence on benzodiazepines is accompanied by a withdrawal syndrome which is typically characterized by sleep disturbance, irritability, increased tension and anxiety, panic attacks, hand tremor, sweating, difficulty in concentration, dry wretching and nausea, some weight loss, palpitations, headache, muscular pain and stiffness and a host of perceptual changes. Instances are also reported within the high‐dosage category of more serious developments such as seizures and psychotic reactions. Withdrawal from normal dosage benzodiazepine treatment can result in a number of symptomatic patterns. The most common is a short‐lived “rebound” anxiety and insomnia, coming on within 1‐4 days of discontinuation, depending on the half‐life of the particular drug. The second pattern is the full‐blown withdrawal syndrome, usually lasting 10–14 days; finally, a third pattern may represent the return of anxiety symptoms which then persist until some form of treatment is instituted. Physiological dependence on benzodiazepines can occur following prolonged treatment with therapeutic doses, but it is not clear what proportion of patients are likely to experience a withdrawal syndrome. It is also unknown to what extent the risk of physiological dependence is dependent upon a minimum duration of exposure or dosage of these drugs. Withdrawal phenomena appear to be more severe following withdrawal from high doses or short‐acting benzodiazepines. Dependence on alcohol or other sedatives may increase the risk of benzodiazepine dependence, but it has proved difficult to demonstrate unequivocally differences in the relative abuse potential of individual benzodiazepines.",

Llegando a negativa para ingerir alimentos y permanencia en posición fija de sedestación, como elementos clave para la sospecha clínica y el diagnóstico oportuno. Descripción del caso: Masculino de 57 años, con historia de síntomas afectivos, quien ingreso a urgencias diagnosticado con episodio depresivo mayor de características catatónicas, el cual mejoró con el inicio de midazolam y luego titulación de Lorazepam. Pasadas cinco semanas de estancia hospitalaria fue dado de alta con antidepresivos y dosis estándar de benzodiazepinas, las cuales se retiraron ambulatoriamente, sin recurrencia de los síntomas durante un año de seguimiento. Conclusiones: Un episodio catatónico puede ser causado por trastornos afectivos. La catatonía secundaria a trastornos afectivos es rara en la práctica clínica, lo cual causa que pase inadvertida, por lo cual el conocimiento de esta alteración genera un manejo oportuno de pacientes reduciendo el gasto de los recursos del sistema de salud y mejorando la calidad de vida de la persona.

      "title": "Bipolar Depression: <i>Best Practices for the Hospitalized Patient</i>",
      "abstract": "One of the most challenging clinical topics in psychiatry is the diagnosis and treatment of bipolar depression. The term mood stabilizer is frequently employed in the treatment of the hospitalized bipolar patient, although clinicians do not universally agree on a consensus definition of this term. Most clinicians would agree that a mood stabilizer refers to a medication that is effective for the acute treatment of manic, mixed, hypomanic, or depressive episodes. Many experts agree that such treatment should offer efficacy against mania, should not worsen depression, and preferably should treat depression as well. In addition, the acute effectiveness in stabilization should not be at the expense of inducing alternate mood symptoms or switching the patient into the alternate phase of illness. From a maintenance standpoint, a mood stabilizer should also prevent against future relapse or recurrence of manic, mixed, hypomanic, or depressive symptoms or episodes (Slide 1). In addition to use of mood stabilizers, there are other issues surrounding treatment of the hospitalized patient with bipolar depression, including the commonly comorbid issue of substance abuse. Hazardous drinking may more commonly occur in bipolar depression or depressive phase of illness, representing a more complex clinical picture. To facilitate understanding of this complex disorder and its appropriate treatment, this discussion centers around the case of a major depressive episode in a patient with a past history of of mania (ie, bipolar I depression or bipolar depression).",

      "abstract": "Internet technologies have made rapid progress, bringing convenience to our daily life. On the other hand, Internet overuse (IOU) and Internet addiction (IA) have reportedly become serious health and social problems across the globe. Recently Internet gaming disorder criteria have been proposed in the section of Conditions for Further Study of DSM5. Many surveys have reported that many IOU & IA patients have contracted other mental disorders and exhibit some psychiatric and physical symptoms (e.g., weight loss, reduced ability to exercise, nutrition disorder). Attention Deficit Hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), sleeping disorders, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, and phobic anxiety disorder are extremely common comorbid mental disorders (CMD) with IUD & IA. Because CMD breaks the usual rhythm of the activities of daily living of IOU & IA patients (e.g., eating meals and sleeping), and prevents the affected patients from participating in social activities (e.g., going to schools or work, participating in sports or other hobbies), CMD causes exacerbation of all IOU & IA symptoms. It has been reported that effecting a cure of some aspects of CMD often leads to the relief of IOU & IA. The diagnosis and the treatment of CMD are therefore very important.",

      "title": "Third Generation Antipsychotic Drugs: Partial Agonism or Receptor Functional Selectivity?",
      "abstract": "Functional selectivity is the term that describes drugs that cause markedly different signaling through a single receptor (e.g., full agonist at one pathway and antagonist at a second). It has been widely recognized recently that this phenomenon impacts the understanding of mechanism of action of some drugs, and has relevance to drug discovery. One of the clinical areas where this mechanism has particular importance is in the treatment of schizophrenia. Antipsychotic drugs have been grouped according to both pattern of clinical action and mechanism of action. The original antipsychotic drugs such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol have been called typical or first generation. They cause both antipsychotic actions and many side effects (extrapyramidal and endocrine) that are ascribed to their high affinity dopamine D(2) receptor antagonism. Drugs such as clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone and others were then developed that avoided the neurological side effects (atypical or second generation antipsychotics). These compounds are divided mechanistically into those that are high affinity D(2) and 5-HT(2A) antagonists, and those that also bind with modest affinity to D(2), 5-HT(2A), and many other neuroreceptors. There is one approved third generation drug, aripiprazole, whose actions have been ascribed alternately to either D(2) partial agonism or D(2) functional selectivity. Although partial agonism has been the more widely accepted mechanism, the available data are inconsistent with this mechanism. Conversely, the D(2) functional selectivity hypothesis can accommodate all current data for aripiprazole, and also impacts on discovery compounds that are not pure D(2) antagonists.",

      "abstract": "A neuropsychiatric and -psychological update of the crime “profile” and “signature” is a necessary addition to the traditional sociopsychological model likely to miss limbic system dysfunctioning. Thus, occurrence of a brief (c. 20 minutes) limbic seizure has been proposed based on behaviors of 12 white male homicidal loners, who showed a dozen symptoms and signs: Limbic Psychotic Trigger Reaction. Readily overlooked can be (a) a transient psychosis (hallucinations and/or delusions), (b) autonomic hyperactivation (e.g., loss of bladder control, nausea, ejaculation), (c) motiveless, out-of-character, unplanned, and well-remembered homicidal acts, (d) committed with a flat affect (not emotionally or impulsively provoked), (e) typically involving a stranger who happened to provide an objectively harmless and only subjectively important stimulus. (f) Such an individualized stimulus triggered the memory revival of mild to moderate but repeatedly experienced hurts. Such a specific sequence of events implicates the specific mechanism of limbic seizure, “kindling,” which does not necessarily involve motor convulsions. Repetition of such limbic episodes with “criminal acts” is conceivable under specific circumstances including cases in which the triggering stimulus is associated with pleasurable delusions (e.g., of grandiose power or wealth) or constitutes a specific aspect of a basic drive motive. For example, eating or sexual activities might be planned but degenerate into a limbic episode with a specific core symptomatology.",

      "title": "Panic Disorder With and Without Agoraphobia",
      "abstract": "Panic disorder is characterized by two components: recurrent panic attacks and anticipatory anxiety. Panic attacks within panic disorder are not caused by physical illness or certain substances and they are unexpected, at least initially; later in the course of the disorder, many attacks may be precipitated by certain situations or are more likely to occur in them. Anticipatory anxiety is an intense fear of having another panic attack, which is present between panic attacks. Some patients with panic disorder go on to develop agoraphobia, usually defined as fear and/or avoidance of the situations from which escape might be difficult or embarrassing or in which help might not be available in case of a panic attack; in such cases, patients are diagnosed with panic disorder with agoraphobia. Those who do not develop agoraphobia receive a diagnosis of panic disorder without agoraphobia. Components of panic disorder are presented in Figure 2—1. Patients with agoraphobia who have no history of panic disorder or whose agoraphobia is not related at least to panic attacks or symptoms of panic attacks are relatively rarely encountered in clinical practice. The diagnosis of agoraphobia without history of panic disorder has been a matter of some controversy, especially in view of the differences between American and European psychiatrists (and the DSM and ICD diagnostic and classification systems) in the conceptualization of the relationship between panic disorder and agoraphobia. The conceptualization adhered to here has for the most part been derived from the DSM system, as there is more empirical support for it. Although panic disorder (with and without agoraphobia) is a relatively well-defined psychopathological entity whose treatment is generally rewarding, there are important, unresolved issues. They are listed below and discussed throughout this chapter. …1. Are there different types of panic attacks based on the absence or presence of the context in which they appear (i.e., unexpected vs. situational attacks)? Should the ‘‘subtyping’’ of panic attacks be based on other criteria (e.g., symptom profile)? 2. Because panic attacks are not specific for panic disorder, should they continue to be the main feature of panic disorder? Can panic attacks occurring as part of panic disorder be reliably distinguished from panic attacks occurring as part of other disorders or in the absence of any psychopathology? 3. What is the relationship between panic attacks, panic disorder, and agoraphobia?",

      "abstract": "<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> Post-stroke apathy is a disturbance of motivation evidenced by low initiative, difficulties in starting, sustaining or finishing any goal-directed activity, low self-activation or self-initiated behavior and emotional indifference. Apathy is a common behavioral disturbance in stroke survivors. We aimed to analyze the relationship between post-stroke apathy at 1 year after stroke and (1) apathy in acute phase; (2) demographic, pre-stroke predisposing conditions (previous mild cognitive impairment, alcohol abuse, mood/anxiety disorder) and clinical features (stroke type and location, neurological symptoms); (3) post-stroke depression and post-stroke cognitive impairment, and (4) post-stroke functional outcome, quality of life and the perception of health. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Consecutive stroke (infarct/intracerebral hemorrhage) patients without aphasia or consciousness disturbances were included in the acute phase of stroke and assessed at 1 year after stroke. We assessed apathy with the clinically rated version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale. We also assessed post-stroke depression (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and post-stroke cognitive impairment (attention, mental flexibility, verbal, motor and graphomotor initiative, and non-verbal and verbal abstract reasoning, and Mini-Mental State Examination), functional outcome (Barthel Index), quality of life and perception of health (EuroQol). Data were analyzed using bivariate associations (χ<sup>2</sup> and t test) and stepwise multivariate analysis. <b><i>Results:</i></b> We included 76 stroke patients [32.9% women, mean age 62.9 years (SD = 10.9) and a mean of 6.9 (SD = 4.3) years of education]. Apathy was present in 17 patients in the acute phase and in 18 (23.7%) patients at 1 year after stroke. At 1 year after stroke, 41% of the acute apathetic patients remained apathetic. Sixty-one percent of new cases of post-stroke apathy were detected. Post-stroke apathy was associated only with previous cognitive impairment, apathy in acute stroke, post-stroke cognitive impairment, verbal abstract reasoning and with worse Barthel Index scale scores. In the multivariate logistic regression model, verbal abstract reasoning (odds ratio, OR = 7.03) and apathy in acute stroke (OR = 3.8) were identified as independent factors for post-stroke apathy at 1 year. Apathetic patients did not report worse quality of life or health. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Apathy in acute stroke phase was a reliable indicator of post-stroke apathy. Apathy should be assessed in both phases. Verbal abstract reasoning impairment was also an independent factor for post-stroke apathy impairing patients' ability to reason about goal-directed activity. Even though apathetic patients had worse post-stroke functional outcome, they did not report losing quality of life or having worse health.",

      "title": "Treating Bipolar Mania in the Outpatient Setting: Enlist the Help of Family, Employ Evidence-Based Pharmacologic and Psychotherapeutic Strategies",
      "abstract": "Manic episodes, by definition, are associated with significant social or occupational impairment. (1) Some manic patients are violent or engage in reckless behaviors that can harm themselves or others, such as speeding, disrupting traffic, or playing with fire. When these patients present to a psychiatrist's outpatient practice, involuntary hospitalization might be justified. However, some manic patients, in spite of their elevated, expansive, or irritable mood state, never behave dangerously and might not meet legal criteria for involuntary hospitalization, although these criteria differ from state to state. These patients might see a psychiatrist because manic symptoms such as irritability, talkativeness, and impulsivity are bothersome to their family members but pose no serious danger (Box, page 40). Box Manic, but refusing inpatient treatment Accompanied by her husband and mother, Mrs. W. age 31, is seeking help for insomnia and anxiety. She reports that she has been unable to sleep more than a few hours a night for the last 2 weeks and is having spontaneous panic attacks. Her affect is elevated, she is hyperverbal and loud, and she repeatedly stands up and paces during the interview. Mrs. W's husband tells you that she doesn't sleep. has spent $1,000 in the last week on random items, is calling her friends and her doctors all day and night. and is so easily distracted that she cannot safely take care of their infant. These behaviors are abnormal for Mrs. W when she is well, he reports. but also occurred during a previous manic episode. He says she is doing nothing dangerous and she hasn't voiced any threats of self-harm or violence toward others. Mrs. W's family is concerned about her behavior. Because you are unable to involuntarily commit Mrs. W to a psychiatric hospital. you recommend that she voluntarily check herself into a hospital. Her family strongly supports this idea, but Mrs. W refuses. In this situation, the psychiatrist can strongly encourage the patient to seek voluntary hospitalization or attend a partial hospitalization program. If the patient declines, the psychiatrist is left with 2 choices: initiate treatment in the outpatient setting or refuse to treat the patient and refer to another provider. Treating non-dangerous mania in the outpatient setting is fraught with challenges: * the possibility that the patient's condition will progress to dangerousness * poor adherence to treatment because of the patient's limited insight * the large amount of time required from the psychiatrist and care team to adequately manage the manic episode (eg, time spent with family members, frequent patient visits, and managing communications from the patient). There are no guidelines to assist the office-based practitioner in treating mania in the outpatient setting. When considering dosing and optimal medication combinations for treating mania, clinical trials may be of limited value because most of these studies only included hospitali7ed manic patients. Because of this dearth of knowledge, we provide recommendations based on our review of the literature and from our experience working with manic patients who refuse voluntary hospitalization and could not be hospitali7ed against their will. These recommendations are organized into 3 sections: diagnostic approach, treatment strategy, and family involvement. Diagnostic approach Making a diagnosis of mania might seem straightforward for clinicians who work in inpatient settings; however, mania might not present with classic florid symptoms among outpatients. Patients might have a chief concern of irritability, dysphoria, anxiety, or insomnia, which may lead clinicians to focus initially on non-bipolar conditions. (2) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] During the interview, it is important to assess for any current DSM-5 symptoms of a manic episode, while being careful not to accept a patient's denial of symptoms. …",

The way of life of the individual who is dependent on alcohol is replete with incidents that are demoralising, waking daily with a hangover or with tremor and retching, coupled with amnesia for events of the night before, a sense of inability to face the day ahead and awareness of recriminations at work and at home. Little wonder that depressed mood is common in such circumstances. Similarly, the drug addict, when life is dominated by the daily problem of obtaining supplies of a substance that brings transient relief or pleasure but also experiences of an impoverished existence and low mood. Add to this the fact that the biological action of many commonly misused substances can induce depression then it is hardly surprising that depression is common in this population. There are also a smaller number who use alcohol or illicit drugs to cope with primary depression. Teasing out the interplay of affect and substance misuse is a challenge for the general psychiatrist and the addiction specialist.",

      "abstract": "The number of persons with drug induced sexual dysfunction has risen simultaneously with the unending increase in the number of commercially available drugs. Sexual dysfunction may seriously impair the human psyche. Patients do not often admit to sexual dysfunction, however, so physicians often miss the symptoms entirely. In addition, they may attribute them to other causes, such as depression. Drugs disrupt all 3 neurophysiologic phases of sexual response (desire, excitement, and orgasm), especially in men, either causing a decrease or loss of libido, impotence (the most common symptom), or failure of ejaculation or anorgasmia. The mechanisms involved are not well understood. Researchers do know, however, that the drug cimetidine (Tagamet) blocks androgen receptors, decreases testosterone synthesis, and induces higher circulating levels of estradiol resulting in impotence and breast enlargement in men. Antihypertensive drugs have a higher frequency of causing sexual dysfunction, particularly impotence, than other drugs. Some also induce or worsen depression that can in turn cause or intensify sexual dysfunction. Both legal and illegal psychoactive drugs act on multiple sites thus often stimulating sexual dysfunction. Further, some hormonal drugs also induce sexual side effects, such as norethindrone and progesterone. Physicians who prescribe a drug associated with sexual side effects should inform patients about their possible occurrence and recommend that they be aware of the symptoms. They should ask these patients do not usually offer this information themselves. If sexual dysfunction develops, physicians can reduce the dosage or switch to an alternative drug. At that time, they should express optimism that the sexual dysfunction will cease.",

      "abstract": "Drowsiness is one of the cardinal symptoms of motion sickness; therefore, a symptom-complex centering around \"drowsiness\" has been identified which, for convenience, has been termed the sopite syndrome. Generally, the symptoms characterizing this syndrome are interwoven with other symptoms but under two circumstances the sopite syndrome comprises the main or sole overt manifestation of motion sickness. One circumstance is that in which the intensity of the eliciting stimuli is closely matched to a person's susceptibility, and the sopite syndrome is evoked either before other symptoms of motion sickness appear or in their absence. The second circumstance occurs during prolonged exposure in a motion environment when adaptation results in the disappearance of motion sickness symptoms, except for responses characterizing the sopite syndrome. Typical symptoms of the syndrome are: 1) yawning, 2) drowsiness, 3) disinclination for work, either physical or mental, and 4) lack of participation in group activities. Phenomena derived from an analysis of the symptomatology of the sopite syndrome are qualitatively similar but may differ quantitatively from abstractions derived in other motion sickness responses. One example is the sometimes unique time course of the sopite syndrome. This implies that the immediate eliciting mechanisms not only differ from those involved in evoking other symptoms, but, also, that they must represent first order responses. Diagnosis is difficult unless the syndrome under discussion is kept in mind. Prevention poses a greater problem than treatment.",

However, major depressive disorder, or clinical depression, is characterized by a persistent low mood or loss of interest or pleasure in one’s usual activities in conjunction with other symptoms, such as decreased energy, disturbances in sleep and appetite, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt. Such symptoms are persistent and cause significant distress and/or interference with one’s functioning (see Table 3-1 below for the primary criteria used to diagnose a major depressive episode.) Major depression is frequently a recurrent disorder1,2 and in 12%-20% of cases is a chronic one. 3,4 However, it is treatable in many cases. There is increasing evidence that “subclinical or subsyndromal” depression, which reflects a constellation of symptoms that may not meet the full criteria identified below but which persists, is associated with significant morbidity. This chapter is primarily concerned with clinical depression. Research that has been conducted on depressive symptoms and may have implications for clinical depression is also discussed.",

Case Presentation: A 27-year-old woman presented with severe and chronic insomnia, persisting for 14 years with recent exacerbation. Her symptoms included significant difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep, resulting in an average of only 3-4 hours of sleep per night and complete sleep deprivation for periods exceeding half an hour over the past 5 days. This sleep deficit led to pronounced emotional instability, physical discomfort, and reduced appetite, although suicidal ideation was absent. She had a past history of drug use for different psychiatric illnesses. She was started on mirtazipine 30mg and showed abrupt improvement in her symptoms. She was discharged afterwards. Discussion: The patient's chronic insomnia and its secondary effects necessitate a comprehensive treatment approach. Mirtazapine, an antidepressant with potent histamine receptor antagonism, has shown efficacy in improving sleep quality across diverse patient profiles. However, side effects like weight gain and sedation require careful monitoring. Combining mirtazapine with prolonged-release melatonin has demonstrated enhanced outcomes, particularly in perimenopausal women. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) remains the first-line treatment due to its efficacy and long-term benefits. Conclusion: Mirtazapine can be a valuable option in the therapeutic arsenal for primary insomnia, but ongoing research is needed to refine treatment strategies. Personalized treatment plans considering patient history and response are crucial for effectively managing primary insomnia and improving patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Spontaneous recurrence of methamphetamine- or amphetamine-induced paranoid hallucinatory psychosis (i.e., flashbacks) occasionally occurs in response to non-specific mild stress in drug-free patients with a history of methamphetamine- or amphetamine-induced psychosis. Stress sensitization associated with noradrenergic hyperactivity and increased dopamine release may be related to this flashbacks. Stressful frightening experiences as well as fear-related paranoid- hallucinatory states during methamphetamine use may be related to these stress sensitization. Robust noradrenergic hyperactivity with increased dopamine release may predicts subsequent flashback episodes. Schizophrenia-like symptoms (e.g., passivity phenomena, Gedankenlautwerden, and thought disorder such as circumstantiality and egorrhea symptoms) appear to develop related to dopaminergic hyperactivity. One of the dopamine receptor-encoding genes DRD2, TaqIA A1/A1 type, with which reduced density of the D2 receptor is associated, reduces to the risk of development of flashbacks. Stress sensitization has been proposed as a key step in the progression from vulnerability to an overt paranoidhallucinatory states, so that schizophrenia and flashbacks due to previous methamphetamine psychosis shares common underlying mechanisms of stress sensitization. Compared to flashbacks due to previous methamphetamine psychosis, psychedelic drug flashbacks are the recurrence of a perception learned while an individual is experiencing high anxiety levels, and thus recur in anxiety-related situations. Anxiety or fear during drug use is an important factor in the development of flashbacks due to previous methamphetamine psychosis and also psychedelic drug flashbacks. Dopaminergic and glutamatergic neural circuits including the striatum, nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex play an important role in the development of psychostimulant-induced long-lasting behavioral sensitization. Immediate early genes expression in the particular brain regions affected by the psychostimulants is involved in this process. Furthermore, recent advances in molecular analysis could shed light on the fundamental mechanism involved, by identifying specific participating molecules such as delta FosB, NAC1, G-protein b1 subunit and methamphetamine-responsive transcript 1b.

      "title": "Force Maintenance With Submaximal Fatiguing Contractions",
      "abstract": "Whereas many definitions of fatigue include externally measurable decrements in force or performance, fatigue can be present with no change in the external output of the muscle. The maintenance of submaximal forces can be considered a compromise between neuromuscular force enhancement and competing inhibitory influences. An example of a muscle facilitatory process includes postactivation potentiation that results in an increased sensitivity to Ca ++ . The neuromuscular system copes with metabolic disruption and subsequent loss of force by recruiting additional motor units and increasing the firing frequency. If the contraction persists, firing frequency may decrease so as to optimize the stimulus rate with the prolonged duration of the muscle fibre action potential (muscle wisdom). The insertion of additional neural impulses into the train of stimuli can result in force potentiation (catch-like properties). Furthermore, there is evidence of neural potentiation and a dissociation of muscle activity with submaximal fatigue. Conversely, inhibition may be derived supraspinally or at the spinal level. While there may be some evidence of intrinsic motoneuronal fatigue, inhibitory afferent influences from chemical, tensile, pressure, and other factors play an important role in the competing influences on force output. Key words: postactivation potentiation, recruitment, rate coding, inhibition, catch-like properties",

But clinical syndromes and personality disorders are now seen as separate entities; therefore, psychogenic trance is part of the so-called 'dissociative disorders'. Here, the integrative functions of the psyche are reduced and control of memory, identity, sensoric and motoric functions are impaired. As a consequence, certain disorders are observed, which have common characteristics, such as onset (psychogenic trauma), course (initial panic or belle indifference) and psychodynamics (repression of an unbearable reality). The following disorders can be distinguished: --psychogenic amnesia: partial or complete loss of memory --psychogenic trance: temporary loss of habitual identity with more or less full awareness of surroundings --psychogenic fugue: apparently purposeful journey away from home with psychogenic amnesia --psychogenic stupor: profound diminuation or absence of voluntary movement and no responsiveness to external stimuli.",

      "abstract": "Familial dysautonomia or the Riley-Day syndrome was first described in 1949 with a report of five cases (14). Dysautonomia refers to the characteristic dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system upon which are superimposed both motor and sensory abnormalities; familial refers to the genetic nature of the abnormality, which is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait occurring almost exclusively in Jewish families of East European extraction (12). The clinical features may be grouped into major categories resulting from apparent dysfunction of the dominantly involved systems: (a) episodic hypertension and postural hypotension, transient (erythematous) blotching of the skin, cool extremities, excessive perspiration, hypolacrimation, episodic unexplained fever, episodic vomiting; (b) disordered swallowing, dysarthria, motor inco-ordination; (c) marked diminution in sensory modalities (notably pain and taste), decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes, corneal hypesthesia (leading to corneal scarring). Additional, almost constant features are emotional lability, recurrent pulmonic infection, kyphoscoliosis, and other bony changes. The occasional occurrence of convulsions is noted, but mental retardation is not thought to be an important primary feature of this syndrome. Recent communications have emphasized the probably pathognomonic absence of the fungiform papillae of the tongue with the presumed absence of the associated taste buds; frequently there is concomitant absence of the circumvallate papillae (4, 15). Pharmacologic investigations have revealed hypersensitivity to both norepinephrine and methacholine, absence of normal responses to intradermal histamine, and restoration of many of the abnormal sensory and parasympathetic findings with infused methacholine (4, 16). Despite the wide array of symptomatology and despite the fact that the radiologist is frequently involved with the initial diagnosis of this disease because of the chronic and recurrent pneumonic episodes that often mimic cystic fibrosis, there is a dearth of radiographic literature available concerning this syndrome. Kirkpatrick and Riley in 1957 discussed the general radiographic findings (10). They found that chronic bronchopneumonia was the most common and important radiographic feature. They also reported the skeletal changes of abnormal and retarded growth, of kyphoscoliosis, and of traumatic sequelae in a large percentage of their cases. Of their 7 patients who underwent examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract, none showed any major abnormality, although one patient had nonpersistent pylorospasm. Linde and Westover in 1962 discussed the esophageal and gastric changes seen in their 6 patients (11). Difficulty in swallowing was present in 2.",

Severe cases of serotonin syndrome, also called serotonin toxicity, are characterized by neuromuscular excitation (clonus, hyperreflexia, myoclonus, rigidity, tremor), autonomic stimulation (hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis, flushing), and altered mental state (anxiety, agitation, confusion). These more severe cases may come to the clinician's attention on an emergency basis. The diagnosis of serotonin syndrome should be considered in a patient presenting with any combination of clonus, myoclonus, rigidity, and/or tremor. Serotonin syndrome is associated with the use of one or more serotonergic agents. Severe cases generally occur with combinations of serotonergic drugs, most commonly including a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Excessive serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) in the central nervous system has been implicated. Certain patient populations may be predisposed to developing serotonin toxicity, based on their use of various medications or other substances with serotonergic properties. When evaluating a patient with clinical features of neuromuscular excitation, autonomic stimulation, and/or altered mental state, prompt identification and management are critical, and treatment considerations are often complex.",

School can reveal the subject's personal problems (anxiety, phobia or depression), but may equally create pathology by not recognising the heterogeneity of individual development and differences in cognitive functioning. In adolescence, the ego is particularly vulnerable. Anything that may induce its instability can create behavioural problems (instability, aggressiveness, inhibition) or problems of thought (anxiety links, difficulties in abstraction). In order to cope with such a haemorrhage of the ego, the adolescent may have recourse to certain behaviours (e.g. use of drugs leading to dependence). So it is important the know well the links between school failure and behavioural problems or drug consumption because, in one way or another, by their sanction or by lack of motivation, these situations will lead very quickly to school disengagement, which in turn leads to the breakdown of the ego.",

      "title": "Excitotoxicity, Synaptic Repair, and Functional Recovery in the Mammalian Cochlea: A Review of Recent Findings",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Besides its fast excitatory properties, glutamate is known to have neurotoxic properties when released in large amounts or when incompletely recycled. This so‐called excitotoxicity is involved in a number of acute and/or degenerative forms of neuropathology such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, stroke, and retinal ischemia. In the cochlea, excitotoxicity may occur in two pathological conditions: anoxia and noise trauma. It is characterized by a two‐step mechanism: (1) An acute swelling, which primarily depends on the AMPA/kainate type of receptors, together with a disruption of the postsynaptic structures (type I afferent dendrites) resulting in a loss of function. Within the next 5 days, synaptic repair may be observed with a full or a partial (acoustic trauma) recovery of cochlear potentials. (2) The second phase of excitotoxicity, which may develop after strong and/or repetitive injury, consists of a cascade of metabolic events triggered by the entry of Ca 2+ , which leads to neuronal death in the spiral ganglion. Ongoing experiments in animals, tracking the molecular basis of both these processes, presages the development of new pharmacological strategies to help neurites to regrow and reconnect properly to the IHCs, and to prevent or delay neuronal death in the spiral ganglion. Human applications should follow, and a local (transtympanic) strategy against cochlear excitotoxicity may, in the near future, prove to be helpful in ischemic‐ or noise‐induced sudden deafness, as well as in the related tinnitus.",

The serotonergic pathway highlights the primary (endogenous) psychiatric disorders. The up-regulation of the kynurenine pathway by physical illnesses can cause neuropathic and immunological disorders1 associated with secondary neuropsychiatric symptoms. Tryptophan and nicotinamide deficiencies fall within the protein energy malnutrition (PEM) spectrum. They can arise if the kynurenine pathway is stressed by primary or secondary inflammatory conditions and the consequent imbalance of available catabolic/anabolic substrates may adversely influence convalescent phase efficiency. The replacement of depleted or reduced NAD+ levels and other cofactors can perhaps improve the clinical management of these disorders. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and fibromyalgia (FM) appear to meet the criteria of a tryptophan-kynurenine pathway disorder with potential neuroimmunological sequelae.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: - Fatigue can be defined as an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained exhaustion that makes it harder to carry out activities and function Fatigue describes a state of tiredness or exhaustion. Fatigue is an important symptom in academics due to its association with physical, psychological and social problems and the employee health, performance, safety and general workability continues to grow. Research has shown that fatigue may result from some health and work-related factors, particularly a poor health status, long work hours and extended-duration work shifts. INTRODUCTION: - Fatigue is a state of physical or mental weariness, often accompanied by a reduced capacity to perform tasks effectively. It is characterized by a sensation of tiredness, exhaustion, and a lack of energy, which can result from various factors, including prolonged physical or mental exertion, insufficient rest or sleep, illness, stress, and other physical or psychological conditions. The need for a study aimed to investigate the prevalence of fatigue in female academicians by using a reliable self-completion tool that can measure subjective condition, either in extreme clinical cases or in routine day-to-day functioning, has never been greater. METHODOLOGY: - An observational study was conducted in Ahmadabad city. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee. The Chalder Fatigue Scale was used to assess symptoms of fatigue. Questioner method was used to collect data. Each question was scored by female academicians. Sample size of hundred participants including the female academicians. RESULT: - The result was carried out by using Microsoft excel 2016. Out of hundred sample size 38% middle aged female academicians had fatigue. The mean age was 34.43 years. CONCLUSION: - This study concludes that there is need to reduce fatigue among the female academicians. Clinical implementation: - There is a need to plan a proper treatment protocol and advice for female academicians to reduce the fatigue.

DMDD is a condition with an early age of onset (i.e., symptoms apparent by age 10, although the diagnosis cannot be made before age 6); however, nothing is known about the condition among adults in part because questions about temper outbursts (versus \"often losing temper\") are not consistently asked after 6 years of age. Other qualifiers are present so that better-known conditions are not overlooked. For instance, manic symptoms that are present for more than 1 day, symptoms that are not exclusively occurring during major depressive disorder, or symptoms that are better explained by autism, posttraumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety, and dysthymia are exclusionary. Although DMDD can co-occur with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, and substance use disorder, it preempts diagnoses of both oppositional defiant disorder and intermittent explosive disorder.",

      "abstract": "Typically, long-term administration of opiates leads to a reduction in the magnitude and duration of effects produced by a given dose (tolerance) and to physical dependence, a state manifested by withdrawal symptoms when drug taking is terminated or significantly reduced. Addiction or psychological dependence implies the compulsive self-administration of the drug, caused by both its reinforcing or rewarding effects and the unpleasant experience (i.e., abstinence syndrome) produced by the sudden interruption of its consumption. In contrast to tolerance or physical dependence, addiction is not simply a biological phenomenon. Psychological, environmental, and social factors can strongly influence its development. All these factors could explain the important variability of the clinical syndrome of addiction, and the various approaches that have been proposed to help addicts to stop their drug use. Nevertheless, these methods do not work equally well for all types of addicts.",

      "abstract": "Online dictionaries provide a suggestive translation for the burnout concept: \"The tubes burned out easily and had to be constantly replaced...\".This is the sequence of events that leads to the syndrome: the depletion of one's own intellectual energy, usually directly tied to the profession one has, presumably exerted with great passion and dedication, after a long lasting effort.The most accurate definition, including the eventual prophylactic actions to be taken, is based on the context in which this syndrome manifests: the surpassing of one's resistance to professional effort and of one's capability to recuperate (1,17).Its manifestation, perceived by others and by the affected individual consists of behaviors and feelings, more or less subjective, noticed by the individual and/or those around him/her.The most common symptoms overlap those found in various types of depression: fatigue, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, irritability, depressed mood, lack of pleasure and motivation for daily activities concerning -surprisinglythose linked to professional activity.Other symptoms are included in the psychosomatic category: headaches, lumbago, gastrointestinal problems, breathing difficulties, loss of appetite, various cenesthetic complaints.If we use the word symptoms we must include our description in the biological model, which is not necessary the case here.Official psychiatric classifications do not recognize burnout as a form of depression.International Classification of Diseases (ICD 10, 1992) (2) includes this syndrome in the last chapter (amongst \"Factors influencing health status and contact with health services\" codes Z00-Z99, in \"Problems related to life management difficulty\" code Z73.0 together with other \"problems\", such as \"Accentuation of personality traits\" including type A behavior pattern, \"Lack of relaxation and leisure\", \" Stress, not elsewhere classified\", \"Inadequate social skills, not elsewhere classified\", \"Social role conflict, not elsewhere classified\", ranging from Z73.1 to Z73.5), all of which do not refer to nosological entities, but to particularities varying with context and eventually with the individual's psycho-social vulnerability.We can thus define burnout as a cumulation of psychological symptoms, more or less interchangeable with the psychiatric equivalents, already indexed among the diagnostic criteria of some psychiatric disorders (exhaustion depression, stress disorders etc.) (3).It is true that, given time, these psychological symptoms and disfunctions can translate to actual depressive symptoms.Because burnout is, in fact, a surpassed work-related state, it is wise to be aware that the onset of the symptoms might show a change in the individual's professional life.This means that the professional act, which one performs with a",

There are some evidences also for effectiveness of other medications. Patients treated acutely usually show rapid and full therapeutic response but even longstanding catatonia can improve. However, some authors suggested that chronic catatonia in the context of schizophrenia is phenomenologically different and less responsive to lorazepam and ECT, especially if associated with echophenomena. We present here the case of a patient with longstanding catatonic schizophrenia treated with antipsychotics who significantly improved after ECT. Improvement regarded mainly catatonia, but also negative symptoms, cognition and psychosocial functioning. A slight amelioration in prefrontal metabolism (Brain[F]FDG PET) one month following the ECT course was also noted.",

      "abstract": "A complaint of bloating or swelling of sufficient severity to lead to medical consultation is the lead symptom of a syndrome (the fluid retention syndrome) which includes affective, somatic and autonomic symptoms. These appear to have a primary origin in a neuroendocrine disturbance of limbic and hypothalamic function and form a substantial part of the work-load of a menopause clinic. The fluid retention syndrome, in turn, is one component of a spectrum of affective-somatic-autonomic disorders which comprise a significant part of the general practitioner's work load. Major risk factors for the fluid retention syndrome comprise a strong family history of swelling symptoms and/or diabetes mellitus, affective illness, including major life events, weight gain and obesity. Short term exacerbations of swelling are precipitated by emotional stress, high carbohydrate meals, alcohol, prolonged standing and exercise, high ambient temperatures and rebound oedema following the withdrawal of diuretic therapy. Management involves recognition of the syndrome, a clear explanation of its nature to the patient, the control of weight-related fluid retention by reduction to a pre-morbid target weight and the avoidance of inappropriate drug therapy. In particular, diuretics should not be prescribed for fluid-retaining symptoms. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) should be prescribed for patients with the fluid retention syndrome if there is biochemical evidence of ovarian failure. The role of HRT in inducing rapid bloating independently of weight gain requires evaluation by a randomised controlled clinical trial. More effective management of the syndrome awaits further understanding of the neuroendocrine substrate for the disorder.",

      "abstract": "The use of steroids and supplements can complicate the clinical picture in a young man with mood swings, anxiety, and depression referred for psychiatric evaluation by his primary care clinician and a psychologist. Identifying information: A 20-year-old single man was referred by his primary care physician and a psychologist for medical management of mood swings, anxiety, and confusion. Chief complaint: The patient reported unremitting sadness that had lasted more than a year, and said that he generally felt dead inside or like a zombie. He was often ruminative and irritable, with difficulty concentrating. History of present illness: The young man's sadness and disagreeable sensations were relieved only for periods of 3 to 4 days when he felt more worried than sad. It was during these intervals of worry that he grew more ruminative, tired, and irritable, and said he could not sort out his thoughts. The patient could not recall when he last felt well enough to have fun with friends. He ruminated about the past, often trying to change it in his mind and thereby causing himself to become confused about what was real and what he might have imagined to be real. In particular, he was preoccupied with the recent loss of a relationship with a girl, which began in high school. He blamed the loss on his moodiness. However, he also acknowledged that he briefly dated her younger sister, a short time after which the girlfriend abruptly stopped returning his calls, telling him it was payback for dating her sister. The patient spent a great deal of time online looking at his ex-girlfriend's MySpace social-interaction page, which only caused him to feel worse. He blamed himself for everything that was wrong in his life and struggled with thoughts that people were talking and thinking about him negatively. Because he believed he was physically too small, he exercised regularly to stay in good shape. Medications and allergies: The referring primary care physician and psychologist had prescribed sertraline 100 mg/d for 3 weeks. They then switched him to venlafaxine 225 mg/d, which he took for 4 to 5 weeks. However, the patient stopped taking both drugs on his own initiative because they made him feel numb, and he also thought they made him feel more depressed. In the week before the initial psychiatric evaluation, his father had given him some sleeping medications because he was often tense, keyed up, and unable to relax in the evenings and around bedtime. They did not help. Otherwise, this young man had not been taking any medications during the previous 6 months. Psychiatric history: The patient had never been hospitalized and denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation. As mentioned, he sometimes thought he could undo the past by some ritualistic rnental action. The young man was an only child and spent a lot of time talking about this. He denied any history of childhood trauma. However, he held an unusual suspicion that his parents were hiding a birth defect from him, and that this defect was in some manner related to his current issues and difficulties. He did not give any more details about this suspicion, saying, Every time I ask them about it, they tell me I'm crazy and just make a joke about it. His mother reported that it took about 10 years to conceive, but there were no complications with the pregnancy or delivery. The patient received no intervention during the first 6 months of the current episode, when his family doctor was contacted. The doctor referred the patient to a psychologist for counseling, and the psychologist quickly referred him back to the doctor, believing that the young man needed a prescription for antidepressant medication. His mother said he was drinking alcohol more regularly while on his medications, and that he was probably not fully compliant with the antidepressant regimens. He was never prescribed benzodiazepines for his anxiety and tension, apparently due to concern about abuse potential. …",

We report a young adult female with no history of bipolar disorder who developed mania and psychosis approximately 1 week following initiation of G cambogia and the Cleanse and Detox™ dietary supplement manufactured by Apex Vitality Health. She presented with a predominantly expansive mood, psychomotor agitation, disorganized and pressured speech, flight of ideas, grandiosity, delusions, and auditory hallucinations. Following discontinuation of G cambogia and the initiation of lithium and quetiapine, the patient experienced rapid and progressive mood stabilization and was discharged after 8 days. Seven previous case reports associating (hypo)mania and/or psychosis with G cambogia consumption have been published. The chronology of mania and/or psychosis onset may appear between 1 and 8 weeks following initiation of G cambogia. Psychiatric symptoms have resolved with G cambogia discontinuation in some instances and may not require chronic pharmacotherapy.

Symptoms consist in the compulsion to move the lower limbs caused by unspecified unpleasant sensations. This disorder is difficult to diagnose because it imitates other diseases. For this reason, differential diagnosis plays a large role in diagnosis. In the case of a slight exacerbation of symptoms, non-pharmacological activities are used, such as improving the conditions of falling asleep, avoiding intense work at the computer just before bedtime, stimulants (coffee, strong tea), energy drinks. Pharmacological treatment should be introduced if the symptoms are more severe. Pharmacotherapy depends on the nature of the symptoms. In the recurrent form, the drug of choice is the lowest effective dose of levodopa. In chronic forms, we permanently use drugs from the group of dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine) or so-called gabapentinoid (gabapentin, pregabalin).",

Many measures used to prevent or reduce jet lag are inappropriate or ineffective and some may even be dangerous, such as use of melatonin. One of the most reliable preventive techniques consists of reinforcing social synchronizers by maintaining exposure to sunlight and social activity.

      "title": "THE EFFECT ON THE STOMACH OF STIMULATION OF THE PERIPHERAL END OF THE VAGUS NERVE",
      "abstract": "Stimulation of the peripheral cut end of either vagus by means of the faradic current will, if the organ be in a state of “hypotonus,” either initiate movements in the quiescent stomach, or, if movements are present, augment and sometimes accelerate them. A rise of entogastric pressure may accompany these movements. The contractions produced are indistinguishable from accentuated normal movements‐they are an exaggeration of the normal‐unless the stimulus be exceptionally strong, when a tonic contraction may result : from this, however, “escape” shortly occurs. The motor effect is preceded by a brief interval or latent period of some three seconds, and should the viscus be initially in a condition of “hypertonus,” this is followed by a period during which movements, if present, cease, and relaxation occurs. Augmented or initial contractions ensue later, but may be delayed until after the cessation of stimulus : there is not necessarily a restoration of entogastric pressure. The pre‐existing state of the peripheral mechanism governs the response to stimulation, the most marked results being obtained with the active organ, the least with the passive. The X‐ray picture on vagal stimulation shows that the effects on function are augmentor and accelerator: food in the cesophagus passes through the cardia, the waves of contraction are deeper than normal, and the pylorus functions rapidly, food leaving through the sphincter before every antral contraction. A brief preliminary relaxation may be observed. These effects remain unchanged by alterations of anæsthetics, decerebration, or splanchnic section. A vaso‐constrictor effect may be obtained on stimulation of the peripheral cut end of the vagus. The first part of the duodenum functions with the stomach and is controlled by the vagus in a similar manner. Stimulation of the intact nerve, the other being undivided, gives variable results, depending on the preexisting state, and on whether the centripetal or centrifugal influences predominate. We desire to make clear that our use of the entogastric pressure is only as an index of the activity or inactivity of the organ, and that by it we are endeavounrng to gauge the condition of the peripheral mechanism. We use the digesting or quiescent viscus in order to obtain variations in this state of the peripheral mechanism, and these are demonstrable by the entogastric pressure, latent period, and “response.” The majority of our findings may be summarised as follows:— 1. The primary effect of stimulation of the peripheral cut end of either vagus on the stomach is dependent on the existing condition of the peripheral mechanism (“tonus”), and may be inhibitor or augmentor. 2. The inhibitor or augmentor effect may involve both “tonus” and movement. 3. The final effect of stimulation is to bring about the augmentation of existing movement or to initiate movement. 4. “Tonus” and contraction may vary inversely or directly.",

      "title": "[Neurobiology of alcohol withdrawal inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters].",
      "abstract": "Alcohol withdrawal is a syndrome that is the result of adaptive changes in the brain secondary to chronic alcohol use and is associated with changes in many neurotransmitter, neuropeptide, and hormonal systems. Long-term exposure to ethanol leads to an imbalance in different excitatory (especially glutamate, a major excitatory amino acid), and inhibitory neurotransmitter (especially GABA, a major inhibitory amino acid) systems. When alcohol consumption is reduced or completely ceases, these imbalances are behaviorally expressed in the form of alcohol withdrawal. Symptoms of alcohol withdrawal are mainly associated with the hypofunction of GABA receptors and enhanced function of NMDA receptors. The imbalance between receptors may be exacerbated by repeated withdrawal. Some of these alterations may last for months following alcohol cessation and cause symptoms of protracted alcohol withdrawal, which may contribute to the continuation of the cycle of alcohol addiction relapses. The search for biological alterations during alcohol withdrawal may not only render some important insights into the pathophysiology of alcohol dependence, but might also identify new targets for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal symptoms and for preventing relapses following withdrawal. Therapists specializing in the treatment of addiction should be cognizant of the underlying biological mechanisms of alcohol withdrawal in order to more adequately understand the physiopathology of substance dependence in general. In this paper, we will review the changes in the inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitter systems involved in alcohol withdrawal, and we will discuss their roles in the development of alcohol dependence.",

      "title": "Childhood depression: early risk and resilience and introducing solids to infants",
      "abstract": "The carefree exuberance associated with young children can make the concept of childhood depression difficult to imagine. It is not surprising then that the existence of mood disorders in children has gained acceptance only in the last few decades. While debate continues regarding conceptualisations of childhood depression, evidence from over 20 years of research suggests that the major affective disorders often begin early in life. This article will outline current knowledge of childhood depression, including recent etiological evidence and implications. There is no formal diagnostic category specifically for childhood depression, with the mood disorders defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) intended to apply to both adults and children. The key feature of clinical depression is a persistently depressed mood, or pervasive loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities. However, for children and adolescents, this mood may be one of irritability rather than sadness. Associated symptoms include feelings of worthlessness, concentration problems, energy loss, and unusual changes in appetite or weight. These symptoms may occur in the context of major depressive disorder, which is marked by acute depressive episodes lasting at least two weeks, or in dysthymic disorder, in which such symptoms persist chronically for at least two years. Also grouped with the mood disorders is bipolar disorder, which is characterised by intermittent manic episodes. While this article focuses on unipolar depression, much of this information may apply to the less understood disorder of bipolar depression also. --------------------- For a number of years there had been some controversy over the appropriate timing of complementary foods to infants. It is with this background that the World Health Organisation (WHO) requested a review of the literature to establish the appropriateness of their recommendations. As a consequence, new guidelines were released in 2001 (WHO, 2001). The new guidelines recommend that complementary foods should be delayed until 6 months. It has been stressed in the literature review, however, that this is a population based recommendation and that infants must be managed individually so that appropriate interventions are provided (Kramer & Kakuma, 2004). By all standards of good nutrition, babies younger than four months who are exclusively breast-fed, or appropriately artificially fed, should not be given solids. The case for delaying complementary foods is based on the health of breast-fed infants and their mothers. The strongest evidence for the recommendation from the infants’ perspective is a reduced incidence of gastrointestinal disease and the absence of any growth deficit. For mothers, the benefit is in prolonged lactational amenorrhoea and greater post-partum weight loss (Kramer & Kakuma, 2004).",

      "abstract": "The neuropsychiatric symptoms of old patients with disturbed cerebral metabolism or blood flow mostly lead to great individual difficulties and make those patients difficult to handle: in the family as well as in hospital such patients develop alienation, isolation and therefore adaptation to a social structure deteriorates with time. In the course of a test program for medicinal therapy of this syndrome we studied the efficacy of a vincamine containing formulation (Pervincamin forte retard or Pervincamin ampoules, respectively) on the symptoms of a chronical brain disturbance. The study was randomised double-blind. We found that under the influence of the vincamine formulation the subjective symptoms, such as lack of interest, apathy, aggressiveness, raging, psychomotoric retardation, lack of concentration, dysmnesia, decreased with a statistical significance (p less than or equal to 0.05). Also the subjective symptoms, reported by the patients, such as tinnitus and vertigo decreased significantly under the treatment with the vincamine preparation. Therefore some of the parameters important for resocialisation and revitalisation of old patients could be influenced in a favourable way. Basing on the good results of our investigations, the treatment of psychiatric disturbances in old patients with vincamine containing drugs seems to be justified.",

Are anxiety and depression entirely separate disorders which may co-exist in the same patient? Does anxiety give rise to the depression? Does depression give rise to the anxiety? Are anxiety and depression manifestations of a single underlying disorders, dysphoria? Therapeutic responsivity to specific drugs suggest: relief of anxiety may reveal an underlying depression; anxiety syndromes which fail to respond to anxiolytics may respond to antidepressants; short-term relief of depression may occur at times with anxiolytics. Proposed mechanisms of action of depression and anxiety also involve overlap of the elements and systems involved. The basic sensations of pain, anticipation, depression and euphoria alone or in combination are sufficient to account for the dysphoric feelings and emotions when these sensations are associated with specific mental content. These may be related in turn to biogenic amines, beta-endorphins, diazepam receptors and possibly cocaine receptors.",

      "abstract": "The introduction of neuroleptic (or anti-psychotic) medication into clinical practice was a major advance in the treatment of schizophrenia. Numerous well-controlled, double-blind clinical trials have established the therapeutic efficacy of these agents in both the acute and long-term treatment of schizophrenia (Klein et al , 1980; Kane &amp; Lieberman, 1987). In general, the therapeutic benefit of medication has been assessed in terms of the relative reduction in the more florid signs and symptoms of schizophrenia (e.g. hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder, agitation, and hostility) and the ability of maintenance medication to reduce the rate of recurrence of these symptoms and in turn rates of rehospitalisation. At the same time it has been quite apparent that anti-psychotic drugs do not necessarily eliminate some of the major chronic disabilities of patients with this illness, disabilities reflected in impoverished affect, lack of drive and ambition, impaired spontaneity, reduced ability to relate to others, and diminished pleasure capacity. These symptoms have at times been described as negative in that they reflect an absence of or reduction in certain aspects of psychologic, cognitive, and emotional functioning in an attempt to distinguish them from the distortions or exaggerations in normal function which characterise positive symptoms (Strauss &amp; Carpenter, 1974; Jackson, 1904).",

Hyperactive basomedial nuclei played the role of a primary pathological determinant which caused the complex of emotional and behavioural disorders.

      "abstract": "Time for primary review 28 days.\n\nMore than any other organ of the body, brain integrity depends on the continuous blood supply of oxygen and glucose for covering the energy demands of the tissue. Cessation or severe reduction of blood flow results in almost instantaneous biochemical and functional deficits which become rapidly irreversible unless blood flow is promptly restored. The ischemia time that is tolerated by the brain depends, among others, on the density of ischemia, the tissue concentration of primary and secondary energy stores and the rate of energy consumption which, in turn, depends on the temperature, the degree of functional activity and the absence or presence of anesthetics and other drugs. There is also a major difference between the ischemic vulnerability of different regions of the brain. As an example, the CA1 sector of hippocampus may suffer irreversible injury after ischemia of as short as 5 min [94]whereas other nerve cell populations survive normothermic cerebrocirculatory arrest of as long as 1 h [77].\n\nThe pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia is further complicated by the fact that the severity of cell injury is modulated by numerous indirect or secondary consequences of the primary ischemic impact. Recirculation disturbances, stress responses, peroxidative changes, or the activation of genomic responses are only few examples of the large number of hemodynamic and molecular responses which determine the final outcome [153, 97]. The interpretation of experimental data of cerebral ischemia, therefore, requires intimate knowledge of the models and conditions under which the data have been collected. The number and diversity of such models, has become very large over the years because researchers have sought in vain for the ideal approach to study ischemic injury and its therapeutic reversal. Such an ideal model should be relevant to the clinical situation, it should be … \n\n* Corresponding author. Tel.: +49 (221) 4726 211; Fax: +49 (221) 4726 325; E-mail: hossmann@mpin-koeln.mpg.de",

      "abstract": "Current concepts of schizophrenia and its treatment are discussed. Schizophrenia entails negative symptoms, such as behavioral and cognitive deficits, attributed to loss of normal functions, and positive, or florid, symptoms that originate from the disturbed function of the remainder of the brain. Schizophrenia type I has positive symptoms predominating, and schizophrenia type II has negative symptoms predominating. Many atypical antipsychotics are now in Phase II and Phase III development; the prototype, clozapine, is now available. These agents challenge traditional views about drug treatment in schizophrenia. Schizophrenia may be explained by a persistent impairment in one or more neurotransmitter or neuromodulatory regulatory mechanisms, resulting in unstable or erratic neurotransmission. A more complex conceptualization of the role of the dopaminergic system makes it possible to understand the lack of biochemical tolerance to the therapeutic effects of antipsychotics, the varied time to onset of effects and prevalence of extrapyramidal symptoms, and the differences in efficacy within and among patients. Drug selection on the basis of patient-specific biological markers and neuropsychological function might expedite treatment responses. Drug therapy should augment homeostatic mechanisms and restore appropriate dopaminergic responses to physiological stimuli. Atypical antipsychotics may act by stabilizing presynaptic activity at a new set point, activating prefrontal dopaminergic systems and inhibiting mesolimbic systems, or exerting pharmacologic or functional effects on other neurotransmitter and neuropeptidergic systems. The traditional view that schizophrenia is simply a manifestation of dopaminergic overactivity is inadequate. New investigative techniques and the study of atypical antipsychotics suggest that a dysregulation hypothesis may be more consistent with the complexities of schizophrenia.",

In addition to other somatic symptoms, withdrawal-emergent dyskinesias may be observed. \"Covert dyskinesia\" refers to a masked form of tardive dyskinesia that becomes clinically detectable only after antipsychotic drugs are withdrawn or their dosage is reduced. Withdrawal dyskinesia appears under similar circumstances but disappears spontaneously in 6 to 12 weeks. Cholinergic overactivity and changes in dopamine-acetylcholine balance in the basal ganglia may underlie these withdrawal syndromes. The principal value of the concept of covert dyskinesia is in the secondary and tertiary prevention of tardive dyskinesia through early discovery and treatment.",

Case : A 17-year-old male with headache since 3 months ago, 3 days after suffered a blow to his left head from falling from a chair. At that time, the patient fainted for about 15 minutes but had no complaints after regained consciousness. Pain is felt on the left side of the head, throbbing, mild-moderate intensity, and feels heavier with a loud sound or a too-bright light. Discussion: Post-traumatic headache is clinically diagnosed. Laboratory and routine diagnostic imaging studies are unnecessary and have minimal clinical utility. Conclusion: Chronic post-traumatic headaches often occur, especially after minimally traumatic brain injury. The clinical picture is variable and may be similar to tension-type headaches and/or migraines. Pendahuluan: Nyeri kepala dalam tujuh hari setelah cedera kepala atau setelah sadar kembali dari trauma kepala disebut nyeri kepala pasca-trauma (post-traumatic headache/PTHA); disebut sakit kepala pasca-trauma kronis atau kronis (CPTHA) jika berlangsung lebih dari tiga bulan setelah cedera. Kasus: Seorang laki-laki berusia 17 tahun dengan keluhan nyeri kepala sejak 3 bulan, 3 hari setelah kepala kiri terbentur karena jatuh dari kursi. Saat itu, pasien pingsan sekitar 15 menit, tidak ada keluhan setelah sadar. Nyeri dirasakan di sisi kiri kepala, berdenyut, intensitas ringan-sedang, terasa lebih berat jika ada suara keras atau cahaya terlalu terang. Diskusi: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma didiagnosis secara klinis. Laboratorium dan studi pencitraan diagnostik rutin tidak diperlukan dan memiliki utilitas klinis minimal. Simpulan: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma kronis sering terjadi, terutama setelah cedera otak traumatis minimal. Gambaran klinisnya bervariasi dan dapat mirip nyeri kepala tipe tegang dan/atau migrain",

      "abstract": "SUMMARYProlonged fatigue is a common complaint in the community and is usually transitory. If fatigue continues for more than six months, is disabling, and is accompanied by other constitutional and neuropsychological symptoms, then a diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome [CFS] should be considered, according to the Centers for Disease Control case definition [1994]. Actually, the diagnosis of CFS is only a clinical diagnosis, since laboratory tests are only useful to identify and/or exclude alternative diseases with a well defined etiology, which may explain the same symptoms. The CFS onset is explained by different etiopathogenetic hypotheses: toxic exposure well documented in some cases [e.g., ciguatera poisoning, workers exposure to solvents and other chemicals], infectious agents [e.g., Epstein-Barr virus and other herpesviruses, coxsackievirus, etc.], immunologic factors [CFS = Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome-CFIDS], neuroendocrine alterations [significant dysfunction of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis has been observed in CFS patients]. Also the psychiatric hypothesis is still credited by CFS researchers. However, a concurrent diagnosis of major depression should exclude a diagnosis of CFS according to the last case definition. Furthermore the depressive syndrome often observed in CFS patients is often secondary to the malaise and disability. Although the various pathogenetic hypotheses are not necessarily in contrast, it seems more likely that CFS is a heterogeneous disease, probably multifactorial, or that CFS includes different pathologies which manifest with the same symptoms. Among the several questions which are still unexplained there is one of remarkable importance about the pathogenetic substrate of CFS symptoms and particularly of “fatigue.” Furthermore, it is still unclear whether the fatigue or the other neuromuscular symptoms [e.g., myalgia] have a central or a peripheral origin. Most of the alterations described so far in CFS point out a clinical and a functional impairment of the central nervous system. However, our own observations at the Reference Center for CFS Study of Chieti University indicate the existence of peripheral alterations [neuromuscular] and this supports the theory about a heterogeneity of the CFSs.",

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) defines dementia as an acquired impairment of cognitive function that includes a decline in memory beyond what would be expected for age and at least one other cognitive function, such as attention, visuospatial skills or language, or a decline in executive functioning such as planning, organization, sequencing, or abstracting. The decline cannot only affect emotional abilities, but must also interfere with work or social activities. The deficits should not be accompanied by an impairment of arousal (delirium) or be accounted for by another psychiatric condition, such as depression or schizophrenia.

      "abstract": "Objective Investigation of mental disorders in 377 patients who met ICD-10 criteria for opioid dependence. Methods Clinical observation and psychological examination. Results It was shown that mental disorders of opioid addicts consist of three types of psychopathological categories: pro-addictive phenomena (personality features and co-morbid disorders predisposing to drug abuse), meta-addictive disorders (psychopathological states gained due to drug abuse) and addictive disorders proper (craving and drug-seeking behavior). Anxiety and other neurotic symptoms are predominant types of mental disorders in opioid addicts. The core disorder of neurosis spectrum disturbances is fear of abstinence or withdrawal phobia. Withdrawal phobia determines largely negative reinforcement of drug. This phenomenon results in anticipating intake of drug and augmentation of daily drug dose. Opioid abuse leads to addictive personality deformation which including such features as constant and hypertrophied demand for positive emotional states, intolerance to frustration and other discomfort, low threshold of stress susceptibility and increased stress vulnerability, permanent urge to modulate the psychic and physical condition by dint of drug use, marked egocentricity and motivational collapse. Distorted motivational hierarchy can be illustrated by phenomenon of attractive taxis: opioid addicts show preference for the activities which lead to afford pleasure only. “Illegal exploitation” of reward system by means of drug abuse results in crucial extinction of non-rewarding routine activities (such as work or studies). Conclusion It appears that a stability of neurotic spectrum disorders and addictive personality deformation is the principal reason of low efficiency of opioid dependence treatment.",

      "abstract": "There are many challenges facing healthcare professionals. One such challenge is the continuous introduction of new synthetic drugs. Synthetic drugs pose many difficulties to providers, including identification of the drug ingested, management of symptoms, ensuring safety of the patient and his or her environment, and continual monitoring after the initial symptoms, because synthetic cathinones have many long-term effects on an individual. One such synthetic drug, flakka, is a potent second-generation synthetic cathinone. Because flakka inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine, which are involved in one's perception of pleasure, it causes inflated feelings and also causes signs and symptoms of psychosis. Flakka also induces various exaggerated symptoms, such as feelings of incredible strength, disorientation, aggression, and altered thought processes, and also can cause hyperthermia, coma, and death. Healthcare professionals need to understand the nature of flakka ingestion, the various symptoms a user may exhibit, and the long-term symptoms a person may have once the acute recovery phase has ended. Once the initial phase of ingestion is over and the patient is medically stabilized, the patient may experience signs and symptoms of psychosis or other psychiatric disorders. It is paramount that healthcare professionals are able to recognize the signs and symptoms of flakka ingestion, know the steps to take to ensure safety of the patient and those around him or her, and also know how to facilitate the patient's recovery.",

A disturbance may result from genetic/dispositional issues, from acute life events, from habitual behaviors and attitudes, or from any combination of these three types of issues. A number of treatment methods have been developed that use behavior modification and cognitive restructuring to facilitate homeostatic and circadian mechanisms of sleep, and to reduce arousal during bedtime.

Withdrawal symptoms include agitation, restlessness, insomnia, anxiety, and seizures. Sedative use should be suspected in individuals with clinical signs of toxicity. Benzodiazepines and barbiturates can be detected in standard urine drug tests. Cognitive impairment and increased risk of accidental injury and falls are the most serious medical complications.

      "abstract": "The term medically unexplained symptoms refers to physical symptoms for which there is either no or insufficient evidence of any underlying conventional disease/disorder process. There is a wide spectrum of severity ranging from essentially normal experience (e.g. an occasional headache) to symptoms which result in severe and long-standing disability. Where symptoms group together in clusters suggestive of a link to a particular bodily system, they have been termed functional somatic syndromes. The term somatoform disorders refers to a specific set of formal psychiatric diagnoses involving conditions which predominantly present with physical symptoms or a worry about physical disease. Only people at the more severe end of the medically unexplained symptoms spectrum meet criteria for one of the somatoform disorders and there is considerable dissatisfaction with the current psychiatric classification system for these conditions, which is discussed later in this chapter. Functional somatic syndromes By the time most people with medically unexplained symptoms are referred to a liaison psychiatrist, they are likely to have picked up a label of one or more of the functional somatic syndromes (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, fibromyalgia). Many different functional syndromes have been described over the past 30 years according to different symptom clusters (Table 6.1). There is considerable overlap in symptoms between different functional conditions and somatoform disorders, yet most of these syndromes are studied as if they are discrete conditions within particular medical specialties, with a focus on the specific set of somatic symptoms, which are specialty specific. There is still uncertainty as to the degree of overlap of these conditions and the relative common factors they may share. In one study, Fink et al (2007) studied 978 patients admitted to hospital from primary care and a medical and neurological department who scored highly on somatic screening measures. They found that patients complained of a median of five functional somatic symptoms (women six and men four). Principal component analysis identified three symptom groups explaining 37% of the variance: cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal. Further analysis showed that the symptom groups were not discrete and patients were likely to report symptoms from different groups, suggesting that the groups were different manifestations of a common latent phenomenon: bodily distress.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety symptoms vary moment-to-moment within a day. One factor that may influence these variations is chronotype. Evening chronotypes prefer to engage in activities (e.g., sleep, physical and social activity) later in the day, and evening chronotype is implicated in psychopathology, including anxiety-related disorders. However, it is unknown whether chronotype influences diurnal variation in anxiety symptoms and whether these effects are amplified in individuals with a probable anxiety-related disorder. We examined the diurnal variation in anxiety symptoms and daily activities in morning and evening chronotypes with and without probable generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in a community sample of adults (N = 410). Evening chronotypes reported higher anxiety symptoms, particularly in the evening hours, and lower engagement in daily activities, predominantly in the morning hours. Evening chronotypes with probable GAD or OCD reported worse anxiety symptoms in the evening. Our findings indicate that anxiety symptoms and engagement in daily activities fluctuate considerably across the day, and these patterns differ depending on chronotype. Evening chronotypes have more anxiety symptoms in the evening, despite preferring this time of day. Personalized treatment approaches that consider chronotype and target certain times of day may be efficient in alleviating peaks in anxiety symptoms.",

Migraines are brought on by numerous behavioural, ecological, and genetic factors. There are various types of migraines, of which migraine without aura is the most common. The objective of this article is to determine the causes of migraine headaches, review the appropriate diagnosis of migraine, and describe the migraine headache management alternatives that are available. Various treatments for migraine are available on the market. Among the many types of headaches, migraines are neurological in nature and are inherited in some people. It has four phases: prodromal phase, aura, attack phase, and postdrome phase. Stress, anxiety, changes in the female endocrine system, bright lights, loud noises, foul odour, excessive or insufficient sleep, changes in the environment or the climate, flashes of light or intense lighting, overexertion, missing meals, drinking alcohol and smoking, quitting caffeine, and taking too many migraine drugs are some of the triggering factors for migraine. Diagnosis of migraine mainly relies on a good history. Appropriate prevention can be done for specific indications. Treatment mainly revolves around medications like analgesics, triptans, ergot derivatives, and newly derived biologics. Lifestyle modifications are also essential as many daily life factors contribute to migraine. Migraine can be well-managed if sufficient attention and care are given along with proper medications and guidance. The patient should not ignore symptoms and report to the physician at the earliest so that correct management can be done.",

      "title": "Diagnostic and Therapeutic Approach to Hypothalamic Amenorrhea",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) is a secondary amenorrhea with no evidence of endocrine/systemic causal factors, mainly related to various stressors affecting neuroendocrine control of the reproductive axis. In clinical practice, HA is mainly associated with metabolic, physical, or psychological stress. Stress is the adaptive response of our body through all its homeostatic systems, to external and/or internal stimuli that activate specific and nonspecific physiological pathways. HA occurs generally after severe stressant conditions/situations such as dieting, heavy training, or intense emotional events, all situations that can induce amenorrhea with or without body weight loss and HA is a secondary amenorrhea with a diagnosis of exclusion. In fact, the diagnosis is essentially based on a good anamnestic investigation. It has to be investigated using the clinical history of the patient: occurrence of menarche, menstrual cyclicity, time and modality of amenorrhea, and it has to be exclude any endocrine disease or any metabolic (i.e., diabetes) and systemic disorders. It is necessary to identify any stressant situation induced by loss, family or working problems, weight loss or eating disorders, or physical training or agonist activity. Peculiar, though not specific, endocrine investigations might be proposed but no absolute parameter can be proposed since HA is greatly dependent from individual response to stressors and/or the adaptive response to stress. This article tries to give insights into diagnosis and putative therapeutic strategies.",

      "abstract": "The concept of prodromal symptoms in schizophrenia is an old matter of debate. There have been reported several signs and symptoms that are considered to have a predictive value in a first psychotic episode, namely in the mood or anxious spectrums. However, these symptoms are not specific and can overlap with other disorders that have to be considered in the differential diagnosis. To present a young adult with marked anxious symptoms, namely in obsessive-compulsive spectrum, and psychotic (subclinical) symptoms, questioning the extension of the comorbidity between anxious disorders and schizophrenia. A case report is presented and a literature review of the theme is shortly surveyed. The case report is about a 20 years old man, who have been developing for about two years obsessive thoughts of doubt concerning his sexuality, death and his mental health. Additionally, he described sensations of depersonalization, derealization and an intense distress that have been interfering with his function and daily activity. Several studies report substantial presence of anxious symptoms (including OCD symptoms) in schizophrenia, suggesting its early appearance in the development of the disease. Moreover, they can act as predictor of poorer outcome and may promote transition from psychotic symptoms to schizophrenia. In schizophrenia prodromal stages, anxious symptoms may increase the risk and predict the development of psychosis disorder. On the other hand, the existence of mild psychotic symptoms can be present in neurotic disorders, witch compels clinicians to be cautious in the differential diagnosis that enclose these symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are disturbances of usual sleep patterns or behaviors caused by deregulation of neuronal synchronicity and of the balance of the neurotransmitter system involved in sleep regulation. Insomnia and hypersomnia are frequent sleep disorders, and these are most often treated pharmacologically with hypnotics and wake-promoting compounds. These compounds act on classical neurotransmitter systems, such as benzodiazepines on gamma amino butyric acid (GABA)(A) receptors, and amphetamine-like stimulants on monoaminergic terminals to modulate neurotransmission. In addition, acetylcholine, amino acids, lipids and proteins (cytokines) and peptides, are known to significantly modulate sleep, and thus, are possibly involved in the pathophysiology of some sleep disorders. Due to recent developments in molecular biological techniques, many neuropeptides have been newly identified, and some are found to significantly modulate sleep. Recent discoveries also include the finding that the impairment of hypocretin/orexin neurotransmission (a recently isolated hypothalamic neuropeptide and receptor system), is the major pathophysiology of narcolepsy with cataplexy. A hypocretin replacement therapy is anticipated to reverse the disease symptoms in humans. In this article, we will review the history of neuropeptide research, sleep modulatory effects of various neuropeptides, and the general strategies for the pharmacological therapeutics targeting the peptidergic systems by referring to hypocretin-deficient narcolepsy as an immediate example.",

The nosology of anxiety.Anxiety is phenomenologically defined as a state experienced as fear or tension dependent on whether psychic or somatic manifestations prevail. Primary anxiety is initial and dominant, whereas secondary anxiety is secondary to and less prominent than other symptoms. Primary anxiety may be rational or irrational, dependent on whether the background is apparent or not for the individual. Irrational anxiety may be somatogenic or neurotic. Neurotic anxiety may appear as free-floating, focal, or transformed into other symptoms. Free-floating neurotic anxiety constitutes anxiety neurosis that is divided into panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Panic attacks are characteristic of panic disorder and may give rise to a sequential development of anticipatory anxiety, agoraphobia, secondary depression, and abuse of alcohol and anxiolytic drugs. Depersonalization/derealization and hyperventilation may dominate the picture in some cases. Both forms of anxiety neurosis may show muscular tension and vegetative symptoms and hypochondria may be superposed.",

Analyses of the individual items of this scale in patients treated with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have shown that not all items respond equally or with the same time of onset of improvement (Table 1).1,2 The items which respond less well or more slowly with SSRIs include lassitude, loss of energy, retardation of thoughts or actions, as well as concentration difficulties and loss of alertness. The loss of interest or pleasure that depressed patients experience (anhedonia) also responds poorly to SSRIs, and patients often complain of emotional indifference or blunting. Certain sleep difficulties are sometimes worsened by SSRIs. Appetite loss can be aggravated by certain SSRIs, an effect which can be made worse by nausea at the beginning of treatment.",

Uma crise epileptica e definida como “a ocorrencia transitoria de sinais e/ou\r\nsintomas secundarios a atividade neuronal cerebral anormal”. A epilepsia e uma sindrome\r\nencefalica definida por pelo menos uma das seguintes condicoes: (1) pelo menos 2 crises\r\nepilepticas nao provocadas em um intervalo superior a 24 horas; (2) uma convulsao nao \r\nprovocada em individuos que possuem fatores associados a uma maior probabilidade de\r\napresentar um limiar epileptico diminuido; (3) diagnostico de sindrome da epilepsia.\r\nIndividuos com epilepsia apresentam mais chances de sofrer morte subita, sendo a morte\r\nsubita e inesperada na epilepsia (SUDEP) a categoria mais comum. O modelo de epilepsia\r\ninduzida por pilocarpina (EIP) tem sido o mais usado para estudar a epilepsia do lobo\r\ntemporal (ELT). Sabe-se que o sistema renina angiotensina (SRA) esta envolvido em algumas\r\ndoencas neurodegenerativas, bem como na epilepsia. E, ja foi demonstrado que areas do\r\nsistema nervoso central (SNC) responsaveis pelo comportamento de sede e apetite ao sodio\r\nsao afetadas por este modelo de epilepsia. Desta forma, este estudo buscou estudar o\r\ncontrole cardiovascular frente a alteracoes dos niveis centrais de angiotensina II (Ang II),\r\ncarbacol e osmolaridade plasmatica no modelo EIP. Para isso foram utilizados ratos Wistar\r\n(250-280 g), pre tratados com metilescopolamina (1mg/kg intraperitoneal -i.p.) em seguida\r\nreceberam uma injecao de pilocarpina (350 mg/kg –ip) para inducao do SE. Apos 3 horas de\r\nSE, foi injetado dizepam (10 mg/kg -i.p.) para interromper a crise. Foram feitos o\r\nacompanhamento de ingestao diaria de agua e NaCl 1,8%, em que nao foi encontrada\r\ndiferenca entre os grupos, e do peso corporal em que o grupo com epilepsia obteve um ganho\r\nde peso menor quando comparado ao grupo controle (358 ± 13 vs. 406 ± 6 g,\r\nrespectivamente). Animais previamente preparados com cânulas direcionadas ao ventriculo\r\nlateral (VL) foram divididos em dois grupos os quais foram submetidos a registro dos\r\nparâmetros cardiovasculares: um grupo que recebeu injecao intracerebroventricular (icv) de\r\nAng II e outro de carbacol. Observamos que a resposta pressora foi maior no grupo com\r\nepilepsia quando comparado ao controle apos a injecao de Ang II (epilepsia: 28,0 ± 3,3 vs.\r\nControle: 13,3 ± 0,7 mmHg, p<0,05), a variacao da frequencia cardiaca (ΔFC) nao foi\r\ndiferente entre os grupos. Nos animais que receberam injecao icv de carbacol, a resposta\r\npressora nao foi diferente entre os grupos, mas houve diferenca dentro dos grupos\r\ncomparando com o basal (-0,5 ± 1,4 vs. 22,3 ± 4,6 mmHg, epilepsia e 1,0 ± 2,3 vs. 24,3 ±\r\n4,0 mmHg, controle, p<0,05), a Δ FC foi diferente entre os grupos (Epilepsia: -24,3 ± 6,1 vs.\r\nControle: -56,3 ± 13,2 bpm), bem como dentro do grupo controle comparando seu periodo\r\nbasal ao periodo pos-injecao de carbacol (396,7 ± 17,0 vs. -56,3 ± 13,2 bpm,\r\nrespectivamente). Em outro experimento, os animais foram submetidos ao registro apos a\r\nsobrecarga intragastrica de NaCl 12%, os quais apresentaram uma queda da pressao nos\r\ntempos 30, 40 e 50 min no grupo com epilepsia quando comparamos ao periodo de 10\r\nminutos apos a gavagem (10’: 5,6 ± 2,9 vs. 30’: -8,0 ± 5,3 mmHg; 40’: -11,5 ± 4,9 mmHg;\r\n50’: -9,0 ± 4,5 mmHg). Esta queda nao foi observada nos animais controle. Quanto a Δ FC\r\nnao houve diferenca entre os grupos, porem no grupo com epilepsia houve um aumento apos\r\na gavagem quando comparamos os tempos -10, -1, 40, 50 e 60 minutos (10’: 49,2 ± 23,0\r\nvs. -10’: 0,0 ± 0,0 bpm; -1’: -5,7 ± 11,1 bpm; 40’: 3,5 ± 7,3 bpm; 50’: -7,0 ± 9,6 bpm e\r\n60’: -5,7 ± 11,3 bpm). Nossos resultados sugerem que a epilepsia induzida por pilocarpina e\r\ncapaz de alterar mecanismos centrais dependentes de angiotensina, carbacol e aumento da\r\nosmolaridade plasmatica que alteram o controle da pressao arterial prejudicando o organismo\r\nem situacoes corriqueiras e contribuindo para a SUDEP.",

In all 7 children whose doses were reduced, improvement of the depressive or obsessive compulsive symptoms was maintained on the lower dosage. Clinicians treating children with fluoxetine are cautioned to be aware of behavioral side effects which may be alleviated by dosage reduction or possibly by starting with lower doses.

Results: A 44-year-old woman with borderline personality traits and severe drug dependence developed a protracted drug-induced psychosis related to chronic high-dose crystalline methamphetamine use. Complete resolution of symptoms occurred with antipsychotic medication and abstinence from methamphetamine. Rapid recurrence of symptoms occurred at a time of high stress associated with minimal methamphetamine use and cessation of low-dose quetiapine. Symptoms rapidly resolved with abstinence, quetiapine and reduction of stressors. Conclusions: A drug-induced psychosis resembling paranoid schizophrenia can occur with repeated or high-dose use of methamphetamine. While this generally resolves rapidly with cessation of stimulant use, some cases of protracted drug-induced psychosis in vulnerable individuals have been documented. Behavioural sensitization can also occur, and neuroleptics may prevent the recurrence of further psychosis triggered by ongoing low-dose methamphetamine use.",

      "title": "Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder. A diagnosis of insomnia requires both a report of poor sleep at night and residual daytime impairment associated with the poor sleep. Insomnia is associated with many other medical problems ranging from depression to any issue that causes physical discomfort or pain. Insomnia may be associated with a specific set of environmental conditions or a chronic and unremitting problem that is either primary or associated with another medical problem. Treatment of an associated medical problem like pain improves sleep in some but not all cases. Conversely, treatment for insomnia may improve other medical outcomes. Primary insomnia seems to be related to inability to down regulate arousal and is frequently characterized by increased metabolic rate, heart rate, or other physiological markers. Some research has shown that insomnia may therefore be related to the development of hypertension and other disorders related to physiological arousal. Relatively little work has linked nutrition with insomnia. Beyond associations between caffeine or stimulant use and poor sleep, there is limited work linking poor nutrition with poor sleep and improved nutrition with better sleep.",

      "abstract": "Aim. We report the case of two young subjects who developed an obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) during a heavy use of ecstasy. After several months of discontinuation of the drug, major depression with psychotic features developed in one subject and a psychotic disorder in the other individual. No mental disorder preceded the use of ecstasy in any subject. Findings. A familial and personality vulnerability for mental disorder was revealed in one subject, but not in the other, and all physical, laboratory and cerebral NMR evaluations showed normal results in both patients. Remission of OCD and depressive episode or psychotic disorder was achieved after treatment with a serotoninergic medication associated with an antipsychotic. Conclusions. The heavy long-term use of ecstasy may induce an alteration in the brain balance between serotonin and dopamine, which might constitute a pathophysiological mechanism underlying the onset of obsessive-compulsive, depressive and psychotic symptoms. The heavy use of ecstasy probably interacted with a vulnerability to psychiatric disorder in one subject, whereas we cannot exclude that an “ecstasy disorder” ex novo affected the other individual.",

      "abstract": "The cause of prolonged or recurrent symptoms following the cessation of long-term benzodiazepine use is proposed to be related to downregulation and allosteric decoupling of the γ-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine receptor complex. This case series describes 2 patients with prolonged (>2 weeks) recurrent complications during attempted tapering of benzodiazepine doses after long-term treatment. Excited catatonia developed in a 90-year-old woman, and prolonged delirium developed in a 69-year-old woman. Both patients showed improvement of symptoms after resumption of higher doses of benzodiazepine treatment and recurrence of symptoms when the dose was again lowered. Caution should be exercised regarding the long-term use of benzodiazepines in older adults (aged ≥65 years). Tapering of benzodiazepines in older patients after long-term treatment may require slow decreases in dose over long periods. Psychotherapeutic interventions, such as brief cognitive therapy with psychoeducation and motivational enhancement, and osteopathic manipulative treatment to decrease paravertebral muscle tension may be beneficial during the tapering process.",

      "title": "Pharmacological treatment of poststroke pathological laughing and crying",
      "abstract": "A 60-year-old man with left-sided limb weakness after a stroke was referred for assessment and treatment of depression. The patient reported that, after his stroke 2 weeks ago, he has been crying “for no reason” several times a day. He described that the crying spells last several seconds and cannot be resisted. The patient denies depressed mood or symptoms consistent with a mood disorder. On examination, stereotyped paroxysms of crying lasting 5–10 seconds were noted during the interview, incongruent to any emotional themes discussed. The patient was diagnosed with pathological crying and was started on citalopram 10 mg orally at night. On follow-up, he reported that his crying spells stopped within days of initiating the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication.\r\n\r\nPathological laughing and crying (PLC) is one of the most common poststroke affective disorders. The cardinal feature of this disorder is a markedly lowered threshold for exhibiting affective behaviour (crying, laughing or both) that is out of proportion to underlying feelings of happiness or sadness. At an extreme, the expression of affect is completely incongruous to the reported underlying emotional experience. Pure pathological crying is by far the most common presentation, representing approximately 80% of cases of post-stroke PLC. Estimates of the prevalence of PLC vary from 7% to up to 48.5% of stroke survivors, with a greater prevalence found in inpatient populations and during the acute post-stroke period.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is important to consider the presence of a depressive episode in people who present with excessive emotionality, most people with PLC do not have a diagnosable mood disorder, and many do not manifest depressive symptoms at all.\r\n\r\nThe etiology of PLC is unknown. Converging lines of evidence suggest that monoaminergic neurotransmission is altered in those who develop PLC after a stroke.\r\n\r\nFour double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment trials of antidepressant drugs in the treatment of PLC have been reported in the English literature. In pooled data of 93 people from these placebo-controlled trials of nortriptyline, fluoxetine, sertraline and citalopram, 96% of patients who received antidepressant medication demonstrated a greater than 50% reduction in the number of crying episodes at the end of the treatment trials, compared with 27.5% of patients who received placebo, yielding a number needed to treat (NNT) of 1.5. Antidepressants have been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of crying or laughing episodes after a stroke, often within days, rather than the weeks typically expected before antidepressant effects are seen. SSRIs should be regarded as the first-line choice when treating poststroke PLC, given the greater tolerability of SSRIs and their lower propensity to have effects on the cardiovascular system, compared with tricyclic antidepressant drugs. The doses of the SSRI medications that were effective in treating PLC in the studies described above (fluoxetine 20 mg, sertraline 50 mg and citalopram 10–20 mg) are at the low end of the therapeutic range used for treating depression. Case reports suggest that bupropion, mirtazapine, venlafaxine and lamotrigine may be effective for PLC in people who cannot tolerate, or do not respond to, SSRIs.\r\n\r\nThere are limited data to guide clinicians on how long patients should remain on treatment. For most stroke patients, the natural history of PLC is for the symptoms to gradually improve over time. However, it is estimated that 10%–15% of people continue to manifest symptoms a year after a stroke. Reports have suggested that PLC can reemerge after discontinuing the antidepressant drug, whereas reinstatement of the medication leads to swift amelioration of these symptoms. The need for long-term treatment needs to be evaluated on an individual basis.\r\n\r\nPeter Giacobbe, MD Alastair Flint, MB Department of Psychiatry University of Toronto Department of Psychiatry University Health Network Toronto Rehabilitation Institute Toronto, Ont.",

Kelainan fundamental dari gangguan jiwa kelompok ini adalah adanya perubahan yang nyata pada suasana perasaan (mood) atau afek menuju ke arah depresi yang ditandai dengan kemurungan, kelesuan, ketidakgairahan hidup, perasaan tidak berguna, dan putus asa. Seorang wanita usia 24 tahun datang ke poliklinik Rumah Sakit Jiwa Provinsi Lampung dengan keluhan utama merasa sedih yang berlebihan sejak tiga minggu yang lalu setelah dirinya didiagnosis menderita kista folikuler oleh dokter spesialis kandungan. Pasien telah mendapatkan penjelasan bahwa kista tersebut dapat sembuh sendiri apabila pasien memiliki anak lagi, namun pasien tetap merasa khawatir dan tidak bisa melawan rasa sedihnya ketika mengingat kondisinya tersebut. Pasien juga menjadi malas bekerja dan beraktivitas, lebih sering di rumah, dan mengalami gangguan tidur, sakit kepala, serta pegal-pegal pada tubuhnya. Pada pemeriksaan fisik tidak didapatkan kelainan klinis sedangkan pada pemeriksaan psikiatri didapatkan gangguan berupa mood hipotimia dengan afek yang sempit dan serasi, tidak didapatkan gangguan isi pikir dan tidak didapatkan gangguan persepsi. Pasien didiagnosis dengan aksis I: (F.32.11) episode depresif sedang dengan gejala somatik, aksis II: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis III: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis IV: masalah dengan psikososial, dan aksis V: Global Assestment of Functioning (GAF) score 70-61 (pada saat pemeriksaan).

      "title": "Consultation with the Specialist: Management of Status Epilepticus in Children",
      "abstract": "The definition of status epilepticus (SE) is a simple, prolonged seizure or recurrent seizures associated with impaired consciousness for 30 minutes or longer. There are two types of SE: convulsive and nonconvulsive. The latter consists of prolonged absence or complex partial seizures.SE occurs most frequently in patients younger than 1 year of age and those between 60 and 80 years. Determining the underlying cause of SE is of utmost importance and is directed by the clinical presentation. The differential diagnosis is similar in all age groups, although the frequencies change in the various diagnostic categories. Table 1 delineates some of the leading causes of SE in various age groups.The differential diagnosis in any age group should include both systemic and central nervous system (CNS)infections; trauma; hypoxia; CNS malformations; ischemic events, including stroke or hemorrhage; and toxic or metabolic causes, including electrolyte imbalance, alcohol use, illicit drug use, and inborn errors of metabolism. External and internal antiepileptic drug withdrawal also is a significant factor.The incidence of SE due to infection and congenital anomalies is higher in the pediatric age group. If a child is younger than 3 years of age,infection, hypoxia, or metabolic disturbances are the most likely causes. In the child older than 3 years, idiopathic epilepsy, congenital anomalies, or chronic encephalopathies are the more likely precipitants. Although usually benign, febrile seizures can progress to SE.Neonatal SE is challenging to diagnose and treat because seizures in neonates are usually subtle and not dramatic in appearance. Clinical manifestations include rhythmic eye movements, rowing or pedaling motions of the legs, tonic posture, or less commonly focal or multifocal generalized tonic, clonic, or tonic-clonic seizures. It often is difficult to correlate clinical seizures with electrocerebral epileptiform activity on electroencephalography (EEG). The decision to treat needs to be based on the underlying etiology of the seizures, background and ictal activity of the EEG, and consideration of the consequences of chronic antiepileptic drug administration.SE is associated with a poorer prognosis in adults than in children. Average mortality rates in one study were 25% for adults versus 2.5% in children. Alcohol and drug abuse account for a large percentage of cases of SE.Table 2 lists a classification scheme for SE. Convulsive,either generalized or partial, is the most easily recognizable form of SE. Nonconvulsive often is difficult to identify and to differentiate from confusional migraine and psychiatric fugue states. Cascino reported that 25%of persons experiencing SE have absence or complex partial SE.Important differential diagnoses in patients who have nonconvulsive SE (absence or complex partial), depending in part upon their age, include confusional states or unresponsiveness associated with transient ischemic attacks,transient global amnesia, stroke, or migraine. Toxic and metabolic causes should be sought early in the evaluation. One must always consider psychiatric disorders, such as various forms of psychosis, fugue states, and",

Excessive caffeine ingestion leads to symptoms that overlap with those of many psychiatric disorders. Caffeine is implicated in the exacerbation of anxiety and sleep disorders, and people with eating disorders often misuse it. It antagonises adenosine receptors, which may potentiate dopaminergic activity and exacerbate psychosis. In psychiatric in-patients, caffeine has been found to increase anxiety, hostility and psychotic symptoms. Assessment of caffeine intake should form part of routine psychiatric assessment and should be carried out before prescribing hypnotics. Gradual reduction in intake or gradual substitution with caffeine-free alternatives is probably preferable to abrupt cessation. Decaffeinated beverages should be provided on psychiatric wards.",

Uno de los grandes logros de la medicina moderna es haber desarrollado farmacos eficaces para el tratamiento de diversos trastornos de animo con lo cual la calidad de vida de un gran numero de personas se ha incrementado notablemente. Gracias a este avance trastornos que en el pasado eran incapacitantes y requerian hospitalizacion pueden ser tratados en consulta externa con muy buenos resultados. Esto ha sido posible por la investigacion clinica y cientifica que ha llevado al desarrollo de nuevas moleculas, de diversas formas farmaceuticas y de regimenes de dosificacion apropiados para el tratamiento de distintos trastornos. Dentro de las sustancias psicoactivas no solo se encuentran las medicinas que controlan los trastornos del estado de animo, del sueno o de la ansiedad, sino las drogas de abuso, llamadas asi por su alta capacidad para producir adiccion. La experiencia indica que hay que ser cauteloso con los compuestos que conforman esta categoria ya que su consumo conlleva el riesgo de perder el control sobre la cantidad ingerida, con las consecuencias negativas asociadas para el sujeto y la sociedad. ?En que consisten las diferencias entre las medicinas psicoactivas y las drogas de abuso? La respuesta a esta pregunta es compleja y requiere tener en cuenta que los efectos de los farmacos dependen no solo de sus mecanismos particulares de accion sino de las condiciones de las personas que los consumen, del regimen de dosificacion (cuanto y cuando se toma), de la forma farmaceutica (pastilla, tableta dispersable, jarabe, ampolleta para inyeccion, parche de liberacion prolongada, etc.) y de la via de administracion. Por eso, una misma sustancia puede ser muy util cuando se usa de manera controlada en un hospital y muy peligrosa cuando se vende en el mercado negro como droga.

      "abstract": "Catatonia-like presentations can be precipitated by multiple organic and medication-related causes. Psychiatric causes of catatonia are typically associated with underlying psychotic or mood disorders. Recurrent catatonia without other precipitating psychiatric diagnosis is rarely described. We present the case of a man in his early 30′s with idiopathic recurrent catatonia, presented with patient consent. Our case presented in a catatonic state, having recently stopped using cannabis. No organic cause for his presentation was identified following extensive investigation and he was admitted for psychiatric assessment. During admission he slowly improved with benzodiazepine and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatment, alongside psychological support. Despite near complete recovery, he significantly relapsed on 2 occasions requiring psychiatric re-admission over the subsequent 6 months. Thereafter, he had multiple relapsing episodes with decreasing severity during rehabilitative care. During admission we explored extensive differentials including mood disorders, schizophrenia or psychosis, drug abuse or poisoning, as underlying triggers for his catatonia. He had a finding of FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity) on his second electroencephalogram (EEG), with no clinical correlate of seizure or structural abnormality. We found no evidence of any underlying psychiatric or organic cause for his presentation. In contrast to classical descriptions of catatonia or recurrent catatonia, our case highlights the need for greater recognition of isolated idiopathic catatonia, as a diagnosis independent of mood disorder or schizophrenia. Furthermore, we evidence effective recovery with psychological support, benzodiazepines and ECT.",

      "title": "Behavior therapy of the sexual disorders",
      "abstract": "The behavioral therapies are bringing with them a new and interestingly effective approach to the treatment of sexual disorders based upon theories of learning. The two basic means used are: (1) reciprocal inhibition, as shown in J. Wolpe's (1958, 1961) systematic desensitization, wherein anxietyprovoking situations are overcome by the presentation of graduated fear stimuli in the presence of relaxation, and (2) aversive techniques, wherein pleasureful sexual sensations are converted to painful ones by chemical or electrical means. Systematic desensitization is what its name implies, a systematic or gradual desensitization to a noxious agent, through the use of the patient's visual imagination. It is most successful when employed against anxiety-provoking situations such as impotence, premature ejaculation, and frigidity. Also against the nonsexual aspects of homosexuality, exhibitionism, and other sexual deviations. The pleasureful aspects of the sexual deviations present another problem. It is no easy task to induce a person to give up what to him is exquisite pleasure. Consequently, aversive therapy is used to convert the pleasure into pain. More of this later. Systematic desensitization is preceded by the taking of a detailed history as in any good medical examination. The history is of particular importance; it is used to determine the fear elements which enter into a disorder. As an instance, a woman who feared snakes was given a realistic synthetic snake to handle. She did so without compunction. Asked why it had not disturbed her, she replied that it was not the snake itself that bothered her, but the eyes and the forked tongue. Any list of fears must include these items separately. For another example, Eysenck (1960) recorded the history of a man with impotence which was present only when attempting intercourse with his wife at home; he did not experience it anywhere else. It appeared that as a young man he had been surprised by an irate husband in the process of seducing his wife. The husband thrashed the patient within an inch of his life. It happened that the wall",

In ranking among the cause of disability it has been ranked as major leading cause for disability in worldwide. (1) Major depressive disorder is debilitating disease and has and at least one individual depressive episode for minimum of two weeks and involves changed mood, decreased interest in surrounding and decreased pleasure specifically in activities which were earlier pleasurable along with changes in cognitive function and changes in vegetative symptoms (2) . few of these patient might report guilt feelings and feelings of worthlessness or feeling of hopelessness, also patient reports of repetitive negative thoughts about individual self and their future (3) .

Study says that if current trends for demographic and epidemiologic transitions continue by the year 2020, the burden of disease might increase up to 5.7% of total burden of the disease making it second leading cause of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), second to ischemic heart disease. (4) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are the first-line therapy for treating MDD because of their superior tolerability and safety profiles relative to monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants. (6) Therapeutic application of these inhibitors is based on the monoamine hypothesis of depression. Unfortunately, over half of MDD patients do not achieve remission after a 12-week treatment with SSRIs. Studies have also shown that one-third of patients treated with successive antidepressant therapies do not achieve remission even after a 1-year intervention.

      "title": "Hyponatremia With Anticonvulsant Medications: A Narrative Review",
      "abstract": "Hyponatremia is an adverse effect of many antiseizure medications (ASMs). It occurs with interference with the normal balance of electrolytes within the body. Various risk factors associated with the development of hyponatremia in patients taking these medications include age, gender, dosage, and combinations with other drugs. ASMs such as carbamazepine (CBZ), oxcarbazepine (OXC), and valproic acid have a higher risk of hyponatremia. Hyponatremia induced by an antiseizure medication can occur through various mechanisms depending on the drug's specific mechanism of action. Hyponatremia can be a potentially fatal side effect. Patients taking these medications need to be monitored closely for the signs and symptoms of hyponatremia. Acute hyponatremia, defined as developing in <48 hours, is more likely to show symptoms than chronic hyponatremia. Signs of acute hyponatremia include delirium, seizures, decerebrate posturing, and cerebral edema with uncal herniation. Chronic hyponatremia, defined as developing in >48 hours, can cause lethargy, dizziness, weakness, headache, nausea, and confusion. Hyponatremia is associated with longer hospital stays and increased mortality. Treatment varies based on the degree of severity of hyponatremia. Choosing a treatment option should include consideration of the drug causing the electrolyte disturbance, the patient's risk factor profile, and the severity of symptoms as they present in the individual patient. Healthcare providers should be aware of hyponatremia as a potential side effect of ASMs, the signs and symptoms of hyponatremia, the different treatment options available, and the potential complications associated with rapid correction of hyponatremia.",

Deprescribing is recommended when there is loss of efficacy, major side effects, or use longer than four weeks. The withdrawal syndrome is due to physiologic dependence based on various receptor adaptations. Psychological, neurophysiologic, and somatic complaints can be misdiagnosed as psychiatric, psychosomatic, or substance use disorder. These symptoms may be severe and prolonged. The discontinuation process should include careful planning, support, and the use of cognitive behavioral therapy. Tapering, perhaps after substituting with a long-acting BzRA, should be patient-led and proceed slowly, anticipating completion over 12 to 18 months or even longer. In a proportion of patients, symptoms may continue months or years after complete BzRA cessation, requiring ongoing medical care.",

Se disena un estudio exploratorio y descriptivo que busca precisar sus caracteristicas. Material y metodo. Se registran los fenomenos clinicos en 61 pacientes consumidores de PBC, consultantes espontaneos de un centro tratamiento de adicciones en una comuna popular de Santiago, elegidos de modo aleatorio. Resultados. Alrededor de los dos meses de uso regular la PBC provoca conductas compulsivas de busqueda y consumo de la sustancia. Es una adiccion condicionada ya que la conducta compulsiva solo aparece como respuesta a estimulos externos (principalmente la posesion de dinero) o internos (cambios animicos o la fantasia de estar fumando). En un mismo individuo existen patones de consumo muy diferentes en un breve lapso de tiempo. Rapidamente se desarrolla sensibilizacion (hipertonia y estereotipias motoras, paranoia, ilusiones auditivas, visuales y cenestesicas, que son sintomas transitorios y vinculados al estado de intoxicacion aguda) y tolerancia (disminucion y desaparicion del efecto euforizante). La sensibilizacion y la tolerancia aparecen simultaneamente y en conjunto con la conducta compulsiva. Cada episodio de consumo por lo general termina con intensos sentimientos de culpa, ansiedad y aun ideas suicidas. Existen una frecuente perdida de normativas sociales y la constitucion de un sindrome psicopatico. Conclusiones. el consumo de PBC se cine a patrones de conducta muy variables pero siempre condicionadas a estimulos internos y externos, con poca o ninguna relacion con la euforia, sugiriendo un fenomeno asociado a la neurobiologia del aprendizaje",

      "title": "Depressive Mood Disorders",
      "abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy is most often used to treat disorders of mood. The internally experienced feeling is the emotional state reflected in the way we present ourselves to others and in the ways we react to them. Mood varies with daily circumstances and is sensitive to the conditions of the body, particularly physical health, fatigue, hunger, and hormonal activity. Moods are experienced internally and fluctuate widely. Two disorders are recognized. Depression, or depressive mood disorder, is dominated by sadness, hopelessness, fear of the future, and the persistent thought that life is not worth living. Mania, or manic mood disorder, is a state of excitement, grandiosity, expansiveness, and feelings of increased power and energy. In the present psychiatric classification, mania is labeled bipolar disorder and the depressed phase is labeled major depression. In a depressive mood disorder, body functions are disrupted. Patients are sleepless, appetite is poor, and weight loss may be pronounced, at times amounting to 20% of the body weight within a few weeks. Work, sexual activity, and family may be disregarded. The future appears hopeless, patients believe they are helpless to affect it, and their thoughts are filled with gloom. Threats of suicide reflect their distress. They are often agitated and restless. Many meet the criteria for the malignant syndrome of melancholia. Overwhelmed by feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, and worthlessness, the depressed patient dwells on thoughts of suicide. He may believe that others are watching or talking about him; voices are heard when no one is present; and concerns that his spouse is unfaithful dominate his thought. At times, the events depicted on the television or movie screen seem to apply directly to him. Such strange thoughts are delusions, and this severe state of depressed mood and disorder in thought is labeled delusional depression or psychotic depression. These disorders require intensive treatment and almost always hospital care. A depressed patient is commonly unaware of the day’s events, registers little of what happens around her, and has a compromised memory. This form of depression can be difficult to distinguish from an Alzheimer-type dementia. When the symptoms of dementia are brought about by depression, however, they can be reversed with treatment.",

The patient's family decided to stop the antimicrobials as they observed an escalation of the psychotic symptoms with the ongoing use of antibiotics. The patient was subsequently brought to the emergency service (EMS) department, and she was admitted to the behavioral health unit. The treatment team managed to stabilize the patient with several interventions, including the administration of antianxiety and antipsychotic medications along with psychosocial intervention. The symptoms of psychosis resolved within 3-4 days, and she was discharged home.

A number of clinical syndromes are described and their differential diagnosis considered. The clinical picture will usually change as the child grows older.

At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal.

      "abstract": "The author presents the clinical picture of anorexia nervosa and comorbidity in women with serious symptoms of anorexia nervosa (diagnosed acc. to DSM-IV), which appeared in adulthood, after the age of 25 years.Most of these patients (25-40 years old) had mild symptoms of eating disorders (restricted anorexia nervosa), from adolescence, never diagnosed and treated, had a nondisturbed somatic state and social functioning. The worsening of psychic state and full development of anorexia nervosa symptoms occurred during stressful life event (e.g. avoidance by sexual partner). The majority of those patients had present and past (from adolescence) various anxiety and depressive disorders and personality disorders (obsessive--compulsive, borderline). In most of the women older than 40 years, anorexia nervosa comorbid with depressive disorders, less often with mixed, anxiety--depressive, disorders. The symptoms occurred during menopause, after loss of life-partner (separation or death). It was not established, which of these disorders appeared as the first one. The prognosis was better for the second group of those patients.",

      "abstract": "The classical syndrome of delirium has an abrupt onset. In the elderly, it involves a rapid cognitive decline from the preexisting level of functioning (whatever that might be) involving conscious level, orientation, attention, memory and concentration. The mental state fluctuates from minute to minute or hour to hour, often worse in the evenings than mornings. There are perceptual abnormalities (illusions, hallucinations and misrecognition), affective changes (apathy, lability, irritability, autonomic arousal), persecutory or terrifying ideas, behavioral changes (hypokinesis or hyperkinesis), and motor features – ‘plucking’ and pointing are common. It is an unpleasant state with a high mortality and a high risk of adverse iatrogenic consequences. In approximately 85% of recognised cases, one or more physical causes can be identified, for example infection, intoxication with prescribed drugs, and cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic disease. In the other 15%, psychologic factors such as removal from home, grief, depression or acute psychotic illness are sufficient to precipitate delirium. The risk of delirium appears to rise with age and underlying cerebral disease.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Food addiction is a topic that has received attention in the psychological literature in part because of the role that it potentially plays in binge eating, obesity, and eating disorders. Food addiction has also received attention as an addiction in its own right, akin to widely known addictive substances and behaviors such as drugs, gambling, and sex. An addiction is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR) as (1) the use of a substance that has mood altering or psychoactive effects, (2) highly controlled or compulsive use of a substance, and (3) the used substance reinforces behavior (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Other criteria include tolerance and physical dependence. Food addiction specifically is typically characterized by a loss of control over eating certain foods, preoccupation with or craving of certain food or foods, failed attempts to overcome the eating problem despite negative consequences, and use of the food or foods to cope with negative emotions. Food addiction has been tied most often to highly palatable foods such as chocolate, confectionary foods, carbohydrate‐rich foods, and foods high in fat content.",

Their proximity is an indicator of the closeness of the classification of the two disorders. Dissociation is often part of the response to trauma. Transient symptoms of depersonalization or derealization lasting a few moments to a few hours are commonly experienced by most people at some point in their lives. The DSM-5 criteria for dissociative identity disorder requires the presence of two or more distinct personality states that is observed or self-reported and that results in disruption or discontinuity in the sense of self, and is accompanied by changes in affect, behavior, cognition, perception, consciousness, memory, or sensory-motor functioning. Dissociative amnesia involves the inability to recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, and often follows a traumatic or stressful life event.",

Caso clínico: Se presenta el caso de un varón de 42 años con antecedentes personales de trastorno por consumo de sustancias (Heroína, cocaína, alcohol, nicotina y cannabis), con abandono del seguimiento en la unidad de conductas adictivas y múltiples ingresos y asistencias en urgencias por clínica ansioso depresiva y rasgos desadaptativos de personalidad B. Como comorbilidad presenta diabetes mellitus tipo II y EPOC de alto riesgo. En los últimos meses el paciente ha sido atendido múltiples veces en el servicio de urgencias con ajustes varios de tratamiento y con prescripciones de diferentes benzodiazepinas, con patrón de abuso de las mismas, junto con consumo de alcohol, y posterior necesidad de nueva asistencia en el servicio de urgencias por intoxicación o para solicitar medicación de nuevo. Por todo lo anterior se decide ingreso para desintoxicación de benzodiazepinas y alcohol. Conclusiones: Las benzodiazepinas son fármacos muy utilizados en todo el mundo, para diversos trastornos como la ansiedad y el insomnio, con un incremento en su uso en la ultima década. En España, se ha demostrado que hasta en un 82,5 % de los casos se excede la duración del tratamiento, siendo muy frecuente la automedicación y la dependencia. En nuestra práctica clínica, observamos con frecuencia esta problemática en los pacientes hiperfrecuentadores de los servicios de urgencias, en los que se acumulan diferentes tratamientos sin seguimiento adecuado de los mismos, lo que podría fomentar el mal uso de estos fármacos.",

      "title": "Clinical management of cannabis withdrawal",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background and Aims Cannabis withdrawal is a well‐characterized phenomenon that occurs in approximately half of regular and dependent cannabis users after abrupt cessation or significant reductions in cannabis products that contain Δ 9 ‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). This review describes the diagnosis, prevalence, course and management of cannabis withdrawal and highlights opportunities for future clinical research. Methods Narrative review of literature. Results Symptom onset typically occurs 24–48 hours after cessation and most symptoms generally peak at days 2–6, with some symptoms lasting up to 3 weeks or more in heavy cannabis users. The most common features of cannabis withdrawal are anxiety, irritability, anger or aggression, disturbed sleep/dreaming, depressed mood and loss of appetite. Less common physical symptoms include chills, headaches, physical tension, sweating and stomach pain. Despite limited empirical evidence, supportive counselling and psychoeducation are the first‐line approaches in the management of cannabis withdrawal. There are no medications currently approved specifically for medically assisted withdrawal (MAW). Medications have been used to manage short‐term symptoms (e.g. anxiety, sleep, nausea). A number of promising pharmacological agents have been examined in controlled trials, but these have been underpowered and positive findings not reliably replicated. Some (e.g. cannabis agonists) are used ‘off‐label’ in clinical practice. Inpatient admission for MAW may be clinically indicated for patients who have significant comorbid mental health disorders and polysubstance use to avoid severe complications. Conclusions The clinical significance of cannabis withdrawal is that its symptoms may precipitate relapse to cannabis use. Complicated withdrawal may occur in people with concurrent mental health and polysubstance use.",

      "abstract": "Sleeping disturbance constitutes a major problem occurring in 25% of people aged over 65. Among the most frequent reasons of insomnia one can mention the overuse of coffee, alcohol, smoking, using some drugs, stress, depression, neurosis, dementia, chronic diseases. Idiopathic insomnia constitutes less than 5% of cases. Before the treatment of insomnia is started, its cause should be found and it should be determined if it is transient or chronic. The treatment of insomnia can be based on pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacotherapy methods. Behavioural therapy is mentioned among non-pharmacotherapeutic methods. It aims at changing the sleep-related habits. Pharmacotherapeutic treatment (still mostly based on benzodiazepines) should not last longer than 2-3 weeks and drugs of short elimination T 1/2 (below 6 hours) should be used. Side-effects of this group of drugs should always be taken into consideration. It should be remembered that sleep disturbances can be symptoms of other diseases and their treatment cannot consist in prescribing hypnotics only.",

      "abstract": "Mood disorders according to DSM V, like all other psychiatric disorders, are still based\r\n on the description and grouping of symptoms. The emotional state can change in two\r\n directions: an elevated mood (which can oscillate from hypomania to mania) and lower\r\n mood (depression). For diagnosing mood disorder, it is essential to have a more\r\n comprehensive diagnostic formulation. The role plays careful observation and identifying\r\n the symptoms, which are used as the most important method for diagnosing mood\r\n disorders. There must be diagnostic criteria for each disease to determine the spectrum of\r\n symptoms occurring in the disease, but it is also important that there are minimal\r\n symptoms when deciding which diagnosis will be given to the patient. In the patient\r\n besides the main mental problem, the appearance of other illnesses, such as the\r\n circumstances that have arisen in the patient's life, and in the working and social\r\n environment, must be considered. We set the mood disorder diagnosis based on anamnesis,\r\n clinical picture, and course of the disease. In basic symptoms of depression, there is a loss\r\n of interest in, until then, important things and activities. The disturbances must last at least\r\n two weeks in order to be a depressive episode. Along with the symptoms that are\r\n compulsory, there are also symptoms such as loss of energy, appetite, sense of worth and /\r\n or guilt, deconcentration, helplessness, indecision, and suicidal thoughts until attempted\r\n suicide. Patients can become so frozen that they can not show the usual emotions, such as\r\n sorrow, joy or pleasure, or they may feel that the world around them without color and life\r\n is dead. The main symptoms that characterize mania are elevated mood, increased energy\r\n and activity. These patients experience graceful ideas, they think they have tremendous\r\n power, they think they can change the whole world. One of the picture of the disease that\r\n can occur in manic patients is the appearance of interpersonal conflicts, which can lead to\r\n paranoid treatment of reality. Pharmacological and psychological therapy gives the best\r\n results, and it is important to emphasize to the patient and family that the therapy does not\r\n have immediate effect, but that the therapy should take about two to six weeks for the drug\r\n / drugs to take effect. The patient should be monitored permanently and analyzed the\r\n results achieved. If the desired results have not been reached, it is necessary to change the\r\n approach and therapy.",

      "title": "Fatigue and brain arousal in patients with major depressive disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract Fatigue is considered a key symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD), yet the term lacks specificity. It can denote a state of increased sleepiness and lack of drive (i.e., downregulated arousal) as well as a state of high inner tension and inhibition of drive with long sleep onset latencies (i.e., upregulated arousal), the latter typically found in depression. It has been proposed to differentiate fatigue along the dimension of brain arousal. We investigated whether such stratification within a group of MDD patients would reveal a subgroup with distinct clinical features. Using an automatic classification of EEG vigilance stages, an arousal stability score was calculated for 15-min resting EEGs of 102 MDD patients with fatigue. 23.5% of the patients showed signs of hypoarousal with EEG patterns indicating drowsiness or sleep; this hypoaroused subgroup was compared with remaining patients (non-hypoaroused subgroup) concerning self-rated measures of depressive symptoms, sleepiness, and sleep. The hypoaroused subgroup scored higher on the Beck Depression Inventory items “loss of energy” ( Z = − 2.13, p = 0.033; ɳ 2 = 0.044, 90% CI 0.003–0.128) and “concentration difficulty” ( Z = − 2.40, p = 0.017; ɳ 2 = 0.056, 90% CI 0.009–0.139), and reported higher trait and state sleepiness ( p &lt; 0.05) as compared to the non-hypoaroused group. The non-hypoaroused subgroup, in contrast, reported more frequently the presence of suicidal ideation (Chi 2 = 3.81, p = 0.051; ɳ 2 = 0.037, 90% CI 0.0008–0.126). In this study, we found some evidence that stratifying fatigued MDD patients by arousal may lead to subgroups that are pathophysiologically and clinically more homogeneous. Brain arousal may be a worth while target in clinical research for better understanding the mechanisms underlying suicidal tendencies and to improve treatment response.",

      "abstract": "The negative and positive effects of the nine newer antiepileptic drugs that have received a product licence in the UK or in the US are reviewed. The importance of avoiding misinterpretation of the data because of confounding factors such as alternative psychosis, the release phenomenon or drug interactions is emphasised. Vigabatrin has been associated with both psychosis and depression. Due to the concentric visual field defects that may occur with vigabatrin, its use is now limited, although it remains the drug of choice for infantile spasms. Lamotrigine seems to be largely associated with improvement rather than deterioration of mood and behaviour. It may have a role in treating affective disorder. Gabapentin probably has relatively little effect on behaviour but may exacerbate behavioural problems in some children with pre-existing difficulties. Topiramate may precipitate both psychosis and depression, but these are less likely to occur if the currently recommended lower starting doses, escalation rates and target doses are used. The data for tiagabine are limited, but there is no clear evidence for psychosis or depression being caused by this drug. Oxcarbazepine may be of value in treating mood disorder, but the information is very limited. There are few reports of behavioural disturbances with levetiracetam, but the data suggest that there is no significant increase in psychosis or depression. There are some reports of psychosis and other behavioural disturbances with felbamate, but the use of this drug is limited by the serious adverse effects of hepatotoxicity and aplastic anaemia. There is some evidence for psychosis with zonisamide, but there is also a suggestion that this drug may be of benefit in treating psychiatric disorders. Careful individual assessment of each patient should enable the clinician to determine whether the medication or some other factor is responsible for any behavioural disturbance.",

      "abstract": "An unusual pain occurred in five patients in the presence of compromised vitamin D status and resolved 5 to 7 days after supplementation with vitamin D in the form of ergocalciferol. The pain had a hyperesthetic quality and did not respond to the use of analgesics, including opiate derivatives. Treatment with therapeutic levels of a tricyclic antidepressant did not bring relief of symptoms. In one case, months after treatment and subsequent improvement of vitamin D status and pain, the vitamin D status again declined and the pain recurred. The pain again resolved with vitamin D replacement and improvement of levels. There may be a pain syndrome associated with vitamin D depletion that appears as hyperesthesia worsened by light, superficial pressure or even small increments of movement. This pain restricts mobility and function and may lead to further complications, such as pressure sores. (<i>Arch Intern Med.</i>1991;151:1662-1664)",

Many features that are important in terms of driving adversely affected under the influence of alcohol and substance and therefore impaired driving behavior arises in drivers.The most effective way to fight for preventing this impaired driver behav- ior is the restrictions and regulations imposed on drivers in traffic related to alcohol and drug use. Nevertheless, in the literature, some drivers continue to impaired driving function with a risky traffic behavior, in which the driver personality (risk-taking, thrill-seeking, self-control), psychopathologi- cal (substance abuse, personality disorders, mood disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, anger and aggression), and many other neuropsychological features are considered to have a relationship with this situation.

It is excessive, difficult to control, and is often accompanied by many non-specific psychological and physical symptoms. Excessive worry is the central feature of generalized anxiety disorder.Diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) include the following: Excessive anxiety and worry for at least six months Difficulty controlling the worrying.

      "abstract": "Catatonic syndromes could accompany a variety of psychiatric and medical conditions. The most common conditions underlying catatonia are affective disorders followed by schizophrenia, but several medical conditions including intoxications affecting the central nervous system can also present with catatonic signs and symptoms. Therapeutic doses of disulfiram could induce catatonia with or without accompanying psychosis or mood disorder. A case of disulfiram intoxication manifesting with catatonia is reported here together with a brief overview of the literature. A patient was admitted to the toxicology ward after a suicide attempt with approximately 20 g of disulfiram. On transfer to the psychiatric ward, she was sitting still, in a semi-stuporous state and displayed motiveless resistance to instructions or attempts to move (active negativism). She was unresponsive to most of the questions (mutism), occasionally verbigerated 1-2 words and stared for more than 20 seconds between shifting attention. After developing a comatosus state her treatment continued at the toxicology ward, where a contrast-enhanced computer tomography scan revealed bilateral emollition of 1.5 cm diameter in both nucleus lentiformis at the level of the third ventricle. Following treatment her condition improved and she benefited of rehabilitation facility and a second psychiatric treatment. She was discharged free of neurological and psychiatric symptoms. In conclusion, we underscore the importance of accurate diagnosis of the underlying psychiatric or medical condition when encountering a fast emerging catatonic syndrome and focus first on treating the causative condition while simultaneously attempting symptomatic treatment of catatonia.",

      "abstract": "A subject is conscious when he is awake and with an adequate awareness of him and the environment. The term alteration of consciousness requires specification as to whether it defines alteration of arousal - when the patient might be confused, in a stupor or in some degree of coma (light, deep) - or alteration of awareness – that is, confused (spatiotemporally disorientated, with difficulty in maintaining his attention), with or without delirious ideation. The coma, in the strict sense, originates from structural (neurological) or functional (metabolic) dysfunction of the ascending reticular activator system, but it is accepted that it can derive also from diffuse bihemispheric cortical-subcortical damage. In the emergency department the starting point is the triad of situations that requires immediate treatment applying the normal protocol (ABC); next, pathologies involving risk to life, which might cause cerebral hypoxia, are ruled out: diminished cardiac output, shock and respiratory failure. Subsequently, a neurological evaluation is made, bearing in mind two situations of potential gravity: endocraneal hypertension and diseases that might cause respiratory failure due to muscular fatigue. Neurological exploration will specify the respiratory, pupil and ocular patterns and motor responses. The depth of the coma is established through scales; a simplification of Jouvet’s scale is proposed. The etiological diagnosis will on occasion require image tests and lumbar puncture.",

      "abstract": "Peningkatan suara dengan gelombang kompleks yang tidak beraturan dikenal sebagai bising, merupakan salah satu stresor bagi individu. Bila hal tersebut terjadi berulangkali dan terus menerus sehingga melampaui adaptasi individu maka berakibat tetjadi kondisi stres yang merusak atau sering disebut distress. Keadaan bising dapat berakibat kelainan pada sistem pendengaran serta menurunkan kemampuan dalam berkomunikasi, disamping sebagai stresor yang dapat memodulasi respons imun. Telah dilaporkan bahwa pekerja yang berada atau bekerja di tempat yang mempunyai tingkat kebisingan tinggi sering mengalami gangguan kesehatan dan mudah terserang infeksi. Bila hal tersebut tidak segera mendapat perhatian maka kejadian dengan mekanisme yang belum jelas berpeluang besar terjadi, yang pada akhirnya akan mempengaruhi kualitas sumber daya manusia yang selanjutnya berakibat produktivitas kerja menurun. Intensitas suara yang melebihi 85 dB selama 1 jam, diberikan dalam waktu 14 hari berpeluang un tuk mengakibatkan gangguan pendengaran, disamping mempengaruhi kondisi kesehatan individu. Sistem safaf, endokrin, dan sistem imun saling berhubungan dengan memanfaatkan berbagai substansi penghantar sinyal stres dan reseptor sinyal, yang berakibat terjadi pengaturan perilaku sel pada sistem imun. Stres yang ditunjukkan dengan peningkatan kortisol dan katekolamin akan menekan aktivitas sel imunokompeten berakibat penurunan ketahanan tubuh. Pengaruh kortisol pada hambatan sekresi IL-l eleh makrofag dan IT,-2 oleh sel Th yang clapat menurunkan sintesis imunogobulin oleh sel B. Pengaruh perubahan kondisi ketahanan tubuh akibat peningkatan kebisingan menunjukkan bahwa terdapat hubungan stres pada sistem imun yang dicerminkan oleh perubahan ketahanan tubuh dengan tingkat kebisingan. Namun sampai saat ini mekanisme perubahan ketahanan tubuh akibat pengaruh stresor suara tersebut belum terungkap dengan jelas. Psikoneuroimunologi sebagai ilmu yang digunakan untuk menjelaskan tentang respons imun pada kondisi stres mulai dikembangkan. Konsep ini memberi peluang untuk menjelaskan perubahan biologis sebagai bentuk respons stres oleh rangsangan yaitu tingkat kebisingan. Sinyal stres yang dirasakan individu, dirambatkan melalui hypotalamic - pituitary - adrenocortical axis (HPA axis). Stresor menyebabkan peningkatan corticotropin releasing factor ( CRF) hipotalamus, yang memicu aktivitas HPA aksis. Dalam kondisi normal sel imunokompeten dalam keadaan homeostasis. Perubahan kadar kortisol, jumlah limfosit dan IgG akan menentukan hubungan antara stres yang disebabkan oleh kebisingan dengan perubahan respons ketahanan tubuh. Namun sejauh ini mekanisme pengaruh kebisingan terhadap modulasi respons imun tersebut belum terungkap dengan jelas. Jenis penelitian eksperimental, bertujuan untuk menjelaskan mekanisme inmnopatobiogenesis respons imun yang stres, dengam rancangan penelitian faktorial the post test only control group design dan analisis multivariat. Penelitian menggunakan stresor suara dengan lama paparan 1 jam dan 2 jam serta intensitas suara 40-50 dB dan intensitas suara > 85 dB pada hewan coba mencit BALB/c jantan berumur 6-8 minggu (sexualy mature), berat badan kurang lebih 40 gram, dibagi 6 kelompok dengan setiap kelompok terdiri dari 8 sampel secara alokasi random, variable tergantung adalah kortisol, jumlah limfosit, IgG. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa terjadi peningkatan kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan kadar IgG serum (p 85 dB. Demikian pula pada paparan.selama 2 jam dengan intensitas suara 40-50 dB maupun intensitas suara > 85 dB yaitu peningkatan kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan kadar IgG serum (p 85 dB terjadi peningkatan lebih tinggi untuk kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan IgG serum yang lebih rendah, daripada intensitas suara 40-50 dB (p<0,01). Dengan demikian dapat disimpulkan bahwa pada stres akibat stresor suara yang berlangsung cepat ataupun lama disertai dengan intensitas suara yang berbeda dapat menyebabkan modulasi respons imun. </description",

      "abstract": "Environmental threats to mental equity have recently gained much attention in the sphere of public and curative health due to their toll on the individual, families, the public, and their economic sphere. Mental health or soundness of mind is important at every stage of life from childhood and adolescence through adulthood to protect the brain from environmental stress. What makes mental health unlike genetic rare disorders is that there is no known single cause for this rising public health issue because it arises from multiple factors. These factors include early adverse life experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse either because of child abuse, sexual assault or seeing any form of violence, experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical conditions, such as cancer or diabetes, biological factors or chemical exposure resulting in hormonal imbalances in the brain, and to a large extent having feelings of loneliness or isolation leading to suicidal action. Furthermore, the increase in mental health and its accompanying conditions depend on environmental with or without behavioral changes due to genetic stability may be associated with drug, alcohol, or substance abuse which is associated with the brain reward circuit which may need to compromise the neural circuit over a wide range of stressors on the human body interacting with the sequential neuronal cell cascade. Although humoral networking is associated with socio-behavioral change, work through family, religious, organizational engagement, and community support play major roles in its solution and management, it is consensually accepted that defining key determinants underlying molecular network altering by epigenetic and genetic factors have promise in empowering future systematic health and personal care including surveillance, prevention, treatment, and monitoring process. In the modern global and urbanization era, emerging new biomedical technological advances such as epigenetic tools, genomics editing, human genomics study utilizing sequencing technology, and reverse genetic resources from worm to animal models have enabled us to take a closer look at mechanisms that could be involved in mental illness and drug abuse or addiction using a pattern of metabolomics and its connectivity reflecting the interplay between mental illness and drug abuse and/or addiction. This paper describes a molecular-driven surveillance platform as a part of the power of prevention to care of populational health which could be beneficial by predicting risk and unfolding the impact of daily lifestyle on human behavior such as food intake, alcohol intoxication, and its outcome likely the effect of metabolism on mental illness and drug abuse. Interaction between environmental cues to neural circuits which may interplay with metabolic networks as well as potential risk resulting in various forms of phenotypic complications and behavioral alteration might be detectable using multi-omics platforms.",

      "title": "Association between chronic insomnia and depression in elderly adults",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is not just a common symptom of various psychiatric or physical disorders, but is itself categorized as a primary psychiatric disorder. Aside from the manifestations of difficulty initiating sleep, fragmented sleep, early-morning wakenings, and overall poor sleep efficiency, the subjective feeling of inadequate or non-restorative sleep the next morning, as well as psychosocial distress or dysfunction caused, are even more crucial in the diagnosis of insomnia.1,2 The duration of insomnia required for diagnosis as “chronic” has varied from as little as 1 month to as long as 6 months, depending upon the criteria used. The increased incidence of chronic insomnia has been related to concomitant medical and psychiatric disorders, which are frequently present among the elderly. When insomnia becomes chronic, it will invariably increase medical problems significantly, and impact a patient's quality of life, cognitive and psychosocial function adversely,1,2 while further exaggerating the already existing psychiatric or medical conditions. Somatic comorbidities associated with aging are known to be risk factors for insomnia and depression. Therefore, chronic insomnia will further aggravate the heavy burden of medically ill elderly patients and their caregivers.3,4 The prevalence of insomnia among the general adult population is approximately 6% to 30%.2,5 Furthermore, an estimated 50% to 70% of all people aged ≥65 years have reported at least one condition of chronic sleep disturbances.4 A study conducted in one district of metropolitan Taipei, Taiwan has shown that nearly half of the elderly reported suffering from insomnia and poor sleep quality, and 22% of elderly subjects used medication for sleep, numbers that are consistent with results of previous studies in other countries.6 In this study, 7% of the elderly have possible depression. The severity of depression has also been found to be a significant factor related to their insomnia and sleep quality.6 Major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia are closely and multifacetedly related, and they pose a bidirectional relationship.7 The interplay between these psychopathologies is not fully understood; however, their functional relationship has become a focus of recent investigation.8,9 By using self-rating scales, epidemiological surveys have demonstrated the significant association between chronic insomnia and depression in young adults, as well as in elderly populations.3,9 Insomnia is the major complaint among those patients with MDD, and about 40% to 80% of such patients complained of insomnia, or poor sleep quality. In addition to being a symptom of MDD, insomnia has also been suggested as a primary disorder comorbid with MDD.7 Conversely, depression has been found to be over-represented in individuals with chronic insomnia, and the severity of depression is significantly associated with nonrestorative sleep and decreased total sleep duration.8 The severity and duration of depression will be exaggerated if patient depression is combined with chronic insomnia. Several longitudinal studies have shown that insomnia can be a risk factor of, and a precursor to new-onset depression; it can also increase the likelihood of a recurrence or relapse of MDD episodes in the following years.7,10 The close relationship between insomnia and depression is also observed in the elderly. The insomnic elderly, by a factor of three to seven times, were more likely to develop depression during later years, compared to control subjects who did not suffer from insomnia. Sleep disturbance was also associated with more severe and later onset depression, where elderly patients with depression had longer nocturnal awakenings, poor sleep efficiency, and poor neuro-psychological functioning comparing to the control group.11 Therefore, patients with insomnia should be carefully evaluated for the presence of comorbid depression, which can facilitate the early detection and management of insomnia as a way to reduce the risk of MDD.11 When insomnia is comorbid with MDD, the relative improvement seen in both disorders can be enhanced if they are treated with a hypnotic along with an antidepressant. One survey revealed that a greater rate (21%) of patients with chronic insomnia received antidepressants, compared to those patients (8%) who did not suffer from chronic insomnia.3 Besides depression, sleep problems are also more prevalent in elderly dementia patients than in controls.4 In a cohort group of elderly patients suffering from dementia, about one-third suffered from insomnia, and roughly 20% to 25% reported being affected by sleep-related leg cramps, restless leg syndrome, or rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders. More than 60% of hospitalized patients with dementia of the Alzheimer-type were observed suffering different sleep disorders.12 These sleep disorders, which occurred at a higher frequencies than in the general elderly population, suggest that neuro-degeneration probably play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of insomnia in the elderly. Among the elderly, sleep disorders were found to be closely associated with depression and anxiety.4 In a postal community survey of adult insomniacs, there has been a reported increase in healthcare use, with the primary reason given as “difficulty in falling asleep.” Correspondingly, “wakes up tired” is the reason often given by insomniacs if insomnia is combined with anxiety or depression.3 About 9% to 26% of those patients with insomnia used sleep medications, which included subjects in the Taiwan survey.5,6,13,14 At present, pharmacological intervention remains the treatment of choice, and the use of hypnotics is significantly associated with elderly female patients with depression-like symptoms, suffering from poor sleep quality and complaining of difficulty falling asleep.5,15 Elderly status and poor sleep control were the strongest predictors for the use of medication, and for subsequent difficulty in quitting sleep medications.15 Both benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics have been the most frequently used drugs for treating insomnia in the elderly in Taiwan.14 Most of the clinical trials of hypnotics in insomnia are of short duration, and the long-term effects, tolerance, and abuse liability of hypnotics require further study. The potential for abuse liability from these benzodiazepine hypnotics appears to be minimal in the elderly, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics also may have diminished abuse liability potential as well. In Taiwan, older individuals are less likely to receive a higher dosage benzodiazepine therapy, but more likely to receive more prolonged therapy.13 Furthermore, elderly patients with concomitant anxiety or depression consumed more hypnotics.13 Elderly patients are at risk for a variety of sleep disorders that are most often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric illnesses. Chronic insomnia has a complex relationship with depression, such that sleep disturbance, cognitive decline, and late-onset depression may share common neurobiological underpinnings. In elderly patients with chronic insomnia, the early detection and treatment of depression must be promoted. If insomnia coexists with depression, both symptoms or disorders may be highly associated with the constant use of hypnotics. Therefore, a combined use of antidepressants should be considered for achieving a more satisfactory improvement in elderly patients.

      "title": "Antidepressant Withdrawal Syndromes: Phenomenology and Pathophysiology",
      "abstract": "The discontinuation of tricyclic antidepresants (TCAs) produces a broad array of symptoms which can be grouped to form 4 categories or syndroms: (1) general somatic distress with anxiety or agitation, (2) sleep disturbance characterized by excessive, vivid dreaming and initial or middle insomnia, (3) movement disorder, and (4) behavioral activation on a continuum to mania. Syndromes (1H3) may be due to withdrawal-induced cholinergic overdrive at peripheral (e.g. the gastrointestinal system) and central (e.g. the gigantocellular tegmental field and the mesocortical, nigrostriatal and mesolimbic tracts) sites. The cholinergic overdrive hypothesis is supported by reports that anticholinergic agents produce tolerance, all TCAs block the physiological effects of acetylcholine and competitively displace radiolabeled muscarinic receptor antagonists in vitro and antidepressant withdrawal symptoms respond to centrally active antimuscarinics. Withdrawal-triggered abnormalities in the interaction of cholinergic and monoaminergic systems may contribute to the development of TCA-withdrawal associated mania but the pathophysiology of this syndrome remains unknown. The development of these syndromes indicates that TCAs can produce heuristically important modifications in cholinergic systems and that they might be used to model those aspects of the pathophysiology of depression which may have a cholinergic component. Phenomenological, physiological, biochemical and receptor binding variables which are pertinent to the biology of depression and partially regulated by cholinergic mechanisms are prime targets for strategies employing TCAs to supersensitize cholinergic systems. Both clinical and basic aspects of TCA withdrawal phenomena are discussed in detail. This article reviews signs and symptoms produced by the withdrawal of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), the management and pathophysiology of TCA-withdrawal phenomena and the use of TCAs and classical antimuscarinic agents to model cholinergic abnormalities which may be involved in the pathogenesis of depression. The phenomenology of TCA withdrawal syndromes is first illustrated using case examples. Evidence that TCAs produce cholinergic system supersensitivity and their withdrawal cholinergic overdrive is then presented. The \"cholinergic overdrive hypothesis,\" does not explain TCA withdrawal-induced hypomania. It is possible, however, that withdrawal of TCAs mobilizes monoaminergic pathways via the activation of cholinergic neurons. Data consistent with this possibility are briefly presented. Finally, the use of TCAs and related drugs to model the pathophysiology of depression is discussed.",

Treatment was well tolerated and the side effects, consisting mainly of nausea or symptoms related with the nervous system, such as anxiety, depression, confusion or drowsiness, were mild or moderate in most cases and rarely led to the patient's giving up the treatment. The drug has a favourable pharmacokinetic profile, with little potential to interact with other pharmaceuticals. It seems to have a synergic effect with modafinil, boosting its effects in the treatment of excessive sleepiness. Although it is a substance that has been used as a recreational drug, no cases of addiction or drug abuse have been observed in narcoleptic patients treated in a controlled manner.Sodium oxybate can be considered to be a first-choice drug in the treatment of narcolepsy-cataplexy.",

They can, however, markedly diminish withdrawal symptoms and craving, and block opioid effects due to lapses. The most effective withdrawal method is substituting and tapering methadone or buprenorphine. alpha-2 Adrenergic agents can ameliorate untreated symptoms or substitute for agonists if not available. Shortening withdrawal by precipitating it with narcotic antagonists has been studied, but the methods are plagued by safety issues or persisting symptoms. Neither the withdrawal agents nor the methods are associated with better long-term outcome, which appears mostly related to post-detoxification treatment. Excluding those with short-term habits, the best outcome occurs with long-term maintenance on methadone or buprenorphine accompanied by appropriate psychosocial interventions. Those with strong external motivation may do well on the antagonist naltrexone. Currently, optimum duration of maintenance on either is unclear. Better agents are needed to impact the brain changes related to addiction.",

      "title": "Chronic Caffeine Consumption Prevents Memory Disturbance in Different Animal Models of Memory Decline",
      "abstract": "Caffeine, the most widely consumed psychoactive drug, enhances attention/vigilance, stabilizes mood, and might also independently enhance cognitive performance. Notably, caffeine displays clearer and more robust beneficial effects on memory performance when memory is perturbed by stressful or noxious stimuli either in human or animal studies. Thus, caffeine restores memory performance in sleep-deprived or aged human individuals, a finding replicated in rodent animal models. Likewise, in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), caffeine alleviates memory dysfunction, which is in accordance with the tentative inverse correlation between caffeine intake and the incidence of AD in different (but not all) cohorts. Caffeine also affords beneficial effects in animal models of conditions expected to impair memory performance such as Parkinson's disease, chronic stress, type 2 diabetes, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, early life convulsions, or alcohol-induced amnesia. Thus, caffeine should not be viewed as a cognitive enhancer but instead as a cognitive normalizer. Interestingly, these beneficial effects of caffeine on stress-induced memory disturbance are mimicked by antagonists of adenosine A2A receptors. This prominent role of A2A receptors in preventing memory deterioration is probably related to the synaptic localization of this receptor in limbic areas and its ability to control glutamatergic transmission, especially NMDA receptor-dependent plasticity, and to control apoptosis, brain metabolism, and the burden of neuroinflammation. This opens the real and exciting possibility that caffeine consumption might be a prophylactic strategy and A2A receptor antagonists may be a novel therapeutic option to manage memory dysfunction both in AD and in other chronic neurodegenerative disorders where memory deficits occur.",

      "title": "Let's Focus on Frailty",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Frailty may be a clinical condition during which a person's vulnerability to acquiring dependency and/or mortality increases after they are subjected to a stressor.[1] Frailty is most regularly characterized as an aging-related disorder of physiological decline, characterized by marked vulnerability to unfavorable health outcomes, such as comorbidities, polypharmacy, the loss of independence, increasing hospitalizations, and mortality, improving the care for the most vulnerable subset of patients by frailty awareness and associated risks for adverse health outcomes. The physical frailty is \"A medical syndrome with multiple causes and contributors that are characterized by diminished strength, endurance, and reduced physiologic function that increases an individual's vulnerability for developing increased dependency and/or death.\"[2] Frail people usually have three or more than five symptoms such as unintentional weight loss (10 or more pounds within the past year), muscle loss and weakness, fatigue, reduced walking speed, and reduced levels of physical activity. WHAT ARE CONSEQUENCES OF FRAILTY? Frailty is viewed as a geriatric disorder with various causes and contributors portrayed by reduced strength, perseverance and diminished physiologic capacity, and increasing a person's weakness for developing disability.[1] As one of the fundamental causes of functional decrease in the elderly, sarcopenia has a high clinical effect, influencing the status and recuperation of an individual's mobility, independence, and quality of life conveys an increased danger for chronic frailty which results in falls, disability, hospitalization, and mortality.[3] WHAT ARE the RISK FACTORS FOR FRAILTY? The elements related with frailty, especially sociodemographic factors such as age, gender, and educational level, just as actual factors, for example, body weight and activities of daily living.[4] Malnutrition, inactivity, and comorbidities have a high antagonistic effect in older people and are risk factors for sarcopenia and physical frailty. The loss of muscle mass, strength, and function, called sarcopenia, is a key factor in the development of physical frailty. WHAT IS ORAL FRAILTY? Oral frailty is characterized as a progression of phenomena and cycles that lead to changes in different oral conditions (number of teeth, oral cleanliness, oral capacities, and so forth) related with aging, and accompanied by diminished interest in oral health, decreased physical and mental reserve capacity, and an expansion in oral frailty prompting to eating dysfunction; the general impact is of deteriorating physical and mental capacity.[5] HOW TO ASSESS THE ORAL FRAILTY? Oral assessments comprised of 16 measures including five dental status, eight oral functions, and three subjective difficulties. The 16 measures were as follows: dental status – number of natural teeth and functioning teeth, community periodontal index, tongue thickness as a marker of oral nutrient status, and turbidity of mouth-rinsed water as a marker of oral hygiene. Oral functions – maximum occlusal force, chewing ability as a marker of general masticatory performance, maximum tongue pressure, repetitive saliva-swallowing test (RSST), articulatory oral motor skill for \"pa, ta, ka\" and experience of dry mouth measured-oral wettability. Subjective assessments – difficulties in eating and swallowing, and using the questionnaire chewing ability, RSST, xerostomia. Oral frailty – the accumulation of a slightly poor status of oral conditions and function, strongly predicts physical frailty, dysphagia, malnutrition, need for long-term care, and mortality. IS ORAL FRAILTY LINKED TO PHYSICAL FRAILTY? A hypothesis for the connection between poor oral health and frailty is that poor diet intervenes the impact of poor oral health (like loss of teeth, dental agony, or potentially biting issues), prompting to frailty.[6] Poor eating routine and nutritional risk have for some time been involved in the etiology and progression of frailty by affecting useful functional reserves and strength and leading to loss of energy, functional decline, morbidity, and subsequent frailty. Oral frailty was essentially connected with physical frailty by 66.6% and sarcopenia by 72.7%. Poor oral condition in hospitalized patients can be attributed to factors such as age, physical dependency, psychological decline, malnutrition, low skeletal muscle mass and strength, and multimorbidity.[7] WHAT ARE the POLICY IMPLICATIONS? The proof from frailty studies has not yet been completely converted into clinical practice and medical care strategy making. As of now, in any case, there is no viable treatment for frailty and the best intervention is not yet known. In view of presently available proof, the multicomponent exercise, which incorporates resistance training, appears to be promising.[8] The current challenges in frailty research incorporate the absence of a worldwide standard meaning of frailty, further comprehension of interventions to reverse frailty, the best planning for intervention, and education/training of health-care professionals. Population-based evaluation for frailty could be costly and resource intensive, and as of now, there is no obvious proof for expected advantage, cost-adequacy, or improved results. Research and development efforts aimed toward building up and spreading best practice in frailty should not lack strategic consideration regarding older people with early (pre-) frailty that passes up on a chance to address a few requests on health and social care services. Another significant space of delicacy research is schooling and preparing The medical services experts including doctors, attendants, and other medical workers need to comprehend essential standards of care for frail older adults and to have the option to distinguish frailty and give therapy/interventions. There is an increasing interest in frailty in other medical fields than the geriatrics One model is that frailty has recently been pursued as a potential risk assessment measure for older surgical patients and has demonstrated to be promising in anticipating postoperative intricacies, for example, mortality or length of emergency clinic stay. Finally, frailty research may have evolved without considering the patient perspective Frailty can be considered as a profoundly adverse term and being marked as frail may influence contrarily the weakest people differently. The individuals who were marked as \"old and fragile\" by others were bound to be related with a loss of interest in friendly and proactive tasks, poor physical health, and increased disparagement. The future innovative work endeavors need to recognize the risks of naming older individuals in defaming ways and stay away from turning into the new cloak of ageism and an instrument for segregation.[8] Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "title": "Anticonvulsants: aspects of their mechanisms of action",
      "abstract": "An ideal anticonvulsant drag would prevent or inhibit excessive pathological neuronal discharge without interfering with physiological neuronal activity and without producing untoward effects. Such an ideal compound is not yet available. However, during the last few years several new anticonvulsants have appeared (e.g. vigabatrine, gabapentin, topiramate, lamotrigine, tiagabine, felbamate and oxcarbazepine) which may challenge the older, more established substances (i.e. phenytoin, benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, valproate, carbamazepine and ethosuximide). Interestingly, several of the old and new anticonvulsants are beneficial in the treatment of various psychiatric conditions (most notably mood disorders) as well as neuropathic pain. The reason these various drags are effective in the treatment of such disparate clinical conditions is unknown. The answer may be that the neuronal dysfunctions underlying these conditions are similar in a mechanistic sense, but are manifested in different neurons/locations of the nervous system, or that the drags possess several mechanisms of action that contribute in different ways to the favourable effect depending on the condition studied. Even though all these drags inhibit excessive neuronal activity, this acute effect appears to be produced by several mechanisms, which fall into three major categories: (1) blockade of voltage‐gated sodium channels; (2) indirect or direct enhancement of inhibitory γ‐aminobutyric acid [GABAergic] neurotransmission; or (3) inhibition of excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission. Moreover, several of these drags fall into more than one category, and it is often unclear which category is responsible for a given effect of a drag. It is plausible that some of the beneficial effects observed in the clinic can be explained by the secondary neural depressant mechanisms of action of these substances, whereas other benefits may be due to long‐term neuro‐plastic effects, which may either be common or different across the various conditions treated. © 2002 European Federation of Chapters of the International Association for the Study of Pain",

      "title": "A Case Report on Management of Subdural Hematoma",
      "abstract": "After aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, acute subdural hematoma (SDH) is a rare consequence. SDH has never been linked to an unruptured intracavernous aneurysm. The most serious sort of subdural hematoma is this one. Following a head injury, the symptoms are severe and appear quickly, which can take anywhere from minutes to hours. The pressure on the brain quickly rises as blood accumulates. If you are not diagnosed and treated as soon as possible, you will die., you may lose consciousness, become paralysed, or even die. A subdural haematoma is potentially fatal. A serious head injury that causes blood vessels to burst is a common cause. As Blood can pool as a result, putting pressure on the brain. The effects of age and blood thinning medications, and other factors all raise the risk. as well as alcohol consumption Symptoms such as After a brain injury, symptoms such as headache, confusion, vomiting, slurred speech, or coma may emerge immediately or weeks later. Symptoms of a subdural haematoma may or may not occur. Main symptoms and Important clinical findings: Because the lower-pressure veins involved bleed more slowly than arteries, the main symptoms of a subdural hematoma appear later than those of an epidural haemorrhage. Acute hematoma signs and symptoms can occur in minutes, if not seconds, but they can also take up to two weeks to appear. Chronic subdural hematomas normally take four to seven weeks to manifest symptoms. The main diagnose, therapeutic intervention and outcomes: A subdural hematoma (SDH) is a common neurosurgical condition that frequently necessitates surgery. It's a sort of intracranial haemorrhage that happens behind the dura (basically, an accumulation of the presence of blood on the brain's surface) and can be linked to other brain traumas. Conclusion: The complication of ruptured, large intracavernous aneurysms is acute SDH. The postulated mechanism for the development of SDH is cavernous sinus wall erosion caused by acute aneurysm expansion after thrombosis.",

However, drug abuse is accompanied by a decrease in serotonin and the derivative in cerebrospinal fluid, suggesting central serotonergic dysfunction, that is associated with cognitive deficits, alterations in sleep architecture and neuroendocrine function, and increased impulsivity as well as an increase in the risk for aggressive behavior toward the self involving suicide. For central stimulant abusers, elevated plasma catecholamine levels are associated with psychotic episodes and cardiovascular complications involving tachycardia and arrhythmias.

Over-the-counter medications, the first line of defense, have little impact on sleep beyond placebo effects. Ironically, antihistamines in them can increase daytime drowsiness and may enhance the person's belief that sleep is getting worse. When these drugs fail, the chronic sufferer often turns to the physician, who is expected to be ready with medically proved answers. Twenty-seven million prescriptions were written for hypnotics in 1976. Barbiturates, accounting for 20% of these prescriptions, lead to a predictable cycle of dependence, tolerance, and escalating doses. These medications also disrupt the sleep structure. Rapid eye movement (REM) and slow-wave sleep (stages 3 and 4) are suppressed, and the EEG shows increased β activity. Physical and psychological dependence, withdrawal reactions, and \"REM rebound\" reactions (severe nightmares and sleep more disturbed than before taking medication) often accompany attempts to stop using these drugs.",

      "abstract": "Aims: Bipolar Affective Disorder (BAD) is known to present with manic or hypomanic episodes, along with depressive episodes occurring at different times. Considerable within-normal-range mood variations between episodes are expected. In some cases, mania or hypomania can be induced by medications. While well-established medications such as corticosteroids and levodopa are known to induce mania, a careful examination of possible triggers for manic switches is essential to ensure individualized patient care. Methods: This 34-year-old Caucasian female patient presented with depressive disorder. She has a history of multiple depressive episodes. She had been on sertraline for seven months for her most recent depressive episode. However, due to excessive sweating as a reported side effect, her medication was switched to fluoxetine at 20 mg daily, which was subsequently increased to 40 mg after three weeks. On the fifth day after the dose increase, she presented with hypomanic symptoms, changing her diagnosis to Bipolar Affective Disorder (BAD), current episode hypomania. Fluoxetine was identified as the causative agent for this switch. However, at the patient’s request, fluoxetine was continued with antipsychotic and/or mood stabilizer cover, as the patient retained the capacity to make decisions regarding her medical management. The patient was otherwise fit and well, with no recent drug or alcohol involvement. She was prescribed lorazepam 0.5 mg PRN QDS, zopiclone 7.5 mg PRN nightly, and risperidone 1 mg BD in addition to fluoxetine 40 mg daily. Due to drowsiness associated with risperidone, she was commenced on lithium PR titration. Two weeks later, her subsequent symptoms were consistent with mixed affective states. The fluoxetine was discontinued with the patient’s consent. Lurasidone 37 mg was initiated alongside lithium (Priadel XL) 600 mg. Four days after the medication change, the patient reported feeling sedated and experiencing low energy levels. After this review, her lithium dose was increased to 800 mg. Eight days after initiating lurasidone, the patient called the clinic with marked irritability. She reported having high energy levels and feeling very well. The review revealed another hypomanic switch with marked rapid speech and reduced need for sleep. The symptoms of hypomania have resolved following discontinuation of lurasidone. Results: This case report highlights the possible hypomanic switch associated with the use of lurasidone. With several new drugs approved for mental illnesses including BAD, it is crucial to monitor their side-effect profiles to ensure safer and more effective management. Conclusion: There are several potential confounders identified in this case.",

      "abstract": "Long-haul flights allow rapid crossing of times zones. When four time zones are crossed, the transmeridian flight induce jet-lag syndrome. Jet-lag is essentially composed of digestive and behavioural disturbances (insomnia and/or drowsiness). It is due to an immediate conflict between external time cues, which have been phase-advanced or phase-delayed by eastward or westward flight, respectively, and the endogenous clock. This conflict induces a desynchronization of the biological rhythms. Different counter-measures could be advised, but the most used is the pharmacological one. Hypnotics like benzodiazepines, cyclopyrones or imidazopyridines induce a recovery sleep but could also induce secondary effects in case of chronic use. Melatonin secreted by pineal gland needs more studies before a safety use for jet-lag treatment. Psychostimulants are able to induce a prolonged wakefulness. But amphetamine-like substances have to be forbidden because of the importance of side effects. New researches are studying a new galenic form of caffeine: the time release caffeine, which permits to induce a long and good quality wakefulness.",

It is characteristic of these symptoms that they appear 1-4 days after reduction of the dose or the last administration of the drug. They may also appear in the infants of mothers who used an antidepressant during the last phase of the pregnancy. It is important that the patient be informed accurately and carefully at the start and termination of any treatment with an antidepressant. In order to prevent withdrawal symptoms, it is advisable to reduce the dosage slowly if possible when the treatment is to be terminated.",

They can, however, markedly diminish withdrawal symptoms and craving, and block opioid effects due to lapses. The most effective withdrawal method is substituting and tapering methadone or buprenorphine. alpha-2 Adrenergic agents can ameliorate untreated symptoms or substitute for agonists if not available. Shortening withdrawal by precipitating it with narcotic antagonists has been studied, but the methods are plagued by safety issues or persisting symptoms. Neither the withdrawal agents nor the methods are associated with better long-term outcome, which appears mostly related to post-detoxification treatment. Excluding those with short-term habits, the best outcome occurs with long-term maintenance on methadone or buprenorphine accompanied by appropriate psychosocial interventions. Those with strong external motivation may do well on the antagonist naltrexone. Currently, optimum duration of maintenance on either is unclear. Better agents are needed to impact the brain changes related to addiction.",

      "title": "The epidemiology and patterns of acute and chronic toxicity associated with recreational ketamine use",
      "abstract": "Ketamine was originally synthesised for use as a dissociative anaesthetic, and it remains widely used legitimately for this indication. However, there is increasing evidence of non-medical recreational use of ketamine, particularly in individuals who frequent the night-time economy. The population-level and sub-population (clubbers) prevalence of recreational use of ketamine is not known but is likely to be similar, or slightly lower than, that of other recreational drugs such as cocaine, MDMA, and amphetamine. The predominant features of acute toxicity associated with the recreational use of ketamine are neuro-behavioural abnormalities such as agitation, hallucinations, anxiety, and psychosis. Secondary to these, individuals put themselves at greater risk of physical harm/trauma. Cardiovascular features (hypertension and tachycardia) occur less frequently and the risk of death from recreational use is low and is predominately due to the physical harm/trauma. Long-term recreational use of ketamine can be associated with the development of psychological dependence and tolerance. There are reports of gastro-intestinal toxicity, particularly abdominal pain and abnormal liver function tests, and of neuropsychiatric disorders, typically a schizophrenia-like syndrome, in long-term users. Finally, there are increasing reports of urological disorders, particularly haemorrhagic cystitis, associated with long-term use. The management of these problems associated with the long-term use of ketamine is largely supportive and abstinence from ongoing exposure to ketamine. In this review we will collate the available information on the epidemiology of recreational use of ketamine and describe the patterns of acute and chronic toxicity associated with its recreational use and the management of this toxicity.",

      "title": "Prolonged coma after anesthesia",
      "abstract": "Anesthesiologists are pretty much the only doctors who induce controlled and reversible coma medically in their daily practice. The word “coma” derived from a Greek word “Koma” signifies a state of sleep. In medical terms it is defined as a state of unresponsiveness from which the patient cannot be aroused.[1] Therefore any delayed recovery is viewed as anesthetic problem. Delayed recovery from anesthesia or coma after anesthesia is a major anesthetic complication. The causes for delayed recovery from anesthesia are many. They are patient, surgical, anesthetic, and pharmacological factors. The pharmacological factors include the use of various anesthetic and adjuvant drugs, and their interactions with other drugs, known or unknown. This depends upon the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, context sensitive half-lives, amount of drug administered, accidental administration, co-administration with other drugs etc. The patient factors such as the extremes of age, obesity, and various co-morbidities like the cardiovascular, renal, liver or other major organ dysfunction can potentiate the effects of the drug used. Some of the rare causes are myxoedema coma, drug toxicity and Addison's disease. However the delayed recovery due to anesthetic causes, excluding hypoxia, usually lasts for a few hours to days.[1] In the case report published in this issue, the coma lasted for >4 weeks. The authors have eliminated most of the causes of delayed recovery from anesthesia. However the hypoglycemia was detected in the postoperative period when the patient did not recover from anesthesia. The history obtained later revealed that the patient had taken long acting insulin in the preoperative period. The blood sugar level on the morning of surgery was borderline. No blood sugar was estimated during the entire surgical procedure. These factors could have led to profound and prolonged undetected hypoglycemia, which could have led to delayed recovery. Hypoglycemia of prolonged duration (>30 min) leads to neuroglycopenia and brain damage.[2] The symptoms depend on level of blood glucose and also on time taken to detect and correct hypoglycemia. Even after correcting hypoglycemia, prolonged coma is observed in critical care units. It can produce a variety of symptoms and effects, but the principal problem arising from an inadequate supply of glucose to the brain is impairment of function (neuroglycopenia). Effects can range from mild dysphoria to more serious issues such as seizures, unconsciousness, and (rarely) permanent brain damage and death.[3] Plasma glucose levels are maintained between 4 and 8 mmol/L (72–144 mg/dl) throughout the 24 hours. 3.3-3.9 mmol/L (60-70 mg/dl) is cited as lower limit of blood glucose. However hypoglycemic symptoms do not occur till 2.8-3.0 mmol/L (50-54 mg/dl) of plasma glucose. Under anesthesia hypoglycemic symptoms are not detected. In the case presented the blood glucose level 5 h after preoperative value was 2.2 mmol/L (40 mg/dl). To detect hypoglycemia causing brain damage electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion-weighted imaging of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are useful, both in detection and prognostication. EEG shows theta waves and lambda waves with definite slowing, flat and burst suppression patterns. In this case the EEG changes observed point to hypoglycemia as the factor leading to delayed recovery. There have been reports of hyper-intense signal intensities in diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI in hypoglycemia.[4] Recently different patterns of DW MRI findings involving the internal capsules, corona radiata and frontoparietal cortex in a patient who recovered from prolonged hypoglycemic coma without neurological deficit have been observed. Therefore, this particular modality might have been useful in diagnosis and prognostication.[5] Volatile anesthetics have been found to produce neuroprotection in various paradigms. The preconditioning by these agents partially protects perirhinal cortex and striatal dependent functions against moderate to severe neonatal hypoxia-ischemia.[6] Although previous morphological data have suggested that cells die by necrosis, experimental research showed neuronal damage after hypoglycemia has features of apoptosis.[7] After exclusion of organic and pharmacological causes, coma may be attributed to a dissociative stupor. Reported delays in return to consciousness span time periods from 2 to 30 h, and longer periods of amnesia thereafter. There are four reports in the literature; each excluded other pathology with extensive examination, laboratory tests and radiological imaging. One individual experienced this phenomenon on three separate occasions after tracheal stenosis repairs.[89] Conclusion Delayed recovery is usually multifactorial. In the present case report, it looks more like prolonged hypoglycemia leading to delayed recovery. A differential diagnosis of dissociative stupor can be considered when other causes are excluded. The lesson one has to learn as a perioperative physician is to assess the patient thoroughly and investigate according to the need and evidence. An arterial blood gas and blood sugar estimation are needed in prolonged surgeries with multiple co-morbidities particularly in obese individuals.

      "abstract": "The repertoire of behavioral symptoms depends on the degree of severity of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition to cognitive symptoms such as memory loss and language impairment, patients with AD often develop behavioral symptoms. While cognitive symptoms are required for the diagnosis of AD and are relentlessly progressive, behavioral symptoms are not inevitable, usually fluctuate in severity, and may be intermittent or transient. Before initiating treatment, the physician must determine whether physical illness, medications, or environmental or interpersonal factors are contributing to the behavioral symptoms. Elderly patients are more sensitive than younger adults to medication effects and side effects. The combination of aging and AD produces marked deficits of brain neurotransmitter systems, particularly acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Delusions and hallucinations occur most often in patients with AD who have mild to moderately severe dementia. Anxiety is relatively uncommon in patients with AD. Several classes of medications may be used, most of which can produce tolerance with long-term use.",

A 25-day trial is discussed here. 18 endogenous depressives who proved to be refractory to tricyclic antidepressive therapy were treated with periodic sleep deprivation (5 sleep deprivation treatments in the second half of the night at 5-day intervals) under continued drug therapy. The combined treatment led to a better result than would have been expected from drug therapy alone. Some of the sleep deprivation treatments effected an accelerated remission without the efficacy of treatment subsiding. In individual cases recovery occurred after one or a few partial sleep deprivation sessions. Whether in other respects sleep deprivation shortens the course of depressive phases is still unproven.",

      "abstract": "The article deals with the problem of postcovid depression. The main diagnostic criteria and symptoms of depressive disorder are outlined. It is indicated that the basic symptoms include: depressed mood, loss of curiosity and pleasure from daily activities, increased fatigue, loss of energy and decreased activity. The risk factors that most influence the formation of depressive disorders are analyzed. These factors include: job loss, divorce, loss of relatives, high levels of personal anxiety, and stressful life events. The main goal of therapy in patients with VDR is complete functional recovery and return to the premorbid state. The difficulty of treating depressive disorders lies in the lack of complete recovery in the case of severe or complicated forms of depressive disorders. The author identifies the main emotional and cognitive signs of depressive disorder, namely: low or increased mood, feelings of anxiety and unreasonable anxiety, irritability or manifestations of anger towards yourself or other people, repeated negative thoughts about yourself, about drug addicts and the future, reduced concentration of attention, apathy, inattention. Recovery from depression is not the absence of negative affective symptoms, but the restoration of normal emotional functioning, the ability to be yourself and experience positive emotions. The goal of psychotherapy for depression is to change the patient's negative thoughts, emotional state and mood.",

      "abstract": "The network therapy approach can be useful in addressing a broad range of patients with addictions characterized by the following clinical hallmarks of substance use disorder: First, when they initiate consumption of their addictive agent, be it alcohol, cocaine, opioids, or depressant drugs, they frequently cannot limit that consumption to a reasonable and predictable level; this phenomenon has been termed \"loss of control\" by clinicians who treat persons dependent on alcohol or drugs. Second, they consistently demonstrate relapse to the agent of abuse; that is, they attempt to stop using the drug for varying periods of time but return to it despite a specific intent to avoid it. This treatment approach is not necessary for those abusers who can, in fact, learn to set limits on their use of alcohol or drugs; their use may be treated as a behavioral symptom in a more traditional psychotherapeutic fashion. Nor is it directed at those patients for whom the addictive pattern is most unmanageable (e.g., addicted people with unusual destabilizing circumstances such as homelessness, severe character pathology, or psychosis). These patients may need special supportive care (e.g., inpatient detoxification or long-term residential treatment).",

The earlier reports are for the most part in accord with more recent ones, despite being diagnostically less specific in psychiatric and hematologic terms. These symptoms seem to fall into several clinically separate categories: slow cerebration; confusion; memory changes; delirium, with or without hallucinations and/or delusions; depression; acute psychotic states; and (more rarely) reversible manic and schizophreniform states. While there still remain abundant hematologic, psychiatric, neurologic, or nutritional reasons for obtaining a serum vitamin B 12 level, its use in the investigation of the etiology of a patient's dementia seems unjustified. However, acute or subacute changes in a demented patient's mental status, specifically a clouding of their consciousness, may make such testing advisable as part of the complete workup of their delirium regardless of a normal hematologic picture.",

This is an etiologically heterogeneous\r\nentity, which might be due to dysfunctions at various levels in the basal ganglia, and especially\r\nin the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum. The parkinsonism can be classified into four broad\r\ncategories: (i) Parkinson's disease (PD, MIM#168600), also called primary parkinsonism, or typical\r\nparkinsonism, which includes the common, idiopathic form, and the rare forms with a recently\r\ndefined genetic etiology; (ii) parkinsonism-plus syndromes, which include different idiopathic,\r\nbut atypical neurodegenerative forms of parkinsonism (additional motor neurologic features are\r\npresent); (iii) secondary parkinsonism, which is caused by known, non-genetic etiologies, such as\r\nenvironmental insults (drugs, toxins, viruses), inflammation, tissue infiltration/compression or\r\nischemia; (iv) parkinsonism in the context of other degenerative disorders, with or without a known\r\ngenetic cause, in which parkinsonism represents a minor, or occasional component of the clinical\r\npicture (table 1 ).\r\nIn the primary forms of parkinsonism (PD) the initial symptoms occur typically in one side of\r\nthe body, spreading in a few years to the contralateral side. However, a certain degree of clinical\r\nasymmetry persists during the more advanced phases of the disease (the body side where\r\nthe symptoms started remains the more severely affected). Moreover, these motor symptoms\r\ndisplay typically a substantial beneficial response to the therapy with levodopa. While the motor\r\nsymptoms dominate the clinical picture, many PD patients have also other, non-motor problems,\r\nsuch as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, constipation, bladder and other autonomic\r\ndisturbances, and sensory complaints (2).\r\nThe diagnosis of primary parkinsonism (PD) remains based on the presence of the clinical\r\nsyndrome, and the exclusion of other (secondary) causes.",

      "title": "Post-Stroke Apathy: An Exploratory Longitudinal Study",
      "abstract": "&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Introduction:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Post-stroke apathy is a disturbance of motivation evidenced by low initiative, difficulties in starting, sustaining or finishing any goal-directed activity, low self-activation or self-initiated behavior and emotional indifference. Apathy is a common behavioral disturbance in stroke survivors. We aimed to analyze the relationship between post-stroke apathy at 1 year after stroke and (1) apathy in acute phase; (2) demographic, pre-stroke predisposing conditions (previous mild cognitive impairment, alcohol abuse, mood/anxiety disorder) and clinical features (stroke type and location, neurological symptoms); (3) post-stroke depression and post-stroke cognitive impairment, and (4) post-stroke functional outcome, quality of life and the perception of health. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Consecutive stroke (infarct/intracerebral hemorrhage) patients without aphasia or consciousness disturbances were included in the acute phase of stroke and assessed at 1 year after stroke. We assessed apathy with the clinically rated version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale. We also assessed post-stroke depression (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and post-stroke cognitive impairment (attention, mental flexibility, verbal, motor and graphomotor initiative, and non-verbal and verbal abstract reasoning, and Mini-Mental State Examination), functional outcome (Barthel Index), quality of life and perception of health (EuroQol). Data were analyzed using bivariate associations (&amp;#x03C7;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and t test) and stepwise multivariate analysis. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We included 76 stroke patients [32.9% women, mean age 62.9 years (SD = 10.9) and a mean of 6.9 (SD = 4.3) years of education]. Apathy was present in 17 patients in the acute phase and in 18 (23.7%) patients at 1 year after stroke. At 1 year after stroke, 41% of the acute apathetic patients remained apathetic. Sixty-one percent of new cases of post-stroke apathy were detected. Post-stroke apathy was associated only with previous cognitive impairment, apathy in acute stroke, post-stroke cognitive impairment, verbal abstract reasoning and with worse Barthel Index scale scores. In the multivariate logistic regression model, verbal abstract reasoning (odds ratio, OR = 7.03) and apathy in acute stroke (OR = 3.8) were identified as independent factors for post-stroke apathy at 1 year. Apathetic patients did not report worse quality of life or health. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Apathy in acute stroke phase was a reliable indicator of post-stroke apathy. Apathy should be assessed in both phases. Verbal abstract reasoning impairment was also an independent factor for post-stroke apathy impairing patients' ability to reason about goal-directed activity. Even though apathetic patients had worse post-stroke functional outcome, they did not report losing quality of life or having worse health.",

It was Rick Strassmann (born 1952), a medical doctor, psychiatrist and clinical psycho-pharmacologist, who had virtue of giving a second birth to academic interest in scientific research of psychedelics after post-70's age of obscurantism lead by American prohibitionist position on this field. Strassman is also person who named this compound the spirit molecule, in order to suggest deeply psycho-spiritual implications concerning this substance. Here, we overview scientific basis and evidences supporting association between DMT and pineal gland.",

Possibly some of the mechanisms by which these drugs elicit altered mental states might lead to a better understanding of schizophrenia. GABA‐enhancing drugs, such as muscimol and CI‐966, produce mental states that differ in various ways from those of other hallucinogens. The mechanism of action also differs from the others, which may be mediated by receptors for serotonin (LSD), acetylcholine (scopolamine), or NMDA (phencyclidine). Whether the GABA A receptor will provide clues to schizophrenia remains to be elucidated.",

The excessive thoughts, feeling or behaviors related to the somatic symptoms or associated health concerns are demonstrated through one of three possible avenues.

The occurrence of a medical illness does not eliminate the possibility of Illness Anxiety Disorder. The diagnosis can still be applied if the health-related anxiety and the concerns about the illness are significantly out of proportion. Somatic Symptom Disorder is differentiated from Illness Anxiety Disorder by virtue of the presence of a substantial somatic symptom(s). Pain disorder associated with a general medical condition was not considered to be a mental disorder, because the requirement was not met that psychological factors play an important role.",

Despite returning to baseline after several days to weeks, patients can suddenly decompensate, exhibiting what is called postictal psychosis despite being abstinent from the substance. This condition can lead to chronic psychosis if not properly treated. In this case, a male in his twenties, presented with 1 month of auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, and paranoid delusions. After his last cocaine use 1 month ago, the patient developed seizure-like activity and shortly after returned to baseline. Approximately 1 week later, the patient started to experience psychosis. Due to persistent symptoms, the patient was admitted and started on Risperidone 2mg twice a day but did not respond. Clonazepam 1mg twice a day was added, which helped patient to return to baseline. Cocaine induced postictal psychosis is underreported, and it can be difficult to recognize. Similarly, there are few guidelines as to how to treat this condition. Clinicians need to rapidly address if they suspect that the patient is experiencing possible postictal psychosis given that this can lead to chronic psychosis.",

These three factors are closely interrelated in a complex system of reciprocal influences and mutual dependence. Thus, the performance of monotonous, routine operations results not only in emotional indifference but also in a reduction in the level of alertness, in drowsiness, apathy, loss of attention, slowed reactions, missing of important signals, and rapidly increasing fatigue. Excessive emotional tension, which can arise in any type of unforeseen, out-of-the-ordinary situation or in performing familiar operations when time is at a premium, is characterized by disorganization of activity, overhasty reactions, an increase in the number of errors (mainly false alarms), and, of course, increasing fatigue because of an excess consumption of energy.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are physical, behavioral and experiental phenomena ocurring during entry or along the sleep or on arousal/awakening. The behavior includes movements, emotional, perceptual or dreaming experience, frequently containing manifestations of autonomic nervous system. Parasomnias are devided into primary (ocurring etiher in NREM or REM sleep) and secondary (following organic system disease manifested during sleep). Primary parasomnias are further devided into those that appear during NREM, REM or states of consciousnes that do not respect boundaries between wake and sleep. Parasomnias represent an example of \"dissocitaion of sleep stages\" with the overlaping of wakefulness and NREM sleep (confusional arousals, somnambulism and night terrors) or wake and REM sleep (REM sleep behavior disorder parasomnia). NREM parasomnias are a significant clinical problem that appears with functional reorganization of the brain as it transits throuh different states of consciousness. Aside from the above dissociation there are other physiological phenomena that render behavior more complex during sleep such as 1) activation of locomotor centers during sleep, 2) sleep intertia (confusion and desorientation during transition from sleep to wakefulness) and 3) instability of sleep stages (rapid oscilation(s) between seleep and wake).",

They can, however, markedly diminish withdrawal symptoms and craving, and block opioid effects due to lapses.The most effective withdrawal method is substituting and tapering methadone or buprenorphine, α-2 Adrenergic agents can ameliorate untreated symptoms or substitute for agonists if not available. Shortening withdrawal by precipitating it with narcotic antagonists has been studied, but the methods are plagued by safety issues or persisting symptoms. Neither the withdrawal agents nor the methods are associated with better long-term outcome, which appears mostly related to post-detoxification treatment.Excluding those with short-term habits, the best outcome occurs with long-term maintenance on methadone or buprenorphine accompanied by appropriate psychosocial interventions. Those with strong external motivation may do well on the antagonist naltrexone. Currently, optimum duration of maintenance on either is unclear. Better agents are needed to impact the brain changes related to addiction.",

These conditions may have some similar manifestations, making differential diagnosis difficult. Depressed alcoholics report more previous treatment for substance abuse, withdrawal symptoms, and marital problems than those without depression. They also incur greater loneliness, unemployment, and social ineptness. Depressive symptoms found commonly in this group include work inhibition, guilt, self-disgust, dissatisfaction, and social disinterest. A history of depression among relatives favors a dual diagnosis of alcoholism and depression. Distinguishing those alcoholics with specific depressive illness enhances the therapeutic efficacy. Alcohol abusers need treatment, but those with concomitant depression persisting well beyond detoxification often require antidepressant medications. In long-term care, lithium may reduce alcohol-related rehospitalizations. A strong doctor-patient relationship with or without pharmacotherapy promotes continuation in a therapeutic regimen. Involvement in Alcoholics Anonymous and disulfiram maintenance therapy are other deterrents to drinking relapse.",

The intensity of the symptoms and signs was high initially, fell during the first 2 weeks, then rose again in the third week, before finally declining. Three groups of symptoms and signs were identified. Group A symptoms occurred throughout withdrawal and included tremor, anorexia, insomnia and myoclonus. Group B symptoms and signs were largely confined to the first 10 days and were those of a toxic psychosis. Group C symptoms reached a peak in the third and fourth weeks of withdrawal and were characterized by sense perceptions that were either heightened or lowered. The symptom groups, the presence of tremor and myoclonus, and the relief of symptoms by a test dose permit diazepam withdrawal to be distinguished from anxiety. The biphasic course of the symptoms is probably related to the pharmacokinetics of diazepam.",

      "title": "Irritability as a Criterion in Diagnosis of Child and Adolescent Bipolar Disorder: Thorny Road Ahead",
      "abstract": "Byline: M. Reddy Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5 [sup]th edition (DSM 5) [sup][1] of bipolar disorder (BD) makes it necessary to meet the following criteria for a manic episode: distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, OR IRRITABLE MOOD… lasting at least one week and present most of the day, nearly everyday…. It is elation or irritation, along with three or four other symptoms. DSM 5 criteria for BD are applicable to all age groups with the same weightage. Irritable occupies a prominent place in the diagnostic criteria of many other disorders, especially childhood and adolescent disorders like oppositional defiant disorder; intermittent explosive disorder; conduct disorder; disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD); other and unspecified disruptive, impulse control, and conduct disorders; and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the classificatory systems. With irritable sharing space in the diagnostic criteria of BD and several childhood and adolescent diagnostic disorders, there looms a possibility of over diagnosis of childhood adolescent bipolar disorder. misdiagnosis, whenever it occurs, hopefully less often, leads to a major therapeutic mismatch resulting in polypharmacy and treatment failures. National Institute of Mental Health research roundtable on prepubertal bipolar disorder, 2001 recommends that patients with grandiosity/elation be classified as bipolar I and irritability/rage be classified as bipolar NOS (DSM IV TR). There was always a doubt about reliability of irritability as a symptom criterion in the of mania as shown in this USA-UK study: USA-UK project (2005) Elation/grandiose - mania - 96.4% USA and 88.9% UK Irritability/rage - mania - 86.2% USA and 31.1% UK There is rather unacceptable poor concordance, with irritability as the criterion. A few valid arguments that merit attention are the following: *That delusions/hallucinations occur only in BD (true, but a significant majority of patients with BD do not have delusions/hallucinations). *Family H/O of BD favors of bipolar illness (yes, very valuable supporting point in those who have a family history). *BD is an episodic disorder, whereas other childhood disorders outlined above are all continuous in course. Is it true? Let us look at the existing data. Evidence Age of onset The greatest frequency of first attacks falls, however, in the period of development with its increased emotional excitability between the fifteenth and twentieth In rare cases, the first beginnings can be traced back even to before the tenth year…. - Kraepelin, 1921 In 28% of the BD patients recruited into the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) study, age at onset was younger than 13, and in the Bipolar Collaborative Network study, 15% of patients had illness onset before the age of 13 years. younger age of onset in BD seems to be a well-documented fact. Diagnosis Some studies have defined mania by the presence of highly labile moods with intense irritability, rage, explosiveness and destructiveness; extreme agitation, and behavioral dysregulation. [sup][2],[3],[4],[5] picture that emerges from several independent research groups is that prepubertal children with BD typically have multiple daily mood swings and that irritability is much more common than euphoria. [sup][6],[7] Course Studies indicate a highly pernicious course with substantial chronicity. In 81% of a well-defined group of patients, Geller et al . [sup][6] reported continuous daily cycling from mania or hypomania to euthymia or depression. In this study, 1-year mania recovery rate stood at 37%. …",

      "title": "Psychological aspects of depression in cancer patients: an update",
      "abstract": "Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention.Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J. Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2004; 32: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar]. Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others.Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others.Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable.Ideally, all cancer patients be screened for depression in the clinic upon their first visit and on a regular basis thereafter by their oncologist, especially when changes occur in their disease status (remission, recurrence, progression of disease etc.). The distress thermometer is a valid and reliable screening tool. Patients are asked about the nature and source of their distress (whether it be physical, social, psychological or spiritual). In addition to detecting distress, the thermometer facilitates referral to the appropriate professional working in the oncology team (mental health, social work, pastoral counselor, etc.) [2.Holland J. Bultz B. The NCCN guideline for distress management: a case for making distress the sixth vital sign.J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2007; 5: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar].Diagnosis of depression in physically healthy individuals relies heavily on the presence of somatic symptoms (anorexia, insomnia and weight loss). However, these are of little value in cancer patients since they are common to both cancer and depression. Four different approaches have been described in the assessment of depression in the medically ill [3.Cohen-Cole Sa Brown F.N. McDaniel J.S. Stoudmire A. Fogel B. Diagnostic assessment of depression in the medically ill.Psychiatric Care of the Medical Patient. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 53-70Google Scholar, 4.Endicott J. Measurement of depression in patients with cancer.Cancer. 1984; 53: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar]:•Inclusive approach: counts all symptoms of depression, whether or not they may be secondary to the physical illness. This approach offers high sensitivity but low specificity and does not focus on etiology.•Etiologic approach: This approach counts a depressive symptom only if it is presumed not secondary to physical illness.•Exclusive approach: Eliminates symptoms such as anorexia and fatigue, which can be secondary to cancer, and employs other depression criteria. This approach increases specificity and lowers sensitivity which may result in lower prevalence and underdiagnosis.•Substitutive approach: Replaces indeterminate symptoms such as fatigue (frequently secondary to physical illness) with cognitive symptoms such as indecisiveness, brooding and hopelessness.Criteria for the diagnosis of a major depressive disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [5.american Psychiatric association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.4th edition, text revision. american Psychiatric association, arlington, Va2000Google Scholar] include:Five or more of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning, with at least one of the symptoms being either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure:1.Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report or observations by others2.Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities, most of the day, nearly every day3.Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day4.Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day5.Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day6.Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day7.Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day8.Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day, and9.Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.In addition, the symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode; they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning; they are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance; they are not better accounted for by bereavement; they persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms or psychomotor retardation.The diagnosis of depression in the oncology setting should depend on psychological not somatic symptoms, in cancer patients [6.Massie M.J.

When physiologic effects of cancer directly cause depressive syndromes, a diagnosis of mood disorder due to a general medical condition should be made.Demoralization syndrome, described by Kissane et al. [7.Kissane D.W. Clarke D.M. Street Af Demoralization syndrome: a relevant psychiatric diagnosis for palliative care.J Palliat Care. 2001; 17: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar], should be distinguished from depression and includes affective symptoms of existential distress (hopelessness or loss of meaning in life); pessimism, helplessness, a sense of being trapped, personal failure or lacking a worthwhile future; absence of motivation to cope differently, and associated features of social alienation or isolation and lack of support. Demoralization syndrome is said to occur in at least 20% of patients who do not meet DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder [8.Grassi L. Holland J. Johansen C. Psychiatric concomitants of cancer screening procedures, and training of health care professionals in oncology: the paradigms of psycho-oncology in the psychiatry field.adv Psychiatr. 2005; 2: 59-66Google Scholar].Boredom in people with cancer has received little attention despite clinical observation, suggesting that it has the potential to affect patient's quality of life significantly. Passik et al. [9.Passik S. Inman A. Kirsch K. Initial validation of a scale to measure purposelessness, understimulation and boredom in cancer patients.Palliat Support Care. 2003; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar] developed a Purposelessness, Understimulation and Boredom Scale to identify boredom and found this construct to be different from depression in the oncology setting.Multiple psychological measurement instruments have been described as useful in the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients. However, a single-item question: 'Have you been depressed, most of the day, nearly every day, for the past two weeks or more?' seems to be able to identify all cancer patients diagnosed as depressed using Research Diagnostic Criteria [10.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. are you depressed?' Screening for depression in the terminally ill.aM J Psychiatry. 1997; 154: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar].Suicide is associated with emotional suffering and, at times, with physical disease. Suicide has been reported to be 1.5–2 times higher in cancer patients than in the general population [11.Hem E. Loge J.H. Haldorsen T. et al.Suicide risk in cancer patients from 1960 to 1999.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. among terminally ill patients with cancer, the request for euthanasia is about four times higher in patients with depression than in those without depression [12.Van der Lee M.L. van der Bom J.G. et al.Euthanasia and depression: a prospective cohort study among terminally ill cancer patients.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar]. In addition, desire for death in terminally ill cancer patients is frequent. It has been shown to be associated with depression and is transitory [13.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. et al.Desire for death in the terminally ill.am J Psychiatry. 1995; 152: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar]. Suicide risk protocols should include an evaluation of thoughts about death, dying and suicide, as well as an evaluation of the presence of a plan to commit suicide, the patient's intention to carry out such plan and its viability.an association between depression and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) has been described. Cancer itself and its treatment (medications and surgery) in general can be responsible, together with the individual stress response, for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar].Depression and depressive symptoms should always be treated in the cancer setting. Because sadness and depressive symptoms are considered to be 'normal' reactions to the disease and its treatment, quite frequently they remain undertreated. They tend to be a manifestation or consequence of emotional suffering. Not treating them will trivialize the patient's suffering associated with the disease and death.adequate treatment of depression in the oncology setting should combine the control or elimination of potential organic causes of depression when possible; pharmacotherapy; psychotherapy and psychological intervention with the patients' families and staff members. Efficient communication skills between doctor and patient are needed as well.The choice of the best psychotropic drug for the pharmacological treatment of depression in cancer will depend on various factors [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar]:•Which is the safest drug or which has the fewest side-effects for the cancer patient•What the characteristics of the depressive episode are, and•Which is the best way of administration for a particular patient (pills versus liquid versus parenteral).General guidelines for the use of antidepressants in the cancer setting have been described [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar] and include:•Starting the dose according to patients' condition (usually half dose for a few days, then titrate)•Waiting for the effects of the drugs (latency: usually 4 weeks)•Providing continued treatment for 6–9 months (more if depression or depressive episode are recurrent)•Discontinuing antidepressant treatment gradually by tapering the dose and providing adequate follow-up•Monitoring symptoms on a continued basis to watch for potential drug interactions that may occur between antidepressants and certain chemotherapeutic agentsPsychotherapy may be an excellent alternative for those who refuse taking antidepressants. In addition, it has no side effects! as with antidepressants, it is necessary to adjust the psychotherapeutic modality to patient's needs and disease stage. Psycho-educational interventions such as clarifying information, among others, are effective usually throughout the disease continuum, although may be more needed at diagnosis, when passing from one stage of the illness to another, for example, initiation and end of treatment; upon starting palliative care, etc. Couple and Family Therapies may be appropriate when conflicting relationships within the couple or the family contribute substantially or are the main cause of the patients' depressive symptoms. Cognitive techniques may be useful in correcting misconceptions and exacerbated fears. Interventions directed to enhance the spiritual aspects in advanced disease and dying are of utmost importance at this stage of the illness, when patients are confronted with life-death issues that generally imply deep existential questioning [15.Breitbart W. Spirituality and meaning in supportive care: spirituality and meaning-centered group psychotherapy interventions in advanced cancer.Support Care Cancer. 2002; 10: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar]. Helping patients discover the meaning they assign to their symptoms, to their disease, to life and death, to suffering, etc., and helping them accept suffering as an integral part of life, is of utmost importance. Finding meaning in the context of advanced or serious illness is quite a challenge that not everyone is capable of achieving. In addition, interventions designed to maintain patients' dignity have been described as well and are very helpful in improving patients' mood [16.Chochinov H.M. Hack T. Hassard T. et al.Dignity therapy: a novel psychotherapeutic intervention for patients near the end of life.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 5520-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar]. Multidimensional structured and semi-structured group psychotherapies have proven to be effective in reducing patients' depressive symptomatology and improving their quality of life [17.Spiegel D.

Staff should be trained to provide basic emotional support effectively as well as to communicate efficiently with the patient and his/her family. Some simple interventions staff may easily implement are related to increasing the patient's perception of control. Cancer influences the patient in such a way that it substantially reduces the perception of control that the patient has over his own life. In order to help patients regain their sense of control staff members may:•provide options to patient. For example, giving him the possibility of choosing whether he wants to have his medication with water, milk or juice helps the patient believe he still has the power to decide over what is happening to him, especially at times when the patient is hospitalized and his hospital days revolve around medication intake, doctor and nurses' visits, medical tests, etc.•anticipate patients' needs. This will help him feel more in control of what may happen to him and will reduce fear and distress upon the development of new symptoms or changes in the patient's body, functions, etc.•facilitate adaptive coping mechanisms, for example, by identifying with the patient effective ways in which he/she has confronted and resolved difficulties encountered in the past•respect defense mechanisms as long as they do not interfere with treatment administration•normalize patient's feelings•help maintain realistic hope: Even in the context of palliative care can hope be maintained. For example, a non-depressed dying patient may hope to die without suffering, or after having solved certain issues, or he may hope that his family will not suffer in excess after his death.•remain available to listen to patient's worries and fears•explain to patient and family that depressive symptoms can be treated•provide continuity in patient care•monitor patient's sense of wellbeing and needs in a continued manner along the disease continuum, since they change over time•work with the family: provide basic caretaking guidelines and support for family members. Facilitate their understanding of what depression is and why the patient may be depressed. It may be difficult for family members to comprehend, for example, why the patient develops depressive symptomatology upon finishing his treatment.•explore one's own attitudes towards illness, suffering, death and dying•inform adequately: staff members should have efficient training in communication skills as to be able to handle difficult interactions with patients at complex moments of the disease process. adequate doctor–patient communication will:•reduce patient's fears and anxiety,•help patient understand and elaborate relevant medical information,•increase patient's perception of control,•allow the patient to discuss relevant worries that may interfere with treatment administration, with the oncologist,•enhance treatment adherence,•facilitate patient's global psychological adjustment.A six-step protocol to deliver bad news and improve doctor–patient communication (SPIKES) has been described [20.Baile W.F. Buckman R. Lenzi R. et al.SIKES—a six-step protocol for delivering bad news: application to the patient with cancer.Oncologist. 2000; 5: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar] and includes the following:•S Setting: prepare an adequate environment. This may be achieved by providing privacy, involving significant others, establishing rapport with patient, etc.•P Perception: ask yourself 'How does the patient perceive his medical situation?'. and, 'Before you tell, ask' (for example, 'What do you suspect your symptoms are due to?').•I Invitation: obtain patient's invitation to deliver medical information. 'How would you like me to give you your test results?' could be a good way to start.•K Knowledge: deliver the medical information: 'I am sorry to tell you that your test results have revealed …'.•E Empathizing and Exploring: assess the patients emotions using empathetic responses, for example 'I understand this must be very difficult for you at this time of your life'.•S Strategy and Summary: Describe strategy/follow-up and summarize the interview making sure that the patient has understood the information provided.This educational workshop will focus on the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders in cancer patients. Diagnostic criteria for depression and for suicide risk as well as psychotherapeutic guidelines to treat depression effectively will be provided. Theoretical aspects of the different topics covered will be illustrated with case vignettes and brief video sketches.In summary, depression is frequent in the cancer setting and should receive adequate attention from professionals. as with other illnesses, its correct although sometimes difficult diagnosis in oncology will allow the design of interventions tailored to address patient needs, intensity of symptoms and others. Treatment of depression should not be targeted to the patient only but should include family and oncology staff members as well.disclosureThe author has declared no conflicts of interest. Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention. Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J. Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2004; 32: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar]. Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others. Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others. Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable. Ideally, all cancer patients be screened for depression in the clinic upon their first visit and on a regular basis thereafter by their oncologist, especially when changes occur in their disease status (remission, recurrence, progression of disease etc.). The distress thermometer is a valid and reliable screening tool. Patients are asked about the nature and source of their distress (whether it be physical, social, psychological or spiritual). In addition to detecting distress, the thermometer facilitates referral to the appropriate professional working in the oncology team (mental health, social work, pastoral counselor, etc.) [2.Holland J. Bultz B. The NCCN guideline for distress management: a case for making distress the sixth vital sign.J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2007; 5: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar]. Diagnosis of depression in physically healthy individuals relies heavily on the presence of somatic symptoms (anorexia, insomnia and weight loss). However, these are of little value in cancer patients since they are common to both cancer and depression. Four different approaches have been described in the assessment of depression in the medically ill [3.Cohen-Cole Sa Brown F.N. McDaniel J.S. Stoudmire A. Fogel B.

The diagnosis of depression in the oncology setting should depend on psychological not somatic symptoms, in cancer patients [6.Massie M.J. Holland J. Holland J. Rowland J.

Multiple psychological measurement instruments have been described as useful in the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients. However, a single-item question: 'Have you been depressed, most of the day, nearly every day, for the past two weeks or more?' seems to be able to identify all cancer patients diagnosed as depressed using Research Diagnostic Criteria [10.Chochinov H.M.

Suicide is associated with emotional suffering and, at times, with physical disease. Suicide has been reported to be 1.5–2 times higher in cancer patients than in the general population [11.Hem E. Loge J.H. Haldorsen T. et al.Suicide risk in cancer patients from 1960 to 1999.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. among terminally ill patients with cancer, the request for euthanasia is about four times higher in patients with depression than in those without depression [12.Van der Lee M.L. van der Bom J.G. et al.Euthanasia and depression: a prospective cohort study among terminally ill cancer patients.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar].

It may be difficult for family members to comprehend, for example, why the patient develops depressive symptomatology upon finishing his treatment.•explore one's own attitudes towards illness, suffering, death and dying•inform adequately: staff members should have efficient training in communication skills as to be able to handle difficult interactions with patients at complex moments of the disease process. adequate doctor–patient communication will:•reduce patient's fears and anxiety,•help patient understand and elaborate relevant medical information,•increase patient's perception of control,•allow the patient to discuss relevant worries that may interfere with treatment administration, with the oncologist,•enhance treatment adherence,•facilitate patient's global psychological adjustment. A six-step protocol to deliver bad news and improve doctor–patient communication (SPIKES) has been described [20.Baile W.F. Buckman R. Lenzi R. et al.SIKES—a six-step protocol for delivering bad news: application to the patient with cancer.Oncologist. 2000; 5: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar] and includes the following:•S Setting: prepare an adequate environment. This may be achieved by providing privacy, involving significant others, establishing rapport with patient, etc.•P Perception: ask yourself 'How does the patient perceive his medical situation?'. and, 'Before you tell, ask' (for example, 'What do you suspect your symptoms are due to?').•I Invitation: obtain patient's invitation to deliver medical information. 'How would you like me to give you your test results?' could be a good way to start.•K Knowledge: deliver the medical information: 'I am sorry to tell you that your test results have revealed …'.•E Empathizing and Exploring: assess the patients emotions using empathetic responses, for example 'I understand this must be very difficult for you at this time of your life'.•S Strategy and Summary: Describe strategy/follow-up and summarize the interview making sure that the patient has understood the information provided. This educational workshop will focus on the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders in cancer patients. Diagnostic criteria for depression and for suicide risk as well as psychotherapeutic guidelines to treat depression effectively will be provided. Theoretical aspects of the different topics covered will be illustrated with case vignettes and brief video sketches. In summary, depression is frequent in the cancer setting and should receive adequate attention from professionals. as with other illnesses, its correct although sometimes difficult diagnosis in oncology will allow the design of interventions tailored to address patient needs, intensity of symptoms and others. Treatment of depression should not be targeted to the patient only but should include family and oncology staff members as well. disclosureThe author has declared no conflicts of interest.

      "title": "Dopamine",
      "abstract": "Abstract Dopamine is a neurotransmitter (or chemical messenger) found in diverse organisms ranging from invertebrates to humans. It is also a required intermediate in the formation of the neurotransmitters noradrenaline and adrenaline. Although found in a number of vertebrate tissues, dopamine's most important effects are due to robust expression in a relatively small number of central nervous system neurones that have widespread projections. Dopamine signalling affects a correspondingly wide variety of physiological functions, from gastrointestinal motility and pituitary hormone release, to voluntary movements, motivation and reward, and higher cognitive processes. Although dopamine neurotransmission is normally a highly regulated process, drugs have been developed to modify its signalling. Some commonly used drugs affect dopamine neurotransmission indirectly (by changing its synthesis, storage, release, reuptake or inactivation), whereas other drugs more directly mimic or block the actions of dopamine at its biological targets (i.e. multiple cell surface dopamine‐responsive receptors). An astonishingly broad range of central nervous system disorders (including Parkinson disease, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and sleep disorders), and other medical conditions (such as nausea, excessive pituitary hormones, gastrointestinal disorders and cardiovascular shock) are currently treated using such drugs. Key Concepts Dopamine is a neurotransmitter in the brain and elsewhere, as well as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitters noradrenaline and adrenaline. Dopamine synthesis is regulated by a rate‐limiting enzyme, and its extracellular concentrations controlled by an active recapture mechanism and several metabolic enzymes. The effects of dopamine are mediated by a family of G protein‐coupled receptors linked to distinct intracellular signalling pathways. Though relatively few in number, dopamine‐containing neurons originating in the mammalian midbrain send branching fibres that innervate widespread areas of the forebrain. Brain dopamine influences learning and execution of voluntary movements, motivation, reward, attention and working memory. Disturbances in dopamine neurotransmission have been implicated in a number of CNS disorders but shown most conclusively in Parkinson disease and drug abuse. Drugs that modify CNS dopamine neurotransmission are used to treat a variety of disorders including Parkinson disease, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, sleep disorders and nausea. Dopamine receptors outside of the CNS are targets in the medical treatment of excessive pituitary hormone release, certain gastrointestinal disorders and cardiovascular shock. The extensive study of this simple neurotransmitter system has led to fundamental discoveries regarding cellular and molecular mechanisms contributing to normal brain function and human disease.",

      "abstract": "Head injury is a common event occurring in 1–2 million people in the U.S. yearly. Head injuries may cause minor inconvenience or it may induce major cognitive changes such as memory loss, concentration difficulties, headache, hearing loss, and visual difficulties, associated with or without loss of consciousness. Two of the major events occurring after head injuries which are not commonly recognized but which significantly alter behavior are loss of smell acuity and subsequent onset of smell distortions or phantosmia. Most patients are unaware that these two events can occur but they are present in most patients who experience head injury of any severity. Initially, patients recognize that they cannot recognize any odors and subsequently recognize that they cannot obtain any flavor from any food or drink. Over time they recognize that they experience a peculiar, usually unpleasant, odor in their nose in absence of any external odor. These odors may be persistent or transient, usually unpleasant, and may be described as fecal‐like, burned, chemical‐like, or metallic. The phantom, if persistent, can be severe enough to initiate loss of appetite with subsequent weight loss and depression. We have evaluated over 200 patients with smell loss and phantosmia after a head injury at The Taste and Smell Clinic in Washington, DC over the past 40 years attempting to understand their cognitive changes in smell function. We have found that the mechanism for these cognitive changes relate to metabolic changes mainly in biochemical changes in both sensory and brain function in which specific growth factors which maintain olfactory function have been diminished and specific brain neurotransmitters, mainly gamma‐aminobutyric acid, have also been diminished. Correction of these abnormalities commonly corrects the smell loss, inhibits the phantosmia and improves cognition.",

      "abstract": "Simplistic concepts which label a drug as an anesthetic, excitant, hallucinogen, convulsant, anticonvulsant, etc., can be extremely misleading. For example, one could label diethyl ether as a stimulant, euphoriant, hallucinogen or anesthetic. Each description partly characterizes ether at some dose/time period but does not describe the totality of drug action. Another example is phenytoin, which is universally considered to be an anticonvulsant agent, but can induce seizures at high doses. Further, the argument that one action is 'the' desired effect and other actions are side effects is likewise misleading. The decision as to which is a desired effect and which is side effect depends upon the desired effect. For example, ophthalmologists dilate the pupil of the eye and paralyze accommodation with atropine. They regard the dry mouth and reduced bladder and gastrointestinal tract excitability as side effects. However, the urologist or gastroenterologist uses atropine because of the latter effects and considers the effects on the eyes to be the side effects. A more satisfactory approach to drug classification would be to describe the continuum of total drug actions which occur according to the dose and time course of effects. The advent of the excessive nonmedical use of drugs makes this réévaluation of central nervous system (CNS) acting drug classes critical.",

      "abstract": "What is the topic of this review? It provides an overview of the recent papers linking brain neurotransmission with exercise-induced and/or mental fatigue. What advances does it highlight? The noradrenergic neurotransmitter system hastens central fatigue during prolonged exercise, a finding that coincides with a faster rate of increase in the rating of perceived exertion. 2) Mental fatigue affects several neurotransmitter systems, with presumably an important role for dopamine and adenosine, in multiple brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex.In sports and exercise science, fatigue is an elusive concept that has important implications in performance during exercise. It has been described in many ways (tiredness, exhaustion, lethargy or weariness) and describes a physical and/or mental state of being tired and lack of energy. Exercise-induced fatigue can be defined as an acute impairment of exercise performance, and a distinction has been made between peripheral and central fatigue. Mental fatigue can be defined as a psychobiological state caused by prolonged exertion that has the potential to reduce cognitive performance and exercise performance. Recent studies have given clear indications that brain catecholamines are involved in the onset of fatigue during endurance exercise. Evidence is provided indicating that the noradrenergic neurotransmitter system hastens central fatigue, a finding that coincides with a faster rate of increase in the rating of perceived exertion. Brain neurotransmission is also suggested to play an important role in mental fatigue. Several neurotransmitter systems might be implicated (with the most important role for dopamine and adenosine) in multiple brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex, and the summation of these alterations might explain the impairment in endurance performance in a mentally fatigued state. Obviously, we have to keep in mind that fatigue is a very complex construct and that, besides brain neurochemistry, several other factors play a role in its onset.",

      "abstract": "Article AbstractBackground: Hypomania or mania have rarely been reported to develop shortly after the discontinuation of an antidepressant drug. The true incidence of this discontinuation syndrome is unknown because it may be underreported as a consequence of underrecognition or misattribution. This article examines the possible etiology, nosology, mechanisms, and other aspects of the syndrome. Data Sources and Study Selection: A PubMed search was conducted in May 2003 and repeated in January 2004 using the search terms antidepressant and mania. Relevant articles containing adequate descriptions for presentation were retrieved, and their reference lists were hand-searched for further pertinent material. Hand-searches of the indexes of leading psychiatry journals were also performed for the years 1998-2003. Twenty-three articles were identified for review. Conclusions: Antidepressant-withdrawal hypomania or mania may occur rarely with almost any antidepressant drug after sudden withdrawal, tapered discontinuation, or even merely a decrease in dose. The syndrome may be self-limiting, may abate with the reinstitution of the antidepressant drug, or may require specific antimanic treatments; mood stabilizers do not necessarily protect against the syndrome. The true incidence of the syndrome is unknown. Narrow and broad diagnostic criteria are proposed for the syndrome, and a synthesis of literature is provided.",

      "abstract": "Depression is characterized by symptoms like sad mood, loss of interest and pleasure, low energy, worthlessness, guilt, psychomotor retardation or agitation, change in appetite and/or sleep and suicidal thoughts, etc. It may be a unipolar or a bipolar cyclic disorder in which cycles of mood swings from mania to depression occur over time. Fluoxetine, Fluvoxamine, Paroxetine, Sertraline, Citalopram and Escitalopram are the various SSRIs( Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) preferred as first line of drug in such conditions. Among the SSRIs, Escitalopram exerts a highly selective, potent, and dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the human serotonin transport. By inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin into presynaptic nerve endings, this drug enhances the activity of serotonin in the central nervous system. Herein we report a case of a 82 year old male who presented with altered sensorium, tachycardia, hypertension and restlessness to emergency department of our hospital. Patient was known case of Adjustment disorder with Depressed mood and was on treatment with Tablet Escitalopram 10 mg OD and Tablet Zolpidem 10 mg OD since 1 month. Patient overdosed himself with 4 Escitalopram tablets of 10 mg. He presented with features similar to serotonin syndrome.",

Prolonged delirium can also affect patients with multiple predisposing and/or precipitating factors. In clinical practice, prolonged delirium is often unrecognized, and can be misdiagnosed as other psychiatric disorders. We describe a case of a 59-year-old male presenting with behavioral and cognitive symptoms that was first misdiagnosed as a mood disorder in a general hospital setting. After prolonged delirium due to multiple factors was confirmed, the patient was treated accordingly with symptomatic management. He evolved with progressive improvement of his clinical status. Early diagnosis and management of prolonged delirium are important to improve patient prognosis and avoid iatrogenic measures.Delirium pode ser conceituado como o declínio agudo na função cognitiva que geralmente dura de horas a dias. O delírio prolongado também pode afetar pacientes com múltiplos fatores predisponentes e/ou precipitantes. Na prática clínica, o delírio prolongado é muitas vezes não reconhecido, e pode ser diagnosticado como outros transtornos psiquiátricos. Aqui, descrevemos o caso de um homem de 59 anos apresentando sintomas comportamentais e cognitivos que foi diagnosticado inicialmente com transtorno de humor em um hospital geral. Após ser diagnosticado delirium prolongado devido a múltiplos fatores, o paciente foi tratado de acordo, evoluindo com melhora progressiva do seu estado clínico. O diagnóstico e o manejo precoces do delirium prolongado são importantes para melhorar o prognóstico do paciente e evitar medidas iatrogênicas.",

Confirm that the patient's depression qualifies as treatment-resistant.A patient is considered to have TRD if they have longstanding depression that meets DSM-5 criteria for major depressive disorder, and have not adequately responded to at least 2 antidepressant trials of adequate dose and duration.2. Confirm that the patient's suicidal ideation and/or suicidal behavior does not require acute hospitalization.The time between the onset of suicidal ideation and a suicide attempt typically is short, which highlights the need to intervene quickly in these patients. 1Being able to provide a treatment that works quickly and effectively may be lifesaving.However, to receive esketamine, patients must be enrolled in the Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy (REMS) patient registry through a certified treatment center, and prior authorization from insurance generally is required.These steps take time, so patients at high",

The concept generally refers to the nature of an experience, resulting from persons interacting in the context of their environment, either through physiological overarousal or underarousal, with an outcome of psychological or physiological distress (bad stress outcome) or eustress (good stress outcome). Stressors range from minor to major, and can be positive or negative events. Generally stressors are life events, such as daily annoyances, pressures at home or on the job, marital discord and conflicts, emergencies, motor vehicle accidents, illness, and injury. Positive stressful life events and transitions include birth of a newborn, graduation ceremony, a family vacation, or a job promotion (Kaplan &amp; Sadock, 1998).",

      "abstract": "As it is well known, all living humans are subject to daily effects of stress; the stress response varies among individuals depending on the experience that has endowed each person to learn how to deal with stress. Stress relief may be obtained by procedures that lead the subject to “forget” the bad situation or to relax, for instance physical exercise, talking the problem to someone else, drinking alcoholic beverages or using drugs of abuse. Drug addiction develops in persons voluntarily seeking relief from a depressive situation, usually linked to personal catastrophic event, death of a dear family member or a valuable loss of personal belonging, or else also voluntarily aiming to a novel mood enhancing experience, in spite of being conscious of the unwanted effects – dependence – arising from repetitive drug taking, the most serious being addiction, a persistent state in which compulsive drug use escapes control. Addictive drugs besides providing a pleasant rewarding experience also generate reinforcing behaviors of the drug effects leading to tolerance, dependency compulsion, persistence, chronicity with multiple relapses and withdrawal syndrome. The compulsion and persistence are based on pathological molecular mechanisms similar to those involved in memory. Studies done both in humans and rodent models of addiction indicate that key behavior abnormalities associated with addiction are related to changes in the brain, both at molecular and cellular levels. The plastic changes in the dopaminergic VTA NAc pathway and the interconnected structures, also include changes in the gene transcription, RNA and protein processing and in synaptic structure. All the specific changes so far identified are not sufficiently long lasting to account for the behaviors associated with addiction.",

Less recognized is that extrapyramidal symptoms are also associated with certain nonantipsychotic agents, including some antidepressants, lithium, various anticonvulsants, antiemetics and, rarely, oralcontraceptive agents.

      "abstract": "<italic>Life’s Rewards: Linking Dopamine, Incentive Learning, Schizophrenia, and the Mind</italic> explains how increased brain dopamine produces reward-related incentive learning, the acquisition by neutral stimuli of increased ability to elicit approach and other responses. Dopamine decreases may produce inverse incentive learning, the loss by stimuli of the ability to elicit approach and other responses. Incentive learning is gradually lost when dopamine receptors are blocked. The brain has multiple memory systems defined as “declarative” and “non-declarative;” incentive learning produces one form of non-declarative memory. People with schizophrenia have hyperdopaminergia, possibly producing excessive incentive learning. Delusions may rely on declarative memory to interpret the world as it appears with excessive incentive learning. Parkinson’s disease, associated with dopamine loss, may involve a loss of incentive learning and increased inverse incentive learning. Drugs of abuse activate dopaminergic neurotransmission, leading to incentive learning about drug-associated stimuli. After withdrawal symptoms have been alleviated by detoxification treatment, drug-associated conditioned incentive stimuli will retain their ability to elicit responses until they are repeatedly experienced in the absence of primary drug rewards. Incentive learning may involve the action of dopamine at dendritic spines of striatal medium spiny neurons that have recently had glutamatergic input from assemblies of cortical neurons activated by environmental and proprioceptive stimuli. Glutamate initiates a wave of phosphorylation normally followed by a wave of phosphatase activity. If dopaminergic neurons fire, stimulation of D1 receptors prolongs the wave of phosphorylation, allowing glutamate synaptic strengthening. Activity in dopaminergic neurons in humans appears to affect mental experience.",

When vegetative symptoms in the areas of sleep, sex, eating, and/or energy level persist for some time and no medical disorder is apparent, patients and clinicians often assume that the cause is emotional.",

Symptoms of depression include the following: These are normal reactions and are part of the process of recovering from a loss or critical incident stress. Although there is little anyone can do to take away these uncomfortable feelings, there are several things individuals who have experienced a crisis or stress situation can do to speed up the recovery process (Jobes &amp; Berman, 1996; Roberts, Yeager, &amp; Streiner, 2004; Weishaar, 2004):",

      "abstract": "Understanding the particular pharmacology of different antidepressant drugs can help explain their adverse effects when they are discontinued. For all antidepressant drugs, abruptly stopping them can sometimes result in “rebound” hypomania or mania. Antidepressant drugs having anticholinergic effects often are associated with a discontinuation syndrome characterized by cholinergic rebound, with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, sweating, headache, and muscle spasms. Discontinuation of monoamine oxidase inhibitor drugs sometimes results in flu-like symptoms, dysphoria, restlessness, tachycardia, hypertension, and a delirium-like state. Serotonergic antidepressant drugs are sometimes associated with a distinct discontinuation syndrome characterized by dizziness, weakness, nausea, headache, lethargy, insomnia, anxiety, poor concentration, and paresthesias. Adverse discontinuation effects can occur with all types of antidepressant drugs, but only rarely would they be considered serious. To minimize adverse discontinuation effects and to reduce the risk of relapse or recurrence of the underlying treated condition, tapering antidepressant medication is prudent for all patients.",

      "abstract": "An increase in the number of victims of psycho-violence, which has a traumatic effect on the personality, causing emotional stress, stress, discomfort, and depression, necessitates studying the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories. Three categories of manifestations of psycho-violence are distinguished: verbal aggression; dominant behavior; manifestations of jealousy that affect the victim of violence in different ways. Violations developing after the experienced psycho-violence affect all levels of an individual’s functioning and lead to sustainable personality changes. Objective: to identify the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories. My theoretical study of the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories made it possible to identify specific features of the consequences for different age categories. Consequences for children: sleep disturbances; hyperreactivity; impaired memory and concentration; irritability; a sharp decline in school performance; change of worldview; the emergence of many complexes; low self-esteem; maladaptation; health problems (various diseases occur); difficulty in building relationships; developmental delays (mental, emotional, speech); constant stress, fear, expectation of danger; suicidal tendency, asocial lifestyle. The consequences of psycho-violence in adults are disorders of a psychological and physical nature: sleep disturbances; nervous breakdowns; irritability; depression; anxiety; difficulty concentrating; panic conditions, heart attacks; loss of self-esteem; decreased self-esteem; violation of social relations; decrease in labor productivity. The consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories are different, the general thing is that violations affect all levels of a person’s functioning and lead to persistent personality changes.",

      "title": "Overtraining in endurance athletes: a brief review",
      "abstract": "Overtraining is an imbalance between training and recovery, exercise and exercise capacity, stress and stress tolerance. Stress is the sum of training and nontraining stress factors. Peripheral (short-term overtraining, STO) or peripheral and central fatigue may result (long-term overtraining, LTO). STO lasting a few days up to 2 wk is termed overreaching. STO is associated with fatigue, reduction, or stagnation of the 4 LT performance capacity (performance at 4 mmol lactate or comparable criterion), reduction of maximum performance capacity, and brief competitive incompetence. Recovery is achieved within days, so the prognosis is favorable, LTO lasting weeks or months causes overtraining syndrome or staleness. The symptomatology associated with overtraining syndrome has changed over the last 50 yr from excitation and restlessness (so-called sympathetic form) to phlegmatic behavior and inhibition (so-called parasympathetic form). Increased volume of training at a high-intensity level is likely the culprit. The parasympathetic form of overtraining syndrome dominates in endurance sports. Accumulation of exercise and nonexercise fatigue, stagnation, or reduction of the 4 LT performance capacity, reduction in maximum performance capacity, mood state disturbances, muscle soreness/stiffness, and long-term competitive incompetence can be expected. Complete recovery requires weeks and months, so the prognosis is unfavorable. Other optional or further confirmation requiring findings include changes in blood chemistry variables, hormone levels, and nocturnal urinary catecholamine excretion. Based on the findings reported, recommendations for training monitoring can be made, but their relevance in the practice must still be clarified.",

Biological stress will lead to microvasoconstriction and quite frequently also reduces the pumping action of the heart.

      "abstract": "Abstract Dementia is characterized by an insidious and progressive loss of memory, disorientation, cognitive decline in other domains, and affective flattening. It is often accompanied by neuropsychological deficits such as aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or disturbances in executive functioning including planning, organizing, and sequencing of events in a logical fashion. Behavioural symptoms such as withdrawal, depression, delusions, motor restlessness, wander-ing, or aggression may complicate dementia, particularly in advanced stages of the disorder. These behavioural symptoms may occur, in part, secondary to loss of orientation and memory, with loss of autobiographic memory perhaps being most devastating. A patient, for example, who is impaired in retrieving past social interactions from autobiographical memory or recalling other relevant personal information may be more likely to respond with increasing irritability or anxiety in situations that are actually or perceived unfamiliar. Such a patient may perhaps choose a ‘safety first’ strategy or remain captured in indecisiveness, which could manifest in ruminating thinking and stereotyped behaviour, or displacement activities expressing motivational conflict and ambivalence. In any event, the combination of memory loss with other cognitive disturbances certainly leads to a profound deterioration of social competence. It is also noteworthy that, in addition to the problems the patients have themselves, which they generally deny except in the earliest stages of the disorder (anosognosia), dementia creates a substantial burden on patients’ spouses, children and other carers.",

      "title": "Provoked and reflex seizures: Surprising or common?",
      "abstract": "Most patients with epilepsy report that seizures are sometimes, or exclusively, provoked by general internal precipitants (such as stress, fatigue, fever, sleep, and menstrual cycle) and by external precipitants (such as excess alcohol, heat, bathing, eating, reading, and flashing lights). Some patients describe very exotic and precise triggers, like tooth brushing or listening to a particular melody. Nevertheless, the most commonly noticed seizure increasers by far are stress, lack of sleep, and fatigue. Recognized reflex seizure triggers are usually sensory and visual, such as television, discotheques, and video games. Visually evoked seizures comprise 5% of the total of 6% reflex seizures. The distinction between provocative and reflex factors and seizures seems artificial, and in many patients, maybe all, there is a combination of these. It seems plausible that all of the above-mentioned factors can misbalance the actual brain network; at times, accumulation of factors leads then to primary generalized, partial, or secondarily generalized seizures. If the provoking factors are too exotic, patients may be sent to the psychiatrist. Conversely, if the seizure-provoking fluctuating mechanisms include common habits and environmental factors, these may hardly be considered as provocative factors. Awareness of precipitating factors and its possible interactions might help us to unravel the pathophysiology of epilepsy and to change the notion that seizure occurrence is unpredictable. This article provides an overview of the epidemiology, classification, diagnosis, treatment, and especially similarities in the variety of provocative and reflex factors with resulting general hypotheses.",

      "title": "Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine Position Paper on Patient Sleep During Hospitalization",
      "abstract": "This article addresses the issue of patient sleep during hospitalization, which the Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine believes merits wider consideration by health authorities than it has received to date. Adequate sleep is fundamental to health and well-being, and insufficiencies in its duration, quality, or timing have adverse effects that are acutely evident. These include cardiovascular dysfunction, impaired ventilatory function, cognitive impairment, increased pain perception, psychomotor disturbance (including increased fall risk), psychological disturbance (including anxiety and depression), metabolic dysfunction (including increased insulin resistance and catabolic propensity), and immune dysfunction and proinflammatory effects (increasing infection risk and pain generation). All these changes negatively impact health status and are counterproductive to recovery from illness and operation. Hospitalization challenges sleep in a variety of ways. These challenges include environmental factors such as noise, bright light, and overnight awakenings for observations, interventions, and transfers; physiological factors such as pain, dyspnea, bowel or urinary dysfunction, or discomfort from therapeutic devices; psychological factors such as stress and anxiety; care-related factors including medications or medication withdrawal; and preexisting sleep disorders that may not be recognized or adequately managed. Many of these challenges appear readily addressable. The key to doing so is to give sleep greater priority, with attention directed at ensuring that patients' sleep needs are recognized and met, both within the hospital and beyond. Requirements include staff education, creation of protocols to enhance the prospect of sleep needs being addressed, and improvement in hospital design to mitigate environmental disturbances. Hospitals and health care providers have a duty to provide, to the greatest extent possible, appropriate preconditions for healing. Accumulating evidence suggests that these preconditions include adequate patient sleep duration and quality. The Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine calls for systematic changes in the approach of hospital leadership and staff to this issue. Measures required include incorporation of optimization of patient sleep into the objectives of perioperative and general patient care guidelines. These steps should be complemented by further research into the impact of hospitalization on sleep, the effects of poor sleep on health outcomes after hospitalization, and assessment of interventions to improve it.",

      "title": "An update on ketamine and its two enantiomers as rapid-acting antidepressants",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Depression is one of the most disabling diseases worldwide. Approximately one-third of depressed patients are treatment-resistant to the currently available antidepressants and there is a significant therapeutic time lag of weeks to months. There is a clear unmet need for rapid-acting and more efficacious treatments. (R,S)-ketamine, an old anesthetic drug, appears now to be going through a renaissance.Areas covered: This paper reviews recent literature describing the antidepressant effects of ketamine and its enantiomer (S)-ketamine in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). Furthermore, the authors discuss the therapeutic potential of (R)-ketamine, another enantiomer of (R,S)-ketamine, and (S)-norketamine.Expert commentary: A number of clinical studies have demonstrated that (R,S)-ketamine has rapid-acting and sustained antidepressant activity in treatment-resistant patients with MDD, BD, and other psychiatric disorders. Off-label use of ketamine for mood disorders is proving popular in the United States. Meanwhile, preclinical data suggests that (R)-ketamine can exert longer-lasting antidepressant effects than (S)-ketamine in animal models of depression, and (R)-ketamine may have less detrimental side effects than (R,S)-ketamine and (S)-ketamine. Additionally, (S)-norketamine exhibits rapid and sustained antidepressant effects, with a potency similar to that of (S)-ketamine. Unlike (S)-ketamine, (S)-norketamine does not cause behavioral and biochemical abnormalities and could be a safer than (S)-ketamine too.",

It is one of the mental health problems of people all over the world. Depression is a multifaceted condition characterised by episodes of mood disturbances alongside other symptoms such as anhedonia, psychomotor complaints, feelings of guilt and suicidal tendencies, all of which can range in severity. Anxiety and fear can be defined as response of subject to real or potential threats that may impair his/her homeostasis that can significantly mark function and quality of life. Some of depressive disorder overlap those of anxiety disorders, including severe phobias, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Anxietyrelated disorders such as patient’s nervousness, obsessive compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress are foremost causes of infirmity in the world. Antidepressant and anxiolytic drug are the drug use for treatment of depression and anxiety but there are several side effect of these drug were observed like dry mouth, mental confusion, weakness and sedation. So, we evaluate the anti-depressant and anti-anxiety effect of N. Jatamansi root extract in rats by dose dependent manner. The behavior assessment observed by force swim test, locomotor activity, tail suspension test and elevated plus maze for depression and anxiety experimentation. The drug given 150 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg by oral route. The study observed that the ethanolic root extract reduced depression and anxiety generated by force swim test, tail suspension method, actophotometer and elevated plus maze.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Inappropriate use of benzodiazepines is an important public health problem. In clinical practice benzodiazepine misuse is generally encountered in one of the three following situations: as part of a complex presentation of polysubstance dependence, in patients who have been prescribed therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines and have difficulty stopping use, and rarely, dependence on benzodiazepines as the primary drug of abuse. Determining the extent of the problem is hindered by various definitions of abuse and dependence. In this chapter, we follow the use of previous publications: ‘‘The terms abuse and misuse refer to the use of a drug in a manner that is not consistent with generally accepted medical practice or social and legal custom, e.g., use without a valid prescription or deliberately to produce intoxication, pleasure or a high’’ (Ciraulo and Sarid-Segal, 2005, p. 1300). Misuse is used to describe patients who use higher than prescribed doses, or obtain medications from a friend or relative for therapeutic purposes.",

Case examples illustrate how these may present. Diabetes can cause confusion due to either hyper- or hypoglycemia. Congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive lung disease can cause hypoxia and resulting confusion. Sleep apnea can present with amnesia, apathy, and depression. Physiological changes make elderly patients especially susceptible to adverse drug effects, including hyponatremia and anticholinergic symptoms. Depression and cognitive changes have been associated with both hyper- and hypothyroidism, as well as with hyperparathyroidism. Elderly patients are at risk for developing subdural hematomas which can present with cognitive deficits and blunting of mood, and some patients may not have taken notice of the traumatic incident. Vitamin B12 deficiency can present with neurological symptoms including dementia, and cancer may present with fatigue and weight loss, which may be interpreted as depression.",

Other systems base ratings by physical findings or diagnosis. Criteria for posttraumatic headache are proposed in the form of a mnemonic: IMPAIRMENT. Intensity, Medication use, Physical signs/symptoms, Adjustment, Incapacitation, Recreation, Miscellaneous activity of daily living, Employment, Number (frequency), Time (duration of attacks). Each are scored from 0 to 2 points. There are three physician modifiers, scored from 0 to -4 points: Motivation for treatment, Overexaggeration or overconcern, Degree of legal interest. Case examples will illustrate how impairment ratings are determined, along with further details on scoring. Proposed criteria for posttraumatic headache impairment are understandable, easy to utilize and reproducible.",

Most often, intermittent forms of alcohol abuse or dependence are observed in patients who present, between the acute ingestions of alcohol, a chronic consumption. Intermittent ingestions of alcohol can also be present among subjects presenting a pathological personality (antisocial personality) and a past or present dependence syndrome to heroine. These patients use alcohol like a drug in order to get a modification of the conscience, a high, a sedation or a trip.",

She goes into old antidepressant medication for a few weeks with an increasing worsening of her state, at the point she is sent to the emergency room with high irritability, intense agitation, suicide thoughts as the highlight symptoms of what we think to be a mixed episode of a bipolar disorder and how we orient the case during hospitalization. The patient follows both public and private psychiatric services and after discharge from acute hospitalization, still with residual depressions symptoms, her private psychiatrist substitutes the given treatment, including mood stabilizers, by only antidepressants. Two weeks after discharge from the hospital, the patient is relocated to our partial hospitalization resource. During her stay in our resource, we decide to keep the new treatment and diagnosis and increase the dosage of one of the antidepressants, which immediately yields to hypomania symptoms, at what we conclude that our patient is better treated as a bipolar type II with a mood stabilizer and low doses of an SRI. We find this to be an interesting case in the both psychopathological and psychophysiological point of view. To understand the case beyond clinical diagnosis, we discuss profoundly whether the bariatric surgery may have a role as a trigger.

The most common pathophysiologic mechanism is through GABA receptor blockade and the most commonly used family of ICU drugs, reducing the seizure threshold, is antibiotics. The exact role that these medications play in inducing a clinical or subclinical seizure, in the context of cerebral injury or other multi-organ failure, is in many cases unclear. The best treatment for drug-induced seizures is increased vigilance and prevention. Cautious measures should be used to minimize or eliminate any unwanted drug side effects by attempting to start and keep the patient on the lowest effective dose for the desired therapeutic effect. When upward dosage titration is necessary it is best to increase slowly while keeping a watchful eye on all laboratory and clinical indicators of success or failure. Free levels of antiepileptic or other medications should be considered in the critically ill, due to numerous factors affecting their final action on the pharmacologic target. If a seizure occurs clinicians should always seek a medication as the cause of the witnessed seizure and should consider replacing it with another agent that has less epileptogenic potential. Lastly, a GABAergic receptor agonist antiepileptic drug should be used as first-line antidote in most of the cases.",

      "abstract": "A drug that subdues exhilaration and produces a calming effect in the subject without necessarily inducing sleep is referred to as sedative. The main system for action of these drugs is the Central Nervous System (CNS). Sedatives are slow working drugs with a levelled dose response curve. They act by modifying nerve responses in CNS to the brain which slows down brain activity thus relaxing the body. Gamma-amino-Butyric acid (GABA) is neurotransmitter which is responsible for retarding the brain functioning and sedatives increase the activity of GABA to produce more effect on the brain activity. Mostly sedatives are used to treat sleep disorders, pain or as anaesthetics. Opioids are sedatives used to treat pain, but long-term usage of these drugs leads to dependency and addiction which may be a challenge to treat. People experience withdrawal symptoms like nausea, vomiting, anxiety, insomnia and/or irritability along with seizures and loss of consciousness in some extreme cases. BXCL501 is a formulation of Dexmedetomidine used to treat agitation and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. The drug is designed in such a manner that it reduces agitation but does not produce excessive sedation. The RELEASE clinical trial of “bioxcel therapeutics” lead to the use of this drug to treat or retard opioid withdrawal symptoms and agitations. This article is aimed at reviewing and summarising existing data concerning the synthesis, chemical taxonomy, properties, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profile, side effects, interactions, toxicology of dexmedetomidine.",

      "title": "Cas de dépression post-partum chez une femelle orang-outan",
      "abstract": "Chez l'humain, les dépressions, dont la dépression post-partum, sont regroupées dans la catégorie « Trouble de l'humeur non spécifié ». Les causes de la dépression sont nombreuses et multifactorielles, d'ordre endocrinien, environnemental, social, affectif, psychologique. Quel qu'en soit l'effet déclencheur, la dépression s'accompagne toujours d'un dérèglement biochimique responsable de nombreux symptômes : anhédonie, anorexie ou hyperphagie, hyper- ou insomnie, perte de poids significative (< 5 %), agitation ou prostration, altération de la vie sociale, etc. L'élaboration d'une revue de littérature prépare la présentation d'un cas clinique de femelle orang-outan. L'étude de l'influence des facteurs biologiques et des agents stressants, tels que environnementaux, sociaux et affectifs, sur l'humeur et ses troubles, étaye l'analyse des résultats obtenus. Née en captivité en Allemagne, gestante primipare lors de son transfert en France en février 1996, Jane, jeune femelle orang-outan de 13 ans a commencé à envoyer des signes de détresse au cours du 3e mois de vie de son nourrisson (vomissement, anorexie, prostration). Au fur et à mesure des semaines son état s'aggravant, elle laissa son jeune au soin d'une femelle plus âgée et expérimentée qu'elle. Puisque les résultats médicaux affichaient des constantes normales, Sébastien Laurent, le directeur du parc commença à la masser, la coiffer, la forcer à manger et à la stimuler. Durant huit mois, chaque jour, il lui consacrait ce temps individualisé. Au fur et à mesure des soins, l'état de Jane s'améliora. Au neuvième mois, elle redevint entièrement autonome. Dans la dépression post-partum, le facteur stress jouerait un rôle fondamental dans le dérèglement de l'axe corticotrope, l'activation de la réponse inflammatoire et le syndrome de basse T3. La perte des repères familiers, l'absence de soutien, l'isolement familial ou social, la détresse affective sont des facteurs de stress indiscutables chez l'humain. Le cas clinique de Jane permet de confirmer que son arrivée dans ce nouveau zoo a pu provoquer un stress à l'origine de son désarroi. La massothérapie, l'attention individualisée, et le temps partagé avec un référent sécure et contenant, furent les outils psychothérapiques enrayant le processus dépressif. Les recherches médicales actuelles démontrent les effets positifs des massages au niveau de la diminution du taux de cortisol (hormone du stress) de 31 % et l'augmentation de sérotonine de 28 % et de dopamine de 31 % (neurotransmetteurs du bien-être), à l'issue de massothérapie.",

      "title": "Differentiating tardive dyskinesia: a video-based review of antipsychotic-induced movement disorders in clinical practice",
      "abstract": "Abstract Accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment of tardive dyskinesia (TD) are imperative, as its symptoms can be highly disruptive to both patients and their caregivers. Misdiagnosis can lead to incorrect interventions with suboptimal or even deleterious results. To aid in the identification and differentiation of TD in the psychiatric practice setting, we review its clinical features and movement phenomenology, as well as those of other antipsychotic-induced movement disorders, with accompanying links to illustrative videos. Exposure to dopamine receptor blocking agents (DRBAs) such as antipsychotics or antiemetics is associated with a spectrum of movement disorders including TD. The differential diagnosis of TD is based on history of DRBA exposure, recent discontinuation or dose reduction of a DRBA, and movement phenomenology. Common diagnostic challenges are the abnormal behaviors and dyskinesias associated with advanced age or chronic mental illness, and other movement disorders associated with DRBA therapy, such as akathisia, parkinsonian tremor, and tremor related to use of mood stabilizing agents (eg, lithium, divalproex). Duration of exposure may help rule out acute drug-induced syndromes such as acute dystonia or acute/subacute akathisia. Another important consideration is the potential for TD to present together with other drug-induced movement disorders (eg, parkinsonism, parkinsonian tremor, and postural tremor from mood stabilizers) in the same patient, which can complicate both diagnosis and management. After documentation of the phenomenology, severity, and distribution of TD movements, treatment options should be reviewed with the patient and caregivers.",

Treatment depends on the underlying cause. If sleepiness persists despite optimal treatment of the underlying condition, exclusion of other causes, and behavioral interventions, wakefulness-promoting agents may be considered. However, no established pharmacological strategy exists for symptomatic treatment. Modafinil and stimulants like methylphenidate may offer some benefit based on experiences with narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia.

      "title": "Neuronal and behavioural effects of social isolation in old age",
      "abstract": "espanolEl aislamiento social en los seres humanos se caracteriza por una menor calidad social que se ve agravada aun mas despues de la jubilacion, disminucion en el numero de relaciones por la perdida de amigos cercanos o incluso la viudedad. Por lo tanto, el aislamiento social es particularmente frecuente en las personas de edad avanzada y un problema creciente en los paises con una esperanza de vida media mas larga. En la actualidad, existe evidencia epidemiologica que indica que el aislamiento social es un factor de riesgo para el desarrollo de diversas enfermedades tales como trastornos cardiovasculares, depresion, deterioro cognitivo e incluso aumento de la mortalidad. Mientras que muchos estudios en animales se han investigado los efectos del aislamiento social en el comportamiento durante el periodo pre-destete, solo en unos pocos estudios se han investigado las consecuencias conductuales y cognitivas del aislamiento social en la edad adulta o en la vejez. La principal hipotesis de este trabajo es que el aislamiento social puede considerarse como una situacion estresante que, cuando se produce a finales de la edad adulta o en la vejez, induce cambios en ciertos procesos fisiologicos y neurobiologicos que afectan al comportamiento y exacerban el deterioro cognitivo relacionado con la edad. En la primera parte de este estudio hemos utilizado hembras adultas de Octodon degus para investigar los efectos del aislamiento social a largo plazo sobre la memoria del miedo condicionado al contexto, y la posible modulacion de los niveles sinapticos de NCAM y PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo. Despues de 6 ½ meses de aislamiento social, las hembras degus adultas mostraron una memoria normal del miedo condicionado al tono, pero un deficit en la memoria del miedo contextual, una tarea dependiente del hipocampo. Posteriormente, se observo una reduccion de los niveles sinapticos de PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo de las degus aisladas en comparacion con las agrupadas. Curiosamente, el aislamiento social redujo ademas el volumen de la subregion de CA1 del hipocampo, sin afectar al volumen de la subregion CA3 del hipocampo o la totalidad de esta region. Por otra parte, se detecto una disminucion en el aumento de peso corporal asi como una reduccion del numero de granulocitos en los animales aislados. Nuestros hallazgos indican, por primera vez, que el aislamiento social a largo plazo de las hembras adultas induce la contraccion especifica de la subregion de CA1 y una disminucion en los niveles sinapticos de PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo. Estos efectos pueden estar relacionados con el deficit de la memoria del miedo contextual observada en las hembras degus aisladas. Nuestros estudios con ratas Wistar machos, llevados a cabo en la segunda parte del estudio, indican que el aislamiento social durante el envejecimiento altera progresivamente la actividad simpatica, y aumenta la ansiedad y el comportamiento tipo depresivo. Ademas, las ratas aisladas a largo plazo muestran niveles elevados de corticosterona plasmatica y cambios morfologicos, bioquimicos y electrofisiologicos en el hipocampo que pueden conducir a la alteracion de la memoria espacial observada en estos animales. Tras el aislamiento social a largo plazo, la administracion sistemica de un peptido sintetico que imita algunas de las acciones de la molecula de adhesion celular neuronal fue capaz de revertir el deterioro de la memoria espacial inducida por el aislamiento, lo que indica que este tratamiento farmacologico puede ser de relevancia terapeutica. EnglishSocial isolation in humans is marked by fewer quality social relationships and is agravated after retirement, widowhood and the loss of close friends. Thus, social isolation is particularly prevalent in elderly people and is becoming an increasing problem in countries with a longer average lifespan. At present, there is epidemiological evidence indicating that social isolation is a risk factor for the development of various diseases such as cardiovascular disorders, depression, cognitive decline and even increased mortality. While many animal studies have investigated the eff ects of social isolation during the pre-weaning and juvenile period on behavior, only a few studies have investigated the behavioural and cognitive consequences of social isolation in adulthood or in old age. The main hypothesis of this work is that social isolation can be considered a stressful situation that, when occurs at late adulthood or in old age, induces changes in certain physiological and neurobiological processes aff ecting behavior and exacerbating agerelated cognitive decline. In the first part of this study we used adult female Octodon degus to investigate the effects of long-term social isolation on contextual and cued fear conditioning, and the possible modulation of the synaptic levels of NCAM and PSA-NCAM in the hippocampus. After 6½ months of social isolation, adult female degus showed a normal auditory-cued fear memory, but a deficit in contextual fear memory, a hippocampal dependent task. Subsequently, we observed reduced hippocampal synaptic levels of PSA-NCAM in isolated compared to grouped-housed female degus. Interestingly, social isolation reduced the volume of the hippocampal CA1 subfield, without aff ecting the volume of the CA3 subregion or the total hippocampus. Moreover, attenuated body weight gain and reduced number of granulocytes were detected in isolated animals. Our findings indicate for the first time, that long-term social isolation of adult female animals induces a specific shrinkage of CA1 and a decrease in synaptic levels of PSA-NCAM in the hippocampus. These effects may be related to the deficit in contextual fear memory observed in isolated female degus. Our studies with male Wistar rats, carried out in the second part of the study, indicate that social isolation at aging progressively alters sympathetic activity, and increases anxiety and depressive- like behaviour. In addition, long-term isolated rats showed elevated plasmatic corticosterone levels and displayed morphological, electrophysiological and biochemical changes in the hippocampus that may lead to the spatial memory impairment observed in these animals. After long term social isolation, systemic administration of a synthetic peptide that mimics some neural cell adhesion activities was able to revert isolation-induced spatial memory impairment, indicating that this pharmacological treatment may be of therapeutic relevance.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a conspicuous problem in modern 24 h society. In this brief overview, medications used to treat insomnia such as hypnotics, sedatives, medications inducing sedation as a side effect, medications directed at the sleep-associated circadian neuroendocrine system, and agents utilized in treating insomnia-inducing sleep diagnoses such as restless leg syndrome are discussed. The newer GABA-effective hypnotics are the only medications with demonstrated effectiveness in treating chronic insomnia with the majority of evidence supporting treatment efficacy for cognitive-behavioral therapy and short acting GABA-receptor agonists. In patients with comorbid insomnia the use of hypnotics can improve outcomes and potentially reduce morbidity and mortality associated with the use of more toxic medications. Except in individuals whose insomnia is secondary to circadian disturbance, mood disorder/depression and/or restless leg syndrome , there is minimal evidence supporting the efficacy of other medications used to treat insomnia despite their widespread use. Sedatives and other medications used off-label for sedative side-effects are a contributing factor to drug induced hypersomnolence, a factor in more than 30% of motor accident deaths. Hypnotic medications with low toxicity, addictive potential, minimal next day sleepiness, and an otherwise benign side-effect profile can be utilized safely and effectively to treat and improve function and quality of life for patients suffering from insomnia. These are the agents that should be exclusively classified as hypnotics and utilized to induce sleep when medications are required to treat the complaint of insomnia. Other pharmacological agents producing sedation (sedatives and agents used off-label for sedative side-effects) should be used cautiously for the treatment of insomnia due to the increased risk of next day sleepiness as well as for known toxicities and adverse side effects.",

      "title": "Human psychopharmacology of Ecstasy (MDMA): a review of 15 years of empirical research",
      "abstract": "Abstract MDMA (3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine) or ‘Ecstasy’ was scheduled as an illegal drug in 1986, but since then its recreational use has increased dramatically. This review covers 15 years of research into patterns of use, its acute psychological and physiological effects, and the long‐term consequences of repeated use. MDMA is an indirect monoaminergic agonist, stimulating the release and inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin (5‐HT) and, to a lesser extent, other neurotransmitters. Single doses of MDMA have been administered to human volunteers in double‐blind placebo‐controlled trials, although most findings are based upon recreational MDMA users. The ‘massive’ boost in neurotransmitter activity can generate intense feelings of elation and pleasure, also hyperactivity and hyperthermia. This psychophysiological arousal may be exacerbated by high ambient temperatures, overcrowding, prolonged dancing and other stimulant drugs. Occasionally the ‘serotonin syndrome’ reactions may prove fatal. In the days after Ecstasy use, around 80% of users report rebound depression and lethargy, due probably to monoaminergic depletion. Dosage escalation and chronic pharmacodynamic tolerance typically occur in regular users. Repeated doses of MDMA cause serotonergic neurotoxicity in laboratory animals, and there is extensive evidence for long‐term neuropsychopharmacological damage in humans. Abstinent regular Ecstasy users often display reduced levels of 5‐HT, 5‐HIAA, tryptophan hydroxylase and serotonin transporter density; functional deficits in learning/memory, higher cognitive processing, sleep, appetite and psychiatric well‐being, and, most paradoxically, ‘loss of sexual interest/pleasure’. These psychobiological deficits are greatest in heavy Ecstasy users and may reflect serotonergic axonal loss in the higher brain regions, especially the frontal lobes, temporal lobes and hippocampus. These problems seem to remain long after the recreational use of Ecstasy has ceased, suggesting that the neuropharmacological damage may be permament. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

      "title": "[Psychology and psychobiology of childhood trauma].",
      "abstract": "Exposure to overwhelming stress often determines how people subsequently organize their perceptions of themselves and of others. Traumatic experiences at different developmental levels have different effects on cognitive, affective and biological self-organization. Acute or chronic exposure to trauma may be expressed as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), dissociative disorders, somatic disturbances and alterations in perception of self and others. These disorders involve (a) the involuntary repetitive re-living of the trauma in thoughts, images, somatic states or behaviors, (b) attempts to avoid dealing with reminders of the past, (c) problems with the modulation of physiological responses to subsequent stress, and (d) a loss of capacity to engage in love and work with pleasure and satisfaction. The display of extremes of emotional distress, or of bizarre or disorganized behaviors, easily obscures the fact that current problems may have their origins in past trauma. The recognition that many psychiatric patients organize much of their lives around repetitive patterns of re-living and warding off traumatic memories, reminders and affective states, may help clinicians understand their symptoms as misguided attempts to regain a sense of control and safety, rather than as bizarre behaviors that need to be merely controlled. Since safe attachments appear to be the primary way in which children learn to regulate internal state changes, the negotiation of interpersonal safety needs to be the first focus of treatment. Since the labeling and categorization of emotional states is one of the principal areas of functioning that is disrupted by developmental trauma, treatment needs to include learning how to use words to understand and interpret feelings in general and stressful events, in particular. Since distrust and lack of social safety are critical parts of developmental trauma, structure and predictability are essential. Identifying specific trauma-based perceptions and expectations and learning how to negotiate the fulfillment of one's emotional needs are critical aspects of effective treatment.",

      "abstract": "Until recently alcoholism was regarded as being an incurable psychological problem. During the last decade a chain of research has led to a new insight into the causes and potential alleviation of alcohol craving: Recent discoveries indicate that the brain has receptor sites for naturally occurring opiate-like substances (endorphins and enkephalins) which are produced by the nervous system. Opiates such as morphine or heroin, and some of the metabolic products of alcohol (tetrahydroiso-quinolines), can also attach themselves to these receptors. It has been further discovered that the craving for alcohol is related to a deficiency of the naturally occurring opiate-like substances as well as other neurotransmitter substances. This deficiency can occur genetically or as a result of prolonged stress or long-term heavy drinking. The neurochemical imbalance may be treated chemically, leading to a possible alleviation of the craving for alcohol, especially in conjunction with psychotherapeutic and counseling regimens.",

      "title": "THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSIVE STATES WITH G 22355 (IMIPRAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE)",
      "abstract": "Over a three-year period, more than 500 psychiatric patients of various diagnostic categories were treated with imipramine hydrochloride. It was demonstrated that the compound has potent antidepressant action. Best responses were obtained in cases of endogenous depression showing the typical symptoms of mental and motor retardation, fatigue, feeling of heaviness, hopelessness, guilt, and despair. The condition is furthermore characterized by the aggravation of symptoms in the morning with a tendency to improvement during the day. Treatment with imipramine hydrochloride resulted in full or social recovery in a high percentage of the patients. As a rule, the initial response was evident within 2 to 3 days, while in some cases 1 to 4 weeks of therapy were required. In view of the symptomatic nature of the action of imipramine hydrochloride, therapy must be maintained as long as the illness lasts. The side effects noted were relatively slight, and with the exception of one case of severe allergic exanthema necessitating discontinuance of treatment, no serious complications were encountered. In some cases of depression, particularly those associated with organic brain damage or schizophrenic psychosis, transitory states of agitation or exacerbation of the psychotic features were noted. These observations suggest the importance of a proper selection of the patients as to type and etiology of depression. While in a number of instances, neurotic, schizophrenic or other depressions were also benefited by the drug, particularly when used in combination with chlorpromazine, electroshock or psychotherapy, it is concluded that imipramine hydrochloride is primarily indicated and effective in the treatment of endogenous depression.",

Readmitted for a manic exacerbation, the increasing of clozapine up to 250 mg/day was accompanied by hyperphagia, weight gain, cognitive impairment, sedation, fatigue, anergy, resistant chronic constipation. To that point clozapine was abruptly replaced with asenapine 20 mg/day with rapid clinical improvement within two days without major side effects. After 6 months the patient is still showing a good affective stability, without side effects. Our case report underlines the possibility of rapid switch from clozapine to asenapine in bipolar I disorder therapy resistant manic patients, presenting extrapyramidal, cognitive and metabolic side effects with atypical and typical neuroleptics.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a serious mental illness that can be debilitating. It can interfere with daily activities and cause feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and despair. It is a mental health condition that can range in severity from mild to severe. The severity of depression can be assessed based on the number, intensity, and duration of symptoms, as well as their impact on an individual's daily functioning. Mild depression typically involves symptoms such as feeling sad, low energy, and a lack of motivation. These symptoms may not significantly interfere with an individual's ability to function in their daily life, and they may still be able to maintain their social and occupational obligations. Moderate depression involves more severe and persistent symptoms, such as a sense of hopelessness, persistent feelings of sadness, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions. These symptoms may make it challenging to fulfill daily responsibilities, and may result in social isolation or problems at work or school. Severe depression involves symptoms that significantly impair an individual's ability to function in their daily life, such as suicidal thoughts, complete loss of interest in activities, and difficulty with basic tasks such as personal hygiene or eating. Severe depression is a medical emergency and requires immediate professional intervention to prevent harm to oneself or others",

Case reports have described dyskinesia occurring in patients with several antipsychotics withdrawn, but studies on amisulpride withdrawal dyskinesia are lacking.A 63-year-old man, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia at age 49, received amisulpride treatment since age 62. The dosage of amisulpride was reduced from 200 to 50 mg/day because of occurrence of akathisia during one admission. Severe withdrawal dyskinesia, mixed with dystonia and akathisia, was noted immediately after the dosage reduction. The abnormal involuntary movement showed improvement 2 weeks later when the dosage was increased to 100 mg/day.Withdrawal dyskinesia and other abnormal involuntary movements could be noted in a patient with reduction of amisulpride dosage or sudden termination. Withdrawal dyskinesia may subsequently lead to persistent tardive dyskinesia. Therefore, withdrawal-emergent dyskinesia should be promptly identified, and appropriate medical interventions should be given early.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BP), also known as manic-depressive illness, is a brain disorder that causes unusual shifts in mood, energy, and activity levels (1). Some of the most prominent and characteristic symptoms of BP include dramatic disturbances in sleep:wake or rest:activity cycles, with restlessness in the manic phase and extremely low levels of activity during the depressive phase (“having difficulty getting out of bed”) (2, 3). Also, rest:activity cycles can profoundly change the course of clinical manifestations; pharmacological agents such as lithium and antidepressants, which are commonly used to treat this illness, significantly alter the cycling of affective episodes over the longitudinal course of the disorder (2, 3). In PNAS, Pagani et al. (4) report, to their knowledge, the first large-scale systematic analysis of rest:activity phenotypes in 26 pedigrees segregating for severe BP. This study involved monitoring of actigraphy for two weeks in 136 euthymic (between episodes of mania or depression) BP subjects and 422 of their non-BP relatives. To identify sleep, activity, and circadian rhythm phenotypes with a significant genetic component, the authors estimated heritability. In simple terms, they compared the degree of familial relationships with the level of similarity in 73 phenotypes collected for all family members. In addition to identifying heritable rest:activity traits, this analysis also identified a subset of phenotypes correlated with the disease status. Systematic delineation of heritable disease-associated traits, as illustrated in the Pagani et al. paper (4), will be critical in ongoing efforts to link genomic lesions—such as those identified by next-generation sequencing—to complex psychiatric disorders.",

It was characterized by fluctuating disorientation, marked inattention, affective lability, increased psychomotor activity, irrelevant speech, social disinhibition, at times staring, talking to self and gesturing in air, and sleep-wake cycle reversal with evening worsening of symptoms.

After administration of 12 pills during 2 days, he started hearing music and songs not heard by others. One day later, when the number of ingested pills increased to 18, he decided to discontinue amiodarone and consulted a cardiologist; no signs of physical, ECG or laboratory deterioration were observed. MHs disappeared next day and returned only as a single episode when he tried to restart amiodarone at a dose of 1 pill daily 2 weeks later. Finally, following complete removal of the medication, he experienced no MHs whatsoever. Amiodarone is known to seldom cause neurological or mental complications; however, MHs after the drug have never been reported so far.",

Although his depressive symptoms, impulse control and his irritability improved significantly he became quite apathetic. This responded positively to a reduction in the dose of sertraline. Since apathy can be a residual symptom of depression it may be a valid consideration to increase the dose of the SSRI. However if apathy was not a significant part of depressive syndrome prior to SSRI treatment then antidepressant treatment emergent apathy needs to be considered and one option is to reduce the dose of the SSRI. Other options appear to be addition of other pharmacological agents such as stimulants, dopamine agonists, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA antagonists.",

The following lasting effects may also be noted upon experiences that have occurred before the emotion: (1) The well-known retro-active amnesia; (2) The opposite, retro-active hypermnesia to which little attention has formerly been paid; (3) a combination of both these effects; for the same person the stretch preceding the critical event may show vivid recollections followed by a period of utter blank. The retro-active hypermnesia in the author's cases rarely goes beyond the events of the day preceding the excitement. It occurred in 25 out of 225 cases. The antecedent events are unusually vivid—more vivid than any other of the patients' memories. The vividness is not confined to visual images, although these are more frequent; sounds, the mood, the general state of the mind may be clearly represented. There is some indication that women experience it more frequently than men. In some cases the effect has come at some crisis at early childhood, in others at a later date. The quality of the emotion seems of less importance than the intensity of the shock. Fear, or fearless surprise, or pleasurable surprise may be the cause. If the intensity be exceeded the experiences connected with it are in some degree suppressed; while if it be not reached the experiences are lost probably by a mere failure to gather up the events into the mesh of interest. Emotion facilitates the recall of whatever is noticed during the excitement, and it seems probable that memory images may be treated by the emotional onrush in the same way as perceptive images. The experiences of the preceding day, however, probably do not exist as actual images at the time of the emotion but as psycho-physical dispositions or traces, so that where there is retro-active hypermnesia the emotion would seem to have the power to strengthen these dispositions and the connections by which they may be called into life. The author gives illustrative cases.",

While its etiological bases remain obscure and consequently its nosological boundaries are uncertain, the condition classically has its onset in childhood or early adolescence [1]. It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

      "abstract": "Introduction Symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) recur during the premenstrual phase of the cycle and disappear to the beginning or after last menstruation. The main symptoms are emotional liability, dysphoria and anxiety. Objectives To review PMDD for helping in the differential diagnosis between this disease and classical anxiety disorders. Methods It was made a clinical review about differential diagnosis and comorbilities on PMDD in specialized literature and Pub-Med. Results PMDD causes significant distress and impairment in social or occupational functioning the first week following menstruation. In relation with differential diagnosis on PMDD, on the one hand, several organic diseases could produce the same symptoms than PMDD: for example gynecological pathology as dysmenorrhea or menopausal transition, endocrinological diseases as hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism and some hormonal treatment including hormonal contraceptives. In addition, a variety of medical disorders are concomitant pathologies that could be associated with PMDD (eg, migraine; epilepsy, asthma, allergies, systemic exertion intolerance disease, chronic fatigue syndrome; irritable bowel syndrome). These pathologies are exacerbated just before or during menstruation. On the other hand, several psychiatric disorders as bipolar disorder, major depression, dystimia, and anxiety disorders could get worse on the premenstrual phase. Conclusions In relation with the diagnosis of PMDD, it seems necessary to consider various differential diagnosis such as psychiatric, gynecological and endocrine disorders because of all of them share like symptoms. For this purpose it is very important to make both a good clinical history and a comprehensive physical examination to offer the most accurate diagnosis and treatment.

      "title": "Η σχέση υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης και διατροφής στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό τρίτης ηλικίας",
      "abstract": "Τα τελευταία χρόνια κερδίζει έδαφος η ιδέα της υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης (ΥΓΕ) ως υποψηφίου ισοδυνάμου του προκλινικού σταδίου της νόσου Alzheimer. Ως υποκειμενική γνωστική έκπτωση (subjective cognitive decline) ορίζουμε την (αυθόρμητη ή μη) αναφορά από ένα άτομο παραπόνων για εμμένουσα έκπτωση της μνήμης ή άλλων γνωστικών λειτουργιών σε σχέση με το προηγούμενο επίπεδο, χωρίς από την αντικειμενική εξέταση να προκύπτει νευρογνωστική διαταραχή (ήπια γνωστική διαταραχή ή κλινική άνοια), λαμβανομένων υπόψη της ηλικίας, του φύλου και του μορφωτικού επιπέδου. Η έκπτωση πρέπει επίσης να μη σχετίζεται με κάποιο οξύ συμβάν και να μην μπορεί να εξηγηθεί από άλλη νευρολογική, ψυχιατρική ή παθολογική νόσο, λήψη φαρμάκων ή ουσιών. Τα δεδομένα υποδηλώνουν ότι τα άτομα αυτά έχουν αυξημένο κίνδυνο νόσησης από άνοια στο μέλλον και συνιστούν ελκυστικό ερευνητικό στόχο, τόσο για επιδημιολογικές, όσο και παρεμβατικές μελέτες.Εφόσον η ΥΓΕ είναι παράγοντας κινδύνου για τη μετέπειτα εγκατάσταση κλινικής άνοιας, είναι ιδιαίτερα ενδιαφέρον να μελετηθούν οι παράμετροι που θα μπορούσαν να επηρεάσουν αυτήν την εξέλιξη. Ένας από τους πιο ενδιαφέροντες παράγοντες που σχετίζονται με τον τρόπο ζωής είναι η διατροφή, η οποία προσφέρεται ως στόχος για την υιοθέτηση ευρείας κλίμακας στρατηγικών πρόληψης της γνωστικής έκπτωσης με καλή σχέση κόστους-αποτελεσματικότητας. Καθώς η διεθνής βιβλιογραφία παρουσιάζει σημαντικές ελλείψεις στη μελέτη της σχέσης ΥΓΕ και διατροφής, η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή φιλοδοξεί να συνεισφέρει στην κάλυψη αυτού του κενού. Για το σκοπό αυτό, η εργασία στηρίχθηκε στα δεδομένα της μελέτης HELIAD [Hellenic Epidemiological Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (Νευροεκφυλιστικές και άλλες νευρολογικές νόσοι στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό – συχνότητες και παράγοντες κινδύνου)] και κινήθηκε σε δύο παράλληλους σχεδιασμούς:1.Συγχρονική μελέτη (cross-sectional), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση του επιπολασμού συγκεκριμένων ειδών ΥΓΕ και της σχέσης τους με ποικίλους παράγοντες, μεταξύ των οποίων και τη διατροφή·2.Προοπτική μελέτη (prospective cohort), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση της επίδρασης της διατροφής στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ στο χρόνο.Τα παράπονα που σχετίζονται με ΥΓΕ αναδείχθηκαν με τη βοήθεια ενός δομημένου καταλόγου ερωτήσεων/θεμάτων για συζήτηση με το συμμετέχοντα. Η ΥΓΕ ταξινομήθηκε ανάλογα με το γνωστικό πεδίο στο οποίο ο συμμετέχων εντοπίζει προβλήματα, δηλαδή τη μνήμη, το λόγο, την οπτική-αντιληπτική και την επιτελική λειτουργία. Οι συμμετέχοντες θεωρήθηκαν θετικοί για ένα είδος ΥΓΕ σε περίπτωση τουλάχιστον μίας θετικής απάντησης στις ερωτήσεις του συγκεκριμένου γνωστικού πεδίου. Η συνολική βαθμολογία ΥΓΕ ορίστηκε ως ο αριθμός των αναφερόμενων γνωστικών πεδίων με ΥΓΕ και συνεπώς κυμαίνεται από 0 ως 4.Με βάση τα ευρήματα από το συγχρονικό σκέλος της μελέτης, η ΥΓΕ στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό ≥65 ετών είναι πολύ συχνή (84,6%) και εστιάζεται κυρίως στη μνήμη. Τα συμπτώματα άγχους και η ύπαρξη αγγειακού εγκεφαλικού κινδύνου σχετίζονται με αυξημένη πιθανότητα ΥΓΕ, ενώ προστατευτικό ρόλο φαίνεται να έχει η εκπαίδευση. Όσον αφορά τα είδη ΥΓΕ, σημειώνεται η επιβαρυντική δράση του γυναικείου φύλου, της γενετικής προδιάθεσης για γνωστική έκπτωση και της αυξημένης ενεργειακής πρόσληψης στην εμφάνιση υποκειμενικής έκπτωσης στη μνήμη. Η παρουσία συμπτωμάτων κατάθλιψης ή/και άγχους και η πρόοδος της ηλικίας συνδέονται επίσης με τα περισσότερα είδη ΥΓΕ.Αναλύοντας τα δεδομένα από την προοπτική παρακολούθηση του δείγματός μας, υπολογίσαμε ότι αρχική συμμόρφωση με το διατροφικό πρότυπο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας υψηλότερη κατά 10 μονάδες στην κλίμακα MDS (Mediterranean Diet Score) σχετίζεται με μείωση κατά 7% στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος, και ότι κάθε επιπλέον μερίδα λαχανικών καθημερινά σχετίζεται με περιορισμό κατά 2,2% της προόδου της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος. Τα αποτελέσματά μας ενισχύουν την άποψη ότι η μεσογειακή δίαιτα δρα προστατευτικά έναντι ολόκληρου του συνεχούς της γνωστικής έκπτωσης, ξεκινώντας από τα πρώτα γνωστικά παράπονα. Η επιβεβαίωση των ευρημάτων αυτών και από άλλες μελέτες, ιδίως για συγκεκριμένες ομάδες τροφίμων, και η αποσαφήνιση των υποκείμενων μηχανισμών μπορεί να ενδυναμώσει το ρόλο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας ως εύκολα εφαρμόσιμης, χαμηλού κόστους και υψηλής αποτελεσματικότητας στρατηγικής πρόληψης που στοχεύει τους τροποποιήσιμους παράγοντες κινδύνου για γνωστική έκπτωση.",

Severe depression also occurs as a comorbid illness with other mental illnesses and usually gets a chronic course.The Report of the World Health Organization from 2015 can be concluded that the Republic of Northern Macedonia has not submitted data on the prevalence and incidence of Severe Depressive Disorder. The presented data on a global level indicate that in the world and in the Balkan 7.5 % of patients are treated in hospital.

No relevant data report the actual incidence of ototoxic problems, but more than 130 products have been classified as potentially dangerous. Individual susceptibility seems highly variable, but some predisposing factors have been identified: renal failure, age, combination of ototoxic drugs, familial sensitivity to ototoxic effects or previous neurosensorial deficit. We will first discuss the ototoxic medications that have certainly been extensively studied and among which we find several antibiotics (especially aminoglycosides and macrolides), the loop diuretics, and some antimalarial or chemotherapeutic agents. Environmental toxins and drug of abuse will then be discussed briefly because scientific data are much less significant. Early recognition of subjects who are at risk of developing ototoxicity, use of therapeutic monitoring and close observation of cochleovestibular functions in high risk situations (often not easy in critical patients) are the best way to prevent severe complications that have occasionally disastrous consequences on the quality of further life.",

      "title": "Clinical practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders in children and adolescents",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Dissociative or conversion disorders (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision [ICD-10]; hereafter referred to as dissociative disorders) are characterized by disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, sensations, and control of body movements. The symptoms of this disorder are not due to substance use and are not limited to pain or sexual symptoms, and the gain is primarily psychological and not monetary or legal. In these disorders, it is presumed that the ability to exercise a conscious and selective control over the symptoms is impaired, to a degree that can vary from day to day or even from hour to hour. However, it must be added that it is usually very difficult to assess the extent to which some of the loss of function might be under voluntary control. The diagnosis is made by the presence of specific clinical features, no evidence of a physical disorder that might explain the symptoms, and evidence for psychological causation in the form of clear association in time with stressful life events and problems or disturbed interpersonal relationships. Dissociative disorder can be of different types, as shown in Table 1.Table 1: International Classification of Disease-10 category of dissociative 10 categories of dissociative (conversion) disordersThese guidelines are an update to previous IPS guidelines on dissociative disorders (2008) in child or adolescent (hereafter child unless specified). These are broad guidelines which will help in systematic assessment and management of a child with dissociative disorder. ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS The assessment of dissociative disorders involves a detailed psychiatric and developmental history. An assessment should be made of the child's temperament, schooling, and peer relationships. The family functioning should be explored. A comprehensive medical, neurological, and mental status examination should be done. An assessment of psychosocial circumstances and problems should be done, especially to find which ones are temporally associated with the onset of dissociative symptoms. One should obtain psychiatric history from all the possible sources including the teachers, if possible. Furthermore, assessment should be made of the perception of the child and parents about the dissociative symptoms. An attempt should be made regarding the presence of physical and psychological symptoms in the other family members or the neighbors which may act as a model. The key points in the assessment of pediatric dissociative disorders are shown in Table 2.Table 2: Key points in the assessmentRULING-OUT PHYSICAL AND OTHER PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS As mentioned above, an initial comprehensive medical and neurological assessment is crucial in any child where a possibility of a dissociative disorder is being kept. In this regard, the treating psychiatrist should always consider seeking appropriate consultations. Relevant physical and psychological investigations must be done [Table 3]. An assessment of educational achievement of the child with regard to the child's potential and the level of education provided should be done, which is often indicated. The possibility of dissociative symptoms superimposed on neurological or medical disorders or other psychiatric disorders should always be carefully considered.Table 3: Investigations for ruling out physical or psychiatric disordersIf dissociative symptoms appear for the first time in a preschool child, a strong suspicion of an underlying physical or psychiatric disorder should be kept in mind because dissociative disorders are very rare in this age group. DIAGNOSIS OF DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER SHOULD NOT BE MERELY BASED ON THE ABSENCE OF OBJECTIVE SIGNS OF PHYSICAL DISORDER Although it is very important to exclude an underlying or associated physical disorder, as well as other primary psychiatric disorders that may explain the dissociative symptoms, the diagnosis of dissociative disorder should not be based merely on the absence of objective signs of a physical or psychiatric disorder. It is imperative to remember that the absence of physical findings applies universally to an earliest stage in the development of all diseases. Moreover, physical findings that appear nonrelevant at first may assume significance later. The diagnosis of dissociative disorder is not just of exclusion. The clinician should always keep in mind the overall biopsychosocial context of the child and the symptoms. When the diagnosis of a dissociative disorder is made with too much certainty without proper assessment, other physical or psychiatric disorders are often missed. When the diagnosis is too tentative, multiple and irrational medical evaluations may be conducted, and iatrogenic reinforcement of the symptoms and harm is possible. Pseudoseizures or nonepileptic seizures are a common presentation of dissociative disorders in children which must be differentiated from true epileptic seizures [Table 4].Table 4: Differences between dissociative convulsion and epileptic seizurePSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS OR STRESSORS Psychological distress overt or covert is an essential causative factor for dissociative disorders. A list of common stressors in pediatric dissociation is shown in Table 5. Stressors are not mutually exclusive.Table 5: Psychosocial factorsAttempts should be made to systematically identify the child's psychosocial environment, stressors, and coping abilities to handle stressful life situations. An attempt should also be made to find the secondary gains due to dissociative disorder. A view that stressors are \"unconscious\" creates a barrier in the physician's mind about looking for stressors. Studies in children with dissociative disorders have shown that stressors are generally present in day-to-day life of the patients and are known both to the patient and the family members. However, they may not reveal them for certain reasons. It is important for the clinician to evaluate the child for the stressors from a developmental perspective. It may not be possible to find stressor in the initial interviews. By repeated, careful and sensitive interviewing stressors can be elicited. Stressors in children and adolescents may include day-to-day problems such as difficulty in school or in family relationships, fights with other children, scolding and punishment by the teachers or family members, some frightening experiences, and educational difficulties. The child may find oneself in some kind of unwanted or disliked situation such as marriage, job or studies, bullying, and sometimes abuse and neglect. The stressor could also be an unaddressed physical illness or deformity. Assessing in detail about the onset of symptoms may give clue to the possible stressor, for example, becoming unconscious at school in English period. At times, stressors may not be severe enough to be noticed by the family members of the patient. Moreover, the family members may not be able to correlate the stressor with the onset of dissociative symptoms. In such cases, stressors should be assessed systematically, and the severity and temporal correlation of stressors with the onset of symptoms should be clearly delineated. One may use multiaxial ICD-10 Axis V for systematic assessment of stressors in children. The ICD-10 specifies that there should be convincing associations in time between the onset of symptoms of the disorder and \"stressful (life) events, problems, or needs.\" However, Indian studies point out that stressors are found in only 62%–82% of cases of dissociative disorder. Unless all the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of dissociative disorder including temporally related psychosocial stressors are met, a confident diagnosis should not be made. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND COMORBIDITIES Dissociative symptoms could be the presenting symptoms of underlying undetected psychiatric disorders such as separation anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, school phobia, depression, and at times, impending psychosis. Then, dissociative disorder may also have comorbid oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual disability, especially in boys. Therefore, it is important to screen for all age-appropriate psychiatric disorders in the child to avoid missing an underlying primary or a comorbid diagnosis. Dissociative disorders should be differentiated from factitious disorder and malingering. In latter two situations, the symptoms are intentionally produced to a assume sick role. The gain is psychological in factitious disorder. In factitious disorder by proxy, the parent (s) induce illness in the child for their own psychological gains. In malingering, the symptoms are feigned to obtain an incentive like money or some other material gain or to avoid a disliked responsibility or punishment. Apparent fabrication of symptoms or gross inconsistencies in history should raise possibility of malingering or factitious disorder. FALSE-POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS Rates of misdiagnosis are around 4%. False-positive diagnosis is likely if importance is given only to the symptoms and not to the underlying physical or psychiatric morbidity and psychosocial circumstances. One must assess the case with open mind. One should review the past medical records carefully, and if required, further assessments should be done. Some of the diagnostic difficulties are mentioned in Table 6.Table 6: Physical differential diagnosisIt is also likely that these false-positive diagnoses are made more often in females, psychiatrically disordered children, patients presenting plausible psychogenic explanations for their illnesses, and patients with unusual movement disorders or epilepsy. POSITIVE SIGNS Various \"positive signs\" of dissociative disorders have been described in the literature such as tunnel vision, discrete anesthetic patches, astasia-abasia, positive Hoover's test, preserved cough in hysterical aphonia, and hemianesthesia sharply separated at the midline. These signs indicate normally preserved physiological functions underlying the superficial appearance of incapacity. In addition to the above \"positive signs,\" hysterofrenic areas (areas on body, which when pressed, abort the hysterical episode, usually convulsive in nature) and hysterogenic areas (areas on body, e.g., a hyperesthetic spot, which when pressed can induce a hysterical episode) have also been mentioned. It must be kept in mind that dissociative disorders can be easily misdiagnosed or overdiagnosed if these \"positive signs\" are taken to be pathognomonic of the disorder. Studies indicate that these positive signs can also be seen in neurological patients. Gould et al. looked for the positive signs of hysteria in 30 consecutive neurological admissions (25 of which had acute strokes in adults). These \"signs\" were la belle indifference, nonanatomic sensory loss, midline split of pain or vibratory sensations, changing boundaries for hypoalgesia, giveaway weakness, and history of hypochondriasis. All 30 patients showed at least one out of seven \"signs,\" most exhibited more than one \"signs,\" and one patient had all seven \"signs.\" TREATMENT It is imperative to treat dissociative disorders promptly to prevent habituation and future disability. The longer the symptoms remain, the more aggressive the treatment should be. The treatment usually consists of two parts: (a) early treatment directed toward symptom removal and (b) long-term treatment directed toward the resolution of stressors and prevention of further episodes. Dissociative disorders are seen very less internationally. Therefore, there are no practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders. The proposed treatment guidelines are based mainly on Indian work in this area. Table 7 gives the key points of treatment.Table 7: TreatmentPRINCIPLES OF ACUTE MANAGEMENT Rapport and therapeutic alliance The cornerstone of successful therapy is establishment of therapeutic rapport and alliance with the child. It is also very important to have good doctor–parent relationship because the parents have to become an ally in treatment of the child. Parental influences on the child are significant even in the hospital setup. Unless the parents understand the clinician's point of view, it may not be possible to alter their overprotective and overindulgent attitude and behavior toward the child. One should listen to the concerns of the family carefully and try to understand their perception of the child's symptoms. PSYCHOSOCIAL EXPLANATION OF DISSOCIATIVE SYMPTOMS First of all, the diagnostic assessment must be done in an impressive manner, and the parents should be involved in the assessment process. It would be useful to explain to them why a particular assessment is being done and what the results are expected to show. When the results of this diagnostic assessment are obtained, their significance should also be explained to the parents. After reliably ruling out physical or other psychiatric illness as the cause of dissociative symptoms, the child and the family should be strongly assured that there is nothing physically seriously wrong with the child and the symptoms are psychogenic and that the child will make a complete recovery [Table 8]. When physical or psychiatric disorders are ruled out and the possibility of the dissociative symptoms being psychogenic is put forward, it is usually very vehemently rejected by the parents. That there could be anything psychologically wrong with their \"severely ill\" child, their parenting or with their family functioning, is totally unacceptable to the parents. Any suggestion of this possibility is met with resentment, anger, and sometimes open hostility. Therefore, any confrontation about the nature of the symptoms should be avoided at all costs, and all the members of the treating team should adopt the same nonconfrontational, calm approach toward the disorder the child and family. When the treatment team's point of view is understood and accepted by the family, only then it would be possible for them to cooperate in psychosocial assessments.Table 8: Key points in psychoeducationADDRESSING THE PSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS Once the causes are known, then attempts should be made to solve the \"problem.\" The problem should be discussed with the child and the family. In case of adolescents, if the problem has been revealed to doctor or the ward staff in confidence, then consent of the adolescent should be taken to discuss it with the family. The physician should not force his opinion on the child or the family. Problems of family relationships should be discussed, and family should be told that the child is being adversely affected by the family problems and their resolution will improve the child. At times, family therapy may be required. It is also important to open up the channels of communication between the child and his family. Throughout the treatment, attention should be focused on the child and his functioning rather than on the symptoms. This helps in speedy recovery. In most of the patients, reassurance and suggestions of recovery coupled with attention to the patient's psychosocial needs lead to a rapid recovery [Table 9].Table 9: Behavioral management of childrenSYMPTOM SUBSTITUTION As the dissociative symptoms begin to subside, the child may sometimes manifest other new dissociative symptoms in their place. Occasionally, distress may be expressed by deliberate self-harm, demanding, and histrionic behavior or the child may develop depressive symptoms. In such a situation, consistent limit setting may be essential for continuation of psychological treatment. Regularity of follow-up visits is important so that the patient does not need to \"produce\" a symptom to visit the therapist. Finally, the physician should not feel pressurized to cure the child very quickly. He should retain his calm and be prepared to face the hostility and aggression of the family and coercion for not using medication and quickly improving the child. SECONDARY GAINS Reduction in secondary gains is not advisable very early in the treatment and without adequate explanations to the family because of three reasons.First, the physician himself may not be certain about the origin of the symptoms. Second, the family may perceive reduction in secondary gain as neglect of the child. Furthermore, initially, the family may not have full confidence in the physician and the hospital's ability to take total care of their child. Later on, the family should be offered adequate explanations regarding secondary gains. Reduction in secondary gains in a child should be coupled with an alternative, healthy, socially acceptable, and age-appropriate role or activities for the child in which he or she can be trained and rewarded for doing something positive. ABREACTION AND AVERSION THERAPY Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior has often been employed in resistant cases, for example, using liquor ammonia, aversive faradic stimulation, pressure over trochlear notch, tragus of ear or over the sternum, and closing the nose and mouth. Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior is not advised as it may harm the patient and has a pejorative connotation equivalent to punishment. It may provide only temporary benefits, if any. Abreaction is bringing to conscious awareness, thoughts, affects, and memories for the first time, with or without the use of drugs. This may be achieved by hypnosis, free association, or drugs. Abreaction may further foster dissociative states. Moreover, some patients treated with this technique may perceive the therapist as sanctioning the dissociative states; hence, it is not recommended. MEDICATION Medication may be used only for concomitant anxiety, depression, or behavioral problems and not for the dissociative symptoms. The family should be tactfully made to understand that medications are neither required nor approved for dissociative symptoms. Otherwise, the family may perceive that doctor is unable to diagnose the child's problem and treat it. The use of medication will unnecessary expose the child to the side effects. In addition, the family may not give enough attention to psychological treatment thinking that medication will cure the dissociative symptoms. However, at times, there are families who persistently demand medication despite repeated explanations. In such situations, one may consider using a placebo to retain the child in treatment and overcome resentment or hostility of the family. NEED FOR HOSPITALIZATION Hospitalization is required when there is doubt in the diagnosis, severe symptoms are present, the family is very distressed, or the symptoms are recalcitrant and resistant to outpatient treatment. DUAL DIAGNOSIS If the dissociative symptoms are present with the physical disorder, then the physical disorder should be treated first. When the physical disorder is stabilized, then the dissociative symptoms if still present should be managed as per the guidelines. TREATMENT OF CHRONIC DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER Chronic cases are more difficult to treat, and the management should always begin with a rational comprehensive evaluation and clear explanation to the child and the family about the findings. Psychoeducation of the family about the nature of the disorder and its course and outcome is necessary. Similar things should also be explained to the child taking into account his ability to understand and accept the information. The family should be explained that although the symptoms are real and impairing, a serious physical disorder is not causing them and there is hope of full recovery. Psychotherapy may be useful but contraindicated in a patient who is resistant to it or gets worse when it is initiated. COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY Family-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps the affected child to become aware of, examine, and if appropriate revise the way they think, respond, and behave rationally to their symptoms. The aim of CBT is to maximize functioning and reduce the dissociative symptoms. Gradually, onus of treatment should be shifted from the physician to the child and the family. The following are the principles of CBT in chronic dissociative states: Give positive explanations for symptoms Persuade the child that change is possible, he or she is not \"damaged,\" and they do have the potential to recover Discuss the treatment rationale with the patient and the key family members Encourage engagement in daily routine activities Teach relaxation and distraction away from unpleasant thoughts and the symptoms Encourage the patient to rationally reconsider unhelpful and negative thoughts Negotiate a phased return to work and studies Joint activities with family in symptom-free periods. Evidence exists at systematic review level that CBT is effective for a wide range of functional somatic symptoms. Its use has also been described (although not properly tested) in patients with nonepileptic attacks, dissociative motor symptoms, and severe and multiple functional symptoms.

These various levels of functioning cannot be separated from the environment. Socioenvironmental stressors, defined by Mechanic [4] as a discrepancy between demands presented to a person and his or her capacity to deal with them, influence the appearance of impairments, disabilities, and handicaps. Wing [5] lists three factors that can cause and exacerbate social disablement in cases of frequent relapse or chronic impairment: environmental overstimulation or understimulation, social disadvantage, and adverse personal reactions (secondary disablement) caused by acceptance by the handicapped person of limitations that are not actually necessary. It is clear that assessment and evaluation of impairments are important in avoiding understimulation and overstimulation and preventing or correcting adverse personal reactions. Although premorbid and environmental factors play an important role, we can expect the more severely impaired also to be the more severely disabled.

D’abord, les diagnostics syndromiques sont modifiés. La définition de l’épisode dépressif caractérisé est simplifiée avec la suppression du critère d’exclusion lié au deuil. Ce choix, qui a pour but de mieux prendre en charge les dépressions post-deuil, a fait l’objet de nombreuses discussions et controverses. La définition de l’épisode maniaque ou hypomaniaque est également modifiée avec l’adjonction du symptôme modification de l’activité et de l’énergie [1]. Et les épisodes mixtes sont supprimés des diagnostics syndromiques et ré-intégrés comme caractéristiques spécifiques des troubles dépressifs ou bipolaires. Ce choix est secondaire aux excès antérieurs de diagnostics d’épisodes mixtes. Pour les chapitres troubles dépressifs [1] et troubles bipolaires [1], de nouvelles caractéristiques spécifiques apparaissent : les caractéristiques mixtes [1] (définies pour les épisodes dépressifs majeurs par la présence de 3 symptômes maniaques), les symptômes anxieux [1], et les caractéristiques spécifiques de risque suicidaire. Par ailleurs, de nouvelles entités sont introduites dans le chapitre troubles dépressifs [1]. Il s’agit du trouble dysphorique pré-menstruel, qui figurait auparavant dans l’appendice, et d’un nouveau trouble de l’enfant, le disruptive mood dysregulation disorder [1]. Enfin, dans le chapitre entités nécessitant de nouvelles études [1], apparaissent Ies épisodes dépressifs avec hypomanie de courte durée, le deuil pathologique complexe et persistant et les comportements suicidaires pathologiques. Ces différentes modifications devraient permettre, via leur remboursement, une meilleure prise en charge, aux États-Unis, du deuil pathologique, du risque suicidaire et du syndrome pré-menstruel pathologique.",

Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency.

      "abstract": "Hyperprolactinemia is a common endocrinological disorder that may be caused by several physiological and pathological conditions. Several drugs may determine a significant increase in prolactin serum concentration that is frequently associated with symptoms. The so-called typical antipsychotics are frequently responsible for drug-related hyperprolactinemia. Risperidone is one of the atypical neuroleptics most likely to induce hyperprolactinemia, while other atypical drugs are unfrequenlty and only transiently associated with increase of prolactin levels. Women are more sensitive than men to the hyperprolactinemic effect of antipsychotics. Classical and risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia may be revert when a gradual antipsychotic drug discontinuation is combined with olanzapine or clozapine initiation. Antidepressant drugs with serotoninergic activity, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO-I) and some tricyclics, can cause hyperprolactinemia. A long list of other compounds may determine an increase in prolactin levels, including prokinetics, opiates, estrogens, anti-androgens, anti-hypertensive drugs, H2-receptor antagonists, anti-convulsivants and cholinomimetics. Finally, hyperprolactinemia has also been documented during conditioning and after autologous blood stem-cell transplantation and during chemotherapy, even though disturbances of prolactin seem to occur less frequently than impairments of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad/thyroid axis after intensive treatment and blood marrow transplantation.",

      "abstract": "Taking opiates for medical purposes without supervision of healthcare professionals and non-medical purposes can cause different consequences such as delirium or even injury, and may cause addiction over a longer period of time. The most common recreational opium is heroin, while opium is rarely used. Opiate groups include opium, morphine, heroin, methadone and codeine. Addiction is manifested through physical and psychological dependence. Physical or biological dependence refers to the change in the biological state of the organism, while psychic addiction implies the forced necessity of entering the substance into the organism in order to restore good mood and to avoid the suffering of certain substances. Addiction leads to acute intoxication characterized by euphoria, facial redness, pruritus, impaired breathing depth, hypotension and bradycardia. Apart from the symptoms of acute intoxication, the use of opiates can lead to serious and even lethal consequences such as neurological diseases, hepatitis, HIV and AIDS. Treatment of opiate dependence implies treatment with naloxone and clinical treatment. Very important for the treatment of overexpression is to determine tolerance to opiates to determine the required dose of the drug. In the Republic of Croatia, the legal framework for the fight against drug abuse is based on the Criminal Code and the Law on Combating Drug Abuse, while at the European Union level the National Strategy for the Suppression of Drug Abuse in the Republic of Croatia was adopted. This research was carried out in order to determine the existence of differences in urban and rural addicts with regard to social demographic characteristics.Research has shown that addicts in urban areas are equally to addicts in rural areas by the time of arrival to the drogs band that addicts in urban and rural areas relatively early start with addiction treatment.

      "abstract": "The three types of pain related to exercise are 1) pain experienced during or immediately following exercise, 2) delayed onset muscle soreness, and 3) pain induced by muscle cramps. Each is characterized by a different time course and different etiology. Pain perceived during exercise is considered to result from a combination of factors including acids, ions, proteins, and hormones. Although it is commonly believed that lactic acid is responsible for this pain, evidence suggests that it is not the only factor. However, no single factor has ever been identified. Delayed onset muscle soreness develops 24-48 hours after strenuous exercise biased toward eccentric (muscle lengthening) muscle actions or strenuous endurance events like a marathon. Soreness is accompanied by a prolonged strength loss, a reduced range of motion, and elevated levels of creatine kinase in the blood. These are taken as indirect indicators of muscle damage, and biopsy analysis has documented damage to the contractile elements. The exact cause of the soreness response is not known but thought to involve an inflammatory reaction to the damage. Muscle cramps are sudden, intense, electrically active contractions elicited by motor neuron hyperexcitability. Although it is commonly assumed that cramps during exercise are the result of fluid electrolyte imbalance induced by sweating, two studies have not supported this. Moreover, participants in occupations that require chronic use of a muscle but do not elicit profuse sweating, such as musicians, often experience cramps.

Secondary causes of insomnia include:lULglLIg depression and anxietyl/LIglLIg conditions causing nocturnal pain or breathlessnessl/LIglLIg side-effects of medications and substance abusel/LIglLIg less common but usually obvious medical conditions, such as hyperthyroidisml/LIglLIg frank sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnoea and restless legs syndrome (RLS). The main symptom of insomnia is insufficient sleep to carry out the full range of daily functions. The patient who sleeps for only 5 hours a night, but is not sleepy during the day, is a 'short sleeper' and not an insomniac. Primary insomniacs have a good response to hypnotics, but feel out of control if they use them continuously. Two components are involved in maintaining the insomnia - a psychological anxiety and a physiological response to this anxiety, including raised muscle tone and respiratory rate. A behavioural regimen based on a cognitive-behavioural approach designed to improve sleep quality gradually over a period of 4 - 6 weeks is often helpful. A hypnotic can be prescribed for use every third night during this regimen - zolpidem and zopiclone are preferred. Referral to a sleep specialist may be necessary if this approach does not work.",

Certains d’entre eux comme les apnées du sommeil peuvent engendrer des syndromes tels la dépression, la fatigue, l’impuissance ou des déclins cognitifs allant jusqu’à la démence ou en constituer des facteurs de résistance au traitement ; de la même façon, le dépistage du syndrome des mouvements périodiques des membres inférieurs au cours du sommeil souvent associé au syndrome des jambes sans repos pendant l’éveil, peut permettre une meilleure approche de certaines formes de fatigue chronique, de dépression, de syndromes de glissement. D’autres perturbations au cours du sommeil constituent les symptômes clefs d’un syndrome psychiatrique comme par exemple l’hypersomnie dans la dépression saisonnière ou la dépression atypique. Enfin, certains troubles du sommeil chroniques telle l’insomnie au cours de la troisième décennie de la vie sont souvent les signes précurseurs d’une dépression qui surviendra vingt ans plus tard comme s’il existait un facteur commun à l’origine des deux entités pathologiques. De la même manière, une période d’insomnie même brève s’avère un prédicteur d’une rechute maniaque ou d’un épisode psychotique aigu. Apprendre à les reconnaître, les évaluer, s’en servir comme guides cliniques s’avère essentiel dans la prise en charge des patients de notre spécialité : dans quels cas faut-il systématiquement ou éventuellement demander un enregistrement polygraphique de sommeil ? Existent-t-ils et quelle est la valeur des outils diagnostiques moins contraignants comme par exemple l’agenda de sommeil, l’actimétrie ? Comment prendre en charge une insomnie dans un cadre psychiatrique ? Quel est le « bon usage » des hypnotiques ?

      "abstract": "Since the majority of patients with psychiatric disorders do not commit or even attempt suicide, it seems that while psychiatric disorder may be a necessary risk factor for suicide, it is not sufficient in itself. One of the most urgent issues for clinical research in the area of suicide is to determine what factors, in addition to and beyond psychiatric disorders, predispose a person to suicide. Three areas of research : Post-mortem psychological studies of adolescents from eighteen to twenty-one years of age who committed suicide while performing their military service in the Israeli army. Clinical work with suicidal adolescents in a full-time hospital ward for adolescents. Work in the emergency room of a large general hospital during an epidemiological study of conducts associated with suicide. Our hypothesis is that three groups of personality types form the basis for the tendency toward suicide : (1) personalities that are narcissistic, perfectionist, unable to tolerate failure and imperfection ; (2) those characterized by impulsiveness and aggression associated with extreme sensitivity to minor life events ; (3) those characterized by underlying depression, usually the consequence of a psychical affliction, such as mood disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia or mental anorexia. These results seem to reinforce the conclusions that we presented in earlier papers (Apter et al., 1995). We think that suicidal conduct in depressed adolescents differs from that of borderline adolescents. The well-known relationship between impulsiveness, aggression and suicidal tendencies (Apter et al., 1993) may indeed be linked to borderline state and conduct disorders (Apter et al., 1995). This has important consequences for research on adolescent suicide in general, since additional results regarding associated trauma, sexual abuse, family break-up, and drug use may also be linked to specific types of suicide. We can no longer view suicidal conduct as a homogenous set of conducts. Although the non-nosiographical approach developed by Van Praag et al. (1987) has been a very fruitful one, diagnosis and personality differences may play a role in the understanding of suicide.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Delusional parasitosis (DP), also know as Ekbom syndrome and in some cases as Morgellons, was first described in the late 17th century in France. It is an obsessive phobic state in which the patient believes that the is infested by parasites. In the hallucinatory state, they frequently remove parts of the skin, identifying them as parasites. The cause of DP is unknown. Evidence supporting the dopamine theory defend that the inhibition of dopamine reuptake (for example cocaine and amphetamines) induce symptoms such as formication. Objectives Through the description of the following clinical case, we emphasize its clinical features and complexities. Methods Review of DP in light of a clinical case Results A 48-year-old woman was brought to the psychiatric emergency due to psychotic symptoms following cocaine use. She had a history of drug abuse. She was apparently asymptomatic until October 2019, when, in the background of vague sensation of something crawling under his skin, she developed a sudden onset belief that she had been infested by insects that crawled under his skin. Previous medical observation found no reason for a skin infection or infestation. Skin examination revealed itch marks and skin excoriations in the abdomen. Mental status examination revealed anxious and depressive affect, delusion of parasitosis, tactile hallucination and impaired insight. Routine hemogram and urinalysis was unremarkable, except for the detection of cocaine. Conclusions Delusional parasitosis often presents to nonpsychiatric medical professionals. An awareness of such ilness, with an early recognition and timely referral are management cornerstones in order to successfully diagnose and treat patients. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

Minor adverse sedation-related events may present inconvenience or transient discomfort to the patient and, if recognized and supported in a timely manner by the sedationist, will not usually result in physiologic or psychological harm to the patient. Postprocedure vomiting, transient hypoxemia, mild hypotension, emergence reactions, and prolonged recovery times are examples of minor events. The relative likelihood of events of this type (1 of every 200 sedation episodes) provides significant impetus for effective preparation and training for sedationists to effectively respond to or preempt them. These “minor” events can still progress to more significant harm.",

BDD patients have a distorted body image, which may be associated with bullying or abuse during childhood or adolescence. Such patients have a poor quality of life, are socially isolated, depressed, and at high risk of committing suicide. They often have needless dermatological treatment and cosmetic surgery. The condition is easily trivialised and stigmatised.

      "title": "Transient epileptic amnesia",
      "abstract": "Transient epileptic amnesia is an adult onset form of temporal epilepsy which is characterised by recurrent acute seizure-induced amnesia often accompanied by ongoing memory disturbances of autobiographical, topographical amnesia and accelerated long-term forgetting. The first case report of transient epileptic amnesia was described more than a hundred years ago. However, more extensively investigations of this type of epilepsy were started not long ago. In 1998 diagnostic criteria were formulated: 1) history of recurrent witnessed episodes of transient amnesia; 2) cognitive functions other than memory are judged to be intact during typical episodes by a reliable witness; 3) evidence for a diagnosis of epilepsy, provided by one or more of the following: (a) wake or sleep electroencephalography; (b) the co-occurrence of other seizure types (if their roughly concurrent onset and/or close association with episodes of transient amnesia suggested a connection); (c) a clear-cut response to anticonvulsant therapy. From case reports that are analysed in literature it is not difficult to summarise clinical characteristics: transient epileptic amnesia usually starts later in life, more often in men than in women; amnestic episodes are brief, recurrent and often occur upon waking; memory loss is usually mixed type with anterograde and retrograde amnesia; in 65% of patients amnesia is associated with gustatory or olfactory hallucinations, déjà vu, a brief period of unresponsiveness, automatisms; epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalography were seen in 43% cases; although transient epileptic amnesia has an excellent response rate to anticonvulsant therapy, between episodes patients still suffer from accelerated long-term forgetting, remote memory impairment and topographical amnesia. Differential diagnostic of transient epileptic amnesia is diverse and diagnosis is usually inaccurate and overdue. Treatment with monotherapy often helps totally prevent recurrence of attacks. In the paper we review two case reports of patients with transient epileptic amnesia.",

Nevertheless, the historical accounts of the properties of marijuana have provided an impetus for modern investigations on the effects and potential therapeutic uses of marijuana, its constituents, and their analogs. A seizure is a paroxysmal event that consists of a transient distortion of normal electrical activity in the brain and some alteration of normal motor, sensory, autonomic, or psychic function. Convulsions subsequent to cannabinoid administration have been reported to occur under certain conditions in \"normal\" animals, genetically seizure-susceptible animals, and experimentally seizure-susceptible animals. Convulsions subsequent to relatively low-dose administration of cannabinoids can occur in animals rendered seizure susceptible by some experimental techniques.

      "abstract": "Lanjut usia (lansia) adalah bagian dari proses tumbuh kembang manusia. Manusia tidak secara tiba tiba menjadi tua, tetapi berkembang dari bayi, anak-anak, dewasa dan akhirnya menjadi tua. Masa tua merupakan masa hidup manusia yang terakhir atau periode penutup dalam rentang hidup seseorang, masa ini di mulai usia enam puluh sampai meninggal yang di tandai dengan adanya perubahan fisik, psikologis, sosial dan spiritual yang semakin menurun. Penyakit yang sering dijumpai pada lansia adalah hipertensi berdampak pada jantung dan stroke. Pengobatan hipertensi berlangsung seumur hidup sehingga harus dikombinasikan dengan pengobatan non farmakologis yaitu relaksasi napas dalam.  Proses menua akan terjadi perubahan-perubahan baik anatomis, biologis, fisiologis maupun psikologis. Gejala-gejala kemunduran fisik antara lain kulit mulai mengendur, timbul keriput, mulai beruban, pendengaran dan penglihatan berkurang, mudah lelah, gerakan mulai lamban dan kurang lincah masalah tersebut akan berpotensi pada masalah kesehatan baik secara umum maupun kesehatan jiwa adalah satu kesehatan jiwa yang terganggu adalah mengalami kecemasan. Rasa cemas ini merupakan keadaan mental yang tidak enak berkenaan dengan sakit yang mengancam atau yang dibayangkan, ditandai oleh kekawatiran, ketidakenakan dan perasa tidak baik yang tidak dapat dihindari, disertai perasaan tidak berdaya karena merasa menemui jalan buntu dan kemampuan untuk menemukan pemecahan masalah terhadap masalah yang diahadapi. Tujuan relaksasi nafas dalam adalah mencapai keadaan relaksasi menyeluruh, mencakup keadaan relaksasi secara fisiologis, secara kognitif, dan secara behavioral. Secara fisiologis, keadaan relaksasi ditandai dengan penurunan kadar epinefrin dan non epinefrin dalam darah, penurunan frekuensi denyut jantung (sampai mencapai 24 kali per menit), penurunan tekanan darah, penurunan frekuensi nafas (sampai 4-6 kali per menit), penurunan ketegangan otot, metabolisme menurun, vasodilatasi dan peningkatan temperature pada extermitas. Kata Kunci : Cemas, Lansia, Hipertensi, Relaksasi Nafas Dalam ABSRACT Elderly (elderly) is part of the human development process. Humans do not suddenly get old, but develop from babies, children, adults and eventually become old. Old age is the last period of human life or the closing period in a person's life span, this period from the age of sixty to death which is marked by decreasing physical, psychological, social and spiritual changes. A disease that is often found in the elderly is hypertension which affects the heart and stroke. Hypertension treatment lasts a lifetime so it must be combined with non-pharmacological treatment, namely deep breath relaxation. The aging process will result in anatomical, biological, physiological and psychological changes. Symptoms of physical deterioration include sagging skin, wrinkles, graying, reduced hearing and vision, fatigue, slow movement and less agility.These problems will potentially lead to health problems both in general and mental health is a disturbed mental health. is experiencing anxiety. This anxiety is an uncomfortable mental state with regard to threatening or imagined pain, characterized by unavoidable worry, displeasure and bad feelings, accompanied by feelings of helplessness due to feeling stuck and the ability to find solutions to problems. faced. The goal of deep breath relaxation is to achieve a state of complete relaxation, including a physiological, cognitive, and behavioral state of relaxation. Physiologically, a state of relaxation is characterized by decreased levels of epinephrine and non-epinephrine in the blood, decreased heart rate (up to 24 times per minute), decreased blood pressure, decreased breathing frequency (up to 4-6 times per minute), decreased muscle tension, decreased metabolism, vasodilation and increased temperature at extermitas.

      "title": "Epilepsy and Psychosis",
      "abstract": "Psychosis is a significant comorbidity for a subset of patients with epilepsy, and may appear in various contexts. Psychosis may be chronic or episodic. Chronic Interictal Psychosis (CIP) occurs in 2-10% of patients with epilepsy. CIP has been associated most strongly with temporal lobe epilepsy. Episodic psychoses in epilepsy may be classified by their temporal relationship to seizures. Ictal psychosis refers to psychosis that occurs as a symptom of seizure activity, and can be seen in some cases of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. The nature of the psychotic symptoms generally depends on the localization of the seizure activity. Postictal Psychosis (PIP) may occur after a cluster of complex partial or generalized seizures, and typically appears after a lucid interval of up to 72 hours following the immediate postictal state. Interictal psychotic episodes (in which there is no definite temporal relationship with seizures) may be precipitated by the use of certain anticonvulsant drugs, particularly vigabatrin, zonisamide, topiramate, and levetiracetam, and is linked in some cases to “forced normalization” of the EEG or cessation of seizures, a phenomenon known as alternate psychosis. Seizures and psychosis may also co-occur secondary to another neurologic disorder, such as a traumatic brain injury, brain tumor, or limbic encephalitis. When a patient with epilepsy develops psychosis, the clinician should attempt to determine the cause, as treatment approach may vary. In this article, we review the various forms of epilepsy-related psychosis and discuss a rational approach to the evaluation and management of patients with epilepsy and psychosis.",

Multiple studies have reported drug-induced RLS caused by antipsychotics, antidepressants and antiepileptic medications. Risk factors for drug-induced RLS include older age, gastrointestinal diseases, high medication dose, simultaneous use of ≥2 drugs. The mechanism of drug-induced RLS is most often associated with the effect of medications on various receptors and neurotransmitter systems, in particular, the dopamine system. Drug-induced RLS treatment includes identification and withdrawal of a drug that caused RLS or a decrease in its dosage. Prevention of drug-induced RLS is based on compliance with the principles of rational pharmacotherapy.Синдром беспокойных ног (СБН) — сенсомоторное расстройство, которое характеризуется движением ног во время периодов отдыха или бездействия, облегчается при движении и наиболее ярко проявляется вечером или ночью.

      "title": "Beyond Dopamine: The 'Other' Effects of Antipsychotics: Antipsychotics Exert Anti-Immuno-Inflammatory, Antioxidative, and Neuroplasticity Effects",
      "abstract": "Ask any psychiatrist how antipsychotics (APs) work and the overwhelming response will be blocking dopamine receptors. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] This mechanism of action (MOA) has been elevated to dogma because no agent has been approved for treating psychosis that does not exert a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist effect. However, as advances in the neurobiology of psychosis accelerate, several other functions of APs have been identified, which can be considered additional MOM that may help mitigate psychosis' deleterious effect on brain tissue. Consider the following beneficial effects of APs (especially second-generation APs [SGAs]) of which many clinicians are unaware: APs suppress induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. (1) It is well established that psychotic episodes of schizophrenia are associated with neuroinflammation and elevations of cytokines such as interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-[alpha]), and interferon gamma (IFN-[gamma]). These inflammatory biomarkers are released by microglia, which are rapidly activated by psychosis (2) and mediate brain tissue damage during psychosis. APs' rapid inhibitory action on pro-inflammatory cytokines obviously is neuroprotective. APs suppress immune-inflammatory pathways. (3) This occurs with atypical agents but not haloperidol (4) and results in decreased IL-1 [beta] and IL-6 and transforming growth factor-[beta]. APs significantly decrease levels of neurotoxic tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATS) such as 3-OHK and QUIN, which mediate the immune-inflammatory effects on neuronal activity. APs also increase levels of neuroprotective TRYCATS such as kynurenic acid. (5) APs activate cholesterol-transport proteins such as apolipoprotein E (APOE). (6) This implies that APs may improve low levels of APOE observed during psychosis and decrease myelination abnormalities and mitigate impairment of synaptic plasticity. (7), (8) APs increase neurotrophic growth factors that plummet during psychosis, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor. (9) This beneficial effect is seen with SGAs but not first-generation APs (FGAs) and is attributed to strong serotonin 5HT-2A receptor antagonism by SGAs. (10) SGAs but not FGAs significantly increase the number of newly divided cells in the subventricular zone by 200% to 300%. This enhancement of neurogenesis and increased production of progenitor cells that differentiate into neurons and glia may help regenerate brain tissue lost during psychotic episodes. Various SGAs have neuroprotective effects: * Clozapine has neuroprotective effects against liposaccharide-induced neurodegeneration and reduces microglial activation by limiting production of reactive oxygen species (free radicals). (11) * Aripiprazole inhibits glutamate-induced neurotoxicity and, in contrast to haloperidol, increases BDNF, glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-1[beta], and the anti-apoptotic protein Bc1-2. * Olanzapine increases BDNF, GSK-3[beta], and [beta]-catenin, increases mitosis in neuronal cell culture, and protects against neuronal death in cell cultures that lack nutrients (which fluphenazine or risperidone do not). * Paliperidone demonstrates a higher antioxidant effect than any other SGA and clearly is better than haloperidol, olanzapine, or risperidone in preventing neuronal death when exposed to hydrogen peroxide. * Quetiapine, ziprasidone, and lurasidone have inhibitory effects on nitric oxide release. Quetiapine, but not ziprasidone, inhibits TNF-[alpha]. * Ziprasidone inhibits apoptosis and microglial activation and synthesis of nitric oxide and other free radicals. * Lurasidone increases BDNF expression in the prefrontal cortex of rodents. (13) Although most clinicians uphold the dopamine neurotransmitter model of schizophrenia (ie, a hyperdopaminergic state that requires treatment with dopamine antagonists), research is moving toward a multi-faceted neurotoxicity and neuroprogression model of impaired neuroplasticity, neuroinflammation, immune dysfunction, oxidative stress, nitrosative stress, apoptosis, and mitochondria' dysfunction. …",

      "title": "Afraid to Leave Home",
      "abstract": "Clozapine alleviates Mr. B's schizophrenia symptoms, but he develops anxieties that leave him virtually homebound. Is antipsychotic to blame? CASE Disabling anxiety Mr. B, age 35, has a history of schizophrenia, chronic paranoid type and has been hospitalized more than 12 times since its onset 10 years ago. He received clozapine during his most recent hospitalization approximately 5 years ago and experienced full symptom response without motor side effects he developed in response to other medications. He visits a psychiatrist monthly for medications and supportive psychotherapy, and he receives intensive case management and housing from a community mental health center. When Mr. B is assigned to my (CK) care, his psychotic symptoms are in remission, but he complains of anxiety that leaves him almost homebound. He has intense fear of bridges, upper-floor windows, express buses, subways, riding in speeding vehicles, and having a seizure. If Mr. B faces any of these triggers, he experiences harmful thoughts--such as jumping out a window or off a bridge--even though he does not endorse suicidality. These thoughts are intrusive, ego-dystonic, and ruminative. He avoids these triggers at all costs, which compromises his housing and employment opportunities. He experienced a single panic attack in subway 1 year earlier. Mr. B firmly believes that any intense anxiety he experiences will trigger a psychotic episode. When faced with sudden urges, he believes his illness would interfere with his ability to his impulses. He reports that these symptoms started when he began clozapine and have worsened. Mr. B says he experiences a feeling of approximately 2 hours after taking clozapine that is exacerbated if he faces a trigger. He describes uneasiness as the feeling of being about to have a seizure during which he would lose control of his body. When I begin treating Mr. B, he is receiving clozapine, 125 mg bid. In an effort to combat Mr. B's anxiety, a previous psychiatrist had titrated clonazepam up to 5 mg/d as needed. Mr. B is compliant with his medications and appointments but refuses to change his psychotropic or psychotherapy regimen. The authors'observations Approximately 50% of patients with schizophrenia have at least 1 anxiety disorder, and close to 30% meet criteria for >1 anxiety disorder. (1) Social anxiety disorder (SAD), generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have been found comorbid with schizophrenia, with rates as high as 30% for each. (1) Possible causes of unusually high rates of anxiety disorders in schizophrenia include trauma history, delusional conviction and inflexibility of abstract thought, (2) and passive coping mechanisms. Schizophrenic illnesses may be linked to anxiety antecedents such as panic or social phobia that: * develop into more profound psychopathology * or bring about anxiety symptoms, given severity of subjective psychotic experience. In a twin pairs study, schizophrenic twin had an almost threefold increase in rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders compared with their non-schizophrenic twins; social or environmental factors may not account for this. (3) Comorbid OCD, panic disorder, and SAD frequently persist after remission of psychotic symptoms. Comorbid anxiety disorders may play a role in psychotic symptoms themselves (such as panic and social anxiety related to paranoia, OCD, and bizarre behavior) and negatively impact quality of life. (4) In patients with schizophrenia, higher anxiety levels are associated with: * increased hallucinations * poor psychosocial function * hopelessness. (5) Accurately assessing and diagnosing anxiety disorders in patients with schizophrenia is challenging because there is inconsistency among clinical interviewers (poor reliability scores), and anxiety scales are not as accurate as we would like them to be (poor construct validity). …",

      "title": "#3095 Rapid anti-obsessive treatments of obsessive-compulsive disorder: reviewing effects of ketamine in OCD",
      "abstract": "Objectives/Aims Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a common neuropsychiatric condition characterised by persistent endogenous repetitive and intrusive anxiogenic thoughts, feelings, or images often followed by anxiolytic mental or physical actions. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are the mainstay of OCD treatment, used both as first line (SSRIs) and second line (Clomipramine) approaches. Despite their effectiveness in treatment of OCD, their anti-obsessive effects only start at eight to 12 weeks into treatment (Pittenger &amp; Bloch, 2014), leaving an effectiveness time gap between diagnosis and treatment. Various treatment strategies have been tried but there is no consensus on the most effective approach. A single pharmacological agent with rapid anti-obsessive action would be an ideal candidate to manage this treatment gap. One such agent may be ketamine with its novel mechanism of action. Ketamine is assumed to increase neuroplasticity by synthesising neurotrophins in the cortex and has demonstrated to have rapid-onset anti-depressant effects (Bjrkholm &amp; Monteggia, 2016). We reviewed the state of evidence for similar rapidly emerging anti- obsessive effects and report our findings here. Methods Embase, MEDLINE(R), and PsycINFO were searched to identify studies investigating rapid anti-obsessive effects of ketamine in humans, available in English. ClinicalTrials.org was further searched for grey literature. Other reviews were excluded. Results 181 studies were identified after deduplication of which nine studies met inclusion criteria. Eight studies revealed rapid anti-obsessive effects, five of which display statistical significance. Combined, OCD scores decline by approximately 49.7% during the first hour following intravenous ketamine administration. Furthermore, a significant reduction of depressive symptoms and suicidality were reported in studies further investigating comorbid depression. Contrary to depression scores, anti-obsessive effects were not sustained. OCD scores increased within three hours post-administration and reversed back to baseline within seven days. One trial reported an extended length and margin of effect when combined with cognitive behavioural therapy. All studies were of small scale as the literature search primarily yielded pilot trials and case reports, suggesting statistical imprecision and reflecting the topics novelty. Conclusions Our review points out the presence of preliminary research evidence to support the presence of anti-obsessive effects of ketamine and a potential for its usefulness as a rapidly acting intervention for OCD, thereby plugging an important gap in clinical management of OCD. However, as such effects are unsustained, their potential to complement existing pharmacological strategies may be limited. Greater awareness and randomised controlled trials are required before recommending the use of ketamine in OCD treatment. References Bjrkholm C, Monteggia LM.

The first is that in which signs and symptoms in somatic organs are seen to accompany specific mental disease, such as dementia precox. This relationship is well known and accepted. An illustration is the depressed phase of manic depressive psychosis which is frequently accompanied by periodic tachycardia, amenorrhea or loss of weight. The second aspect of psychosomatic medicine suggests that specific somatic diseases are influenced by mental states. Thus, peptic ulcer is aggravated when the patient is distressed or under tension and apt to be improved during periods of physical and emotional relaxation. The third consideration is the one that is least established, but nevertheless the most discussed recently. This maintains that repeated emotional or psychologic stress may actually produce certain somatic diseases, such as asthma, essential hypertension or eczematoid dermatitis. The present discussion will concern itself with only the",

      "abstract": "Abstract Addiction occurs when repeated use of drugs changes how a person’s brain functions over time. The transition from voluntary to compulsive drug use reflects changes in the brain’s natural inhibition and reward centers that keep a person from exerting control over the impulse to use drugs even when there are negative consequences—the defining characteristic of addiction. Many adolescent risk factors, including genetic vulnerability, prenatal exposure to alcohol or other drugs, lack of parental supervision or monitoring, a history of physical and/or sexual abuse, and an association with drug-using peers are risk factors that contribute to a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with a substance use disorder. On average, adolescents tend to show a reduction in use following treatment, but post-treatment course is variable. Aftercare helps to maintain treatment gains, and more than one episode of treatment may be needed for some adolescents with more severe substance involvement.",

Conversely, a relatively rapid process of adaptation may suppress the manifestations of motion sickness. In addition, there are other ways of weakening or preventing the response. Thus, the effect of motion is minimized by assuming a supine position, which greatly reduces the stimulation of the utriculus. Further, the reduction of psychological, visual, visceral or other facilitating influences may lower the incidence of motion sickness. Finally, there are certain drugs which are preventive.

      "title": "Manic-switch induced by fluvoxamine in abstinent pure methamphetamine abusers.",
      "abstract": "On a global level, methamphetamine (MAP) is typically abused in combination with other drugs of addiction. However, in Japan, many MAP abusers use the drug alone.1 The depressive state caused by MAP, generally seen during the withdrawal period, generally disappears within several days.2,3 However, in cases where the depressive symptoms persist, treatment with antidepressants, including the tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may be necessary. Antidepressants can elicit manic or hypomanic episodes in patients with unipolar depression,4 but to our knowledge, there are no reports of this with respect to stimulants users. We describe 2 abstinent MAP patients (neither abused other drugs) who developed mania after taking fluvoxamine for persistent depressive symptoms.\r\n\r\nMs. A, a 23-year-old married woman, started abusing MAP by intravenous injection twice a week or more at age 16. There was no significant premorbid depression before MAP use began or genetic vulnerability to depression. She married at age 20, but did not stop using MAP. She stopped taking MAP at age 23 when her family noticed her abuse, but then began to develop MAP abstinence symptoms, such as depressive moods and insomnia. \r\n\r\nShe was admitted to our hospital 21 days after the last use of MAP. MAP was not detected in the urine. The woman complained of severe depressive mood, insomnia, inertia and loss of appetite. We prescribed fluvoxamine (150 mg/d) and brotizolam as needed (0.5 mg/d). Thirteen days after treatment was initiated, she began to show a manic state with elevated mood, talkativeness and increased activity. Because these symptoms lasted for 10 days, we discontinued fluvoxamine treatment, and her manic symptoms readily dissipated. The patient became euthymic and was discharged from the hospital 3 months after admission.\r\n\r\nMs. B, a 22-year-old single woman with no premorbid depression before using MAP or genetic vulnerability to depression, started abusing MAP at age 17, and abused MAP once or twice a week for 4 years. She stopped taking MAP at age 21 when her family noticed her abuse. She began to exhibit MAP abstinence symptoms (i.e., low mood, listlessness and insomnia) and was admitted to our hospital 23 days after she last used MAP. MAP was not detected in her urine. We started to treat her symptoms with fluvoxamine (100 mg/d) and brotizolam as needed (0.5 mg/d). Her depressive symptoms disappeared in several days, but 2 weeks after treatment with fluvoxamine was instituted, she became manic, exhibiting talkativeness and aggressiveness with grandiose ideation. When fluvoxamine was discontinued, her manic state subsided within several days. The woman was discharged from the hospital 3 months after admission.\r\n\r\nSome studies suggest that one of the acute abstinent symptoms after MAP abuse is a depressive state.2,3 Generally, the depressive state peaks 48–72 hours after the last dose and resolves completely within a week.2 Thus, our cases where the depressive state persisted for 3 weeks or longer are considered unusual. Indeed, in our hospital in the last 5 years, we have seen only 5 cases where MAP-induced depressive symptoms persisted. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an antidepressant causing a manic switch in abstinent MAP abusers with depressive symptoms. \r\n\r\nWe cannot explain this phenomenon at present. The induction of mania or hypomania by SSRIs such as fluvoxamine may depend on the dose used.4 However, in our cases, manic switch occurred using standard dosages. Studies in laboratory animals indicate that repeated MAP administration can produce long-lasting depletion of brain serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA).5 Therefore, it is possible that the sudden increase in serotonin levels produced by fluvoxamine's blockade of the serotonin transporter may induce the manic switch in these patients.6 Given the well-described 5-HT/DA interactions in the brain, the SSRI-induced mania may also involve DA. This explanation is highly speculative however, and it is not known whether manic switch in MAP users with depression is specific to SSRIs such as fluvoxamine or not.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Serotonin toxicity, often referred to as ‘serotonin syndrome,’ is a drug-induced condition due to excess serotonin released from brain synapses, resulting in symptoms that may be autonomic, neuromuscular, and/or cognitive in nature. Most cases involve more than 1 of the following drug regimens: monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), serotonin releasers, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). This report is of a 70-year-old woman who presented with confusion and muscle spasms due to serotonin toxicity associated with paroxetine and quetiapine treatment. CASE REPORT:An elderly woman with dementia presented to the Emergency Department with fever, altered mental status, labile blood pressures, and inducible clonus. No known medication dosage increases had been made, nor had any new serotonergic agents been added to the patient’s drug regimen. She underwent a thorough workup in the Emergency Department and later during her hospitalization. A presumptive diagnosis of serotonin toxicity was made early on during her stay, with the etiology attributed to use of paroxetine and quetiapine. Clinical improvement was observed after benzodiazepine administration, discontinuation of offending agents, and a brief cyproheptadine course. The patient survived her hospital stay and was ultimately discharged to hospice care with a return to her baseline level of functioning. CONCLUSIONS:Diagnosing serotonin toxicity requires a high degree of clinical suspicion and can occur in the absence of increased dosage of existing, or initiation of new, serotonergic agents.",

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an intense and disabling response to a traumatic event. Acute PTSD occurs 1 to <3 months following the event, whereas chronic PTSD persists for 3 months or longer. The symptoms fall primarily into three clusters. The first includes reexperiencing the event. This reaction manifests clinically as distressing memories, nightmares, or the more extreme \"flashbacks\" to the event itself. During reexposure (either from internal cues such as reexperiencing in the mind, or external, such as visiting the scene of the accident), the person suffers from intense anxiety and distress. The second cluster can, to some extent, be seen as a reaction to the first. This response is characterized by avoidance of reexposure to the trauma and numbing to the psychological responses the exposure creates, including a more generalized emotional numbing. The third symptom cluster involves a constant hyperalert state. The person may have difficulty falling or staying asleep, may have an increased startle response, may have more trouble concentrating, and may be more generally irritable or angry.Approximately 70% of children have had exposure to a traumatic event before age 16 years; however, despite the large amount of exposure, the 6-month prevalence of PTSD in these patients is ∼3.7% for boys and 6.3% for girls. Protective factors against PTSD include, in descending order of importance, connections to positive caretakers, feelings of self-worth, feelings of hope, importance to others, talents valued by others, religious faith, and socioeconomic advantage.Specific risk factors for developing PTSD also exist. These factors primarily fall into four categories, the first of which includes lack of resilience or negative prior life experiences, which would include a history of other traumatic exposures, preexisting psychological problems, and substance abuse. The second main risk factor is the type of traumatic event. Nearly 100% of children who see a parent being killed or sexually assaulted acquire PTSD. This observation is important because it appears that in children, threat to a parent is equivalent to threat to self. Additionally, PTSD develops in 90% of sexually abused children, 77% of children who see a school shooting, and 35% who witness violence around their home.The effects of exposure to trauma through media are less clear. Many researchers have found that children resonate with media via reexposure if they were personally affected by the original trauma, but not if the trauma was more distant.A third area of risk concerns the child's reaction to the trauma. Dissociation, a psychological mechanism whereby a person attempts to protect him- or herself by separating from reality, was found to be strongly predictive of posttraumatic symptoms. Finally, the resources available to a child after a traumatic exposure can be critical. The most important of these is an attentive parent or guardian; thus, attending to parents' mental health can actually be the most effective intervention in aiding the child's recovery.Screening for and identifying PTSD can be difficult. Standardized assessments, such as the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory (see Suggested Reading) can be useful to evaluate exposure. Even after exposure is assessed, diagnosing PTSD itself can be complex, and may best be left to a child mental health provider. If a referral seems difficult, scheduling frequent appointments (monthly) to address any continued disability from the reaction to a trauma can be helpful.Treatment for PTSD is complicated and multifactorial. Regarding medications, there is some evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have some utility. In adults, these agents have been shown to reduce symptoms in all three of the symptom clusters described previously, but in children, only two small studies (24 and 26 children, respectively) support their effectiveness. Additionally, SSRIs can lead to activation (irritability, poor attention, and sleep disturbance), which can mimic the hyperarousal cluster of PTSD symptoms.In two child-specific studies, clonidine was found to decrease basal heart rate, anxiety, impulsivity, and PTSD hyperarousal. Propranolol also was found to decrease reexperiencing and hyperarousal. Opiates may be beneficial, but should be used with caution. Even controlling for subjective pain, one study found that there was a significant linear association between morphine dosage and 6-month reduction in PTSD symptoms. Neuroleptic agents, such as risperidone, have shown mixed results. Benzodiazepines have not been found to be beneficial in treating PTSD-specific symptoms, and may worsen some symptoms characterized primarily by disinhibition (aggression, acting out).In children, the strongest empiricalevidence to date supports Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT). In fact, a study comparing TF-CBT and placebo to TF-CBT and an SSRI showed no significant differences in response rates. TF-CBT begins with the child directly discussing the traumatic event, and then proceeds to anxiety-management techniques, such as relaxation and correction of distorted trauma-related thoughts. Through this procedure, the children learn that they do not have to be afraid of their memories. CBT often is accompanied by psychological education and parental involvement. Research shows that the better parents cope with the trauma and the more they support their children, the better their children will function. Therefore, it is important for parents to seek treatment for themselves so as to develop the necessary coping skills that will help their children.Comments: After September 11th and, more recently, the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, there has been more focused national and international attention on PTSD in children and adolescents. These experiences provide important examples of how communitywide interventions are essential and needed; however, Dr Kelly's In Brief reminded me of how important this topic is to patients whom I serve. I have worked most of my career with low-income patients who live in an urban area and I have been continually inspired by the resilience of these families. This In Brief reminded me of the heightened risk of these children and adolescents to PTSD because of their chance of witnessing or being involved with traumatic events, such as homicide, domestic violence, child abuse, house fires, or even dog attacks. I worry that parents may minimize some of these experiences because, unfortunately, they occur more frequently in urban communities. It is important that parents know that we as pediatric health-care providers have an interest in these experiences and to ensure that diagnosis and treatment is initiated.",

The EEG revealed severe pathological patterns which disappeared after discontinuation of clozapin and could be reproduced as a function of clozapin medication. Other major tranquilizers had no particular effects. This study demonstrates how we determined whether clozapin or other major tranquilizers had seizure-promoting effects in a particular patient.",

      "abstract": "Acute intermittent porphyria mimics a variety of commonly occurring disorders and thus poses a diagnostic quagmire. Psychiatric manifestations include hysteria, anxiety, depression, phobias, psychosis, organic disorders, agitation, delirium, and altered consciousness ranging from somnolence to coma. Some patients develop psychosis similar to schizophrenia. Psychiatric hospitals have a disproportionate number of patients with this disorder as only difficult and resistant patients accumulate there. Presence of photosensitive porphyrins in the urine is diagnostic. When porphyrins are absent, excess of alpha aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen are present in the urine. The definitive test is to measure monopyrrole porphobilinogen deaminase in RBCs. This diagnosis should be entertained in the following situations: (a) unexplained leukocytosis; (b) unexplained neuropathy; (c) etiologically obscure neurosis or psychosis; (d) 'idiopathic' seizure disorder; (e) unexplained abdominal pain; (f) conversion hysteria, and (g) susceptibility to stress. Porphyria is important in psychiatry as it may present with only psychiatric symptoms; it may masquerade as a psychosis and the patient may be treated as a schizophrenic person for years; the only manifestation may be histrionic personality disorder which may not receive much attention. Diagnosis is based on a high index of suspicion and appropriate investigation. Various psychotropic drugs exacerbate acute attacks. While it is important not to use the unsafe drugs in porphyric patients, it is also imperative to look for this diagnosis in cases where these drugs produce unprecedented drug reactions.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive speed, inhibitory function, and memory decline with age while crystallised, particularly verbal, abilities remain largely intact. Poor health, fewer years of education, lower activity, the presence of the APOE E4 allele, and high BP appear to predict faster cognitive decline. Dementia is diagnosed in the presence of objective cognitive impairment, both long- and short-term memory, plus at least one additional (cortical) cognitive deficit, such as dysphasia, dyspraxia, agnosia, or disturbance in executive functioning. In addition, patients have to show significant impairment in social or occupational functioning and a significant decline from previous levels. Both smoking and diabetes increase the risk of all types of dementia, not smoking or even stopping smoking reduces this risk, but better control of type 2 diabetes does not appear to have a measurable effect. Drinking small to moderate amounts of alcohol appears to confer some benefit in ameliorating cognitive decline. There is some evidence that HRT, DHEA, BP lowering in patients without prior cerebrovascular disease, statins, vitamin B6 and procaine are NOT helpful. There is insufficient evidence to establish or refute a beneficial effect for exercise, treatment of type 2 diabetes, omega-3 fatty acids, folic acid with/without vitamin B12, antioxidant vitamins, or ginkgo biloba. Depressive symptoms are more prevalent than dementia. Clinical (major) depression can present with cognitive deterioration, often associated with subjective complaints. Patients with subjective or objective memory impairment, but without functional deterioration, can be referred to the local memory clinic, while demented patients eligible for acetylcholinesterase inhibitor treatment, patients whose diagnosis is unclear and who may need some specific investigations, as well as patients who may benefit from a combined approach with psychotropic drugs and behavioural support should be referred to the local mental health team.",

      "abstract": "EDITOR: Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants retain a vital place in anaesthetic practice. The number of available muscle relaxants has increased in recent years. All of these drugs vary in speed of onset, duration of action and in speed of offset. The manufacturers produce guidance for the use of these drugs in the form of data sheets. These may give recommendations for initial dose, speed of onset and duration of action. Clinical practice is however, likely to vary considerably with the manufacturer's guidance for the following reasons: 1. Variable individual response to muscle relaxants. Marked variation has been shown between healthy individuals for the same dose of muscle relaxant [1] 2. Renal function. Impaired renal function may prolong the duration of action. 3. Liver disease or reduced hepatic blood flow. These may prolong the duration of action. 4. Electrolyte disturbances. These may prolong the duration of action. 5. Other drugs. Aminoglycosides prolong the duration of action, other drugs may also affect the duration of action. 6. Obesity. Dose requirements are affected with variation between the different muscle relaxants. Knowledge about the state of neuromuscular blockade is important from induction through to recovery. Inadequate neuromuscular blockade during the procedure may make surgery difficult, and has the potential to be extremely dangerous to the patient. At the end of the procedure there is the potential for an awake patient with residual paralysis or for recurarization during the recovery period. Residual neuromuscular blockade may increase the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications [2]. The peripheral nerve stimulator is not the perfect monitor; it measures neuromuscular function in the periphery, which is more sensitive to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants than is diaphragmatic muscle [3]. It may give an inaccurate test due to poor electrical contact or incorrect placement. At present, it is the most common monitor of neuromuscular function. This is due to its simplicity, ease of use, portability and cost. We have undertaken a survey to establish current practice in respect of PNS usage at five hospitals. We aimed to assess use and availability of the PNS. We also wanted to identify the factors which influence PNS usage, such as duration of anaesthesia and the muscle relaxant used. A questionnaire was sent to all grades of anaesthetist at five hospitals. Three teaching hospitals and two district general hospitals. The questionnaire asked a number of questions about PNS usage. One hundred questionnaires were returned with a response rate of 57%, of these, replies were from consultants (48%), from training grades (48%) and from other grades (4%). Question 1: Is there a place for using a peripheral nerve stimulator while using a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant in your practice? Yes 89% No 11% Question 2: If a PNS is available in the theatre, how often do you use it? Never 8% Sometimes 74% Always 17% Question 3: Will you use a peripheral nerve stimulator if the duration of operation is less than 20 min, 20-40 min, 40-60 min and over 60 min? (Table 1)Table 1: Use of PNS with duration of operation Question 4: How often is a peripheral nerve stimulator available? (Table 2)Table 2: Availability of PNS in theatre (%) Question 5: How often do you use a peripheral nerve stimulator with different muscle relaxants? (Table 3)Table 3: Use of PNS with particular relaxants as percentage The response rate of 57% was disappointing but did show some marked differences. The large majority of anaesthetists (89%) in our survey have a need for a peripheral nerve stimulator in their practice. Most use it for selected cases, with a small group using it for all cases in whom a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant is used (17%). This survey found that a factor affecting usage was the duration of anaesthesia with the number of anaesthetists always using a PNS rising from 11% for operations of 20-40 min duration to 21% always using a PNS for operations of 40-60 min. This may reflect the fact that an induction dose of muscle relaxant will often last between 20 and 40 min, but repeat doses are likely if the duration exceeds 40 min. There appeared to be a relation between the choice of muscle relaxant and the duration of drug action, with the least use for the short-acting mivacurium and most use for the long-acting pancuronium. It was interesting to find no increase in PNS use for the newer agents. This may reflect their predictability, although there are reports of recurarization with rocuronium [4]. It is of concern that in some hospitals there are insufficient nerve stimulators. The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland recommends that a means of assessing neuromuscular block should be available whenever neuromuscular blocking drugs are used [5]. In the case of one teaching hospital, 40% of respondents reported that peripheral nerve stimulators were 'rarely available' or 'never available'. While their use is not mandatory they should be readily available in every theatre complex. The results of this survey were presented to this hospital and have resulted in the provision of four extra peripheral nerve stimulators for the theatre complex. The use of the PNS helps with anaesthetic training and with the introduction of new or modified muscle relaxants but above all it may improve anaesthetic standards by preventing over- or under-curarization.

      "abstract": "A broader palette of safe and better-tolerated agents is available for treating people suffering from chronic schizophrenia, depressive disorders, anxiety disorder, autism spectrum disorders. However, current medical treatments are still only partially effective, and highly-prevalent psychiatric disorders continue to represent a huge personal and socio-economic burden. Most pharmacological agents sometimes induce a variety of severe movement disorders, including dystonia or dyskinesia, with an acute, subacute or more chronic time course. More extensive cerebral condition, such as the neuroleptic malignant syndrome or the serotonin syndrome may be induced by antipsychotics or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Medications commonly involve dopamine receptor blockers, antidepressants and anti-epileptics, among many others. Mechanisms underlying drug-induced movement disorders involve blockade, facilitation or imbalance of dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline and cholinergic neurotransmission in the basal ganglia [1]. The traditional and atypical neuroleptics sometimes induce dystonic reactions, akathisia, parkinsonism, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome, tremor, hyperkinesia and movement disorders [1]. A better understanding of the impact of these drug-induced adverse effects may provide new strategies to develop novel neuroleptics with less adverse metabolic effects and to develop complementary medical therapies to patients treated with antipsychotic medication [2]. The lack of success in discovering more effective pharmacotherapy has contributed, together with many other factors, to a relative few useful findings on new drug targets for neuropsychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome (SS) is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with increased serotonergic activity in the central nervous system. SS is characterized by a triad of altered mental status, autonomic dysfunction, and neuromuscular abnormalities [Boyer and Shannon, 2005]. The syndrome is, for some authors, a loose term to define the clinical picture at the moderate to severe end of a spectrum of serotonin toxicity, mild symptoms of which include tremor, hyperreflexia, and occasional myoclonus [Gillman and Whyte, 2004]. In the severe forms of toxicity, generalized myoclonus, sustained ankle clonus, and hyperreflexia may occur along with hyperthermia, which is associated with increased mortality [Gillman, 2013]. SS is classically associated with the high doses of a single selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use, or with a combination of two or more serotonergic agents [Mason et al. 2000].\r\n\r\nFluoxetine is metabolized in the liver by the isoenzymes of the cytochrome P450 system, including CYP2D6 [Blazquez et al. 2012]. The role of CYP2D6 in the metabolism of fluoxetine may be clinically important, as there is a great genetic variability in the function of this enzyme [Gaedigk, 2013].\r\n\r\nAripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic, which is a partial agonist at the 5-HT1A receptors, is equally metabolized via both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 isoenzymes [Molden et al. 2006]. Therefore, coadministration with fluoxetine (a potent inhibitor of CYP450 2D6) may significantly increase the plasma concentrations of aripiprazole. On the other hand, aripiprazole has no known effect on fluoxetine metabolism [Boulton et al. 2010].\r\n\r\nHere, we describe a case in which increased plasma concentration of aripiprazole due to a drug interaction with fluoxetine led to SS.",

      "title": "Effective Management of Ketamine-Induced Bladder Syndrome With Baclofen During Ketamine Detoxification: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Aims: Ketamine, a dissociative anaesthetic, is used therapeutically to treat mental health disorders like depression, anxiety, and PTSD. However, its recreational misuse can lead to severe physical and psychological consequences. A concerning long-term effect of ketamine misuse is ketamine-induced bladder syndrome (KIBS), which presents with symptoms such as urinary urgency, frequency, and pain. As dependence on ketamine develops, the severity of KIBS increases, potentially leading to significant organ damage. In such cases, ketamine detoxification becomes essential for reducing or eliminating ketamine from the system while managing withdrawal symptoms and psychological distress. While no FDA-approved medication exists for ketamine detoxification, treatment generally focuses on addressing withdrawal symptoms, psychological and physical dependence, and related complications. Methods: This case involves a 23-year-old woman with a complex mental health history, including ADHD, Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), anxiety, and previous self-harm attempts, well-documented by community mental health services. Her substance use began at age 18, starting with ketamine use during university. Over time, her ketamine consumption escalated from 0.5 grams every few months to 3.5–5 grams, causing both physical and psychological harm. Her usage pattern varied; sometimes she refrained from use for a day or two, but often she would use it continuously for 3 to 4 days, followed by a break. At times, she alternated days of use, with usage depending on her mood, occasionally taking the entire dose at once. Approximately four years after initiating ketamine use, she developed significant bladder pain, frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and a constant urge to urinate. To manage these symptoms, she began using pregabalin, initially obtained illegally but later prescribed at a dosage of up to 600 mg daily by her GP. Despite this, her bladder pain remained inadequately controlled, and she resorted to using paracetamol and co-codamol, which proved ineffective. She also visited a urologist biweekly. She underwent two private ketamine detoxifications in 2021, although relapse occurred a few days later. Considering her ketamine addiction and bladder pain, she underwent detoxification treatment. Managing her bladder pain was a key focus of her treatment. Diazepam was prescribed for anxiety, and in addition to pregabalin, baclofen was added to address the bladder pain. During detox, the patient reported significant improvement in bladder pain. Results: One of the most challenging aspects of ketamine-induced bladder syndrome is the chronic bladder pain. Baclofen, a GABA-B receptor agonist, helped relax smooth muscles, including those in the bladder, reducing spasticity and discomfort. Baclofen also alleviated neuropathic pain, which contributed to ketamine-induced bladder dysfunction. Baclofen’s ability to manage neuropathic pain makes it a valuable option when traditional painkillers fail. By inhibiting pain signal transmission, baclofen provides relief from discomfort and reduces urinary urgency and frequency. In this case, baclofen effectively alleviated bladder pain, reducing reliance on pregabalin during detoxification. Despite the complexities of her treatment plan, baclofen was vital in improving the patient’s quality of life during detox. Conclusion: Baclofen proves to be an effective alternative for managing ketamine-induced bladder pain, particularly when traditional treatments fail. This case emphasizes the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to address both physical and psychological challenges during ketamine detoxification. By managing bladder pain and other withdrawal symptoms, patients can experience a sustainable detox process, ultimately improving their chances of recovery and decreasing the risk of relapse.",

      "abstract": "Addiction is a wide spread term used in our days. Some of the habits due to routine conditioning are called dependences, i.e.: eating shopping etc. These are fundamentally different of those due to chronic alcohol intake, drugs medicines (chemicals), with euphoric effect. For this reason some physicians prefer the term of addiction to drug. Unlike the benign addiction, by conditioning, drugs addiction initiates very fast (after 1 or 2 intakes), had a big resistance at treatment and show the phenomena of sever disturbance in withdrawal. In this paper we refer mainly at this kind of dependency. Nervous disturbances that are produced during drugs and even alcohol intakes refer to psychical affective and cognitive processes. The prevailing factor of these processes is the hedonist one.",

      "title": "Insomnia Caused by Medical Disorders",
      "abstract": "Virtually any medical condition can cause sleep disruption. The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur, and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease. There are multiple ways in which insomnia may be caused or aggravated by medical illness or bodily injury. Unpleasant stimuli can directly impede initiation of sleep, or they may cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Changes in basic systemic physiology (such as disorders of ventilation) may produce similar disruption in sleep continuity. There may be humoral changes that have direct neurochemical or neurophysiological effects, augmenting vigilance and lowering the threshold to arousal from sleep. The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to chronic psychophysiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and by altering circadian entrainment, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A hiccup is a sudden contraction of the inspiratory and diaphragmatic muscles followed by an abrupt closure of the glottis; that produces a characteristic noise resulting from vibrations of the vocal cords. Brief episodes of hiccups are common in humans at all stages of life and are usually benign. Prolonged attacks that last for days or weeks are considered a more serious phenomenon and may indicate an underlying disorder warranting a comprehensive medical evaluation. These attacks have been associated with significant burden and morbidity. The most common triggers for acute hiccups are linked with gastro-intestinal causes, such as the gastric distension that occurs after an abundant meal, or with gastroesophageal disease. Sudden changes in temperature, excessive alcohol consumption, as well as excitement or emotional stress, may also set off acute hiccups. Certain drugs, including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and many others, have been reported to induce hiccups. Drug-induced hiccups are diagnosed by exclusion of other causes and represent a very unusual side-effect of drugs like corticosteroids. We present a case of hiccups associated with intra-articular Diprospan (Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate) administration.",

      "abstract": "The state of sleep consists of different phases that proceed in successive, tightly regulated order through the night forming a physiological program, which for each individual is different but stabile from one night to another. Failure to accomplish this program results in feeling of unrefreshing sleep and tiredness in the morning. The program core is constructed by genetic factors but regulated by circadian rhythm and duration and intensity of day time brain activity. Many environmental factors modulate sleep, including stress, health status and ingestion of vigilance-affecting nutrients or medicines (e.g. caffeine). Acute sleep loss results in compromised cognitive performance, memory deficits, depressive mood and involuntary sleep episodes during the day. Moreover, prolonged sleep curtailment has many adverse health effects, as evidenced by both epidemiological and experimental studies. These effects include increased risk for depression, type II diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular diseases. In addition to voluntary restriction of sleep, shift work, irregular working hours, jet lag and stress are important factors that induce curtailed or bad quality sleep and/or insomnia. This review covers the current theories on the function of normal sleep and describes current knowledge on the physiologic effects of sleep loss. It provides insights into the basic mechanisms of the regulation of wakefulness and sleep creating a theoretical background for understanding different disturbances of sleep.",

On the other hand, epilepsy can be the cause of an additional disorder or the consequence of another health problem. Sometimes, epileptic seizures are the first sign of another condition or disease. This chapter will first focus on health problems that can be caused by epilepsy. The second part of the chapter describes other disorders or conditions that can cause epileptic seizures and epilepsy. When a medical disorder causes epileptic seizures, doctors do not always make a diagnosis of epilepsy. If people have seizures that were clearly provoked by another disorder (for instance, a low sodium level caused by diuretic medication—water tablets), treatment should involve the removal of the underlying cause of the seizures and not antiepileptic drugs. However, other medical conditions associated with epilepsy may not always be cured as easily, and people’s quality of life may then be affected by two chronic disorders.",

Parapsychological (psi) research also indicates that when individuals are exposed to techniques to alter the state of consciousness such as sensory homogenization, meditation, hypnosis, and psychedelic drugs, they exhibit stronger evidence of psi functioning than when they are in ordinary waking consciousness, particularly if they are prone to having spontaneous alterations of consciousness and/or have had a mental practice for a long time.

      "abstract": "ISOLATED ADRENOCORTICOTROPIC HORMONE (ACTH) deficiency is a rare pituitary disorder characterized by decreased secretion of ACTH, but not of the other hormones of the anterior pituitary and causes secondary adrenal insufficiency.1 Since isolated ACTH deficiency gradually and latently develops and shows non-specific symptoms, it is easily misdiagnosed. We report a case of middle-aged-onset isolated ACTH deficiency that showed a severe major depressive episode. A 62-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to suicidal behavior. He did not have any previous history of neuropsychiatric or endocrine disorders. From 6 months before the admission, he complained of mild general fatigue, depressed mood, loss of pleasure, psychomotor retardation, insomnia, decrease in appetite, and weight loss. He was diagnosed as having major depressive disorder. A dose of 100 mg/day of sertraline did not relieve him of his depressive symptoms at all. At the time of admission, he was fully conscious and showed a severe major depressive episode with suicidal ideas. He did not show any symptoms suggestive of atypical depression or chronic fatigue syndrome, such as hypersomnia, lead paralysis, mood reactivity, rejection sensitivity, muscle pain, lymph node swelling, and fever. Magnetic resonance imaging of his brain did not show any structural abnormality, including an empty sella. Blood test revealed anemia (red blood cell count, 3.24 × 106/µL; hemoglobin, 10.0 mg/dL) and hyponatremia (117 mEq/L). Thyroid function studies were consistent with hypothyroidism: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 49.8 µIU/mL (normal range, 0.6–5.1); fT3, 2.45 pg/mL (2.47–4.34); and fT4, 0.71 ng/dL (0.97–1.79). Rheumatoid factor and antinuclear, antithyroglobulin, anti-thyroid peroxidase, TSH-receptor, and antipituitary antibodies were negative. Both serum ACTH (<2.0 pg/mL; normal range, 7.2–63.3) and cortisol (0.2 µg; 3.7–19.4) were extremely low, whereas aldosterone (61.6 pg/mL; 38.9–307.0) was within normal range. Neither ACTH nor cortisol responded to corticotrophin-releasing hormone stimulation test, showing that he suffered from secondary adrenocortical insufficiency. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone test, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone test, and growth hormone-releasing hormone test showed normal responses, revealing that his secondary adrenocortical insufficiency was caused by isolated ACTH insufficiency. We discontinued sertraline and started to administer him 5 mg/day of hydrocortisone. Three days later, his symptoms mimicking major depressive episode were dramatically resolved. As in our case, isolated ACTH deficiency may be comorbid with primary hypothyroidism although the mechanism of the coexistence is unknown.2 However, the comorbid hypothyroidism did not seem to induce his depressive state as hypothyroidism was recovered 4 months after rapid relief of his psychiatric state. Relationships between glucocorticoid function and symptoms mimicking major depressive episodes are complex but might reflect insufficient glucocorticoid signaling. Some major depressive episodes might be associated with the insufficient glucocorticoid signaling by decrease of glucocorticoid production or decrease of sensitivity of glucocorticoid receptors.3 Our case suggests that isolated ACTH deficiency should be added into a differential diagnostic list of major depressive disorder. The patient gave the authors informed consent to publish this letter.",

Ms A, a 40-year-old married woman, had a 20-year history of recurrent MDD (DSM-IV). Her first episode began when she was 20 years old. Seven years ago, her depressive symptoms began to appear slowly, characterized by depressed mood, irritability, diminished interest in her usual activities, loss of appetite, weight loss, lack of energy, poor concentration, insomnia, and recurrent thoughts of death, such as “It would be nice not being alive.” These symptoms led to impaired work and social functioning. Her mother had a history of chronic depressive mood disorder.\r\n\r\nMs A also had a 26-year history of PCOS, characterized by oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, hirsutism, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries, confirmed by several laboratory tests and ultrasound, meeting the 2003 Rotterdam, or European Society for Human Reproduction/American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ESHRE/ASRM), criteria.1 Twenty years ago, her gynecologist suggested lifestyle changes such as exercises, nutritional guidance, low doses of oral contraceptive pills, cosmetic therapy, and laser therapy for hirsutism. With the use of oral contraceptive pills, Ms A experienced an improvement in her menstrual cycles, although she continued to have mood swings, irritability, and severe headaches, which were extremely distressing. She was switched to several oral contraceptive pills, but all showed severe side effects. She discontinued all oral contraceptive pills after a few months of use.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Ms A presented for treatment of MDD. Escitalopram—a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, not an oral contraceptive pill—was administered at 5 mg/d, with the dosage reaching 20 mg/d in 3 weeks. After 4 weeks of treatment, Ms A experienced clinically significant depressive symptomatic relief. Remission was achieved in 8 weeks. Over the next 18 months, she continued to receive escitalopram and experienced a return of regular menstrual cycles and improvement in hirsutism. She reported transient mild nausea at the beginning of treatment; no other side effects were reported.\r\n\r\nRemarkably, 2 months after antidepressant discontinuation, she started experiencing menstrual irregularity and hair growth. Ten months later, MDD recurred. During the next 4 years, she was on treatment with escitalopram at 20 mg/d and remained symptom-free. Meanwhile, she achieved notable menstrual cycle improvement and reduction in hirsutism. As Ms A was feeling well, she stopped taking the medication on her own and her menstrual complaints immediately recurred. She restarted escitalopram in 4 months, and her PCOS symptoms remitted again. This was the longest regular menstrual cycle period she had ever had with no use of oral contraceptive pills. Last year, her ultrasounds continued to show polycystic ovaries.\r\n\r\nReports have revealed that hyperandrogenism, hormonal disturbances, obesity, ovarian dysfunction, hypothalamic pituitary abnormalities, and insulin resistance are implicated in the etiology of PCOS.2,3 Hormonal dysregulation is involved with both MDD and PCOS. As mood disorders and PCOS share some level of genetic and pathophysiologic mechanisms,4,5 the intervention on common metabolic changes can treat both conditions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract There are reports that abrupt withdrawal of various selective serotonin re‐uptake inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine, can elicit in patients various withdrawal symptoms. Fluvoxamine has been widely used in Japan for ~1 year. However, there have been no case reports of withdrawal symptoms following abrupt fluvoxamine discontinuation in Japan. The author reports a case where the abrupt discontinuation of fluvoxamine produced restlessness in a depressed patient. The restlessness disappeared soon after the reinstatement of treatment with fluvoxamine. This case report suggests that clinicians should carefully scrutinize a patient's compliance to fluvoxamine as the withdrawal symptoms observed following abrupt discontinuation might be regarded as a relapse of depression or side‐effects of the medicine.",

There are many physiological changes in sleep such as fall in blood pressure, decrease in heart rate, reduction in pH of the blood, reduction in urine secretion, decrease in metabolic rate, slow and regular breathing, muscular relaxation and the disappearance of deep reflex actions, but almost any of these physiological changes may be absent in a sleep which is normal in all other respects. It is therefore more accurate to refer to the physiological accompaniments than to the physiology of sleep (Gillespie, 1929).",

      "abstract": "Although bipolar affective disorder is defined by the history of manic or hypomanic episodes, depression is arguably a more important facet of the illness. Depressive episodes, on average, are more numerous and last longer than manic or hypomanic episodes, and most suicides occur during these periods. Misdiagnosis of major depressive disorder delays initiation of appropriate therapy, further worsening prognosis. Distinguishing features of bipolar depression include earlier age of onset, a family history of bipolar disorder, presence of psychotic or reverse neurovegetative features, and antidepressant-induced switching. Bipolar I depressions should initially be treated with a mood stabilizer (carbamazapine, divalproex, lamotrigine, lithium, or an atypical antipsychotic); antidepressant monotherapy is contraindicated. More severe or \"breakthrough\" episodes often require a concomitant antidepressant, such as bupropion or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). The first treatment specifically approved for bipolar depression is a combination of the SSRI fluoxetine and the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine. For refractory depressive episodes, venlafaxine, the monoamine oxidase inhibitor tranylcypromine, and ECT are most widely recommended. The optimal duration of maintenance antidepressant therapy has not been established empirically and, until better evidence-based guidelines are established, should be determined on a case-by-case basis.",

Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug in the United States; almost 44 million Americans report using in the past month. People who use cannabis may experience relaxation, euphoria, and mild hallucinogenic effects. Some may experience nausea and vomiting after use. Synthetic cannabinoids have been associated with more serious complications. Cessation after regular use may result in drug craving, insomnia, anorexia, and restlessness. Metabolites of THC can be detected in the urine up to a month after last use; some medications can cause false-positive tests. Serious medical complications of cannabis use are uncommon; the most concerning are neuropsychological problems among adolescent users and acute cognitive and motor impairment. Synthetic cannabinoid use is associated with significant neuropsychological effects. Psychosocial modalities appear to help those who wish to stop or cut down on use. There are no medications approved for the treatment of cannabis use disorder or cannabis withdrawal.",

Cocaine addiction is a significant worldwide public health problem, which has somatic, psychological, psychiatric, socio-economic and judicial complications. Some of the most frequent complications are cardiovascular effects (acute coronary syndrome, cardiac arrhythmias, increased blood pressure); respiratory effects (fibrosis, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, alveolar haemorrhage, asthma exacerbation; emphysema), neurological effects (strokes, aneurysms, seizures, headaches); risk for contracting HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B and C, sexual transmitted disease and otolaryngologic effects. Other complications are not discussed here. The vast majority of studies indicate that there are cognitive deficits induced by cocaine addiction. Attention, visual and working memories, executive functioning are affected in cocaine users. Psychiatric complications found in clinical practice are major depressive disorders, cocaine-induced paranoia, cocaine-induced compulsive foraging and panic attacks.",

These may include any number of verbal or physical acts, and range from swearing, threatening, to harming self, others, or property. Identifying specific target behaviors for treatment is important in selecting the appropriate therapeutic option. The major neurotransmitters involved in aggression include gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and serotonin, which inhibit aggression, and dopamine, norepinephrine and acetylcholine, which increase it. Drug therapy for control of aggressive behaviors has traditionally included the antipsychotics and benzodiazepines. However, additional, newer therapies are also useful. Among these are the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and valproic acid, various beta-blocking agents, antidepressants, and buspirone. These medications may be needed when nondrug therapy for control of behavioral problems fails or is insufficient. Determining which behaviors are problematic and need treatment, knowing which medications are indicated for those problems, and noting contraindications for particular drug therapies will lead to the best therapeutic option for a given patient.",

Insomnia is experienced as poor, disrupted, or insufficient sleep associated with significant daytime impairments including increased fatigue or reduced energy, impaired cognitive function, and increased mood disturbance. Poor sleep is associated with negative outcomes across a range of dimensions that impair quality of life, increases risk for other diseases, and may interact negatively with the progression and treatment of other disorders. Evidence for effective psychological interventions to improve sleep in later life, specifically cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, is robust and well described.

      "abstract": "Editor—Sanfilippo syndrome or mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III) encompasses a group of four lysosomal storage disorders resulting from a failure to break down the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulphate. Each of the four subtypes, A, B, C, and D, is caused by the deficiency of a different enzyme in the degradative pathway of heparan sulphate: heparan-N-sulphatase (EC 3.10.1.1), α-N-acetylglucosaminidase (EC3.2.1.50), acetyl-CoA N-acetyl transferase (EC 2.3.1.3), and N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulphatase (EC 3.1.6.14), respectively.1 Clinical symptoms usually occur after two years of apparently normal development and include hyperactivity, aggressive behaviour, delayed development (particularly in speech), sleep disturbances, coarse hair, hirsutism, and diarrhoea. There are only relatively mild somatic manifestations. There then follows a period of progressive mental retardation with death usually between the second and third decade of life. In a small number of patients with Sanfilippo syndrome type B, there is a more slowly progressive form of the disease with later onset known as the attenuated phenotype.2-4 A late onset phenotype has also been described for Sanfilippo syndrome type A.5 \n\nSanfilippo syndrome type A (MPS IIIA) is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme heparan-N-sulphatase (sulphamidase). The disease is autosomal recessive and the gene encoding the enzyme is situated on chromosome 17q25.3, contains eight exons, and encodes a protein of 502 amino acids.6 7 To date, 46 different mutations have been identified in Sanfilippo A patients,6 8-13 several of which have been found at high frequencies in particular populations.

      "abstract": "Summary Twelve psychotic reactions are reported in 11 patients with various somatic illnesses treated with ACTH and/or cortisone. Two major patterns occurred: (a) A primarily affective disorder, either manic or depressive; and, more frequently, (b) an organic reaction (toxic psychosis) with associated paranoid-hallucinatory and/or affective (usually depressive) components. No consistent correlation could be obtained with regard to drug dosage and onset, duration, or type of psychosis. Suicidal tendencies were present in several cases. After the ACTH or cortisone was discontinued, termination of the psychosis occurred spontaneously in the organic reactions. The affective disorders required electroconvulsive therapy. A comparison is made between these states and psychoses appearing in naturally occurring hyperadrenalism or Cushing's syndrome. The following factors involved in the production of these psychotic reactions are considered significant: The physiological effects of the hyperadrenal state on the central nervous system. The influence of the underlying disease process. The premorbid personality. Only in a few cases were recognizable psychotic trends present before treatment. It is felt that in most instances the previous personality pattern determined the psychological content of the psychosis, but not its onset. A complete understanding of the interrelationships of all of these physiological and psychological mechanisms is not possible at the present time.",

In some instances the craving for alcohol precedes the paroxysm or epileptic fit like an aura or premonition. Sometimes the convulsion is intensified and increased by alcohol, or in other instances it may be neutralized and the direction of the symptom changed. The sudden maniacal impulse to become narcotized by alcohol, as seen in the dipsomaniac and periodic inebriates, closely resembles epilepsy. A number of cases have been noted where a distinct convulsion preceded the use of spirits and was followed by a continued impulse to drink.

Anorexia nervosa has a considerably worse long-term outcome than bulimia nervosa or binge eating disorders. Never the less, purging bulimia nervosa is often associated with other impulsive symptoms, such as addictions and suicide attempts. Chronic undernutrition leads to main long-term medical complications of eating disorders: linear growth in adolescents with anorexia nervosa, infertility, and osteoporosis. These complications need a specific medical follow up, at least once a year, added to the psychiatric and psychotherapist follow-up.",

      "abstract": "Side effects play a significant role in the selection of drugs to be used in panic disorder/agoraphobia whose polyphobic symptomatology often includes a suspiciousness about taking drugs and a fear of undesired side effects which may lead to the refusal of treatment. The safety, side effects and patients' acceptance of alprazolam and imipramine versus placebo were evaluated in 1168 subjects with panic disorder/agoraphobia who had been enrolled in the second phase of the Upjohn World Wide Panic Study. Side effects that worsened over baseline to a greater extent with alprazolam than with imipramine and placebo were sedation, fatigue/weakness, memory problems, ataxia and slurred speech. In the imipramine group blurred vision, tachycardia/palpitations, insomnia, sleep disturbance, excitement/nervousness, malaise, dizziness/faintness, headache, nausea/vomiting and decrease in appetite were worse than in the other groups. In the placebo group the anxious symptoms were most prominent. The highest level of compliance was shown in the alprazolam-treated group and the lowest in the placebo-treated group. Strong predictors of side effects were not observed. If a side effect profile is known, it will be easier for a clinician to choose the right drug and the appropriate management by taking into account compliance, safety and efficacy in each patient under treatment. Further information about side effects in long-term maintenance treatment would be of great clinical pertinence in ensuring safety and enhancing patients' quality of life.",

      "abstract": "The main criteria for the diagnosis of delirium are a change in cognitive function with rapid onset of symptoms and/or fluctuating sensorium, impairment of attention and development of perceptual disturbance. Disorientation to time and place, and disturbance of the sleep–wake cycle are also common features (American Psychiatric Association 1994). The clinical picture in a developing delirium is often characterised by new onset: • social withdrawal • restlessness • anxiety (or an increase in anxiety) • irritability • insomnia • nightmares (Jacobson & Leuchter 1996) There is a lack of consensus about the factors that are likely to precipitate a delirium. The most significant risk factors for Levkoff et al (1992) are ageing, dementia, sensory impairment, ill-health and being in institutional care. However, the use of physical restraints, malnutrition, more than three medications, presence of an indwelling bladder catheter, and ‘any iatrogenic event’ were identified by Inouye and Charpentier (1996). They also propose sleep deprivation, sensory impairment, existing cognitive impairment, poor hydration and nutritional status and immobility as risk factors (Inouye & Charpentier 1996). Some of the risk factors identified clinically are: • large number of medications • drug and alcohol use / misuse or withdrawal • dehydration and poor nutrition • hepatic or renal dysfunction • electrolyte disturbance • sensory impairment • sleep deprivation • existing cognitive impairment / brain damage • pain • respiratory / cardiovascular disease • infection • immobility Stephen Harding MMHN CCMH CertPsych CredMHN RN, Lecturer, School of Nursing and Midwifery, University of South Australia Email: sharding@netspace.net.au Continuing Professional Development Managing delirium in older people",

La cirugia funcional ha adquirido gran relevancia en el tratamiento de las complicaciones motoras de la enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) avanzada, y menos conocida es la influencia de la estimulacion cerebral profunda (ECP) en los sintomas no motores (SNM). Objetivo. Revisar la bibliografia sobre ECP y SNM en la EP. Desarrollo. Los resultados de la cirugia funcional sobre los SNM de la EP son variables en los distintos estudios. Algunos sintomas mejoran -trastornos del sueno, dolor o disconfort, trastornos obsesivo-compulsivos- y empeoran o aparecen otros -fluencia verbal, apatia, aumento de peso-. En estudios aislados se encuentra mejoria en memoria de trabajo, secuenciacion visuomotora y razonamiento, algunos trastornos digestivos, genitourinarios, de termorregulacion y olfativos, y empeoran la memoria verbal (recuerdo diferido) y visuoespacial, la velocidad psicomotora y la funcion ejecutiva, mientras que otros sintomas -hipotension ortostatica- no muestran cambios. Existen otros factores, ademas de la estimulacion, que pueden modificar los SNM, como la vulnerabilidad preoperatoria individual, la disminucion de medicacion dopaminergica tras la cirugia, la propia EP y los cambios psicosociales. En pacientes con perfiles determinados pueden existir riesgos especificos -mayor riesgo de alteracion cognitiva en pacientes de mas de 69 anos o con alteracion cognitiva precirugia; mayor riesgo de depresion, mania o suicidio en pacientes con patologia psiquiatrica previa-.

The term ‘acute confusional state’ is often used synonymously with ‘delirium’. Delirium may be associated with a range of associated clinical features including increased or decreased psychomotor activity (hyperactive and hypoactive variants), hallucinations and delusions, and efferent sympathetic hyperactivity. Delirium with pronounced psychomotor and sympathetic hyperactivity is more often seen in younger patients with alcohol or substance intoxication/withdrawal (delirium tremens), but no cause is specific to a clinical subtype. Delirium is distinguished from dementia (with which it may coexist, as dementia is a major risk factor for delirium) by its speed of onset (over hours or days) and reversibility with correction of the underlying cause. In some patients, however, delirium may be followed by long-term cognitive impairment, suggesting that the pathophysiology of delirium overlaps with that of dementia.",

      "title": "Composers - Substance Abusers",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONThe aim of this article is to emphasize and summarize pathographies of eminent composers, 77 of them, who were substance abusers. In this section we can divide them into three groups as follows: substance abusers who suffered from primary alcoholism, secondary alcoholism, and those who were alcohol and/or tobacco, drugs abusers. Most of them had different anxiety and depressive disorders (neurosis, panic disorder, cyclothymia, manic depressive disorder).1Substance abuse is the use of alcohol, tobacco and/or illegal drugs in a way that is harmful for health. Most of the composers mentioned in this article were alcohol abusers. Alcoholism is a syndrome of physical dependence on alcohol, whose sudden deprivation may cause withdrawal symptoms - tremor, anxiety, hallucinations and delusions (delirium tremens). Alcoholism impairs intellectual functions, physical skills, memory, judgment and social skills, such as conversation. Heavy consumption or alcohol abuse also causes following complications and diseases of different organs and systems, for example cardiovascular - cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure; nervous system - neuritis, funnicular myelosis, cerebral atrophy; gastrointestinal tract - gastropathy, ulcers, portal hypertension, acute and chronic pancreatitis, enteritis, cirrhosis of the liver etc. There are many substance abusers, but only a few of them (Dussek, Mysliveoek, Mussorgsky etc.) suffered primarily from alcoholism to such extent that their careers were interrupted and stopped because of alcohol abuse. Therefore they were unable to finish their creative work.11 In this journal we previously published pathographies of the following composers: J.C. Bach, W.F. Bach, Beethoven, Berlioz, Brahms, Debussy, Glinka, Gluck, Handel, Liszt, Mozart, Mussorgsky, Puccini, Ravel, Schonberg, Schubert, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky, Wolf.COMPOSERS AND RESULTS1. Pietro Marc Antonio Cesti(1623-1669) Italian composer and conductor who was born in Arezzo and studied with various local musicians. In 1637 he joined the Franciscan order. While he was in Volterra he turned more toward secular music, probably due to the patronage of the powerful Medici family. There he also came in contact with Salvator Rosa who wrote librettos for a number of Cesti' s cantatas. By 1650 Cesti' s calling as a monk and his success as a singer and composer of operas were coming into conflict so he was officially reprimanded. In 1652 he became a court member in Innsbruck. After holding a post somewhere in Florence as maestro di cappella, he entered the papal chapel in 1660. In 1666 he became Vice-Kapellmeister in Vienna. He was described as unstable, stubborn, quarrelsome and often seeking confrontation. He had frequent disagreements with other musicians. His frequent changes of living places were caused by his conflicting nature and connected with his alcohol abuse because of which he had problems with the society. His health was impaired because of alcohol abuse, so he died at the age of 46 in Venice as a result of complications of alcoholism, probably poisoned by his rivals in Florence.2-82. Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf(1739-1799) Austrian violinist and composer who was born in Vienna. He was a brilliant musician of great technical skills and soon became a member of the court chapels held by prince Sachsen - Hildburghausen, and later of another held by Bishop Adam Pataoic. Afterwards he was active in Breslau - Wroclaw and again in Vienna. He was a member of the royal orchestra and later a capelmeister in service of Bratislava Duke. He cooperated with J. Haydn and W.A. Mozart extensively. His musical drama »A doctor and a chemist« became very famous and was even compared to Mozart's »Figaro«. He was a master of »Singspiel«; he composed more than forty of them, and comic operas. He led a decadent life, eating and drinking excessively. He was one of the last composers living that kind of life. Later, he suffered from uric arthritis and hemorrhoids, what is more, he became almost paralyzed. …",

      "abstract": "Intellectual dysfunction, usually involving short-term memory, abstract reasoning, visuomotor coordination, intellectual flexibility, and spatial reasoning, is a well-documented finding among alcohol imbibers of various drinking styles. Despite the diversity of groups examined and the attempted control of variables other than alcohol consumption, little concensus has been reached with regard to the chronology of dysfunction (as related to lifetime drinking style, duration of alcoholism, quantity consumed per session, or type of potable). In many instances, diet, age, and even sex have outweighed the relative influence of alcohol in the degree of intellectual dysfunction. Morphologically, brain changes tend to be in the anterior/basal areas and may involve the third ventricle, diencephalic areas, and other focal variations. Cerebellar changes also are not uncommon yet may reflect a subgroup of alcoholics rather than a generalised trend. Generally, many intellectual deficits partially rebound rapidly within the first two or three weeks after cessation of drinking, with perhaps modest further improvement if sobriety is sustained for several months. Because of the extreme heterogeneity of the alcoholic population and the potent effect of ancillary variables upon measures of intellectual functioning, control and matching of demographic factors is a paramount consideration. Demographic variables of primary concern include age, sex, socio-economic status, education, duration of alcoholism, quantity of alcohol consumed per session, diet, psychotropic medications, secondary psychiatric diagnoses, secondary medical diagnoses, exact duration of abstinence, and prior exposure to psychometric instruments.",

It causes various health effects such as nausea, sweating, chills, muscle cramping, etc. The effect of this drug can be seen in 3 to 5 hours in the body. A spike in body temperature can be seen in MDMA users that can be fatal as it affects the liver, kidney, and heart leading to death. Addiction to MDMA is not yet proven, however, withdrawal symptoms such as fatigue and depression are noted. MDMA is usually taken via the mouth or snorting in the form of tablets or capsules. This drug is also taken or abused along with other drugs such as LSD, alcohol, and marijuana. MDMA is a scheduled drug with no proven medical use. MDMA causes a surge of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in the brain to regulate mood, learning, memory, stress, anxiety, etc. This chapter discusses the effects of MDMA on the human brain.",

      "abstract": "Opioids strongly modulate numerous physiological and psychological functions. They may induce euphoria and analgesia, which cultures have sought for generations when administered abruptly. Chronic opioid usage alters neural circuitry and creates a drug-dependent condition. During drug withdrawal, allostatic alterations caused by drug dependence are evident. Drug use stops a temporary coordinated allostatic re-established of neural circuits, which manifest as physiology and psychological consequences that are the opposite of those seen throughout sensitive drug intoxicates. Physical withdrawal symptoms, for example, go away in a matter of days, although other symptoms, such as dysphoria, sleeplessness, and anxiety, might last. Some adaptations, like gathered connections, can become permanent. The brain circuitry, cellular processes, and opioids drug dependence suggest a potential role for neuroinflammation. The taught association involving opioids and alleviation from a preexisting or withdrawal-induced anxiogenic and dysphoric state leads to opioids-addicted behaviors. Drug cravings among susceptible persons living in an increasingly pressured environment would be fueled by a taught link between drug use and respite from unpleasant moods. We contend that the present opioids crisis in the USA is exacerbated by this path to addiction.",

      "abstract": "Personal History: Have You Ever Nearly Lost or Actualy Lost Consciousness? The History To determine the importance of a positive answer to this question, the following questions should be asked: Did the syncopal event occur during or immediately after exercise; if the latter, was the patient standing still or moving around? Prior to the syncopal event, were there any prodromal symptoms such as the following: chest pain, palpitations, visual changes, wheezing/shortness of breath, nausea, or itching? After the syncopal event, what was the patient’s postevent clinical status? Did they wake quickly, or was there a prolonged period of unresponsiveness? Was there any observed seizure activity or loss of urine, stool, or tongue bite marks? Were there vital signs recorded on site, particularly the immediate postsyncope measurements? What medications and supplements were being utilized prior to the event? Is there a prior personal or family history of syncope or of sudden cardiac arrest/death? The evaluating physician’s first priority is to use the clinical history to distinguish between true syncope involving a loss of consciousness with presumed hemodynamic compromise and exercise-associated collapse associated with exhaustive effort or postexercise hypotension. In true syncope from hemodynamic causes, the athlete typically recovers quickly with restoration of arterial pressure, unless resuscitation is required. After collapse associated with an exhaustive effort, however, athletes usually will have prolonged periods of “being out of it,” even in the supine position with normal heart rate and BP. This picture is in contrast to patients with syncope due to heat stress who are universally hypotensive and tachycardic. Athletes who are impaired, seeming “unconscious,” but able to assist in their own evacuation are unlikely to be in the throes of a life-threatening arrhythmia, although other metabolic or catastrophic abnormalities are possible (e.g., hyponatremia, exertional heat stroke). The postevent state provides important clues such as seizure activity, incontinence, and immediate vital signs (including body temperature). It must be emphasized however, that a seizure-like activity can be the result of reduced cerebral perfusion and therefore does not always imply epilepsy or neurologic problems. Reports from witnesses can be invaluable. Too often, syncope is assumed to be neurologic and the cardiac evaluation is not done, resulting in fatal outcomes. The second critical distinction is whether the event occurred during or immediately after exercise. Orthostatic hypotension occurring after exercise, usually associated with sudden cessation of activity, is much less ominous than the sudden loss of consciousness that occurs during exercise, which suggests cardiac arrhythmia with loss of blood flow to the brain. Syncope prompted by an abrupt loud noise such as a starting gun or immersion in cold water may provide a clinical clue to prolonged QT syndrome (LQTS). The third component of the history that provides clinical clues is a detailed assessment of events prior to the collapse. Prodromal symptoms such as palpitations (suggesting arrhythmia), chest pain (ischemia, aortic dissection), nausea (ischemia, high levels of vagal activity, or hyponatremia), wheezing, and pruritus (anaphylaxis) are significant, along with precipitating events like “only during exercise.” It is important to identify whether syncope occurs in the upright position (orthostatic hypotension) alone or also when sitting or supine (arrhythmia or nonhemodynamic cause). The fourth component of the evaluation requires assessment of the medication and supplement history. A comprehensive medication list, including over-the-counter medications and ergogenic aids is necessary; the practice of high-risk behaviors, such as recreational drug use should be carefully investigated. Finally, a personal and family history of sudden death is critical and, if present, may identify very high-risk subgroups with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), LQTS, or right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Delineating a family tree will give a complete snapshot of the family history. The Physical Examination Vital signs (including orthostatic measurements) should be included. Blood pressure (BP) should be measured in both arms and legs as well as after 5 min of moving to a standing position. Special Tests/Referral The three tests that are core to the diagnostic evaluation of the athlete with syncope include the electrocardiogram (ECG), the echocardiogram, and the exercise stress test. Echocardiography should precede the exercise test, allowing the assessment of ventricular size and function, pulmonary pressures, and valve function/integrity. Rather than a standard Bruce protocol, a maximal symptom-limited exercise test should be used to reproduce the conditions that provoked the syncopal event. For example, a stuttering start-stop test for a basketball or soccer player or a prolonged high-intensity race pace test for a runner. The exercise ECG also should be examined for appropriate shortening of the QT interval. Further testing should be ordered only as indicated and in consultation with the appropriate specialist. A complete review of all the advanced diagnostic tests is beyond the focus of this article. Tilt table testing should not be used in the syncope evaluation because of the high rate of false positive tests due to the steep Starling curve in athletes. The clinician is additionally reminded that not all syncope is cardiogenic. Athletes whose history suggests seizure activity may require an electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to exclude a structural lesion, and seizures can be related to hyponatremia or heat stroke. Hematologic and metabolic abnormalities require testing as indicated, e.g., hypoglycemia in those with diabetes, athletes with eating disorders, or patients on beta-blockers. CASE EXAMPLES Case 1: Cross-Country Runner with Collapse at the Finish Line A 17-year-old female track star was competing in the district championships in the 5,000 m. She was having an excellent race and was part of the final pack that was in contention for a medal. Just after crossing the finish line (in 17 min 55 s), she collapsed to the ground and, according to bystanders, remained “unconscious” for about an hour. ECG, echocardiogram, and Holter monitor testing results were normal, although she did not faint during the period of recording. An athlete-specific exercise test was performed on a large treadmill at 10 mph; after 10 min, the patient started to cry and then slumped in the safety harness. At the moment of fainting, her rhythm was normal, pulse was 185 bpm, and BP was 140/70. The final impression was exercise-associated collapse, and the recommendation was better training and pacing to match demands of her sport. Key Point: History pointed away from life-threatening arrhythmia; athlete-specific exercise testing reproduced the problem during direct electrical and hemodynamic monitoring, allowing an accurate diagnosis. Case 2: Basketball Player with Collapse on the Free Throw Line A 21-year-old male college basketball star led a 12-point run, mostly by a series of impressive fast breaks, in the middle of the first half of an early round of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. After the last jam, he was fouled and walked to the foul line. While standing waiting to shoot, he slumped to the ground. Witnesses observed generalized seizure activity. ECG showed LVH and unusual T waves in the right precordial leads, but his echocardiogram result was normal and short-term Holter monitoring did not identify any arrhythmias, although no symptoms occurred during the monitoring period. A stuttering exercise test was performed at high speed (15 mph) followed by sudden stops. After the fifth repeat, while standing quietly, there was a sudden drop in pulse to 45 bpm, BP was 60/40, and the patient fainted on the treadmill. The final diagnosis was postexercise hypotension (neurally mediated syncope). The recommendation was behavioral modification (avoid standing still if possible, learn leg crossing/butt clenching and toe bouncing maneuvers, stay well hydrated, and wear compression socks). Key Point: Standing still after intense exercise can lead to hypotension due to loss of the muscle pump and lead to neurally mediated syncope with bradycardia and hypotension. Athlete-specific exercise testing elicited the problem and led to simple, effective, nonpharmacologic therapy. Case 3: Football Player with Collapse while Running out for a Pass A 19-year-old male wide receiver for a junior college football team was running a crossing pattern during practice when witnesses observed him to weave, stumble, and fall to the ground. The trainer arrived at the scene to find him alert and oriented. His BP was 135/80; pulse was 110 bpm and regular. Physical examination result was normal; however, ECG results showed septal Q waves, LVH, and deep T wave inversions. Echocardiogram results showed a septal thickness of 1.8 cm, although without systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Holter monitoring revealed multiple runs of NSVT, and cardiac MRI showed multiple areas of delayed enhancement. The diagnosis was HCM; he was held from competition, and family members were screened for HCM. Key Point: Syncope during exercise is very concerning for an arrhythmia and underlying structural heart disease. Case 4: Lacrosse Player with Syncope during Exercise A lacrosse player had syncope while running wind sprints. Careful history examination documented that the syncope occurred during a sprint and not between sprints. ECG results showed nonspecific ECG changes, but the echocardiogram result was normal. The exercise test result was normal; cardiac MRI was performed and showed patchy areas of delayed enhancement indicating potential myocarditis. An electrophysiology (EP) study induced atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) but no ventricular arrhythmias. A 24-h Holter monitor showed no arrhythmias. The athlete had a major game coming up, and there was pressure to allow him to play. The patient had ablation of the AVNRT and was allowed to return to sports. He died in practice the following week. Key Point: The worrisome history plus noncoronary distribution of delayed enhancement on MRI are concerning for myocarditis. The conservative approach would have been to treat with a beta-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, hold out of sports for at least 3 to 6 months, perhaps implant an implantable loop recorder so that a specific diagnosis could be made if another episode of syncope occurred, and then repeat the MRI looking for resolution of delayed enhancement. Pressure to play (athlete, coach, and parent) can influence medical decision making and steer the decision away from the athlete’s best interest. Case 5: A 23-year-old male second-year medical student completed a maximal-effort Wingate test as part of a research project; prior V˙O2max testing demonstrated a maximum of 55 mL·kg−1·min−1. Immediately after the 30-s test, the student was extremely nauseous and rapidly exited the bike to move to a trash can to vomit; after two short wobbly steps, he collapsed to the ground. He was attended to immediately by the exercise staff in attendance; he had an estimated loss of consciousness for less than 30 s and had a first set of vital signs of heart rate of 140 bpm and BP of 110/60. There was no observed seizure activity and no prior complaint of chest pain. A subsequent evaluation in the sports medicine clinic demonstrated normal clinical examination results with no history of syncope; ECG results demonstrated early repolarization variation in the precordial leads. As the syncopal event occurred immediately after exercise, a treadmill stress test and echocardiogram were performed; the student completed 17 min of Bruce protocol and had a normal echocardiogram results. The diagnosis was postexertional syncope secondary to orthostatic hypotension. Key Point: Syncope during or immediately after exercise is always concerning and warrants conscientious examination to rule out structural cardiovascular disease. Intense anaerobic exercise, which can be seen in maximal efforts like the Wingate test or weightlifting, can precipitate syncope through orthostatic hypotension and a central effect of hypocapnia leading to, or aggravating, cerebral hypoperfusion. The history of the event provides not only insight into the diagnosis but also important opportunities for prudent recommendations for prevention.",

Libido may be decreased by drugs that block dopamine or testosterone, or that cause dysphoria. Erection may be decreased by drugs that divert blood flow from the penis, or drugs that affect spinal reflexes. Ganglion blockers may also inhibit erection. Ejaculation may be diminished by drugs that affect spinal reflexes or be inhibited by ganglion blockage. Enervation of the vas deferens and epididymis may be blocked and cause a smaller emission. Retrograde ejaculation may occur due to blockage of the internal urethral sphincter. Orgasm is usually inhibited by the drugs that inhibit ejaculation. Fertility is impaired by drugs that affect sexual performance or spermatogenesis. Major groups of drugs that may affect male sexual function include drugs of abuse, CNS depressants, antihypertensives, anticholinergics, psychotherapeutics, hormones, and cancer therapeutics, in addition to miscellaneous other agents. Information about these drugs has been arranged in tables so that the provider has a convenient reference to use when explaining to men the effect of drugs on sexual response and fertility.",

Self-medication of mood disorders with legal or illicit substances is highly prevalent. Careful assessment of patients is necessary to determine whether a co-occurring disorder is due to substance use or a separate diagnosis that requires independent treatment. Many depressive symptoms may resolve with treatment of the substance use disorder. Independent mood disorders can be treated with behavioral therapy and standard pharmacological therapy. Some mood disorder medications are also effective for substance use disorders.

      "abstract": "Many patients are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for acute intoxication, serious complication of overdose, or withdrawal symptoms of illicit drugs. An acute withdrawal of drugs with addiction potential is associated with a sympathetic overactivity leading to marked psychomimetic disturbances. Acute intoxication or withdrawal of such drugs is often associated with life-threatening complications which require ICU admission and necessitate prolonged sedative analgesic medications, weaning from which is often complicated by withdrawal and other psychomimetic symptoms. Dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 (α(2)) agonist, has been used successfully to facilitate withdrawal and detoxification of various drugs and also to control delirium in ICU patients. Herein, we report a case of a chronic opioid abuse (heroin) patient admitted with acute overdose complications leading to a prolonged ICU course requiring sedative-analgesic medication; the drug withdrawal-related symptoms further complicated the weaning process. Dexmedetomidine infusion was successfully used as a sedative-analgesic to control the withdrawal-related psychomimetic symptoms and to facilitate smooth detoxification and weaning from opioid and other sedatives.",

Blood alcohol measurements are a vital test in the comatose patient as the clinical picture may be caused, or temporarily significantly worsened, by severe alcohol intoxication. The preservation of pupillary light reflexes in the presence of deep coma with decerebrate posturing should alert the clinician to a possible metabolic cause for the coma, including alcohol.

      "abstract": "Background: The second generation antipsychotics now have clinical approvals for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar depression, bipolar mania, autism, major depressive disorder and are used furthermore off-label to treat other mental disorders. Each agent is unique in its pharmacodynamic profile and allows for unique dosing strategies to be employed when treating these different disorders. Aims: To review relevant data regarding the second generation antipsychotics and their empirical dosing strategies. To further review and comment theoretically in these areas where substantial, definitive data are lacking. Materials and Methods: A MEDLINE and recent textbook review was conducted regarding each second generation antipsychotic and cross-referenced with searches for major mental disorders. The findings are compiled in the review below. Discussion: The second generation antipsychotics are clearly delineated in the treatment of psychosis and mania and share similar mechanisms of action to achieve these results: dopamine-2 receptor antagonism for efficacy and serotonin-2a receptor antagonism for EPS tolerability. From here, each agent has a unique pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile where some agents carry more, or less antidepressant, anxiolyic, or hypnotic profiles. Choosing an agent, and dosing it in low, middle, or high ranges may result in differential effectiveness and tolerability. Conclusion: The second generation antipsychotics have many clinical applications in psychiatric practice. This article serves to review this and also suggests ways clinicians may optimize treatment based upon patient diagnosis and utilizing appropriate dosing of each individual second generation antipsychotic.",

      "title": "OCCUPATIONAL STRESS IN COMPUTER OPERATORS",
      "abstract": "During work, a person is exposed to various types of stressors that can negatively affect an individual's health and reduce labor productivity. Irrational organization of work, poor interpersonal relations in the team, too short deadlines for the realization of the work tasks, inadequate microclimatic conditions, non-ergonomic design of equipment and tools, as well as accelerated changes and innovations in technology, which require additional education and acquisition of new knowledge and skills, are just some of the factors that negatively burden the person who works.In response to occupational stress, disorders occur on a physiological, psychological and behavioral level. Under conditions of stress, a person, as a social and emotional being eager for affirmation and proof, turns to some bad habits, such as consuming cigarettes, alcohol, psychostimulant substances or anxiolytics, which additionally have a bad effect on health. Employees who are exposed to chronic stress cannot be expected to achieve the desired professional results because they lose motivation, innovative thinking and increased absenteeism from work. Stress often worsens without the support of relatives, the environment and colleagues. Therefore, early recognition of signs of stress, identification of stressors and taking measures and procedures to combat unwanted factors, as well as providing support are of great importance for both human health and to reduce company costs.In this paper, we surveyed 120 computer operators, 72.5% female, average age 37.6 years, and 27.5% male, average age 39.2 years old. 7.8% had a high school diploma, 8.6% higher education, and 83.6% high education. Among them, 32.5% stated that they have moderate, while 29.2% state that they have a high level of stress at work. Poor working conditions and short deadlines are cited as the most common reasons. Of these, 25.6% associated stress with the current epidemiological situation of Covid-19. A significant percentage, 25.2% feel worn out or exhausted, 10% wake up tired, and 8.3% try to overcome fatigue in order to complete their work tasks.Fatigue, apathy, dissatisfaction, overtime work, „bringing work home― can negatively affect family and social relationships as well as leisure activities. There are a variety of stress management techniques at the individual and organizational levels, including group therapies, support and counseling, and breathing exercises that can help overcome the negative effects of stress. Workplace stress must be minimized, in order to ensure a favorable work environment, as well as the physical, mental and social well-being of the working man",

      "title": "Course and outcome of schizophrenia and their prediction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Studies conducted over many decades consistently demonstrate that schizophrenia presents a broad spectrum of possible outcomes and course patterns, ranging from complete or nearly complete recovery after acute episodes of psychosis to continuous, unremitting illness leading to progressive deterioration of cognitive performance and social functioning. Between these extremes, a substantial proportion of patients show an episodic course with relapses of psychotic symptoms and partial remissions during which affective and cognitive impairments become increasingly conspicuous and may progress to gross deficits. Although no less than one-third of all patients with schizophrenia have relatively benign outcomes, in the majority the illness still has a profound, lifelong impact on personal growth and development. The initial symptoms of the disorder are not strongly predictive of the pattern of course but the mode of onset (acute or insidious), the duration of illness prior to diagnosis and treatment, the presence or absence of comorbid substance use, as well as background variables such as premorbid adjustment (especially during adolescence), educational and occupational achievement, marital status, and availability of a supportive social network allow a reasonable accuracy of prediction in the short- to medium-term (2–5 years). One of the most striking aspects of the longitudinal course of schizophrenia is the so-called ‘terminal improvement’. A relatively high proportion of patients tend to improve substantially with ageing. What determines this long-term outcome is far from clear but the stereotype view of schizophrenia as an invariably progressive, deteriorating disorder does not accord well with the evidence. Similarly, a model of schizophrenia as a static neurodevelopmental encephalopathy decompensating post-adolescence under the influence of a variety of stressors fits only part of the spectrum of course patterns. In a significant proportion of cases, the disorder exhibits the unmistakable features of a shift-like process with acute exacerbations and remissions which may progress to severe deterioration or come to a standstill at any stage. Whether a single underlying pathophysiology can explain the variety of clinical outcomes, or several different pathological processes are at work, remains obscure. It has been suggested that the longitudinal course of schizophrenia should be seen as an open-ended, dynamic life process with multiple, interacting biological and psychosocial determinants. Obviously, such issues cannot be resolved by clinical follow-up studies alone, and require a strong involvement of neurobiological research in prospective investigations of representative samples of cases spanning the entire spectrum of course and outcomes. No such studies have been possible until recently, both because of the technical complexity of such an undertaking and because of the tendency to selectively recruit for biological investigations patients from the severe, deteriorating part of the spectrum. Overcoming such limitations will be essential to the uncovering of the mechanisms driving the ‘natural history’ of schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Cancer-Related Fatigue: Nursing Assessment and Management",
      "abstract": "Cancer-related fatigue (CRF), the most common side effect of cancer and cancer treatment, is unlike the acute fatigue we experience from working all day in our jobs and with our families. It is an unpredictable, intense, overwhelming sense of tiredness or energy depletion. Fatigue is also defined as exhaustion, lethargy, lack of concentration and motivation, weakness, and depression. 1 It can occur suddenly and may not end when treatment ends but last months or even years. Patients with advanced colo-rectal cancer, lung and breast cancers, and lymphoma, all of which are managed under a variety of treatment regimens, report fatigue. 2 The onset, duration, and intensity of CRF have variable patterns, most notably in people receiving chemotherapy. Many report fatigue during the first few days after treatment, with a peak in fatigue when blood counts reach their lowest (nadir) and a decrease in fatigue before the next chemotherapy cycle. 1,3 Several studies have examined patterns of fatigue from radiation. 3–5 Findings suggest that fatigue may be cumulative over four to six weeks of treatment, with an increase in the presence of other physical symptoms, mood disturbances, and changes in usual activity. 3 For people receiving biologic therapies, fatigue is cumulative and related to dose and schedule. 6,7 With more types of cancer being treated with a combination of these therapies, the number of people affected by CRF is rising. People receiving cancer treatment can best describe CRF’s effect on their quality of life and thereby provide insight into its definition. A 76-year-old woman with lung cancer stated, “The morning after my treatment I could not get out of bed. When I finally did, I could only walk as far as the bathroom, then back to bed. I did not dare walk into the kitchen to prepare breakfast. My legs felt like lead.” A 52-year-old man with colon cancer described his fatigue. “I tried to work while taking my treatments, but I was exhausted by noon. I decided to work at home with my computer, but found it hard to focus. I tried to nap, but I never felt rested.” On the initiation of her second chemotherapy regimen, a 37-year-old woman with breast cancer recalled, “The first round of treatment made me so tired. My body ached. For the last three treatments, I found myself in bed most of the time. I could not be a wife or a mother to three small children.” A variety of patterns and multiple factors influence an individual’s experience of CRF. 1,8 With the interactions of multiple physiologic and psychological factors, CRF remains difficult to describe, and subsequently, manage. 9 Cancer-related fatigue has long been a misunderstood side effect of cancer treatment, and unfortunately the message often conveyed to patients and their families is that it’s unavoidable and needs to be tolerated. ASSESSING CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE The etiology of CRF cannot always be determined. 10 Several contributing factors have been identified: cancer and cancer treatments, anemia, neutropenia, sleep disturbance, depression, nutritional disturbance, and coping with other side effects of cancer treatment such as pain and nausea. 8 Along with complaints of unusual tiredness or weakness, people with CRF have decreased physical stamina, withdrawal from social activities, and decreased motivation. They may express irritability or impatience. 2 CRF’s cognitive manifestation ranges from sluggish thought process to inability to concentrate, forgetfulness, decreased short-term memory, and shortened attention span, 11 which may interfere with the person’s ability to fully participate in work, family, and social activities. Given that the contributing factors of CRF may be multicausal, and those interrelationships are the subject of many research questions, the current approach to assessment and nursing intervention needs to be multifaceted. Fatigue may present a challenge for nursing assessment because of the inherent difficulty in measuring a subjective symptom. Here are some guidelines to consider in assessing fatigue: Assess CRF as one would pain.1 First, allow patients to describe their fatigue in their own words by using open-ended questions such as, “Tell me about your fatigue.” Afterward, it’s useful to refer to the symptom by using the patient’s own words which hold significant meaning. More specific responses may be prompted by questions related to the patient’s functional mobility and ability to participate in leisure activities. Use a scale. A 0-to-5 or 0-to-10 response scale helps determine the patient’s perception of the severity of his fatigue. Select a scale that’s familiar to other care providers in the clinical setting, and use the same scale for other subjective symptoms such as pain or nausea. Having a consistent rating system helps everyone interpret a patient’s symptom patterns more quickly. Determine aggravating and alleviating factors. Ask the patient what makes his fatigue seem more severe, and what has worked and not worked in the past to prevent or reduce fatigue. Document assessment findings. This is critical for communication among health care providers. One initial assessment strategy is to track hemoglobin counts and fatigue scores on a graph (vital signs or treatment flowsheet) so that the nurse can convey to the physician how the patient is experiencing fatigue in reference to other symptoms, treatments, and lab values. The information also may be useful for individualizing fatigue management. SUGGEST AN ACTIVE APPROACH People experiencing CRF may make adjustments in their lives long before they seek guidance from health care providers. The usual fatigue self-management strategies, such as sleep and rest, which are more appropriate for healthy persons managing acute fatigue, are passive approaches. 9 In managing CRF, strategies need to be targeted toward maintaining sufficient energy to participate in the most meaningful life activities as defined by the person experiencing fatigue. 12 Because of the multicausal and multidimensional nature of CRF, 7 more than one management strategy may be necessary to provide relief. From a review of theoretical and research literature on CRF, Emma Ream and Alison Richardson identified three core activities to reduce the effect of fatigue: effective management of associated symptoms, enhancement of activity balanced with rest, and management of emotional stress. 9 Although more investigation is necessary to identify and test successful strategies for minimizing fatigue, several approaches for managing CRF have been supported by nursing research: preparatory education, physical activity, psychosocial support resources, and attention-restoring activities. Following are self-management strategies that can be incorporated into nursing practice: Acknowledgment of fatigue. Acknowledgment of the existence of CRF is a crucial first step toward assessment and management. Its recognition by the health care provider identifies CRF to be as important as nausea and vomiting, pain, peripheral neuropathy, or other treatment-related symptoms that affect quality of life. People with cancer report that having a health care provider simply inquire about their fatigue is meaningful because it indicates that their fatigue is worthy of intervention. 13 Preparatory information. By providing patients with information on fatigue, what’s known about it, and how it can be managed, the nurse validates not only its presence, but expresses her interest in working with the patient to manage it. A study of people receiving radiation therapy reported that those who prepare themselves for impending fatigue experience it less than those who receive no preparatory information. 14 With realistic expectations, people experiencing CRF can adjust and adapt to this symptom. 2 Prioritizing and pacing activities. Discuss with your patient how to prioritize and pace activities, including rest. 15 In setting priorities, it’s important to include a family member so that the choices for rest and activity reflect the needs of patient and family. As a man receiving chemotherapy explained, “I try to work three days a week—Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. I need one day off to recuperate from eight hours of work. My wife thinks I’m lazy because I have no energy to do what she wants me to do.” Encourage the person with CRF to review his usual weekly activities and identify low, moderate, or high priorities. Eliminate the low-priority activities and negotiate the moderate-priority activities into a daily schedule. Suggest assigning low-or moderate-priorities activities that are essential to other family members. If prioritizing and planning activities are energy depleting for the patient, assign a job broker, a family member or friend who can organize and assign tasks such as grocery shopping and meal preparation. There are certain tasks that may be obligatory to the patient’s role in the family. For example, a mother of three school-age children was undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer. She felt it was her role to complete her usual to-do list of household chores, although she knew it took much of her energy. Her nurse helped her identify realistic expectations and develop new strategies. For this family, the task of doing laundry was divided into smaller activities for each family member. Her husband brought the hamper into the living room where his wife could sort the dirty laundry. She taught the older children to use the washer and dryer in the basement. The children brought the clothes upstairs for their mother to fold and put away. By breaking down household chores, the patient was able to participate and maintain her role in the family. Balancing activity and rest. In addition to prioritizing activities, a balanced schedule of activity and rest is important. 15 One woman in a cancer support group referred to her experience with fatigue as “living with the toddler effect.” She described pushing herself like a toddler who moves from one activity to another before finally collapsing. She stated, “I didn’t know another way to manage my fatigue.” Often, the balance between activity and rest is difficult. For some people, rest means sleeping for an extended time. Whereas lying down and shutting one’s eyes may be appropriate for a short time, sleeping on and off throughout the day interrupts sleep cycles at night and creates more symptom distress. To alleviate CRF, rest is more effective when used as a respite from activity. Short, frequent periods of inactivity, such as sitting quietly or lying down, strategically planned throughout the day, are more beneficial than long periods of sleep. 15 Physical activity. The nurse may need to help a person with CRF develop an incremental plan to increase physical activity. Even normally physically active people can and do exercise during treatment. However, the intensity and duration of the activity may need to be modified. 16 Although regular physical activity is an important component of a healthy lifestyle, Anna Schwartz confirmed that many health care providers do not provide information about it or encourage people with cancer to exercise. 16 Several studies of women receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy for breast cancer and who participated in moderately intense aerobic exercises or a walking program reported that participants had less fatigue and emotional distress than those in usual care groups. 17–19 Patients report that physical activity is most effective when symptoms like fatigue are at their worst. 20 Of all the physical activities studied that have been used by people experiencing fatigue (walking, riding a stationary bicycle, low-impact aerobics, and swimming), walking is the most convenient, low cost, and low risk, regardless of age. In addition, walking may provide distraction, socialization, and attention-restoration. One young man, after his third cycle of treatment for lymphoma, had been hospitalized for an extended period of time. Upon returning home, he needed an incremental plan for increasing his physical activity. The first few days he focused on getting out of bed, getting dressed, and moving about his house. The plan also included activities beginning with sitting on the front porch and progressing toward walking down the driveway, to the end of the street, around the block, and continuing until he was able to choose his own physical activities. When he returned to the clinic, he shared with the staff a rediscovery of what he enjoyed most in life: socializing with friends, hiking, biking, and running. More study is necessary to determine specific recommendations for the appropriate type and amount of exercise. Overall, physical activity needs to be initiated at a comfortable level. Gradually, the intensity and duration may be increased to three to four days per week. 20 Energy conservation. Encourage the person experiencing fatigue to perform tasks that expend the least amount of energy. A collaborative approach among physical therapists, occupational therapists, nurses, and physicians supports the integration of energy-conserving strategies into planning daily activities and adapting the home environment. Eileen Donovan described several energy-conserving strategies for self-care, meal preparation, housekeeping, shopping, child care, and work. 21 Simple strategies, such as sitting rather than standing, or moving items closer within reach, decrease the amount of energy used. A breast cancer survivor, who had experienced fatigue, described her energy-conservation strategy for grocery shopping to her support group. She prepared the grocery list the day before and organized it by aisle. She planned her trip to a familiar neighborhood market at a time when it was less congested. She supported herself with a grocery cart as she moved from aisle to aisle, and took a 15-minute break halfway through on a bench in front of the store. After she paid the bill, she always asked for assistance with carrying the groceries to her car. Psychosocial support resources. People receiving radiation treatment and chemotherapy find it affects many aspects of their lives: their ability to work, their physical and emotional well-being, their ability to enjoy life in the moment, and their intimacy with their partner. 22 People with a history of chemotherapy indicated that CRF made it more difficult to participate in social activities, and to maintain relationships with family and friends. 23 A nurse referral to psychosocial resources, such as support groups, can help the patient cope with the effect of fatigue on quality of life. Through support groups, patients learn new self-management strategies that they can share with others. The selection of a specific psychosocial resource needs to be individualized. 9 Some people with CRF may be open to support group activities and benefit from a group, while others may prefer one-to-one counseling. Attention-restoring activities. People with CRF are often overwhelmed by an overstimulating environment. Their attention is diverted by the many sights, sounds, and objects in the health care environment—alarms, the fast-paced movement of staff, and painful procedures. Consequently, the patient, overburdened by information and environmental distractions, may not understand what’s being said. Bernadine Cimprich pioneered research in attentional fatigue, 1 the decreased capacity to concentrate or direct attention. 24 Natural environments or scenes such as a waterfall, a garden, or a sunrise may restore the patient’s ability to concentrate and comprehend. Women newly diagnosed with breast cancer, who participated in individualized, attention-restoring activities for 30 minutes three times a week, experienced significant improvements in attentional capacity compared to a control group. 11 Following participation in attention-restoring strategies, the person with fatigue may think more clearly and participate more actively in personal care and activities. The implications of Cimprich’s research are significant for providing information and education to people with fatigue and designing more supportive environments for them. Nurses are increasingly aware that the number of people experiencing CRF is rising. Cancer-related fatigue permeates every aspect of daily life: work, family, and social activities. Although more research is required to determine the effectiveness of proposed strategies to prevent and alleviate fatigue, the profound physical, psychological, emotional, and spiritual effect of fatigue demands that nurses intervene now. Nurses can be instrumental in identifying, evaluating, and aiding patients with fatigue to make the transition from passive to more active self-care strategies. Fortunately, more than a trial-and-error approach exists for fatigue management in current clinical practice. CRF theories direct nurses to management strategies such as providing preparatory information, assisting the patient to establish a balance of activity and rest, encouraging use of psychosocial support resources, and recommending attention-restoring activities. Managing CRF effectively requires nurses to thoughtfully and thoroughly pursue strategies that prevent physical deconditioning and allow people with fatigue to continue engaging in meaningful activities.",

      "abstract": "Istifragh or tanqiya-e-badan (body waste clearance) is an important therapeutic modality, prevalent in Unani System of Medicine, applied to treat various chronic diseases. Brain, like other parts of the body, needs to maintain homeostasis to function properly, and that requires continuous removal of toxic wastes. Brain possesses specific waste disposal system. The glymphatic system serves as a brain waste disposal system. BBB also facilitates the efflux of toxic metabolites out of the brain.The brain’s waste consists of metabolites, and proteins such as amyloid- beta, tau and alpha- synuclein proteins etc., which can form aggregates that are deleterious to brain. Sleep deprivation , aging and many other brain pathologies (i.e. stroke, ischemia, tumour, injury etc.) may disrupt glymphatic function. Some non-pharmacological therapeutic modalities such as exercise, sleep, sleeping posture, intermittent fasting and dietary regimens (omega-3 fatty acids, resveratrol etc.) are powerful drivers of glymphatic transport. Unani herbal drug, Ustukhuddus (Lavandula stoechas L.) is also used for istifragh-e-dimagh or tanqiya-e-dimagh in Unani System of Medicine since long time.This review addresses current scientific knowledge regarding understanding and significance of Istifragh-e-dimagh with special reference to prevention and / or treatment of chronic neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Amphetamines are central nervous system (CNS) stimulants and belong to psychoactive drugs that affect chemicals in the brain, nerves and exert a constant contribution to hyperactivity and impulse control. The communal group of amphetamines comprises amphetamine, dextroamphetamine and methamphetamine. Amphetamines show its action on the mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system by inducing release of dopamine and to some extent norepinephrine, in the synaptic clefts of the nucleus accumbens and other terminal areas. They offer not only a sense of euphoric state, but also addiction. Amphetamines are frequently prescribed for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children, adolescents and adults, narcolepsy and obesity. At therapeutic doses, amphetamine causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, improved cognitive control, etc. The balance of benefit/risk is the main challenge for its clinical use. When overused these medications can be highly addictive, are often diverted from the user to be used as recreational drugs. Adverse effects include anxiety, aggression, headache, insomnia, hyperactivity, palpitations, increased breathing rate, increased blood pressure, tachycardia, arrhythmia, dilated pupils, paranoia, etc. However, at large doses, these drugs may impair cognitive function and induce rapid muscle breakdown. Even higher doses may give rise to hallucinations, paranoia, psychosis and potentially lifethreatening conditions such as convulsions, stroke, kidney failure, etc. The furthermost serious health implications of amphetamine resulting from chronic use are dependence, considered by compulsive drug-seeking and drug use and a phenomenon notorious as amphetamine psychosis. Therefore the objective of this study was to explore the functions of the amphetamines as recreation drug of abuse.",

Oxygen deficiency at tissue level (hypoxia, see Box 60.1) is often accompanied by glucose and nutrient deprivation, and is further compounded by pre-existing or complicating factors in the mother, especially pyrexia, and in the infant such as sepsis or congenital anomalies, the concomitant degree of metabolic derangement (e.g. extent of hypoglycaemia or metabolic acidosis), and the time to delivery and effective resuscitation. All of these factors will potentially compound any hypoxic injury and the extent of any ensuing brain damage, described as hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE, Box 60.1). Attempts to assign an HIE ‘grade’ may help to correlate early symptoms and signs with the degree and likelihood of long-term sequelae [2], although accurate prognostication of asphyxial brain damage remains difficult.",

This drug when administered intravenously in subnarcotic doses usually produces a reaction in which the symptoms lessen in severity and the patient more closely approaches his normal. The commoner response is for the depression partially to subside, the patient feeling more comfortable, pleasant, alert, and even on occasion euphoric. Less often the depression is felt more strongly and expressed more overtly. In addition to these shifts in mood, other changes may become apparent. There may be an increase in the speed of retarded mental processes. The desire to communicate personal problems and experiences may improve. Patients who are agitated may become quiet; those who are retarded may move with greater ease. There may be a diminution of anxiety",

The excitement is not linked to sexual desire and may also be triggered by non sexual stimuli, as mere vibrations; moreover it cannot find a way out in an orgasm, which often proves unsatisfactory. Causes that may contribute to increase female sexual activity, be it egosyntonic or egodistonic, pleasant or disturbing for the couple, are still not appropriately investigated (Leiblum, Graziottin, 2007).",

      "abstract": "Varying resistance to psychotherapy occurred in patients fantasying that the rapid removal of depressions was effected by a “miracle drug” which could be relied upon for “magical” solutions to future problems. Most patients easily transferred their desires for assistance from the medication to the psychotherapist who prescribed it (and might possibly have to do so again). The administration of adrenocorticosteroids, however, may result in undesirable complications. The medical contraindications to steroid therapy must be heeded, and constant watchfulness for the possible development of harmful physical side-effects is essential. Psychiatric and neurologic disturbances may follow the administration of corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropin( 4, 5). A too rapid tapering of steroid dosage may result in a period of relative hypoadrenalism, thereby exacerbating and compounding psychiatric difficulties(5). During this study, reappearance of severe depressions occurred in 1 manicdepressive and 2 neurotic-depressives, in each case about 2 months after the discontinuation of medication. These relapses may indicate the necessity for maintaining the recovered depressive patient on small doses of steroids for periods approximating the average duration of previous phases of severe depression. In this study the rapid relief of depressive symptomatology afforded by therapy with prednisone accentuated the patients’ basic personality problems. In schizo-affectives, adequate doses of phenothiazines were needed to treat the intensification of psychotic thought disorders which began concurrently with the remission of depression. The treatment of patients having involutional psychotic depressions with some paranoid features likewise required phenothiazines to suppress the paranoid thought disorders which replaced their affective disorders.",

While acute exposure may cause autonomic overactivity, the chronic effect of most such compounds is a reduction in autonomic activity. This chapter will focus primarily on drugs and other chemicals that reduce autonomic activity, either directly by inhibiting the activity of otherwise functional autonomic nerve fibres and/or receptors, or indirectly by causing an autonomic neuropathy. It will conclude with a brief discussion of compounds, including naturally occurring toxins and venoms, that cause an abnormal increase in autonomic activity. Direct reduction of autonomic activity Therapeutic drugs Drugs whose pharmacodynamic effects depend on direct antagonism of autonomic neurotransmission are very widely used in clinical cardiovascular medicine.

The patient suffered from anxiety and inner restlessness when trying to discontinue the medication, as well as from fatigue and forgetfulness when on medication. The medical history was free of psychiatric disorders and abuse of psychoactive substances.Apart from mild attention and concentration deficits with a mildly depressed mood the psychiatric findings were normal.Consistent with the preliminary diagnosis of a primary non-benzodiazepine dependence (zopiclone), after withdrawal of zopiclone the patient suffered from inner restlessness and psychomotor agitation, vague abdominal pain, and hypertension. The symptoms subsided after administration and subsequent gradual discontinuation of diazepam.Zopiclone dependence has repeatedly been reported in patients with pre-existing substance-related addictions, and in patients with other psychiatric disorders. Primary zopiclone dependence may be regarded as rare. Despite the low dependence potential of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, the indication of prescription should be thoroughly considered.",

      "abstract": "Individuals suffering from mental illnesses, unfortunately, have a shorter lifespan. An increase in mortality rates is primarily due to physical illness, unhealthy lifestyle, and associated comorbidities. Antipsychotic medications, previously known as tranquilizers, antipsychotics, or neuroleptics, can alleviate or attenuate symptoms related to psychosis, delusion, and/or hallucinations and are used in the treatment of psychosis, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, or Alzheimer's disease. Within hours to days, these medications alleviate symptoms and reduce confusion in individuals with psychosis; however, the full effect may take longer than usual in some cases. Importantly, these drugs do not cure the disease, but only treat the symptoms of the disease. The treatment is adjusted to reduce any psychotic symptoms while keeping the adverse effects to a minimum level. Antipsychotics may lead to increased risk of diseases, including but not limited to, diabetes, obesity, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular, renal, or respiratory disorders. Improved dosages, polypharmacy, and age-specific treatment play an important role in limiting the comorbidities, as well as the side effects. Further research and clinical attention are required to understand the functioning of these medications. The review focuses on the use of antipsychotic medications in different diseases and their effect on mental health.",

Various drug therapies are successfully employed in numerous geriatric conditions. Pharmacotherapy is discussed under six headings: Substitution or replacement therapy —whenever there is a break-down of metabolic processes due to deficiency of an important factor in the complex chain of metabolism; Anticoagulants and Vasodilators — when there is sufficient evidence to believe that decreased brain metabolism plays an important role in the causation of impaired behavioural functioning and inertness; Sedatives (minor tranquillizers) — to control restlessness, tension, anxiety and insomnia; Neuroleptics (major tranquillizers) — for the treatment of psychotic symptoms, e.g. hallucinations, delusions and manneristic behaviour; and Anti-depressants — for the treatment of various depressions. It must be remembered that the general indications for these treatments are the same in geriatric as in younger patients, but the geriatric patient is often more sensitive to drugs and to the side effects they may produce.",

Adolescence is a developmental period when emotions can be extreme when elicited by both positive and negative experiences. The major internalizing disorders are depressive disorders and anxiety disorders; related ones in this domain include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder, and autism. Treatment effectiveness for teenagers with substance use disorder and a coexisting internalizing disorder is optimized when both domains are addressed. Behavioral-based treatment approaches with concurrent psychotropic medication are part of the treatment plan. One of the most common mental and behavioral disorders among adolescents in the United States is depression. For those suffering from a major depressive disorder, symptoms include a period of at least 2 weeks of a very persistent low mood accompanied with low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, and problems with sleep, energy, and concentration.",

Noncognitive feature is a terminology that draws the distinction between cognitive loss and the heterogeneous group of symptoms that include psychiatric symptoms such as depression, hallucinations, delusions and misidentifications. This term also includes behavioral disturbances such as aggression, agitation, pacing and eating disorders (Burns et al., 1990). An alternative expression is neuropsychiatric features (Cummings et al., 1994). The term \"Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia\" (BPSD) has also been defined as \"symptoms of disturbed perception, thought content, mood and behavior that frequently occur in patients with dementia\" (Consensus Conference on the Behavioral Disturbances of Dementia, 1996). Noncognitive disorders can cause distress both to patients and carers. Such changes are often a determinant for institutional care. A study reported that psychotic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations and delusions) were present in about 50% of patients with dementia and disruptive behavior (e.g., physical violence, hiding things, wandering, demanding or critical behavior) in up to 70% (Rabins et al., 1982). These include hitting, yelling, grabbing people, wandering, hoarding, and repetitive gestures and questioning (Moak & Fisher, 1990; Reisberg et al., 1987).

      "abstract": "There is a worse prognosis for psychosis and schizophrenia when onset is in childhood or adolescence. However, outcomes are improved with early detection and treatment. Psychotic symptoms can be associated with a variety of disorders including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, drug-induced psychosis, personality disorder, epilepsy and autistic spectrum disorder. Positive symptoms include hallucinations and delusions. Negative symptoms include apathy, lack of drive, poverty of speech, social withdrawal and self-neglect. The DSM IV criteria for schizophrenia include two or more of the following: hallucinations, delusions, disorganised speech, grossly disorganised or catatonic behaviour and negative symptoms. Adults may raise concerns about social withdrawal, bizarre ideas, a change in behaviour or a decline in achievement. Most children and young people with psychotic symptoms will not go on to develop psychosis or schizophrenia. Direct enquiry may be needed to elicit suspected unusual beliefs or hallucinations. To distinguish unusual ideas from delusions the ideas should be tested for fixity. For example by asking: 'Are you sure? Could there be another explanation?' Mood and anxiety symptoms should be explored. The assessment should include a developmental history with particular attention to premorbid functioning. Failure to make expected progress whether personal, social or academic is significant. Better outcomes in terms of symptoms and social function are associated with a shorter duration of untreated psychosis. The detection of psychotic symptoms in primary care therefore warrants an urgent referral to secondary care mental health services for assessment and treatment.",

      "title": "Obsessive–compulsive disorder as the onset of bipolar disorder in adolescence",
      "abstract": "The onset of bipolar disorder (BD) usually occurs during adolescence or early adulthood. Several studies show an alarming duration of untreated illness (5 years) with 60% of people with BD reporting 1–4 different diagnoses before that of BD, with consequent treatment delay. In recent years, a growing interest in preliminary phases of BD or sub-syndromic signs has been reported. Obsessive–compulsive disorder often anticipates the onset of bipolar disorder with serious consequences due to treatment delay, self-threatening behaviors, and admissions. Several clinical features have been linked to a higher risk of developing disorders from the bipolar spectrum (e.g., mood switches, emotional lability, depressive episodes, anxiety, sleep disorders, attention deficits, behavioral disturbance, and substance use disorder). Such symptoms or syndromes may be shown some years (from 1.8 to 7.3) before an acute manic or hypomanic episode and adolescents with anxiety disorders are more prone to developing BD in early adulthood.1 As a consequence, anxiety disorders might be predictive of BD onset.2 In particular, the prevalence of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) in BD patients is around 17%, with an even higher comorbidity during adolescence (24.2%) compared to adulthood (13.5%). OCD might represent a key feature in the onset of BD if shown during adolescence. In fact, prior OCD is associated with the development of BD with a hazard ratio of 6.9.3 Moreover, anxiety has a negative impact on BD outcomes since it is associated with a worse prognosis, increasing self-threatening behaviors, and substance misuse. Diagnostic delays have serious consequences linked to inappropriate treatments, increasing admissions and suicide risk. The identification of prodromal symptoms is crucial to detect subjects at higher risk, taking advantage of a clinical staging model. Furthermore, a progression from OCD to BD should be strictly taken into consideration when treatment options are scrutinized. The NICE and APA guidelines suggest cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; including exposure and response prevention - ERP) as the first option in the treatment of OCD during adolescence, with prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) if the patient declines psychotherapy or symptoms persist and compromise their quality of life. Unfortunately, antidepressant prescription may elicit manic symptoms and facilitate the onset of BD. Accordingly, pharmacological options should be carefully evaluated and close monitoring is highly recommended. No conflict of interest to disclose.

Apomorphine, an injectable dopamine agonist recently introduced in the United States, is indicated for the management of hypomobility associated with advanced Parkinson's disease. Subcutaneous apomorphine is effective for rapid and consistent rescue from hypomobility, with a magnitude of motor improvement similar to that of levodopa. The effect begins within 20 minutes after dosing and lasts approximately 100 minutes. Therapeutic rescue doses are 2-6 mg, and patients typically require approximately three rescue doses/day. Apomorphine is associated with a clinically significant potential to cause nausea and orthostatic hypotension. These potential effects can be managed with antiemetic prophylaxis and appropriate determination of the therapeutic rescue dose.",

      "title": "A Case of Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder",
      "abstract": "Aims: Background: Depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR), classified under ICD–11 code 6B66, involves persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Depersonalization refers to a sense of detachment from one’s thoughts, emotions, or body, whereas derealization involves perceiving the external world as unreal or distorted. These symptoms cause significant distress or impairment, are not attributable to other mental disorders, substance use, or medical conditions, and occur while reality testing remains intact. Methods: Case Report. An 18-year-old female A-level student presented with a two-year history of frequent episodes in which her surroundings, including people and familiar environments, felt unreal. These episodes varied in duration and were highly distressing, particularly during emotional extremes such as heightened happiness or stress. Symptoms were most pronounced in the evenings or when she was unoccupied, leading to emotional breakdowns. Despite these experiences, she remained aware of her own reality, with disturbances centred on external perceptions. Her symptoms began following a nine-month psychiatric hospitalization. Prior to admission, she experienced unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, and in the absence of an identifiable physical cause, she was diagnosed with conversion disorder. The hospitalization was distressing due to frequent invasive procedures, a perceived sense of blame for her condition, and feelings of entrapment. She subsequently developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of medical settings. However, DPDR symptoms persisted outside of PTSD-related re-experiencing episodes, causing ongoing distress and impairment. Results: Discussion: This case highlights the complex interplay between DPDR and PTSD, particularly following medical trauma. While dissociative symptoms frequently occur in PTSD, ICD–11 differentiates DPDR as a distinct disorder when symptoms persist beyond re-experiencing episodes. In this case, the patient’s prolonged hospitalization, combined with perceived invalidation and invasive interventions, likely contributed to the development of DPDR as a maladaptive dissociative response. The exacerbation of symptoms during emotional extremes aligns with research indicating that dissociation may function as an affect regulation mechanism. Trauma-related dissociation has been linked to disruptions in emotional processing, potentially interfering with adaptive coping strategies. This underscores the importance of targeted psychological interventions to reduce distress and improve functional outcomes. Conclusion: A trauma-informed, multidisciplinary approach is essential in managing this patient’s complex presentation. Psychological interventions such as EMDR or trauma-focused CBT should be integrated with ongoing medical care to address both dissociative symptoms and physical health concerns. Collaborative management between psychiatric and medical teams will be crucial in promoting long-term recovery, enhancing her psychological resilience, and improving overall quality of life.",

Cognitive functions other than memory, specifically self-awareness, are spared [3]. Marijuana use has been linked to transient global amnesia in some cases [4-6], presumably through the effect of Δ9- Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on the Cannabinoid receptors (CB1) that are located presynaptically in the lipid membranes of neurons, which results in neuromodulation with changing the number of neurochemicals such as glutamergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic systems, all of which end up affecting the memory [7].",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction in a patient being treated with antidepressant medications may be due to the underlying depression, a coexisting medical illness, disruption of interpersonal relationships, or it may be a side effect of the medication. Almost all antidepressants are associated with sexual side effects that go above and beyond any symptoms that can be explained by the disease process itself. The incidence of such sexual side effects can be as high as 92% for some antidepressants. Some of the newer antidepressants currently on the market seem to have a lower incidence of sexual dysfunction as a side effect. In view of the fairly common occurrence of these unwanted effects, and their potential contribution to noncompliance, careful selection of antidepressant medications is necessary. A variety of treatment options is available, including decreasing the dosage of medication to the lowest-effective level, adjunctive medications (such as cyproheptadine, bethanechol, yohimbine, and amantadine, as well as other antidepressants) to counteract the adverse sexual effects, or switching to another antidepressant. The treatment of antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction requires a creative approach on the part of the treating psychiatrist, and must be individualized to the patient.",

      "title": "Diagnostic guidelines for bipolar depression: a probabilistic approach",
      "abstract": "Objectives: There are currently no accepted diagnostic criteria for bipolar depression for either research or clinical purposes. This paper aimed to develop recommendations for diagnostic criteria for bipolar I depression. Methods: Studies on the clinical characteristics of bipolar and unipolar depression were reviewed. To identify relevant papers, literature searches using PubMed and Medline were undertaken. Results: There are no pathognomonic characteristics of bipolar I depression compared to unipolar depressive disorder. There are, however, replicated findings of clinical characteristics that are more common in both bipolar I depression and unipolar depressive disorder, respectively, or which are observed in unipolar‐depressed patients who ‘convert’ (i.e., who later develop hypo/manic symptoms) to bipolar disorder over time. The following features are more common in bipolar I depression (or in unipolar ‘converters’ to bipolar disorder): ‘atypical’ depressive features such as hypersomnia, hyperphagia, and leaden paralysis; psychomotor retardation; psychotic features, and/or pathological guilt; and lability of mood. Furthermore, bipolar‐depressed patients are more likely to have an earlier age of onset of their first depressive episode, to have more prior episodes of depression, to have shorter depressive episodes, and to have a family history of bipolar disorder. The following features are more common in unipolar depressive disorder: initial insomnia/reduced sleep; appetite, and/or weight loss; normal or increased activity levels; somatic complaints; later age of onset of first depressive episode; prolonged episodes; and no family history of bipolar disorder. Conclusions: Rather than proposing a categorical diagnostic distinction between bipolar depression and major depressive disorder, we would recommend a ‘probabilistic’ (or likelihood) approach. While there is no ‘point of rarity’ between the two presentations, there is, rather, a differential likelihood of experiencing the above symptoms and signs of depression. A table outlining draft proposed operationalized criteria for such an approach is provided. The specific details of such a probabilistic approach need to be further explored. For example, to be useful, any diagnostic innovation should inform treatment choices.",

      "abstract": "It is difficult to differentiate whether neuropsychiatric symptoms are caused by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or psychiatric background, coexisting disorders or drug-induced side effects. The aim of this paper is to present two cases of psychotic symptoms (bipolar and paranoid disorder) induced by chloroquine. Case 1: Severe depressive episode with psychotic features appeared in the context of third SLE exacerbation and chloroquine treatment. Hydroxychloroquine was used instead and symptoms resolved. Later, manic episode (with psychotic features) emerged several days after chloroquine was prescribed for concomitant arthritis. Since that time, chloroquine has been withdrawn. Currently the patient is undergoing treatment with hydroxychloroquine and psychiatric drugs with good response. Case 2: The second patient started to suffer from headaches and being lightheaded three days after chloroquine administration and within next few days feeling of derealization and poorly defining persecutory delusions accompanied by strong anxiety with occasional visual illusions occurred with clear consciousness. After eighteen days chloroquine was withdrawn and after two days all the symptoms resolved. Clinicians should be vigilant for possible psychiatric disorder when using chloroquine in patients with SLE. Such cases are probably rare and may include both paranoid and bipolar spectrum disorders. Studies on interactions of chloroquine with brain neurotransmitter systems are needed. Hydroxychloroquine may represent lower risk considering psychiatric complications. Mechanism of the difference is currently not known.",

Neither presentation consistently shows enough specific features to warrant the diagnosis of 'cannabis psychosis' as a distinct clinical entity.

      "title": "Some Considerations of the Tolerability of Ketamine for ECT Anesthesia",
      "abstract": "Most anesthetic agents used for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) have few intrinsic adverse effects. Ketamine, however, is well known to be associated with a variety of adverse effects including nausea, dizziness, and psychotomimetic phenomena. Over the past several decades, there have been numerous reports on the use of ketamine for ECT anesthesia, with varied assessments on how prominent these adverse effects are in the ECT situation. Ketamine has received a resurgence of interest as an ECT anesthetic of late owing to its established independent antidepressant effects and to theoretical reasons why it might lessen the cognitive adverse effects of ECT. In this case series, the author reviews the experience with 14 patients who had undergone ECT who were switched to ketamine as anesthetic from methohexital at the preference of the treating anesthesiologist. All 14 patients spontaneously reported a strong preference not to be given ketamine again due to bothersome adverse effects. The latter consisted of either vestibular-type symptoms (nausea/vomiting, dizziness, and vertigo) or psychotomimetic effects (dissociative phenomena). It is concluded that ketamine is not free of adverse effects when used as an ECT anesthetic. Electroconvulsive therapy clinicians should be vigilant about assessing for these effects when ketamine is used, and consideration should be given to using a benzodiazepine such as diazepam or midazolam at seizure termination when ketamine anesthesia is used to prevent bothersome adverse effects seen upon awakening.",

      "abstract": "The psychic reevocation of disturbance of the colon or disturbances of other body districts not felt by the patient at the time facilitates the accentuation of colon motility or tone, leading to the exacerbation of the pathogenetic premises of the disturbances complained of. The colonmetrographic findings are instructive in this respect. Direct functional disturbance of various districts is also suggested, and the pathology of such forms in psychosomatically oriented patients is described. Such orientation takes the form of a ready translation of ideas into rather diffuse somatic changes that are partly aspecific, due to the predominance of response mechanisms that are more physiological than psychological. The picture is one of a primordial reaction to difficulties and problems, coupled with increased stress, sometimes to the points of vegetative or motor storms, in the expectation of help from outside, such help being represented in the past by intervention on the part of the mother.",

      "abstract": "The majority of opioid dependent patients suffer from various psychiatric and somatic comorbid diseases like mood and anxiety disorders, psychotic diseases, personality disorders, HIV infection, Hepatitis B and C. If medical treatment is needed, grouping active substances to FDA Pregnancy Categories (A, B, C, D or X) may be helpful. The majority of substances reported here only fulfill the FDA-categories C or D, which means that they could have teratogenic effects, but with probably different rank order. First of all, referring to mood, personality and anxiety disorders, the focus should be laid on non-pharmacological treatment by offering psychotherapeutic and supporting psychosocial interventions to the patients. However, opioid dependent pregnant patients who suffer from severe diseases such as psychosis, bipolar affective disorder or severe depression, may need psychoactive medication like antipsychotics, antidepressants or mood stabilizers to prevent them from harm caused by psychotic ideas and actions and/or suicidality. However these medications may comprise fetal risks, especially when taken together, and therefore should only be used when benefit and risks are considered together with patients and their relatives. It is important to avoid acute or renewed psychiatric decompensation. We present the current differentiated knowledge for therapy of opioid dependent patients with antipsychotics, antidepressants (e.g. higher fetal risk in case of treatment with fluoxetine and paroxetine) or mood stabilizers. All of them should only be used after considering benefit and risks. During pregnancy, there should not be switched between different antidepressant drugs. Referring mood stabilizers, the intake of valproic acid should be avoided in pregnancy or at least, dosage should be kept as low as possible since severe teratogenetic effects are known. In addition the specific drug treatment of HIV and hepatitis B during pregnancy is described. During childbirth HIV-infected patients should receive zidovudine intravenously to prevent vertical transmission. Co-infection with hepatitis C cannot be treated during pregnancy, since interferons are associated with a severe risk of fetal malformations and ribavirin has teratogenic effects; for this reason interferon therapy should be started after delivery.",

      "abstract": "Smoking is becoming increasingly concentrated in people with co-factors such as depression, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, and bulimia/bingeing. These behavioral or cognitive patterns may be adaptive or neutral in the conditions under which we evolved but maladaptive in environments requiring alertness for extended periods, where a fully mobilized fight-or-flight response is inappropriate, and where food availability makes lack of an \"appestat\" a liability. Such conditions are amenable to management by nicotine because of its ability to produce small but reliable adjustments in relevant cognitive and behavioral functions. Moreover, symptomatology may be unmasked or exacerbated by nicotine abstinence, persisting beyond the usual time-course for nicotine withdrawal, which may explain the particular attraction of smoking and the difficulty these individuals experience in quitting without necessarily requiring that they be more nicotine-dependent. The implications are: (1) a better understanding of the evolutionary psychobiology of smoking may promote development of tailored interventions for smokers with co-factors; (2) nicotine may have therapeutic applications for non-smokers with co-factors; (3) because smoking has a fairly high heritability index, and because of evidence of assortative mating, special prevention efforts targeting children of smokers with co-factors, as well as early identification of the co-factor itself, may be needed.",

Any case of decline can be explained on one of four bases. 1. A tree may decline primarily as the result of chronic irritation by a single agent. 2. A tree may decline because of damage by secondary agents after an injurious event such as defoliation or major wounding. The same agents would not cause decline in an uninjured tree, and the injury alone would not cause decline. 3. Chronic irritation by one or more agents may diminish the tolerance or resistance of a tree to another agent that then incites decline. Various factors including those that predisposed the tree and incited decline may then contribute to further decline. 4. Trees of similar age growing in groups tend to display group behaviour including premature senescence (synchronous cohort senescence) in response to stress.",

Although tic symptoms have been reported since antiquity, systematic study of individuals with tic disorders dates from the nineteenth century. In addition to tics, individuals with tic disorders may present with a broad array of behavioral difficulties including disinhibited speech or conduct, impulsivity, distractibility, motoric hyperactivity, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (Leckman and Cohen, 1998). Alternatively, a sizable portion of children and adolescents with tics will be free of coexisting developmental or emotional difficulties. Scientific opinion has been divided on how broadly to conceive the spectrum of maladaptive behaviors associated with Tourette’s syndrome (TS) (Comings, 1988; Shapiro et al., 1988).",

      "title": "Stress and cognition",
      "abstract": "Stress can affect cognition in many ways, with the outcome (i.e., facilitating or impairing) depending on a combination of factors related to both stress and the cognitive function under study. Among the factors identified as particularly relevant to define the cognitive effects of stress are the intensity or magnitude of stress, its origin (i.e., whether triggered by the task or externally), and its duration (i.e., whether acute or chronically delivered). At the cognitive end, the specific cognitive operation (e.g., implicit or explicit memory, long-term or working memory, goal-directed or habit learning) and information processing phases (e.g., learning, consolidation, and retrieval) are essential as well to define stress effects. The emerging view is that mild stress tends to facilitate cognitive function, particularly in implicit memory or simple declarative tasks or when the cognitive load is not excessive. Exposure to high or very high stress acutely (whether elicited by the cognitive task or experienced before being trained or tested in the task) or chronically impairs the formation of explicit memories and, more generally, of those that require complex, flexible reasoning (as typically observed for hippocampus- and prefrontal cortex-related functions) while improving performance of implicit memory and well-rehearsed tasks (as reported for amygdala-dependent conditioning tasks and for striatum-related processes). In addition to these general principles, there are important individual differences in the cognitive impact of stress, with gender and age being particularly influencing factors.

Patients describe a number of accompanying sensations: lack of energy, exhaustion, restlessness, boredom, lack of interest in activities, weakness, dyspnoea, pain, altered taste and itching. John and his family may feel there is no point in planning ahead, while professionals may assume the fatigue is due to the illness and cannot be changed. Lethargy is a feature of feeling low in mood and of a clinical depression. Drowsiness occurring in minutes, hours or days needs urgent review. Possible causes are drugs, severe infection, hypoglycaemia, hypercalcaemia, haemorrhage and hypoadrenalism.",

      "title": "AGMATINE AMELIORATES SOCIAL ISOLATION INDUCED OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR IN MICE",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is defined as recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses (obsession) and/or repetitive purposeful behaviors (compulsions). 13% of children and adults are suffering from this condition. There are evidences that increased OCD symptom severity has been linked with diminished quality of life [3] and also increased functional impairment. Social isolation is defined as a state in which the individual lacks a sense of belonging socially, lacks engagement with others, has a minimal number of social contacts and they are deficient in fulfilling and quality relationships.Social isolation (SI) causes a variety of behavioral changes like hyper-locomotion, anxiety, impulsivity, aggression. These behavioral abnormalities in rodents may be related to the symptoms in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism, schizophrenia, depression. In addition, Social isolation and OCD are associated with similar neurochemical changes like hypofunction of serotonin, dopamine and glutamate hyperfunction.These changes might be one of the causes for exacerbation of OCB in social isolation. Agmatine [4(amino butyl) guanidine] is an endogenous amine, widely present in mammalian brain and proposed as a novel neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.It is a metabolite of L-arginine via arginine decarboxylase and hydrolyzed to putrescine and urea by agmatinase. Recently, Agmatine is evidenced for anti-compulsive like effect . It has also been reported for its effectiveness in schizophrenia , addictive behavior , stress,anxiety [11] and depression . Besides this, Agmatine is evidenced for modulating levels of serotonin [13] as well as dopamine and glutamate levels .Incidentally, these neurotransmitters levels are altered in social isolation and OCD. [14] Hence, in the present study, the effect of agmatine was investigated in social isolation induced OCD in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental Animals Adult male albino Swiss mice (22–25 g) were group housed (n=6) under a standard 12 h light/dark cycle and controlled conditions of temperature (23 ± 2C) and humidity (55 ± 10%). Mice were acclimatized to laboratory conditions for 7 days before carrying out the experiments. The animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC) (SCOP/IAEC/2013/14/151). Drugs Agmatine sulfate was purchased from SigmaAldrich Ltd., USA. Drug solutions were prepared fresh and doses are expressed in terms of their free bases. Isolation condition Mice were housed singly in cages (21 x 38 x 14 cm) under a controlled 12-hour/12-hour light-dark cycle, Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric condition characterized by persistent intrusive thoughts (obsessions), repetitive ritualistic behaviors (compulsions) and excessive anxiety. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is classified as an anxiety disorder under DSM-IV-TR guidelines. In OCD, the levels of serotonin and nitric oxide decreased; whereas levels of dopamine and glutamate increased in brain. Environmental conditions such as isolation from social surroundings lead to anxiety and increased level of aggression. The present study was designed to examine the effect of agmatine in social isolation induced obsessive-compulsive behavior on marble burying behavior and locomotor activity. Agmatine (20, 40 and 80 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered in different groups of mice; activity was observed 30 min after dosing. Acute treatment of agmatine (40 and 80 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced marble burying behavior. Moreover, hyperlocomotion was observed in socially isolated animals and agmatine was found to attenuate the same without affecting basal locomotions. In conclusion, agmatine effectively decreases social isolation induced obsessive-compulsive behavior in mice.",

      "abstract": "Climate solutions are available now, are widespread, and support psychological health.Increasing adoption of active commuting, public transportation, green spaces, and clean energy are all solutions that people can choose to support and integrate into their daily lives.These climate solutions, among others, can help to curb the stress, anxiety, and other mental illnesses incurred from the decline of economies, infrastructure, and social identity that comes from damage to the climate.Major acute mental health impacts include increases in trauma and shock, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), compounded stress, anxiety, substance abuse, and depression.Climate changeinduced extreme weather, changing weather patterns, damaged food and water resources, and polluted air impact human mental health.Increased levels of stress and distress from these factors can also put strains on social relationships and even have impacts on physical health, such as memory loss, sleep disorders, immune suppression, and changes in digestion.Major chronic mental health impacts include higher rates of aggression and violence, more mental health emergencies, an increased sense of helplessness, hopelessness, or fatalism, and intense feelings of loss.These feelings of loss may be due to profound changes in a personally important place (such as one's home) and/ or a sense that one has lost control over events in one's life due to disturbances from climate change.Additionally, a sense of loss regarding one's personal or occupational identity can arise when treasured objects are destroyed by a disaster or place-based occupations are disrupted by climate change.Personal relationships and the ways in which people interact in communities and with each other are affected by a changing climate.Compounded stress from a changing environment, ecomigration, and/or ecoanxiety can affect community mental well-being through the loss of social identity and cohesion, hostility, violence, and interpersonal and intergroup aggression.Recent increases in natural disasters illustrate the relationship between the acceleration of climate change and severe weather.Areas that endure a natural disaster face a number of risks and difficulties.Direct physical impacts range from brute physical trauma to more pernicious effects, like increased incidence of infectious disease, asthma, heart disease, and lung problems.These physical health impacts interact with mental health impacts, which is why they are detailed in this report on page 39.In this section, we use floods, the most common form of natural disasters (EM-DAT, 2011, as reported in Alderman, Turner, & Tong, 2012), as an example to illustrate the ways in which direct health impacts of disasters come about.",

Many with panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and/or generalized anxiety disorder present initially to their primary care clinician. Effective treatment is possible in a busy primary care setting; therapy involves patient education and pharmacotherapy. Once other potential causes of symptoms of an anxiety disorder have been ruled out, the first step is to reassure the patient that he or she has a psychological condition-a very common one-and that symptoms are not the result of an undiagnosed disease or going crazy or losing control. Educate and inform patients that complete clinical remission is achievable, often with medication alone. Begin treatment on day 1 with a long-acting benzodiazepine-such as alprazolam XR or clonazepam-or with the anxiolytic agent buspirone; at the same time, start a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). The anxiolytic agent allays acute somatic symptoms until the full effects of the SSRI are manifest (often 4 to 6 weeks). The anxiolytic can then be gradually tapered. Referral to a psychiatrist for psychotherapy may be indicated when a patient refuses or cannot tolerate drug therapy, or when response to therapy is inadequate.",

      "abstract": "Les médecins sont souvent confrontés à des situations d’absence d’efficacité ou d’efficacité jugée insuffisante d’un traitement antidépresseur de première intention. On estime ainsi qu’entre un et deux tiers des épisodes dépressifs majeurs ne répondront pas à un premier antidépresseur prescrit. Mais avant de parler d’inefficacité d’un traitement, il est important d’évaluer certains aspects susceptibles d’entraver l’efficacité de ce dernier. Un examen clinique complet ainsi que certains examens complémentaires (TSH par exemple) seront dans un premier temps nécessaires afin de d’éliminer une pathologie organique responsable d’une symptomatologie dépressive, qui pourra régresser une fois cette pathologie traitée. Une cause iatrogène médicamenteuse devra aussi être éliminée, ainsi qu’une cause toxique (abus de substances). L’entretien clinique nous permettra ensuite de confirmer le diagnostic d’épisode dépressif majeur et de son évolution sous traitement, ainsi que d’éliminer des diagnostics psychiatriques différentiels (un trouble bipolaire par exemple) ou certaines comorbidités psychiatriques, tels qu’un trouble de la personnalité. Après s’être assuré que la posologie prescrite et la durée de traitement antidépresseur sont adéquates, l’un des critères fondamentaux à évaluer est l’observance du traitement prescrit. Il est de plus indispensable d’évaluer le contexte de vie et les facteurs de stress parfois responsables d’une chronicisation de la symptomatologie dépressive. Il est donc nécessaire de prendre le temps d’évaluer globalement la situation pour s’assurer que le traitement antidépresseur mis en place est réellement inefficace, avant de passer à une autre stratégie thérapeutique.",

In serious situations, it might show as a dissociative disorder, which extremely impairs psychological functioning. Dissociative trance, a type of other specified dissociative disorder (OSDD), is characterized by an abrupt loss of awareness, leading to unresponsiveness and involuntary actions. Despite being conscious, the individual may feel separated from their body, as if it were under the control of an external force. This case report represents a 22-year-old patient with no prior criminal history who experienced episodes of decreased consciousness, altered identity, and involuntary movements. These episodes were perceived as being controlled by an external force and culminated in a tragic event leading the patient to kill her children. After ruling out other potential causes like psychotic disorders, organic factors, and substance abuse, a diagnosis of dissociative trance disorder was considered. Treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines resulted in improvement of the patient's symptoms.",

      "title": "Classification of fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease",
      "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson9s disease (PD) are subject to a wide range of fluctuations in their clinical state, most of them treatment-related but some more disease-related. Short-duration motor fluctuations include freezing and paradoxic kinesis, lasting seconds to minutes. It is important to distinguish between \"off\" period freezing, which may be helped by measures to increase time \"on,\" and freezing that is present in both \"on\" and \"off\" periods, which is difficult if not impossible to treat. Medium-duration fluctuations associated with chronic L-dopa treatment include wearing-off and \"on-off\" responses, which can involve (a) return of parkinsonism, (b) dyskinesias, and(c) non-motor fluctuations. A poorly understood long-duration pharmacodynamic response to L-dopa lasting up to 2 weeks may also be seen. This may manifest as late deterioration after L-dopa is withdrawn. More importantly, and more commonly, it is important to recognize that the ultimate effect of an alteration in L-dopa treatment may take 2 weeks to equilibrate in the brain.\"Optimization\" of L-dopa therapy is therefore not a realistic expectation during an inpatient admission and is instead primarily a long-term outpatient procedure. The \"off\" state is not the same as untreated PD, and may represent rebound worsening after the beneficial effect of L-dopa has worn off. Sometimes there is also transient worsening at the onset of effect of a dose.\"Off\" period dyskinesias tend to be relatively fixed, painful, and dystonic. Biphasic (beginning and/or end of dose) dyskinesias are often severe, ballistic, and stereotypic. Peak dose or \"square wave\" dyskinesias comprise a mix of mobile dystonia or chorea that is usually painless. Many patients experience any combination of panic, anxiety, and depression in their \"off\" periods, and many also experience pain, with instant relief as they turn\"on.\" Other parameters that may vary between the \"on\" and \"off\" states include urinary and bowel dysfunction, blood pressure, respiratory function, and sweating attacks. Most but not all of these phenomena can be related to a simplistic but nevertheless usually practically useful model of differing levels of central dopaminergic stimulation. In difficult cases, an acute apomorphine challenge analogous to the effects of a \"Tensilon test\" in myasthenia gravis may help to determine whether a given clinical feature represents over- or understimulation of central dopamine receptors.",

      "title": "The association between platelet MAO-B activity and specific symptoms in PTSD",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that can develop in some subjects after exposure to extreme trauma. The most common symptoms of PTSD are re-experiencing of the traumatic event(s), avoidance of trauma stimuli, numbing and persistent hyperarousal that are present for at least a month. Since not all subjects exposed to a trauma develop PTSD, and some individuals with PTSD also develop comorbidities such as major depression, panic disorder, agitation, cognitive impairment, psychosis, drug and alcohol abuse and suicidal behavior, the extent to which individuals are vulnerable or resilient depends on different psychosocial, biological, environmental, genetic and epigenetic factors, and the complex interaction between them. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) isoenzymes type A and type B degrade serotonin, noradrenaline (mostly MAO-A) and dopamine (primarily MAO-B) and other amines. There are reports of the association between altered platelet MAO-B activity and changes in mood, behavior, and various symptoms in different neuropsychiatric disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of platelet MAO-B activity and several symptoms occurring in PTSD defined with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and its subscales. Methods: Proposed study included 459 male war veterans with PTSD of the Croatian origin. The diagnoses of PTSD and comorbid psychiatric disorders have been made using Structured Clinical Interview (SCID) based on DSM-IV criteria, Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), PANSS and its positive, negative, general, excitement, psychosis, depression and cognitive subscales. MAO-B activity was determined with spectrofluorometric method, using kynuramine as a substrate, from platelet- rich plasma, obtained through series of centrifugation of whole blood samples. Due to deviation from normal distribution, non- parametric statistical analysis was used (SigmaStat 3.5). This work was supported by Croatian Science Foundation grant IP-2014-09- 4289. Results: As expected, MAO-B activity was significantly decreased in smokers, hence whole analysis was done in smokers and non-smokers separately. All subjects were subdivided into groups with moderate and severe symptoms and those with none or mild symptoms. Platelet MAO- B activity was significantly decreased in smokers with moderate and severe symptoms of agitation vs. those with mild symptoms of agitation. Platelet MAO-B activity was drastically lower in individuals with higher psychotic, depressive, positive, general and total PANSS scores than in those with mild symptoms. Symptoms listed in the PANSS cognitive and negative subscale were not significantly associated with platelet MAO-B activity. Conclusion: Since MAO-B degrades dopamine, lower MAO-B activity can lead to higher dopamine availability in the prefrontal cortex, which might be associated with elevated psychosis and agitation levels. To elucidate the role of platelet MAO-B in development and severity of different symptoms occurring in PTSD, but also in other neuropsychiatric disorders, further studies should be focused on more specific clinical measures, and should also include genetic analysis of MAO-B variants.",

      "abstract": "To the Editor.— Buspirone is a new anxiolytic agent of the azaspirodecanedione class. A nonbenzodiazepine compound, it differs from the benzodiazepines in several important ways. It does not (a) have any anticonvulsant activity, (b) interact with the benzodiazepines or alcohol, or (c) have a demonstrated abuse potential. 1 In many ways, it is ideally suited for the treatment of mild to moderate anxiety. However, since buspirone does not interact with the benzodiazepines, it does not protect against benzodiazepine withdrawal. Such withdrawal can present as either a minor or a major abstinence syndrome, with the former being more frequent and preceding the latter. The minor abstinence syndrome consists of anxiety, restlessness, anorexia, dysphoria, and insomnia. In the major abstinence syndrome, withdrawal phenomena include grand mal seizures, delirium, and psychosis. 2,3 Withdrawal phenomena are documented for benzodiazepines with a long (eg, diazepam) or short (eg, lorazepam) half-life.

      "abstract": "Dysfunctions in the interplay among multiple neurotransmitter systems have been implicated in the pathophysiology of major psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or major depression, which display a wide range of behavioral, emotional and cognitive alterations. Particularly, schizophrenia is a highly complex and multidimensional disorder, which shows a large number of unmet needs in terms of positive, negative and cognitive symptoms control in patients by current available pharmacotherapy. Indeed, an extimated 30% of patients do not satisfactorily respond to present treatments, and only a small percentage of responding patients is able to restart a normal working life. \nThus, the complex clusters of symptoms showed by schizophrenic patients often need more than one psychiatric drug from the same or a different pharmacological class, particularly under the following conditions: 1) when monotherapy provides insufficient improvement of the core symptoms; 2) when there are concurrent additional symptoms requiring more than one class of medications; 3) to improve tolerability, by using two compounds under dose thresholds to limit side effects. \nCurrently, the choice of antipsychotic combinations is based on empirical paradigms guided by clinical responses. Some empirically-supported antipsychotic combination therapies include the following: 1) the combination of atypical antipsychotics with other atypical or typical antipsychotics in clozapine-refractory schizophrenia; 2) the addition of antipsychotics to mood stabilizers for acute mania or for maintenance in bipolar disorder [152]; 3) the addition of antipsychotics to antidepressants in treatment-resistant major depression or in psychotic depression, as well as the addition of antidepressants to antipsychotics to control prominent negative symptoms in chronic schizophrenia.Although still dearth at present, data from preclinical studies suggest that combined therapies may induce molecular changes that are sharply different, and often synergistic, as compared to those induced by individually administered drugs. \nFor instance, several studies describe a specific impact of antipsychotic-SSRI combination treatment on the expression of immediate-early genes and neurotrophic factors, different from that obtained by the administration of each drug alone. Moreover, preclinical studies have also demonstrated that both mood stabilizers and antipsychotics may impact common intracellular target molecules that are involved in the transductional pathways of dopamine signaling (i.e. AKT/GSK-3 pathway, MAP kinases pathway, postsynaptic density proteins). Finally, new multitargeting drugs, such as asenapine, have been demonstrated to concurrently impact different neurotransmission systems, which may crosslink at crucial steps along neural transductional pathways, thereby synergistically reinforce downstream signaling in selected brain areas deputed to control cognitive and behavioral functions.\nThese observations support the hypothesis that convergence at crucial steps of intracellular dopaminergic pathways could be responsible for synergistic effects obtained by the co-administration of apparently heterogeneous compounds. \nUnderstanding the biological mechanisms by which combined and multitargeting treatments act could enable a targeted selection of drugs, as well as provide further insights into the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms . \nHere we provide a set of preclinical studies whose aim was to investigate the postsynaptic molecular responses to either combined treatment strategies or novel multitargeting agents currently used in psychiatric clinical practice. \nFirst aim was to evaluate whether combined treatments may impact differentially postsynaptic genes/proteins as compared to treatments individually administered. With regards to multitargeting agents, we compared them to “older” antipsychotics in order to evaluate the different impact on postsynaptic molecules. Second goal was to determine whether combined strategies or multitargeting agents may activate postsynaptic transcripts in brain areas that are different from that elicited by standard therapies, and that may suggest better clinical efficacy on some cluster symptoms, or possibly some new adverse effects. Through topographic analysis, we aimed at providing imagines of this differential region-specific brain gene expression by the distinct compounds evaluated.\nFinally, we aimed at investigating if the different gene/protein modulation by agents administered was elicited in functionally correlated brain areas and whether animal behavior responses may relate to such a selective cortical-subcortical integrated postsynaptic molecules modulation.",

Although research studies sometimes require a speciﬁc quantitative deﬁnition, a patient’s subjective judgment that sleep is insufﬁcient, inadequate, or nonrestorative is the most important factor in clinical practice. Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint. Transient insomnia lasts less than one week, and short-term insomnia one to four weeks. Chronic insomnia, insomnia lasting more than one month, affects between 10% and 35% of the population in the western world (3,4). The number of chronic insomniacs rises with age, and women of all ages complain of insomnia more often thanmen (3,5). Insomnia is frequently associatedwith othermedical complaints and psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety, worry, and depression. Stressful life events (difﬁculties in interpersonal relationships, family discord, problems at work, and ﬁnancial troubles) may also generate a nonrestorative sleep complaint. Insomnia is not a speciﬁc illness or disease, but rather a symptom or consequence of other primary disorders. “Poor quality of sleep” is a common complaint in the family members of chronic insomniacs. However, it is difﬁcult to gauge the extent to which the emotional problems favouring the onset of a sleep disorder in adulthood are due to a genetic predisposition or the result of having lived in a family burdened by affective problems and/or interpersonal conﬂicts.",

Keyakinan-keyakinan delusional pada penderita episode depresif dengan gejala psikotik merupakan suatu distorsi kognitif, sebuah pola berpikir yang rancu dan menimbulkan kesalahan secara negatif yang meningkatkan kerentanan terhadap depresi. Studi kasus ini mengkaji klien yang didiagnosis episode depresif berat dengan gejala psikotik dari sudut pandang psikologi dengan pendekatan Teori Kognitif Beck. Seorang laki-laki bernama G, berusia 45 tahun mengurung diri dan tidak mau bertemu dengan saudara-saudaranya. Klien tidak mau mandi serta tidak shalat. Klien merasa ia tidak bisa melakukan apa-apa lagi. Menurut kakak, adik ipar, dan istri klien, klien pernah mengalami kecelakaan ketika bekerja di pabrik dan saat mengendarai sepeda motor sehingga kondisi fisiknya menurun. Klien lalu mendapatkan pemutusan hubungan kerja. Kondisi kejiwaannya terganggu. Hasil integrasi tes psikologi menunjukkan bahwa klien memiliki depresi dan kecemasan berlebihan. Teori kognitif Beck mengenai depresi mencantumkan tiga aktivitas kognitif yang mendasari munculnya sebuah gangguan, yaitu: a) negative triad (pandangan pesimistik terhadap diri sendiri, dunia, dan masa depan); b) skema atau keyakinan negatif yang dipicu oleh peristiwa/ situasi kehidupan negatif; dan c) distorsi kognitif. Negative triad berupa pandangan klien bahwa ia telah gagal, sedang dihukum, dan tidak bisa melakukan apa-apa di masa depan. Skema atau keyakinan negatif klien, yaitu meyakini bahwa karena sakitnya yang dialaminya tersebut membuatnya tidak berdaya. Distorsi Kognitif dalam bentuk overgeneralisasi, yaitu â€œSaya tidak bisa melakukan apa-apa lagiâ€. Â  Kata Kunci: depresi, gejala psikotik, keyakinan delusional, Teori Kognitif Beck, negative triad Â  Severe depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms are a form of major depression accompanied by typical psychotic symptoms such as delusions or nihilistic, non-bizarre delusions, somatic, poverty, worthlessness, or delusional beliefs about guilt and being punished, and sometimes appear hallucination. Delusional beliefs in people with depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms are a cognitive distortion, a pattern of thinking that is ambiguous and negatively causes errors that increase susceptibility to depression. This case study discusses clients diagnosed with severe depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms from a psychological perspective with Beckâ€™s Cognitive Theory approach. A 45-year-old man named G locked himself in and didn't want to see his brothers and sisters. Clients did not want to shower and did not pray. The client feels he could not do anything According to the brother, sister-in-law, and client's wife, the client had an accident while working in a factory and while riding a motorcycle so that his physical condition declined. The client then gets terminated in work. His mental condition is disturbed. The results of the integration of psychological tests show that the client has depression and excessive anxiety. Beck's cognitive theory of depression lists three cognitive activities that underlie the emergence of a disorder, namely: a) negative triads (pessimistic views of yourself, the world, and the future); b) negative schemes or beliefs triggered by negative life events/ situations; and c) cognitive distortion. Negative triad is the client's view that he has failed, is being punished, and cannot do anything in the future. The client's negative schema or belief, which is to believe that because of the pain he is experiencing makes him helpless. Cognitive Distortion in the form of overgeneralization, which is I can't do anything else.

      "abstract": "Major depression is one of the four basic forms of mood disorder. It is considered as a serious medical illness that affects a person’s behavior, feeling, mood, thoughts and also health. A patient is associated with major depression when he or she possesses at least five of these clinical symptoms; sadness (also known as depressed mood), lack of concentration, sleeping disorder such as insomnia and hypersomnia, fatigue, loss of interest, lack of appetite, excessive guilt, unworthy feeling and suicidal thoughts. The mentioned symptoms should be present for a minimum period of two weeks for the diagnosis of major depression to be established. Left untreated, major depressive disorder may interfere with daily life activities and eventually leads to suicide, which is one of the leading cause of death in the United States. In this report, the referred case study for major depressive disorder will be the scenario of a 30 year old woman who attempted suicide by consuming 8 bodrex pills. She was given psychotherapy and treated with antidepressant of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor group which indeed showed a good improvement on her health.",

Nymphomania can be defined in terms of three distinct elements: marked increase in sexual drive; extremely frequent partner sexual behavior; promiscuity. The essence of the problem, however, is the disruptive increase in desire. Causes often involve one or more of the following: acting out; atypical psychoses; alcohol and/or drug abuse; temporal lobe disorders; involvement with an inappropriate partner; response to another sexual dysfunction. Many of these women are unable to derive emotional satisfaction from sex.",

      "title": "Behavioural Effects of Anti‐epileptic Drugs",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY There is increasing evidence that various types of behavioural disturbance, other than those described for phenytoin, for example, may occur from the use of anti‐epileptic medication, and it has been suggested that these disturbances may not always be reversible. There are suspicions also that certain groups of patients—especially those with structural brain damage—are particularly susceptible. These and other factors relevant to the study of the effects of anti‐epileptic drugs on behaviour are comprehensively reviewed. It is concluded that the psycho‐pharmacology of anti‐epileptic drugs is unsatisfactory at present because of inadequate and unsophisticated reporting of behavioural change and because of the common problem of polypharmacy, and that more accurate observations are needed on less heterogeneous groups of patients than have been described in the past. RÉSUMÉ Effets des medications anti‐épileptiques sur le comportement Il devient de plus en plus évident que des types variés de troubles du comportement, autres que ceux traditionnellement attribués à la phénytoïne, par exemple, peuvent suivre l'emploi de medication anti‐épileptique; il a même été suggéré que ces troubles ne sont pas toujours réversibles. Certaines indications laissent à penser que certains groupes de malades, notamment ceux qui présentent des troubles cérébraux structuraux, sont particulièrement sensibles. Ces faits et les autres facteurs relevant d'une étude de l'action des médications anti‐épileptiques sur le comportement sont systématiquement analysés. L'auteur concluent qu'à l'heure actuelle la psychopharmacologie des médications anti‐épileptiques n'est pas satisfaisante en raison de rapports inadéquats et non qualifiés sur les troubles du comportement ainsi que sur le problème commun des associations médicamenteures. Il est indispensable de disposer d'observations plus précises, de groupes de malades moins hétérogènes que ce qui a été fait dans le passé. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Verhaltenseinflüsse von Antiepileptika Es gibt zunehmend Hinweise darauf, daß verschiedene Arten von Verhaltensstörungen, andere als die zum Beispiel traditionell vom Diphenylhydantoin beschriebenen, bei der Anwendung von Antiepileptika auftreten können; es wurde vermutet, daß die Störungen nicht in alien Fällen reversibel sein könnten. Es gibt weiterhin Vermutungen, daß eine bestimmte Gruppe von Patienten—besonders solche mit strukturellen Hirnschädigungen—im besonderen dafür empfänglich sind. Es wird eine umfassende Übersicht dieser und anderer, für diese Studie der Effekte antikonvulsiver Medikamente auf das Verhalten relevanter Faktoren gegeben. Es wird festgestellt, daß die Psychopharmakologie der Antikonvulsiva zum gegenwärtigen Zeitpunkt unzureichend ist, da adäquate und sorgfältige Berichte über Verhaltensanderungen und die allgemeinen Probleme der Polypharmazie fehlen; es werden genauere Beobachtungen an weniger heterogenen Patientengruppen benötigt, als sie bisher beschrieben sind. RESUMEN Efectos sobre la conducta de los fármacos antiepilépticos Hay una evidencia creciente de que diversos tipos de alteraciones en el comportamiento, además de los ya tradicionalmente descritos para la fenitoína por ejemplo, pueden aparecer por el uso de medicación antiepiléptica, y se ha sugerido que estas alteraciones no siempre pueden ser reversibles. Hay sospechas también de que algunos grupos de pacientes, especialmente aquellos con lesión estructural cerebral, sen particularmente susceptibles. Se revisan de forma complet estos y otros factores en relación con el estudio de los efectos de los fármacos antiepilépticos sobre el comportamiento. Se concluye que la psicofarmacología de los fármacos antiepilépticos no es satisfactoria en el momento presente debido a unas comunicaciones inadecuadas o no sofisticadas sobre los cambios del comportamiento y el problema común de la polifarmacia, y que es necesaria una observación más atenta en grupos de pacientes menos heterogéneos de los que han sido descritos en el pasado.",

      "title": "Neurology and psychiatry in Babylon",
      "abstract": "We here review Babylonian descriptions of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including epilepsy, stroke, psychoses, obsessive compulsive disorder, phobias, psychopathic behaviour, depression and anxiety. Most of these accounts date from the first Babylonian dynasty of the first half of the second millennium BC, within a millennium and a half of the origin of writing. The Babylonians were remarkably acute and objective observers of medical disorders and human behaviour. Their detailed descriptions are surprisingly similar to modern 19th and 20th century AD textbook accounts, with the exception of subjective thoughts and feelings which are more modern fields of enquiry. They had no knowledge of brain or psychological function. Some neuropsychiatric disorders, e.g. stroke or facial palsy, had a physical basis requiring the attention of a physician or asû, using a plant and mineral based pharmacology; some disorders such as epilepsy, psychoses, depression and anxiety were regarded as supernatural due to evil demons or spirits, or the anger of personal gods, and thus required the intervention of the priest or ašipu; other disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder and psychopathic behaviour were regarded as a mystery. The Babylonians were the first to describe the clinical foundations of neurology and psychiatry. We discuss these accounts in relation to subsequent and more modern clinical descriptions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Delirium is a highly prevalent neuropsychiatric syndrome. It is defined by acute disturbance in attention, a change in cognition, or a perceptual derangement. Delirium can be precipitated by any somatic factor, which includes a variety of different illnesses, surgery, or substance (medication) intoxication or withdrawal. Predisposing factors are higher age and cognitive and functional impairment, among others. A final common pathway seems to be the most plausible for this multifactorial syndrome. The current leading candidate for the final pathway is the neurotransmitter state of relative acetylcholine deficiency and dopamine excess, together with an exaggerated inflammatory cascade. Although prevention of delirium should be the main aim, treatment consists of non-pharmacologic measures, reversing the precipitating conditions, and judicious use of antipsychotics in severely agitated patients only. Delirium is independently associated with an increase in mortality, impaired physical and cognitive recovery, and increased hospital costs.",

Their thoughts can be scattered and require significant effort to organize, often resulting in sentences that do not come out as intended, making little sense to others. Methods : Two Patients with psychasthenia are unable to resist specific actions or thoughts, regardless of their maladaptive nature and have insufficient control over their conscious thinking and memory, sometimes wandering aimlessly and/or forgetting what they were doing. Results : The constant mental effort induces physiological fatigue, which worsens the condition. Nevertheless, psychasthenia has become a forgotten disorder. We observed two cases that are worthy of the original definition of psychasthenia. Conclusions : It can be concluded that patients with psychasthenia complain of sinking because of a reduction in psychological tension or an effort to recover the reduction in tension.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome affecting movement, emotion, speech, and behavior, which commonly occurs secondary to medical or psychiatric disorders and with comorbid illnesses. We report the case of an 18-year-old male with a history of depression, anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, polysubstance use, and previous suicide attempts who presented to the hospital from a residential eating disorders treatment facility, due to psychomotor slowing. The patient scored 3 or lower on the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS), but he showed marked improvement following 2 mg of intravenous lorazepam. The patient was referred for ECT, experienced dramatic improvement, and was discharged at his baseline functioning. His discharge diagnosis was catatonic syndrome secondary to severe melancholic depression. Catatonia may present a diagnostic challenge as no single catatonia screener captures all possible phenotypes. The patient consistently scored low on the BFCRS but he had a clear response to standard-of-care catatonia treatment. Psychomotor slowing is common in catatonia but is not designated as a catatonic feature in either the DSM-5 or the BFCRS. This case also presented diagnostic complexity as the patient initially presented with malnutrition and concern about a possible eating disorder. This report highlights that diagnosing catatonia is challenging, particularly in the context of medical complexity, and that there are discrepancies between diagnostic tools. When suspicion of catatonia is high, despite low individual screening scores, clinicians may consider alternative screening instruments or empiric treatment.",

      "abstract": "The progression of Alzheimer s disease (AD) is linked with the appearance of symptoms in three key domains, namely activities of daily living (ADL), behaviour and cognition. The development and decline of these symptoms gives rise to a loss in the patient s functional capacity and contributes to the social, health care and economic costs associated with the disease. Tests suggest that the onset of these symptoms, in AD and in other types of dementia (e.g. frontotemporal dementia, dementia in Parkinson s disease and vascular dementia [VaD]), can be attributed to the loss of acetylcholine and cholinergic neurons in areas of the brain that are central to learning and memory, to execution functions and to behavioural and emotional responses, such as the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus and the limbic regions. There is evidence to show that the use of cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors, including rivastigmine, donepezil and galanthamine, to enhance the survival of cholinergic neurotransmission is beneficial in the treatment of these symptoms. For example, administering rivastigmine stabilises and improves the performance of ADL in mild to moderate stages and slows down the decline in the capacity to carry out ADL in patients with serious AD. There is an improvement in the behavioural symptoms, the appearance of new symptoms diminishes and the use of other psychotropic drugs is reduced. Cognitive deficits become stable or improve during short term treatment and the treatment also delays the cognitive decline associated with the progression of the disease. A review of the available data reveals that ChE inhibition is beneficial in the long term in the three key symptomatic domains in different stages of the disease, as well as its perhaps being useful in different dementias. Therefore, it is likely that treatment with a ChE inhibitor improves quality of life and reduces the social and economic burden of these disorders",

The extent of the emotional blood pressure response depends upon the natural emotional reactivity of the animal and the degree of training, being most pronounced in highly trained animals. These factors must be considered in experiments on trained dogs when it is important to avoid emotional tension. It is possible that frequent daily repetitions of these emotional states may over a period of months or years lead to morphological changes in the kidneys and cardiovascular system with persistent elevation of blood pressure. It is reasonable to assume that the high degree of restraint and conditioning which are characteristic of the daily existence of the average human subject may eventually result in a similar state of irritability of the vasomotor centers so that minor changes in the daily routine or environment may lead to repeated and excessive acute blood pressure elevations and over a period of years become a factor in the genesis of certain types of hypertension.",

The acute effects of empathy, euphoria, and excitement for which it is used recreationally can make it overwhelmingly distracting for the user in the context of driving. This review considers the chemistry, synthesis, analysis, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and documented effects of MDMA on cognitive and psychomotor skills important to driving. Laboratory studies show that users do experience cognitive impairments, and may also act more impulsively while under the influence of the drug's sympathomimetic effects. Psychomotor impairment may occur with elevated doses or after repeated administration, and residual psychomotor impairment during the \"coming-down\" phase may be compounded by fatigue, dehydration, combined drug use, or other confounding factors. There is growing anecdotal information providing evidence of MDMA-impaired driving, and it is evident that many users recognize and attempt to mitigate the effects by delaying driving until the acute affects have dissipated. The drug inevitably may affect a subject's judgment and ability to properly assess their fitness to drive also. Blood concentrations in MDMA-impaired drivers suggest that this impairment can be caused by normal patterns of recreational use, and MDMA use should be considered inconsistent with safe driving immediately following ingestion, and for up to a day or longer following use.",

These psychiatric side effects appeared after one to three months of therapy, usually improved within three to four days of decreasing the dose of interferon alfa, and invariably resolved once therapy was stopped. The organic personality and affective syndromes tended to occur in patients who received the highest dose of interferon alfa, who had relatively mild hepatitis, and who lost weight during interferon treatment. Delirium tended to occur in patients with severe hepatitis who had previous evidence of organic brain injury or dysfunction or previous drug and alcohol abuse. Failure to recognize these side effects quickly and to treat them with supportive therapy and modification of the dose of interferon alfa could result in limitation of therapy and serious personal and interpersonal consequences.

      "abstract": "Rebound insomnia and rebound anxiety are clinical conditions related to withdrawal of certain benzodiazepine drugs. Numerous studies of benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics conducted in our sleep laboratory demonstrated that rebound insomnia developed following withdrawal from benzodiazepines with a rapid or intermediate elimination rate. Several studies conducted by other investigators also indicated the development of rebound insomnia under similar conditions. Rebound insomnia and rebound anxiety are discussed in terms of their interrelationship, clinical implications, and receptor mechanisms. Evidence suggests that drugs producing rebound insomnia and rebound anxiety also show a more rapid development of tolerance and greater potential for drug dependence than benzodiazepines where the parent compound or its metabolites have a long elimination half-life.",

This ‘extra’ which complements the infantilism of hysteria, are determined by the following constellation of factors: (1) an immature, underdeveloped, emotional personality with a feeble identity; (2) due to the relatively great need for warding off emotional influences, the personality is more vulnerable to emotional stress; (3) a predisposition to deficient repression, leading to insufficient mental defence; (4) an auxiliary auto-regulation in the form of states of lowered consciousness and convulsions or fits, to keep the overwhelming emotional influences outside his awareness. Freud elucidated the dynamic relationships in an impressive way; he described all that can be called neurotic in hysteria. But we know that hysteria encompasses more than various types of neurosis, and can also manifest itself in psychotic and psychopathic-like patterns of behaviour.",

Inadequate sleep may impact children's development, mood and behaviour and in consequence the wellbeing of their parents and caregivers. In a prospective, randomised, multicenter, open, comparative clinical trial the effectiveness of homeopathic ZinCyp-3–02 tablets (Cypripedium pubescens D4, Magnesium carbonicum D10, Zincum valerianicum D12) in children with sleep disorders and restlessness was evaluated. <h3>Methods</h3> Children aged≤6 years, suffering from sleep disorders for≥1 month, were randomised to receive either ZinCyp-3–02 tablets (intervention) or the aminoacetic acid glycine (control) for 28 days. Effectiveness endpoints included the change of 7 sleep related complaints (SRC; time to sleep onset, difficulties maintaining sleep, sleep duration, troubled sleep (somniloquism), physical inactivity after awakening, restlessness for unknown reason, sleep disorders frequency; total score = maximum 11 points) and parent's treatment satisfaction. Safety parameters were the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and the tolerability of the treatments. <h3>Results</h3> The SRC total score decreased from baseline median 7.0 points in both groups to 2.0 points in the intervention group (n=89 children) and 4.0 points in the control group (n=90 children) after 28 days of treatment. Children of the intervention group had overall significant higher odds of getting lower SRC total score (odds ratio: 4.45 (95%-CI: 2.77–7.14), p&lt;0.0001; ITT). First clinical differences between both groups were seen already after 14 days. At day 28 significantly more children in the intervention group showed absence of individual complaints (Chi<sup>2</sup>-test: all P values≤0.0475; ITT). More parents were either 'very satisfied' (n=33) or 'satisfied' (n=49) with ZinCyp-3–02 treatment compared to the number of parents with 'very satisfied' (n=10) and 'satisfied' (n=28) ratings in the control group. Only few ADRs occurred (ZinCyp-3–02: n=2 (nervousness, excitability); control: n=1 (excitement)) and almost all parents and physician (&gt;93% out of 179) rated the tolerability of both treatments as 'very good' or 'good'. <h3>Conclusions</h3> ZinCyp-3–02 showed to be a safe and effective treatment option for paediatric sleep disorders and restlessness.",

      "abstract": "Syndrome of dementia, which appears as a result of deterioration of brain structure that is caused by different factors, together with syndrome of psychomotor restlessness, represents one of the most common psychiatric conditions at patients of the geriatric population (older than 75 years). Our clinical experience shows that these conditions, in this age group, at the moment of admission to hospital treatment, are much more frequent than relapse of chronic endogenous psychosis. Many somatic condition, activation of chronic diseases and subclinical disorders, consequences of previous head trauma (that patient don’t even remember), side effects of most commonly used drugs in the general and internal medicine (benzodiazepines, hypnotics, anticholinergics, antihypertensives, and drugs used in the treatment of arthritis), can cause mental confusion, anxiety and psychomotor agitation – which are conditions similar to dementia. It is very often that mild dehydration is sufficient to cause deterioration in mental status, accompanied by the emergence of nocturnal agitation, confusion, and delirious clouded consciousness. The risk of the manifestation of side effects of psychomotor drugs in geriatric patients becomes much higher due to the exhaustion of adaptive reserves of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system, and due to the delayed liver and kidney function. Implementation of antipsychotics with simpler pharmacodynamic effect is justified to calm the patient. However, later treatment should be directed to compensate the volume of fluid, to correct the electrolyte imbalance, and to treat the root causes that led to the manifestation of psychopathological phenomenology.",

In those early years only hypnotics and anticonvulsants were available and they were administered chiefly for the management of excitement and agitation. The discovery of chlorpromazine (Delay & Deniker, 1952) and other neuroleptics resulted in a revolution in the treatment of psychoses of adults. It was hoped that these drugs would arrest or decrease the psychotic process in the child and that after the reduction of anxiety, hyperactivity, and/or aggressiveness he would become more amenable to special education and other treatment modalities. These hopes were not always fulfilled. Drug therapy has come under attack because of improper use, especially with institutionalized retarded Children. This abuse has included high dosage over prolonged periods of time, multiple drug usage—children receiving from two to eight drugs at the same time—no drug holidays, little or no evidence of drug monitoring, and usage of sedative types of phenothiazines which probably suppress cognitive learning functions (Lipman, 1970).",

      "abstract": "Patients with mental disorders exhibit a range of abnormal movements. The severely depressed are given to hand wringing, pacing, and restlessness. Others lie in bed, stare into space, and posture for hours or days. At times, this behavior is so extreme as to be a stupor. Psychotic patients exhibit tremors or peculiar facial and body movements described as parkinsonism, dystonia, or dyskinesia. Manic patients are in constant motion. Children and adolescents bang their heads and pick at their skin, injuring themselves. Little attention is paid to such behavior unless it overwhelms the patient’s life, but it does distress the patient, the family, and the community. These motor symptoms often bring psychiatric patients to medical care. Catatonia is the motor syndrome characterized by muscular rigidity, unusual posturing, negativism (refusal to obey simple commands), mutism (persistent silence), echolalia (repetition of what has been said), echopraxia (imitation of movements), and repeated stereotyped mannerisms. It appears suddenly and quickly immobilizes the patient or it appears insidiously. When it dominates behavior and threatens the patient’s life by the failure to eat or drink, treatment becomes compulsory. Forced feeding, bedsores resulting from immobility, muscular atrophy, bladder catheterization and consequent infection, and blood clots in immobilized limbs all take a terrible toll. If the clots move to the lungs or brain, stroke or death may ensue. Catatonia was first described as a consequence of intense emotional anguish and tension. Although the movements frequently respond to sedative drugs, ECT is a more complete and effective treatment. The condition is frequently seen in patients with affective illnesses— both depression and mania—in patients with systemic disorders, and in those with toxic brain states caused by hallucinogenic drugs. For decades, the prevailing belief in psychiatry was that each instance of catatonia represented a type of schizophrenia. The major classification systems in psychiatry—the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association and the International Classification of Diseases—assigned to all patients with catatonia the diagnosis of schizophrenia, catatonic type. As a consequence, few patients were treated with anticonvulsant sedatives or with ECT, because those treatments were not recognized as effective in schizophrenia.",

Available antidepressants are not effective in all patients and often show a relevant response latency, with a range of adverse events, including weight gain and sexual dysfunction. Novel rapid agents were developed with the aim of overcoming at least in part these issues. Novel drugs target glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, orexin, and other receptors, providing a broader range of pharmacodynamic mechanisms, that is, expected to increase the possibility of personalizing treatments on the individual clinical profile. These new drugs were developed with the aim of combining a rapid action, a tolerable profile, and higher effectiveness on specific symptoms, which were relatively poorly targeted by standard antidepressants, such as anhedonia and response to reward, suicidal ideation/behaviours, insomnia, cognitive deficits, and irritability. This review discusses the clinical specificity profile of new antidepressants, namely 4-chlorokynurenine (AV-101), dextromethorphan-bupropion, pregn-4-en-20-yn-3-one (PH-10), pimavanserin, PRAX-114, psilocybin, esmethadone (REL-1017/dextromethadone), seltorexant (JNJ-42847922/MIN-202), and zuranolone (SAGE-217).

DIT mechanisms include dopamine receptors block, gamma-aminobutyric acid depletion, cholinergic deficiency. DIT risk factors include older age, female sex, longer administration of drugs associated with tremor or/and their administration in higher doses, history of tremor in the patient and/or relatives, excessive caffeine intake. It is necessary to establish a causal relationship between the use of a potential inducer drug and the development/intensification of tremor to diagnose DIT.

      "abstract": "Psychostimulants such as cocaine have been used as performance enhancers throughout recorded history. Although psychostimulants are commonly prescribed to improve attention and cognition, a great deal of literature has described their ability to induce cognitive deficits, as well as addiction. How can a single drug class be known to produce both cognitive enhancement and impairment? Properties of the particular stimulant drug itself and individual differences between users have both been suggested to dictate the outcome of stimulant use. A more parsimonious alternative, which we endorse, is that dose is the critical determining factor in cognitive effects of stimulant drugs. Herein, we review several popular stimulants (cocaine, amphetamine, methylphenidate, modafinil, and caffeine), outlining their history of use, mechanism of action, and use and abuse today. One common graphic depiction of the cognitive effects of psychostimulants is an inverted U–shaped dose-effect curve. Moderate arousal is beneficial to cognition, whereas too much activation leads to cognitive impairment. In parallel to this schematic, we propose a continuum of psychostimulant activation that covers the transition from one drug effect to another as stimulant intake is increased. Low doses of stimulants effect increased arousal, attention, and cognitive enhancement; moderate doses can lead to feelings of euphoria and power, as well as addiction and cognitive impairment; and very high doses lead to psychosis and circulatory collapse. This continuum helps account for the seemingly disparate effects of stimulant drugs, with the same drug being associated with cognitive enhancement and impairment.",

      "abstract": "This paper summarises the research evidence presented in a recent issue of Effective Health Care on drug treatments for schizophrenia.1\n\nSchizophrenia is an illness or a group of illnesses affecting language, planning, emotion, perceptions, and movement. In the UK, approximately 250 000 people suffer from schizophrenia or a schizophrenia-like illness.2\n\nA quarter of those who have experienced an episode of schizophrenia recover and the illness does not recur. Another 25% experience an unremitting illness. The remaining 50% have a recurrent illness, but with long episodes of considerable recovery from positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disordered thinking, and catatonic movements.3 Many with recurrent illness have enduring problems from schizophrenia such as persistent psychotic symptoms, but, for most people, the problems consist of negative symptoms such as loss of enthusiasm and emotional responsiveness, apathy, and social withdrawal.3 These negative symptoms, though intrinsic to schizophrenia, are compounded by the adverse effects of drugs, living in impoverished circumstances, and by the social stigma associated with mental illness. Recovery from episodes of schizophrenia for some people is often complicated by episodes of depression, substance abuse, and anxiety. People with schizophrenia have a shortened life expectancy4 due to physical illness, accidents, and other causes of violent death, especially suicide.5\n\nTreatments for schizophrenia are divided into the so-called “physical interventions” of drugs, psychological and social managements and, rarely in the UK, electroconvulsant treatment. This article draws upon evidence from systematic reviews undertaken by the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group, and summarises the evidence on the effectiveness of the main drugs used in the treatment of schizophrenia. More detailed information is available on each treatment within the referenced reviews. These reviews are regularly updated in the Cochrane Library .6\n\nThe main class of drugs used to treat or manage schizophrenia is antipsychotics …",

      "abstract": "The allure of afflictions and appetites gone awry are endless in the modern era. They range from the endless junk food we eat, to the computer games that lock our children to distraction, compulsion, and fixation on a screen. A sense of compulsion pervades addiction. For both appetite and addiction, incentives are mediated by diverse information molecules, which include CRF and dopamine. Chapter 8 explains how CRF is tied both to the ingestion of diverse drugs and to withdrawal. This process, however, is little understood. Indeed, one of the most important discoveries in the addiction research field was that for all addictive drugs that have been tested, this dual phenomenon on ingestion and withdrawal has been expressed; this included cocaine, heroin, alcohol, and cannabis, for example. The brain is active in all stages of addiction (preoccupation/anticipation, binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect, and psychic pain), and is differentially regulated.",

      "abstract": "From time to time, physicians encounter patients with a chief complaint of hyperosmia accompanied by multisystem symptoms and intolerances for a wide variety of chemicals, foods, and/or drugs (Ashford and Miller, 1998; Berglund et al., 1992; Doty et al., 1998). Often these patients say they become ill when exposed to various odors, often in response to cacosmia (Ryan et al., 1988) or dysosmia (Miller, 1996). For example, they may describe everyday exposures to fragrances, diesel exhaust, new plastic car interiors, household cleaners, etc. (Table 1), as being overpowering, \"stronger than ever before,\" or \"extremely irritating\" and triggering symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, memory difficulties, mental confusion, anxiety, irritability, depression, myalgias, arrhythmias, dyspnea, and every sort of gastrointestinal problem (Table 2). This clinical presentation has come to be known as multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) or multiple chemical intolerance. Patients presenting with this peculiar combination of subjective hyperosmia, multisystem symptoms, and multiple intolerances appear to be on the increase (AOEC, 1992; NIEHS, 1997; NRC, 1992). Later in this chapter, epidemiological and clinical studies of this phenomenon will be reviewed.",

      "title": "Introduction: Emotion and Psychopathology",
      "abstract": "Abstract Given the complexity and exquisite regulation of emotion described in previous chapters, it is not surprising that emotional dysfunction lies at the core of a variety of psychopathological conditions. The syndromes of emotional dysregulation lie on a continuum of temporal characteristics, ranging from seconds/minutes (panic attacks) to hours/days (borderline personality disorder) to weeks/ months (unipolar and bipolar illness) to years/lifetime (schizophrenia and autism). The panic/anxiety disorders are characterized by paroxysmal episodes of panic, sometimes superimposed on more chronic components of dysphoria, agoraphobia, and depression. The marked mood lability of borderline personality disorder and its interdigitation with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) syndromes are typified by extremely rapid and major mood shifts. Included in this phasic dysregulation are prominent components of anxiety, depression, proneness to substance abuse, and chaotic experience of the self and relationships to others. The unipolar and bipolar affective disorders range from chronic dysthymia to irregular bursts of recurrent brief depression to minor and major depression to these conditions in the context of hypomania (bipolar II) and fullblown mania (bipolar I). This range of depressive and manic mood disorders is common in the general population and most typical of psychopathologies involving dysfunction of emotional regulation. The schizophrenias are more commonly associated with a persistent disconnection of affect from its appropriate context, and thus they present with prominent autistic components. In childhood autism itself there is an early and chronic breakdown of emotional communication that often involves an absence of normal language and affective responsiveness to others. Given this range of type and temporal dissimilarities among the major psychopathological syndromes of emotion, we chose to highlight in this part several of the more prominent syndromes and components that bridge diagnostic categories Although each of the chapters has a separate focus, it is worth emphasizing the constant interaction and interplay of cognition, emotion, and neurobiology that is important not only for understanding the psychological and neurobiological substrates of affective dysregulation but also for approaches to therapeutics that can also involve each of three domains (affective, cognitive, and somatic) as primary targets.",

      "abstract": "IntroductionThe principal routes of cocaine administration are oral, intranasal, intravenous, and inhalation.The slang terms for these routes are, respectively, \"chewing,\" \"snorting,\" \"mainlining,\" \"injecting,\" and \"smoking\" (including freebase and crack cocaine).Cocaine use ranges from occasional use to repeated or compulsive use, with a variety of patterns between these extremes.There is no safe way to use cocaine.Any route of administration can lead to absorption of toxic amounts of cocaine, allowing to acute cardiovascular or cerebrovascular emergencies that could result in sudden death.Repeated cocaine use by any route of administration can produce addiction and other adverse health consequences.Those who snort or sniff cocaine through their noses suffer damage to their nasal and sinus passages.These include nasal crusting, nosebleeds, nasal congestion, irritation, facial pain caused by sinusitis and hoarseness.Cocaine addiction changes the responsiveness of the brain to various neurotransmitters or chemicals.The development of drug addiction involves persistent cellular and molecular changes in the Central Nervious System.The brain dopamine, GABA and glutamate systems play key roles in mediating drug-induced neuroadaptation.We show some physiological changes that can occur in some key pathways in which glutamate, dopamine and GABA receptors are involved.These chemical changes cause different effects in users, including: anxiety, confusion, dizziness, psychosis, headaches and nausea.Cocaine use and addiction affects the sympathetic nervous system (which controls automatic functions such as breathing, heartbeat, etc.).This system secretes adrenaline which raises ones heart rate, narrows blood vessels and significantly increases blood pressure.Chest pain, heart attacks and strokes are common side effects of cocaine use.The most widely studied neurobiological characteristic of cocaine addiction is the role played by dopamine transmission.It is clear that enhanced dopamine transmission in neurons projecting from the ventral mesencephalon to the limbic forebrain, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc), is the pharmacological target for cocaine-induced reinforcement and locomotor stimulation (O'Brien., 2001) However, persistence of the behavioral characteristics of cocaine addiction, such as paranoia (sensitization) and the propensity to relapse years after the acute rewarding effects of the drug have disappeared, indicates that there must also be neuronal substrates undergoing Addictions -From Pathophysiology to Treatment 104 long-term neuroplastic changes.Although studies have endeavored to identify enduring changes in dopamine transmission that might underlie behavioral sensitization and the reinstatement of drug-seeking (relapse), the results have not been entirely consistent with an obligatory role for dopamine.Addiction can be viewed as a form of drug-induced neural plasticity.One of the bestestablished molecular mechanisms of addiction is up-regulation of the cAMP second messenger pathway, which occurs in many neuronal cell types in response to chronic administration of opiates or other drugs of abuse.This up-regulation and the resulting activation of the transcription factor CREB appear to mediate aspects of tolerance and dependence.In contrast, induction of another transcription factor, termed 1FosB, exerts the opposite effect and may contribute to sensitized responses to drug exposure.Knowledge of these mechanisms could lead to more effective treatments for addictive disorders.Cocaine Dopamine Tansporter (DAT) Norepinephrine Transporter (NET) Serotonine Transporter (SERT)",

      "abstract": "In the last decade, progress in psychopharmacology had led to the synthesis of newer antidepressant compounds. Known as \"new generation antidepressants\", they belong either to classical families of anti-depressants (tricyclics or MAOIs) or to new pharmacological groups. The first ones differ from classical tricyclics or classical MAOIs for the absence of major contraindications for their use (mostly few or no anticholinergic properties for new tricyclics and no dietary restriction rules for new MAOIs). The nontricyclics-non MAOIs antidepressants are, for most of them, particularly well tolerated and safe. The clinical potency of such compounds seems to reach conditions beyond depressive states and they have indeed some specific effects in obsessive-compulsive disorders or other anxiety disorders. In this group, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors seem to represent a major progress in antidepressive therapy. All these advantages invite now the practitioners to use these \"new generation antidepressants\" as the first choice medication, when treating uncomplicated depressive disorders.",

      "abstract": "Caffeine is the most widely used psychoactive substance, and caffeinated beverages enjoy immense popularity around the world. Temporal abstinence from caffeine in habitual users results in the well-characterized withdrawal syndrome, consisting mainly of headache, fatigue, tiredness and decreased alertness. The formal diagnostic criteria for caffeine-withdrawal headache (CWH) were given in the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edition (ICHD-II). According to these criteria, the headache is bilateral and/or pulsating, occurs when intake is interrupted or delayed in person with caffeine consumption of C200 g/day for [2 weeks, develops within 24 h after last caffeine intake and is relieved within 1 h by 100 mg of caffeine. The obligatory criterion, as for the other secondary headaches, is the improvement or resolution of headache after relief from the causative disorder, e.g. that this headache resolves within 7 days after total caffeine withdrawal. There is a comment on the possibility of this syndrome in patients on dialysis who consume large quantities of caffeine [1, 2]. We report a case of patient on hemodialysis (HD) with CWH. To our best knowledge, there is no published case report on that subject in medical literature.",

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) regardless of the anesthetic agent used, is the most effective form of treatment in major depression and the gold standard therapy in treatment resistant depression. Ketamine is one of the anesthetic drugs approved by the Αmerican Psychiatric Association Task Force Report for use in ECT. However, it has been used infrequently as an anesthetic in ECT. The initial reports suggested that ketamine has antidepressant properties resulting in rapid antidepressant response when administered in subanesthetic dose (0.5 mg/kg) in slow intravenous injection in patients suffering from depression. In recent trials has been reported that ketamine as the only anesthetic or as an adjunctive to another anesthetic agent may enhance the antidepressant effect of ECT either by increasing efficacy or by producing a rapid antidepressant response. ECT with ketamine may also cause less cognitive side effects. The most notable limitations of these studies are the small number of patients enrolled and several methodological differences (patients characteristics, electrode placements, titration method, anesthetic agent used with ketamine). The results of the clinical trials have been summarized in six meta-analysis and suggest that ketamine when used as a sole anesthetic agent or as an adjunctive anesthetic in ECT may accelerates the antidepressant response but does not augment ECT efficacy. It also does not improve the cognitive profile of the treatment. Larger, double-blind randomized controlled trial are needed for a definite conclusion.",

      "abstract": "This article reviews the current studies on the mechanism of nicotine dependence. In the process of nicotine dependence, there are four major determinants: reinforcing effects, tolerance, craving and withdrawal. 1) The positive reinforcing effects of nicotine are important especially for the initiation of nicotine self-administration. These effects are considered to be induced by the ability of nicotine to promote the release of catecholamines, acetylcholine, beta-endorphine, glucocorticoid, and other kinds of hormones. 2) However, tolerance gradually develops to the positive reinforcing effects of nicotine, as nicotine is repeatedly self-administered. 3) Craving is defined as the uncontrollability of the urge to take drugs, which is a core aspect of recent ICD-10 or DSM-IV descriptions. Craving for nicotine is caused and enhanced by the following three factors; psychic withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, depression and dysphoria, conditioning processes leading to the association of nicotine effects with environmental stimuli, and memory of the reinforcing effects of nicotine. 4) Neither somatic withdrawal symptoms nor mental disorders related to nicotine dependence is significant. 5) As for the neurobiology of nicotine dependence, the reward system is focused as a putative responsible region involved not only in the reinforcing effects of nicotine but also in the psychic withdrawal symptoms. The amygdala-nucleus accumbens connection may be intimately involved in the association between nicotine effects and environmental stimuli. And neuronal circuits involved in memory function may be implicated in the manifestation of craving and relapse, but the details remain to be solved.",

      "title": "Case of Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia - Continuum Through Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy",
      "abstract": "Panic disorder is characterized by spontaneous and unexpected occurrence of panic attacks, the frequency of which can vary from several attacks per day to only a few attacks per year. Panic disorder is usually qualified with the presence or absence of agoraphobia. Panic disorder with agoraphobia is an anxious disorder where repeated attacks of fear and anxiety appear at places and situations out of the family surrounding, places where the escape is difficult and where someone would be helpless, as for an example crowded places, passing over bridges, traveling by public transport, walking in an open space. Depressive episodes, as well as obsessive-compulsive procedures, can also follow this condition. A female person aged 25 years presents with a classical panic disorder with an agoraphobia and a classic and secure behavior. She also suffers from dysthymia and a chronic fluctuating mood and low self-confidence. The patient gets panic attack when traveling by public transport in the morning when going to work, in a restaurant, in a supermarket, in a disco, when walking in an open space. The symptomatology started half a year before going to the psychiatrist, after several close persons died. A short description of CBT. CBT is based on the cognitive model of an emotional answer and aspects of stoic philosophy. CBT is based on an idea that our thoughts cause emotions and different behavior, so that we can change the way of thinking, and after that feelings/behavior unchanged situations. CBT uses Socrates' method and some techniques from psychodrama, as well as relaxing techniques. Giving «homework» and keeping a diary is also a very important part of this therapy. Seven therapeutic sessions of a cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy in a combination with the antidepressants (one session weekly) were performed. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is a leading therapy in dealing with agoraphobia and panic attacks. In combination with SSRI, it gives excellent results in reduction of the symptomatology. At the end of the treatment, the mental state was significantly improved. The patient came in contact with her beliefs and the basic models developed in childhood, and learned how to cope with negative thoughts, feelings and maladaptive behavior.",

It can occur intermittently or daily. Nonpharmacologic treatments include moderate exercise; good sleep hygiene; elimination of alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine; and hot baths, massage, and stretching. Activities promoting mental alertness may improve symptoms. Moderate exercise and use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure are the only nonpharmacologic treatments with proven benefit. For intermittent restless legs syndrome, carbidopa/levodopa and nonpharmacologic therapy are recommended as primary treatments. For daily restless legs syndrome, dopamine agonists, particularly ropinirole and pramipexole, are suggested as the drugs of choice. Carbidopa/levodopa could be considered for daily restless legs syndrome, but augmentation is a significant drawback to its use. Carbamazepine and gabapentin have limited data to support their use.",

      "abstract": "On a regular basis, the media presents the potential risks of the use of psycho-active compounds, including misused pharmaceuticals (flunitrazepam, GHB) or drugs of abuse (cannabis, LSD, ecstasy). Ethanol is also frequently encountered. These drugs can be used for recreational purposes by addicts or can be observed after sexual assaults (drugs spiked in food). Forensic toxicology can be involved in several situations to document impairment, such as: crime under influence, date rape, driving under influence, psychiatric disorders, determination of the cause of death... In some particular situations, it can be very cautious to investigate exposure to psycho-active drugs, due to late sampling of biological specimens. To enhance the window of detection of 3 specific drugs, the authors propose the following: 1. Use of an ultra-sensitive technique, such as GC/MS/MS/NCI for 7-aminoflunitrazepam; 2. Use of a cumulative specimen, such as sweat for GHB and 3. Use of a metabolite with a long half-life, such as ethyl glucuronide for ethanol.",

Results: A 44-year-old woman with borderline personality traits and severe drug dependence developed a protracted drug-induced psychosis related to chronic high-dose crystalline methamphetamine use. Complete resolution of symptoms occurred with antipsychotic medication and abstinence from methamphetamine. Rapid recurrence of symptoms occurred at a time of high stress associated with minimal methamphetamine use and cessation of low-dose quetiapine. Symptoms rapidly resolved with abstinence, quetiapine and reduction of stressors. Conclusions: A drug-induced psychosis resembling paranoid schizophrenia can occur with repeated or high-dose use of methamphetamine. While this generally resolves rapidly with cessation of stimulant use, some cases of protracted drug-induced psychosis in vulnerable individuals have been documented. Behavioural sensitization can also occur, and neuroleptics may prevent the recurrence of further psychosis triggered by ongoing low-dose methamphetamine use.",

      "abstract": "In our outpatient clinic for adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), 10–20% of those affected repeatedly complained about abnormally extended (24 hours) or (more often) notably shortened or reduced effectiveness of local anesthesia injections for dental treatment. Some patients reported paradoxical reactions to postoperative administration of tranquillizers (including benzodiazepines). These drugs made them “even more awake”, much to their doctor’s surprise.\r\n\r\nOne female patient reported that she had followed the surgeons’ conversations during the initial 10 minutes of the operation under full anesthesia and complete muscle relaxation. The surgeons were surprised at the amount of details she remembered. In other patients, anesthetics worked for ”too long” or had “too strong an effect.”\r\n\r\nMany people with ADHD have next to no reaction or react paradoxically to caffeine (coffee/black tea/cola) and other stimulants (nicotine, “Red Bull,” amphetamines). One female patient also reported excessive awareness —and better cognition—when taking antihistamines (for example, “Fenistil” [dimethindene maleate]).\r\n\r\nSuch “idiosyncratic” reactions seem to be stable over time, which means that the different effects are predictable.\r\n\r\nWe therefore advise our ADHD patients to inform their anesthesiologist before an operation that they may react differently to caffeine, antihistamines/low-potency neuroleptics, benzodiazepines (and also central and peripheral anesthetic drugs).\r\n\r\nMany mentally healthy people also react in a primarily unexpected way to caffeine, etc. It therefore may make sense to ask patients preoperatively about untypical reactions to this (not very long) list of different substances, in order to anticipate possible intraoperative and postoperative problems and to avoid these where possible.\r\n\r\nPresumably such atypical reactions are genetically determined. Therefore “idiosyncrasies” in family members may as well provide a hint for an increased risk of abnormal reactions to anesthetics.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES",

Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is an epileptic condition, lasting more than 30 min, characterized by con tinuous or recurrent epileptic activity on EEG, which is responsible for various clinical symptoms (especially in mental status or behavior) in the absence of manifest seizure activity. It includes different clinical forms, from minor confusion to complex behavioral disorders, psychosis, or coma. These psychotic symptoms can be very complex and their differential diagnosis can be difficult. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient without previous personal or family recorded history of epilepsy and/or schizophrenic disorder, without identifiable stressors, showing a subacute episode of anxiety with aggression. Initially, he was discharged without treatment. Seven days later he went to the emergency services accompanied by his family members reporting delusions of injury. He presented a disorganized behavior with self-harm, anxiety, dysesthesia, cenestopathy and in ternal field hallucinations (auditory and visual). The initial EEG study revealed a nonconvulsive status with an active tempo ral focus. In this patient, the psychotic symptoms and EEG abnormalities consistent with NCSE appeared simultaneously. Once the EEG returned to normal, the symptoms only persisted residually and were compatible with intraictal psychosis.",

      "title": "DIAGNOSIS OF FIBROMYALGIA IN HEALTH PRACTICE",
      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia is a chronic non inﬂammatory, non-autoimmune central aﬀerent processing disorder leading to a diﬀuse pain syndrome. It aﬀects individuals of diﬀerent age groups, sex and sociocultural background. It is estimated to aﬀect 2-5% of western population. The symptoms include widespread pain, fatigue, stiﬀness and sleep disturbance, cognitive problems and mood disorders (anxiety, depression or both) 1. The etiology of Fibromyalgia (FM) is unknown; however several factors may contribute to development as well as severity of symptoms of FM. Genetic polymorphisms have been reported in serotonin transporter and receptors, as well as in dopamine, beta2 adrenergic and glutamate receptor genes. 2 Middle aged women and young are more aﬀected. Sleep abnormalities, autonomic dysregulation, and psychological variables like perfectionist personality, negative beliefs, low self-esteem, depression and anxiety are the contributory factors.3 Physical examination and pathological investigations reveal no evidence of articular, osseous or soft tissue inﬂammation or degeneration. Patients may have tender points both above and below the waist. The previously followed criteria, depending on presence of tender points, are no more followed. In 2010, a new diagnostic criterion was adopted by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 4. It has three points: - 1. Widespread pain index (WPI)&gt;7 &amp; a symptom severity (SS) score &gt;5 or widespread pain index 3-6 &amp; (SS) score &gt;9. 2. Symptoms present for at least 3.No other disorder to explain In diﬀerential diagnosis, many diseases need to be ruled out making the diagnosis of FM. These are systemic lupus erythematosis, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteomalacia, rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatic hypothyroidism, chronic hepatitis, HIV, hemo- chromatosis, celiac disease, myasthenia gravis, hyperthyroidism, myopathies, Sjogren`s, adrenal insufficiency, lymphoma and chronic fatigue syndrome.5 Although the exact pathophysiology of FM is unknown, most of the researchers believe that the pathophysiology of FM is due to the central sensitization within the CNS, manifesting as amplified pain perception. The specific abnormalities that have been observed in the aﬀerent pain procession areas of the CNS in FM patients, who exhibit the following symptoms: increased excitability of dorsal horn nuclei due to abnormal windup; increased levels of substance P, nerve growth factor, glutamate and aspartate measured in CSF of patients with FM 6expanded receptive fields for central pain perception (central sensitization); MRI shows expanded fields in the insula, anterior cingulate cortex and somatosensory area.7 The abnormalities within the descending analgesia system are also observed i.e decreased levels of pain inhibitory neurotransmitters including nor epinephrine, serotonin, dopamine and suppression of normal activity of dopamine releasing neurons in limbic system.1 The management of FM is very challenging. It has many components i.e patient education, physical exercises, analgesia, treatment of associated condition like anxiety, depression, and mood disorders. Counseling about the disease and CBT are also helpful. Medication approved for the treatment of FM are: Serotonin-noreprenphine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs); Duloxetine ,venlaxafine, Milnacipran. Anticonvulsants; Pregabalin. Tri cyclic antidepressants: Amitriptyline, imipramine. Analgesia; Tramadol. Paracetamol and NSAIDS are not aﬀective for analgesia.8,9 The diagnosis of FM is quiet challenging in the developed world with good evaluation and referral system. In underdeveloped country with poor medical education and no referral system FM patients are the mostly go un-diagnosed and hence are under treated. It is high time to highlight the importance of diagnosis of FM by the general practitioner and other specialties doctors for proper management of these patients. The disease impact of FM is not less than any other chronic inﬂammatory disease like Rheumatoid Arthritis. On an average the FM patients visit doctor 3-4 times more often than the general population (17 versus 4 visits/year). The frequent visits of patients with FM, is one of the factors of increasing burden on health system as well as having socio-economic impact on patients.",

      "title": "AS01-02 - The impact of psychiatric disorders on sexual dysfunction: an update",
      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction is prevalent among psychiatric patients and may be related to both the psychopathology and the pharmacotherapy. Schizophrenia, affective disorders, anxiety disorders, eating disorders and personality disorders - all have a substantial impact on sexual function. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia limit the capability for interpersonal and sexual relationships. The first-generation antipsychotics cause further deterioration in erectile and orgasmic function. Due to their weak antagonistic activity at D2 receptors, second-generation antipsychotics are associated with fewer sexual side-effects and thus may provide an option for schizophrenia patients with sexual dysfunction. Depression and anxiety are a cause for sexual dysfunction that may be aggravated by antidepressants, especially the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction may be overcome by lowering doses, switching to an antidepressant with low propensity to cause sexual dysfunction (bupropion, mirtazapine, nefazodone, reboxetine), addition of 5HT2 antagonists (mirtazapine, mianserin) or co-administration of 5-phosphodiesterase-inhibitors. Eating disorders and personality disorders, mainly borderline personality disorder, are also associated with sexual dysfunction. The sexual dysfunction in these cases stems from impaired interpersonal relationships and may respond to adequate psychosexual therapy. It is mandatory to identify the specific sexual dysfunction and to treat the patients according to his/her individual psychopathology, current pharmacotherapy and interpersonal relationships.",

      "title": "Addictions and Stress: Clues for Cocaine Pharmacotherapies",
      "abstract": "Addictions are chronic relapsing brain diseases, with behavioral manifestations. Three main factors contribute to the development of an addiction: environment, including stress, the reinforcing effects of the drug, and genetics. In this review we will discuss the involvement of the dysregulation of the stress responsive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in the acquisition of, and persistence to drug addiction (Section B). Addictions to specific drugs such as cocaine/psychostimulants, alcohol, and mu-opioid receptor agonists (e.g., heroin) have some common direct or downstream effects, including modulation of dopaminergic systems. Through its action on the dopaminergic signaling pathways, cocaine affects the HPA axis, and brain nuclei responsible for movements, and rewarding effects. Several neurobiological systems have been implicated with cocaine addiction, including dopamine, serotonin and glutamate systems, opioid receptor and opioid neuropeptide gene systems, stress-responsive systems including CRF, vasopressin and orexin. The use of animal models (Sections C and D) has been essential for studying the individual vulnerabilities to the effects of drugs of abuse and the neural pathways and neurotransmitters affected by these drugs. Basic clinical research has revealed important relationship between cocaine use, HPA axis responsiveness, and gender (Section E). Finally, we will discuss gene polymorphisms that are associated with drug use (Section F). Results from animal models and basic clinical research have shown important interactions between the dopaminergic and the opioid systems. Hence, compounds modulating the opioid system may be beneficial in treating cocaine addiction.",

      "title": "A Review of Addiction",
      "abstract": "Addiction to drugs and alcohol is often undiagnosed and untreated. Physicians are often unaware or have negative attitudes regarding these patients, such as the perception that treatment is ineffective. Addiction--psychological dependence with or without tolerance and withdrawal--is essentially compulsive uncontrolled substance use despite physical, psychological, or social consequences. We now have an understanding of the 2 major neurological pathways involved in addiction. First, the mesolimbic dopamine reward pathway, which is essential for survival, can be physically altered by drug abuse to result in uncontrolled cravings. Second, the decision-making prefrontal cortex, which suppresses inappropriate reward response, can also be altered by drug abuse. Thus, accelerated \"go\" signals and impaired \"stop\" signals result in uncontrolled use despite severe consequences. Further, addicts can be predisposed to addiction by genetic defects in reward pathway neurotransmission and stress-related developmental brain abnormalities. Relapse to drug use can occur because of stress or cue-related reward pathway stimulation or even by a single drug dose. Individualized treatment of addiction, including pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral interventions, can be as successful as treatment of other chronic diseases. Several pharmaceuticals are available or under study for these disorders. Waiting for the addict to \"be ready\" for treatment can be dangerous and detoxification alone is often ineffective. The physician's role in treating addiction includes prevention, diagnosis, brief intervention, motivational interviewing, referral, and follow-up care. An understanding of the biological reality of addiction allows physicians to understand addicts as having a brain disease. Further, the reality of effective pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral treatments for addiction allows physicians to be more optimistic in treating addicts. The challenge to the physician is to embrace the reality of addictive disease and fulfill his or her role in its treatment.",

Two or more attacks could occur in a single night and were most common in the early morning hours. Family and personal histories did not show epilepsy, psychiatric disorders, or (with 1 exception) previous somnambulism. Electrographic investigation revealed that all patients had normal waking‐sleep cycles but that 4 of them had epileptiform abnormalities on their electroencephalograms. All patients were treated with either phenytoin or carbamazepine, with cessation of the abnormal nocturnal behavior during follow‐up periods ranging from 9 to 48 months. This syndrome appears to be distinct from more typical non–rapid eye movement dyssomnias and suggests an atypical form of epilepsy.",

      "title": "Dopaminergic dysfunction in alcoholism and schizophrenia – psychopathological and behavioral correlates",
      "abstract": "Summary Dysfunction of central dopaminergic neurotransmission has been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia as well as drug and alcohol dependence. Different drugs of abuse stimulate dopamine release in the ventral striatum and thus reinforce drug consumption. Increased subcortical dopamine release has also been associated with the pathogenesis of positive symptoms in schizophrenia and may be driven by a prefrontal dopaminergic dysfunction. These seemingly heterogeneous findings may be explained by recent research in non-human primates. According to these studies, reward anticipation but not anticipated reward consumption is accompanied by a phasic dopamine release in the striatum and prefrontal cortex. In the striatum, phasic dopamine release primarily affects motivation, psychomotor activation and reward craving, while in the prefrontal cortex, dopaminergic stimulation is involved in the activation of working memory and reward anticipation. In alcoholism, previously neutral stimuli that have been associated with alcohol intake can become conditioned cues which activate phasic dopamine release and reward craving. In schizophrenia, stress-induced or chaotic activation of dopamine release may attribute incentive salience to otherwise irrelevant stimuli and thus be involved in the pathogenesis of delusional mood and other positive symptoms. Studies in humans and non-human primates emphasize the role of dopaminergic neurotransmission in reward anticipation and its dysfunction in different neuropsychiatric diseases.",

Pathological laughter occurs when laughter is inappropriate, unrestrained (forced), uncontrollable, or dissociated from any stimulus. Pathological laughter is found in three main conditions: a) pseudobulbar palsy; b) gelastic epilepsy; and c) psychiatric illnesses. It is also found in other pathological conditions.

Excited delirium syndrome is an increasingly common presentation, characterised by extreme agitation and aggression in a patient with an altered mental status. Excited delirium is a potentially life-threatening condition, with generally non-specific symptoms. Common triggers of excited delirium syndrome are acute drug use, psychiatric illness, or abrupt cessation of antipsychotic medication. It occurs when there is excessive dopamine stimulation in the striatum, combined with acute exposure to catecholaminergic psychoactive substances. A history of schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder are known risk factors for excited delirium syndrome. While agitation and aggression, concomitant with an altered mental status are the hallmark of excited delirium, other medical conditions such as hypoxia, head trauma, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, and infection can produce similar symptoms, and need to be ruled out as causes. Safety is paramount in the management of excited delirium, with the use of physical and chemical restraint being commonplace. Rhabdomyolysis often occurs when the patient is able to exercise extreme exertion against the restraints and this should be minimised to prevent the risk of cardiac arrest.",

      "title": "Augmented Restless Legs Syndrome with Marked Hyperkinesias and Impulsive‐Compulsive Behaviors",
      "abstract": "RLS is a sensorimotor disorder characterized by a discomfort, primarily in the legs, that compels the afflicted person to move. Augmentation is a paradoxical worsening of RLS symptoms during dopaminergic treatment (earlier onset during the day, shorter latency to symptoms at rest, greater intensity, and/or spread to previously unaffected body parts).1, 2 The phenomenology of augmented RLS is not well documented. We present video documentation of severe augmentation on levodopa (200 mg/day) in a patient with idiopathic RLS, with phenomenology that could be confused with other hyperkinetic movement disorders. The case was further complicated by dopamine agonist (DA)-induced impulsive-compulsive behaviors (ICBs), which worsened during attacks of RLS; acting out these behaviors, in turn, provided transient relief of RLS symptoms. A 51-year-old woman with RLS since her teens (but no other history of sleep-related movement disorders or parasomnias) was referred for \"choreiform movements not yet diagnosed and RLS.\" Her RLS symptoms were mild initially and controlled with clonazepam. She later took l-dopa/carbidopa 200/50 mg at bedtime. This was very effective, but augmentation developed after 1 year. Symptoms spread to her back and arms, occurred daily, began during the day, and caused major sleep disturbance, prompting her to seek treatment in the emergency department. She had long-standing, but stable, depression, treated with venlafaxine 150 mg/day and trazodone 100 mg at bedtime (doses unchanged for several years). Systems review was otherwise negative and there was no family history of RLS. When first observed by us, she demonstrated a wide range of marked hyperkinetic movements (see Video 1, Segments 1 and 2), which she admitted were largely voluntary owing to \"a generalized feeling of having to move.\" Stretching, tensing, extension, flexion, and rotatory movements of the legs and arms, leg rubbing, and whole-body rocking movements were observed. At times, the limb postures were briefly sustained, giving the appearance of dystonia. Some of the movements (e.g., excessive hand gesturing) superficially resembled chorea. Iron indices (serum ferritin 55 μg/L; normal range: 10–291) and renal and thyroid function were normal. The patient had been taking oral iron supplementation for many years. l-dopa was switched to pramipexole 0.125 mg twice daily (BID), and she was significantly improved 1 week later (see Video 1, Segment 3). When last observed (almost 2 years after her initial presentation to us), RLS symptoms were still relatively well controlled on pramipexole 1 mg BID. She took oxycodone occasionally; gabapentin caused dizziness without benefit. No hyperkinesias were observed, but she experienced breakthrough symptoms every few weeks, lasting 3 or 4 nights, associated with overeating (occurring at night when she was clearly awake and aware), hypersexuality, and problem gambling. She found that responding to the compulsions (e.g., waking her husband in the middle of the night for sex) temporarily relieved her restlessness. Whereas overeating leading to weight gain had been a problem for many years, this behavior, together with the development of hypersexuality and problem gambling, was clearly worse on pramipexole treatment. Because of her compulsive tendencies, regular intake of benzodiazepines and opioids was avoided. Recognition of augmentation in RLS is critical, given that increasing dopaminergic medication dose reduces augmented symptoms only temporarily and may lead to a vicious cycle of escalating augmentation. As was the case in our patient, symptoms may respond to switching from l-dopa to DA or opioid therapy.3 Although gabapentin was not useful in her case, other α-2-δ ligands, such as pregabalin or gabapentin enacarbil, could have been considered as well, given that agents of this class of medication are associated with very low rates of augmentation.4 DA therapy was associated with the development of ICBs. This complication has been increasingly recognized, despite the lower DA doses typically used in RLS compared with treatment in Parkinson's disease.5 Two studies reported 7% and 17% ICB rates in RLS patients treated with dopaminergic medications, with binge eating being the most common ICB.6, 7 The stress of coping with severely augmented RLS symptoms—in a patient with pre-existing vulnerabilities—likely contributed to the worsening of her compulsive behaviors.5 Interestingly, a very high rate (61%) of nocturnal eating was recently reported in RLS patients; the researchers suggested that this phenomenon, like mood and anxiety disorders, could be a nonmotor manifestation of the disease itself, rather than being an adverse effect of dopaminergic treatment.8 The array of hyperkinetic movements manifested by RLS patients during wakefulness has not been comprehensively cataloged. Walters et al. published videos of motor restlessness associated with RLS.9 However, the motor and sensory agitation exhibited by our patient was dramatic, even by comparison with examples of severe augmentation demonstrated in a video supplement on the topic.10 In such cases, the phenomenological distinction from drug-induced akathisia, in which patients experience a \"general feeling of inner restlessness\" (rather than the classic limb discomfort of RLS), may be difficult. Patients with augmented RLS may report a generalized feeling of having to move (as did our patient) and lack of significant relief from movement.3 Venlafaxine has been reported to cause both akathisia and worsening of RLS.11 The present case could be differentiated from akathisia on the basis of the fact that her RLS symptoms escalated to this state, showed diurnal variation, and responded promptly to switching from l-dopa to low-dose DA treatment. However, had her RLS symptoms not improved promptly, we would have considered carefully discontinuing her venlafaxine. (1) Research Project: A. Conception, B. Organization, C.

      "title": "Prevalence of Allostatic Overload Syndrome in Patients with Chronic Cardiovascular Disease",
      "abstract": "Allostasis, the ability to maintain stability through change, is a fundamental process through which organisms actively adjust to both predictable and unpredictable events. When allostatic systems are turned on and turned off again efficiently and not too frequently, the body is able to cope effectively with challenges that it might not otherwise survive. However, in a number of circumstances allostatic systems may either be overstimulated or not perform normally, and this condition has been termed 'allostatic load', or the price of adaptation [1]. Findings from several studies suggest that it is associated with worse health conditions and plays a significant role in the susceptibility, course, and outcome of cardiovascular (CV) diseases [2]. Recently, Fava et al. [3] introduced clinimetric criteria for assessing allostatic overload syndrome (AOS) based on: (a) current identifiable sources of distress in the form of acute or chronic stress (the stressor is judged to tax or exceed the individual's coping skills when its full nature and circumstances are evaluated), and (b) psychiatric symptoms (DSM-IV) or psychosomatic symptoms (DCPR) or significant impairment in social or occupational functioning or in psychological well-being occurring within 6 months after the onset of the stressor.This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of the AOS of Fava et al. [3] in patients with chronic CV disease and its relationships with psychosomatic syndromes (Structured Interview for Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research; DCPR [4]), psychopathology (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV; SCID [5]), illness representations (Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised; IPQ-R [6]), and psychosocial functioning (12-item Short Form Health Survey; SF-12 [7]). To evaluate AOS, recent and chronic stress, environmental mastery, sleep, somatization, and psychological distress were carefully evaluated in the clinical interview.Consecutive outpatients with essential hypertension and coronary heart disease (CHD) were enrolled between January and December 2011. Patients with severe CV comorbidity, psychosis, oncology and autoimmune diseases, cognitive impairment, and current alcohol or any other substance abuse were excluded. For all patients, body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure were recorded at the entry. All patients gave their informed consent. The study was approved by the local ethics committee. Because of refusal to participate, clinical problems, and other difficulties, 116 of 138 patients (84%) entered the study (84 with essential hypertension and 32 with CHD). The clinical characteristics and scale scores of patients with and without AOS are shown in table 1.No differences in CV and sociodemographic variables were found between the two groups, except for younger age in the AOS patients. Patients with AOS showed significant poorer mental functioning (SF-12 MCS), higher scores on the IPQ-R consequences (perception of severity and effects of the illness on individual life) and emotional representations (emotional reactivity to the illness) subscales, and a higher prevalence of DSM-IV diagnoses. Furthermore, a 2-fold significant higher prevalence of DCPR clusters of abnormal illness behavior, irritability, and somatization (though the latter was near to statistical significance) was found in the AOS group compared to the comparison group. It is noteworthy that DCPR demoralization was more than 5-fold higher in AOS patients than in those without AOS. Also, the DCPR syndrome of illness denial was diagnosed 3 times more frequently in the AOS (31%) group than in the comparison (10%) group [χ2(1) = 4.82, p = 0.03]. Logistic regression analysis was used with AOS as the dependent variable and DSM and DCPR syndrome illness representation, psychosocial functioning, and sociodemographic characteristics as independent variables. The final model was statistically significant (χ2 = 31.46, p < 0.001; Cox and Snell R2 = 0.24) and AOS was found to be independently predicted by DCPR demoralization [B = 1.807 (SE 0.849); Wald statistic 4.530 (d.f. = 1), p = 0.03; Exp (B) = 6.090 (95% CI 1.154–32.153)] and SF-12 MCS [B = –0.099 (SE 0.040); Wald statistic 5.978 (d.f. = 1), p = 0.01; Exp (B) = 0.906 (95% CI 0.837–0.981)].In this exploratory study we showed for the first time, to our knowledge, the prevalence of AOS in outpatients with chronic CV illness. Within this sample, AOS is characterized by poorer psychosocial functioning, higher rates of psychopathology, and a higher disease-related emotional burden (perception of the impact of the illness on individual life) with associated correlates of abnormal illness behavior, somatization symptoms, and irritability. It is of interest that AOS partially and independently overlapped with demoralization, a feeling state characterized by an inability to cope with problems, hopelessness, and helplessness [8] which may dramatically increase the subjective perception of being overloaded by stressful demands, as shown by the association with the mental component score of SF-12. Recently, Offidani and Ruini [9] found a much higher prevalence of AOS (41%) compared to our results (11%). The marked difference with the report of Offidani and Ruini [9] might be likely due to a number of reasons including sampling (they recruited blood donors on a voluntary basis vs. consecutive CV outpatients), procedure (they recruited healthy volunteers who might be more interested in participating in a psychological evaluation because of experienced distress), age (they recruited younger subjects aged an average of 37 years while our patients had a mean age of 66), work status (more than half of their subjects were employed while two third of our subjects were retired, with a consequent different weight of work-related stress), and assessment instruments (they did not use SCID and DCPR but cut off criteria to self-report scales).Our study includes obvious limitations dues to its preliminary nature such as a limited sample size, cross-sectional design, lack of assessment of biological (e.g. erythrocites, leukocytes, triglycerides, cholesterol, cortisol, C-reactive protein, glucose, and insulin), metabolic (waist-hip ratio), and behavioral (smoking status, diet, alcohol, and coffee consumption) data that are relevant for both CV illness and allostatic load. Nonetheless, our findings show that a reliable evaluation of allostatic overload may help to identify those conditions that, by exceeding individual resources, may constitute a danger to health such as demoralization. The relevance of diagnosing AOS is particularly important in cardiology because of the established association of chronic stress with negative prognostic factors. Furthermore, diagnosing AOS may help target treatment to psychological functions enhancing well-being outcomes [10].",

      "title": "Brain Death",
      "abstract": "The term \"brain death\" (BD) is used to indicate a clinical situation characterized by the irreversible loss of all brain functions; the identification of this condition is closely linked to the development of intensive care medicine that, with mechanical ventilation, allows the maintenance of somatic functions even when cerebral functions are ceased. BD diagnosis is essentially based on the presence of three cardinal clinic criteria: 1) coma or unresponsiveness, 2) absence of brainstem reflexes 3) absence of spontaneous breathing, evaluated with apnea test. For BD diagnosis the following prerequisites must be scrupolously considered: knowledge of the proximate cause of coma and confirmation of its irreversibility; exclusion of confounding clinical variables (severe electrolyte, acid-base, endocrine disturbances); hypothermia and/or hypotension; drug intoxication or poisoning. Ancillary tests used in BD confirmation are represented by neurophysiological methods to highlight the loss of bioelectrical brain activity (EEG, evoked potential (EP)) and methods for demonstration of cerebral circulatory arrest (TransCranial Doppler (TCD); Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ( SPECT); conventional Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA); CT angiography; MRI angiography). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether ancillary tests are able to confirm the complete cessation of all brain functions and then, in adults, ancillary tests are not needed for the clinical diagnosis of brain death and they should never replace the clinical neurological examination. However, even though ancillary tests are not mandatory but only optional in many countries, they continue to be used, especially when there are factors that may interfere with the complete clinical assessment or when apnea test cannot be performed. Although BD is a relatively simple clinical diagnosis, there are substantial differences in perceptions and practices regarding its declaration among countries, states and even between hospitals worldwide. There are also cultural and religious obstacles—especially in lower-income countries—to the determination of death with neurologic criteria, which lead to the suspension of mechanical ventilation. Therefore, health organizations should implement educational campaigns to improve knowledge and awareness of current criteria among the population, and national and international scientific societies should also make every efforts to validate and standardize clinical and laboratory criteria. Finally, it should reminded and underlined that the ultimate purpose of brain death determination should be to increase the number of organs donated, to improve the quality of life of organ recipients.",

In the moderate form there is a loss of consciousness for less than five minutes, usually with some retrograde posttraumatic amnesia. The severe category covers loss of consciousness for longer than five minutes, wandering eye movements, and lack of purposeful responses. Loss of short-term memory and coordination are the two primary deficits that occur after concussion.

      "title": "[Neurobiology of addiction].",
      "abstract": "Several psychoactive drugs may induce addiction. Despite distinct pharmacological targets, all have the common property to stimulate the brain reward circuitry, which results in an increase of dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. The stimulation induced by drugs of abuse is much more important in intensity and duration than the stimulation induced by natural rewards. The positive reinforcement resulting from this stimulation promotes repeated drug intake, which induces cellular and molecular adaptations in the brain reward circuit and other regions associated with this circuit. Enduring changes are more particularly observed in regions involved in pleasure, motivation, memory, conditioning, executive functions, judgement and self-control. A tolerance to the reinforcing effects of natural rewards is observed in parallel to a hypersensitivity to the motivational effects of drugs and drug-associated stimuli. Behaviour focuses more and more exclusively on drug research and drug consumption. Drug privation can induce a negative emotional state, withdrawal signs and craving which are key elements of relapse",

      "title": "Can exercise prevent cognitive decline?",
      "abstract": "As the tolerability of pharmacological agents decreases with age, exercise may be particularly helpful as a possible treatment or stabiliser of mood and cognitive function in older age. Exercise has been most commonly evaluated for the treatment of depression. Exercise interventions designed primarily for treatment of physical conditions in the elderly do appear to confer psychological benefits as well, with reduction in depressive symptoms over the course of treatment. The effects of exercise on reducing depressive symptoms are not dissimilar to the effects of antidepressant drugs and cognitive behaviour therapy. Exercise may be a useful low-tech intervention for people with mild to moderate depression. In particular, exercise may be helpful in the elderly and in patients who have had insufficient response to, or are intolerant of, pharmacotherapy. Mastery of a new skill and positive feedback from others may increase feelings of self-esteem and improve mood. Exercise may distract participants from persistent negative thoughts. Exercise has been shown to improve executive function acutely in adults of all ages. It is possible that dance routines or other exercise regimens requiring some cognitive input may confer additional benefit to cognitive function. Exercise has a moderate effect on the ability of people with dementia to perform activities of daily living and may improve cognitive function. Midlife exercise may also have an impact on later cognitive function.",

      "title": "Neuroanatomical and Etiological Approaches to Secondary Narcolepsy",
      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is one among the disorders of central hypersomnolence characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness not related to disturbances in nocturnal sleep or misalignment in circadian rhythms. The cardinal symptom of this group of disorders is disabling daytime sleepiness, characterized by the repeated episodes of irresistible daytime sleepiness or lapses into sleep in monotonous situations, but also under unusual conditions such as eating. Narcolepsy is defined as type 1 and type 2 on the basis of the presence of cataplexy. The most pathognomonic feature of narcolepsy type 1 is cataplexy, which is characterized by sudden episodes of brief loss of muscle tone-sparing consciousness, usually triggered by strong emotions. Other nonspecific symptoms associated with rapid eye movement sleep dissociation include fragmentation of nocturnal sleep, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 1 is well established as the deficiency of hypocretin (orexin) signaling in the lateral hypothalamus. In narcolepsy type 2, on the other hand, hypocretin levels are not decreased, and it has been suggested that there is probably a partial deficiency in hypocretin signaling system to cause excessive daytime sleepiness but not severe enough to cause cataplexy. Instead of types 1 and 2, primary (idiopathic) narcolepsy, familial narcolepsy, secondary (symptomatic) narcolepsy, and narcolepsy plus (hereditary forms with additional neurological symptoms) forms were suggested to better classify the clinical entities. In this paper, the diagnosis of symptomatic or secondary narcolepsy is reviewed and classified based on the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.",

      "title": "Unpacking agitation in practice: a call for greater precision",
      "abstract": "Agitation is a term often used by health professionals to describe patient behaviour that is regarded as problematic or disruptive. What constitutes agitation has been a topic of debate, and no unified conceptualisation prevails. Rather like terms such as ‘indigestion’, agitation may refer to completely different things when used by different clinicians. Or as famously said by Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass: ‘When I use a word it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less’.\nA consensus statement by the International Psychogeriatric Association (IPA) [1] proposes that specific behaviours (excessive motor activity, verbal aggression, physical aggression) associated with ‘emotional distress’ have to be present for at least 2 weeks before a ‘diagnosis’ of agitation is made. This definition of agitation is limited to patients with mild-to-severe cognitive impairment, in particular dementia. Disruptive patient behaviours that are attributable to other ‘psychiatric disorders’ (e.g. psychosis), medical conditions or inadequate care do not fall under this definition of agitation. Remarkably delirium, commonly associated with agitation, is not mentioned in that statement. Perhaps this is not all that surprising as delirium is a somewhat invisible condition at bedside and organisational levels [2].",

      "title": "Benzodiazepine Hypnotics and Insomnia",
      "abstract": "In summary, it is proposed that the more frequent or severe side effects associated with the newer triazolo-benzodiazepines are related to an interaction of several factors, including rapid elimination, high receptor-binding affinity, and unique chemical properties. Among benzodiazepine hypnotics, triazolam has a unique side effect profile for CNS adverse reactions in regard to type, frequency, and severity. All of the three factors mentioned contribute to this side effect profile: rapid elimination (the shortest half-life among benzodiazepine anxiolytics and hypnotics); high receptor-binding affinity (the highest among benzodiazepine anxiolytics and hypnotics); and unique chemical properties as a triazolo-benzodiazepine. Given these three factors, the drug's side effects can be understood as follows: Hyperexcitability states (daytime anxiety during drug administration and rebound insomnia following withdrawal) are related primarily to its rapid elimination and secondarily to the other two factors, whereas cognitive impairments (amnesia, confusion, and psychiatric symptoms) are related to the high binding affinity and unique chemical properties as well as to its rapid elimination. In contrast, benzodiazepines that are slowly eliminated and have only relatively moderate receptor-binding affinity (flurazepam) are unlikely to produce daytime anxiety and rebound insomnia and CNS adverse reactions such as cognitive impairment. The most common side effect, daytime sedation, is easily recognized and can be managed by dose reduction and/or intermittent use. This safety profile combined with the drug's high degree of efficacy both initially and with continued use provides a high benefit-risk ratio in using the drug in the adjunctive pharmacologic treatment of insomnia. Similarly, temazepam, which has relatively weak receptor-binding affinity produces very few CNS adverse reactions. Furthermore, temazepam (15 mg) is more efficacious than triazolam (0.25 mg). However, temazepam is not as effective as flurazepam, because it is slowly absorbed and therefore has limited efficacy for sleep induction. On the other hand, triazolam's safety profile of frequent and severe adverse reactions combined with the lack of efficacy for the current dose of 0.25 mg limits the drug's usefulness. In fact, the 0.25-mg dose has such a poor benefit-to-risk ratio that there is a real question as to whether the drug should remain on the market.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "title": "Stressing out, or outing stress?",
      "abstract": "Stress is an unavoidable component of our working life. How we deal with it may have profound consequences for our job satisfaction, our health and the standard of care we are able to give our patients [1]. Any stressful event will elicit a characteristic physiological response consisting of autonomic stimulation and heightened arousal, which will then persist to some degree for the duration of the stressful stimulus. During an acutely stressful event, such as an intraoperative critical incident, this 'fight or flight' reaction may directly contribute to the resolution of the stressful event. On the other hand, because chronic occupational stresses such as poor working conditions or extended hours are seldom amenable to rapid resolution, the fight or flight reaction in these circumstances may be both inappropriate and ineffective. Our ability to tolerate stress is the result of a complicated interaction of inconstant factors. These include our own personality and coping skills, our current levels of fatigue, distraction or frustration, our experience of previous stressors, the strength of our social or occupational support and, not least, the nature of the stressor itself. However, a fundamental component is our individual 'locus of control' [2]. This term describes our belief in our ability to influence events around us, individuals who believe they have this ability having an 'internal' locus, in contrast to those with an 'external' locus who place more emphasis on the role of chance. Individuals with an internal locus of control tend to report less occupational stress than those without it [3]. Recent studies of occupational stress in nurses have demonstrated the complex relation between the perception of stress and the character of the individual. In a study comparing occupational stress between intensive care unit (ICU) nurses and non-ICU nurses, the ICU nurses found that their ICU nursing activities were less stressful than non-ICU nurses found their non-ICU nursing tasks to be [4]. The authors concluded that ICU nurses had maximized their job satisfaction, and minimized their occupational stress, by selecting a speciality that offered them the high degree of personal autonomy and job complexity which they required for personal fulfilment. In a separate study, when ICU nurses were asked to specify the most stressful aspect of being an ICU patient they selected items relating to loss of personal control significantly more frequently than ICU patients did when given the same questionnaire [5]. The association of a preference for working in a stressful environment, a strong need for personal autonomy and an internal locus of control has been described as 'Type A' behaviour [6]. This rather loose term also includes characteristics such as self-confidence and a strong work commitment, a preference to work alone when under pressure and an urgent sense of time pressure. Type A behaviour is observed more frequently in doctors than in other health professionals, and is associated with a high level of job satisfaction, a low perception of occupational stress and a low requirement for sick leave [2]. Although the prevalence of Type A behaviour in different medical specialities has not been studied, it is likely that doctors who have chosen a speciality in which they usually work alone, and in an environment over which they can exert a high degree of personal control, might be expected to display marked Type A behaviour patterns. Many anaesthetists and intensivists will recognize this as a description of their own working practice. If Type A behaviour offers a degree of protection against the consequences of choosing a profession with a high exposure to occupational stress [3], and if doctors in general, and anaesthetists in particular, display a high prevalence of this behaviour, is there any need to be concerned about our exposure to stress in the workplace? The obverse to the high-achieving behaviour of the Type A individual is their tendency to suppress symptoms of fatigue, and sacrifice their own and their family's social needs, to their pursuit of a successful career [6]. This is exemplified by the results of a survey of occupational stress in health professionals, which demonstrated that doctors made less use of coping strategies such as social support, and were less able to separate home and work, than almost any other group [2]. It has even been suggested that health workers have a particular susceptibility to occupational stress because of the emotional stresses to which they are exposed [7], particularly if they have not been trained to deal with these aspects of their work [8]. Occupational stress is usually beyond the individual's control, and is therefore exactly the form of stress with which competitive, achievement-orientated Type A individuals are least able to deal [3]. In the face of such stressors, individuals may adopt coping strategies such as denial or rationalization which, whilst providing apparent short-term relief, actually perpetuate the individual's exposure to the stressor. Furthermore, although decreasing the individual's emotional involvement in a stressful situation may be helpful in the short-term, in the face of continued exposure these coping mechanisms can lead to a growing sense of detachment and cynicism, impairing the health professional's ability to emphathize with their patient, and resulting in a progressive reduction in job satisfaction. If their home and work environment are already poorly separated, the emotional detachment is likely to extend into the individual's home life, and slowly erode the support it previously offered [9]. In the long term, this will increase the doctor's vulnerability to prolonged stress and lead to social isolation, professional over-involvement, emotional exhaustion and 'burn out' [2]. Finally, the sustained fight or flight response elicited by continued exposure to the stressor may itself present a significant threat to the doctor's own health, through an increased risk of cardiovascular or infectious disease, as well as depression, anxiety and excessive alcohol consumption [10-12]. Another, more recent, factor adds a potent source of stress to this fragile structure. The protective effect of an internal locus of control on the perception of occupational stress is diminished if the individual feels they have lost control of the stressor. The recent organizational changes to the delivery of health care in many developed countries, with the consequent reduction in doctors' autonomy, poses exactly this risk. A recent study has confirmed an increase in the level of occupational stress, and a fall in morale, amongst doctors as a consequence of these changes [13]. These changes illustrate the challenge that is facing the profession. As doctors, we have chosen to work in a highly competitive, achievement-orientated environment. As anaesthetists and intensivists, we have selected a speciality in which our high degree of personal autonomy, and our control over our environment, contribute to our job satisfaction. Yet, as individuals, we are faced with a growing burden of occupational stressors that fall outside our control, and with which we are poorly equipped to deal. Since we are unlikely to be able to reduce our exposure to these stresses significantly, we should take steps to improve our ability to deal with them. The first of these steps is to acknowledge our exposure to stresses beyond our control. The observations on doctors' behaviour through the centuries suggest that we are not good at conceding our own vulnerability and that, as care givers, we make poor recipients. This should not be a point of pride. Second, we need to accept that not only are we probably not as good at dealing with these stresses as we might like to believe, but also that they may compromise both our health and the health and happiness of our families. Finally, we have to equip the next generation of doctors with the skills they will need to meet the roles they will encounter in the course of their careers. This does not simply mean training doctors to deal with identifiable stresses such as starting a new job [8], comforting the bereaved [14] or managing the department [15], although this is important. We also need to develop a working environment in which we have the skills to support our juniors and the expectation that our colleagues will support us. Clearly this cannot be imposed by management directive. Rather it is the responsibility of us all to learn how to provide support to our colleagues, and to encourage them to support us. Stress, like mortality, involves us all, and denial is no cure. C. E. Granger Blackpool M. P. Shelly Manchester",

      "title": "Neuroimaging Data in Bipolar Disorder: An Updated View",
      "abstract": "IntroductionBD is a prevalent mood disorder, often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric conditions and frequently misdiagnosed (Altamura et al., 2011a).Intense emotional states that occur in BD comprise manic, hypomanic, mixed or depressive episodes.According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, IV th edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000), BD spectrum ranges from cyclothymia to Bipolar I, Bipolar II Disorder and Not Otherwise Specified (NOS) forms.BD can also be conceptualized as a gradual change in mood scale, which ranges from severe depression to severe mania with an intermediate euthymic state or balanced mood.Dysthymia is a chronic state of mild low mood occurring for a minimum of two years.At the other end of the scale there is hypomania and severe mania.An alternative and broader dimensional approach conceptualizes BD as a continuum, between unipolar depression, schizoaffective disorder (which is considered by some authors a subcategory of BD) and schizophrenia.This theory may be supported from a clinical point of view by the fact that, sometimes, during severe manic, mixed or depressive episodes, bipolar patients experience psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusions.It is also supported by the presence of morphometric alterations of frequent observation among major psychoses, such as enlarged ventricles and white matter volume reductions in the left and temporoparietal regions (Czobor et al., 2007).In BD, symptomatic states are frequently associated with poor working functioning and social impairment.Bipolar patients, moreover, have higher suicide rates than the general population and among the highest of psychiatric patients.In a recent study on factors predicting suicide in BD, white race, family history of suicide, and previous cocaine abuse were considered predictive of suicidal behaviour (Cassidy, 2011).Usually BD develops in early adulthood/late teens, with an age of onset ranging from 15 to 50 years (Cassano et al., 2006).International treatment guidelines for BD recommend the use of mood stabilizers -either in monotherapy or in association -as the gold standard in both acute and long-term therapy.The concept of stabilization, in fact, has been stressed as the ultimate objective of the treatment of BD, given the chronic and recurrent nature of the illness, which accounts for its significant levels of impairment and disability (Altamura et al., 2011b).Beyond the www.intechopen.comNeuroimaging -Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience 264 aforementioned core mood symptoms and clinical features of BD, over the last decade, neurocognitive dysfunction has been stressed as another nuclear dimension of BD and, possibly, a marker of its underlying pathophysiology (Lewandowski et al., 2010).There is accumulating evidence that individuals with BD have neurocognitive impairment that persists even during euthymia: the degree of impairment is more severe in patients with depressive symptoms, with functions associated with processing speed and attentional control being particularly implicated (Chaves et al., 2011;Van der Werf-Eldering et al., 2010).In addition, in older euthimic adults with BD, resting-state corticolimbic dysregulation was related to sustained attention deficits and inhibitory control, which could reflect the cumulative impact of repeated affective episodes upon cerebral metabolism and neurocognitive performance (Brooks et al., 2011).Cognitive impairment in BD is influenced by the severity of illness (Yates et al., 2010).In addition, neuropsychological and imaging studies in BD suggested the presence of cognitive deficits and subtle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in limbic areas that may persist over euthymia.However, other studies are inconsistent with this claim.For example, a recent study did not identify any difference between BD patients and controls in levels of cognition over a two-year period, indicating that BD doesn't have a significant adverse impact on cognition (Delaloye et al., 2011).Neuroimaging has recently gained an important role both in clinical practice and research of psychiatric disorders, including BD. Structural imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) have contributed to a deeper understanding of the structural changes in the brain in the context of psychiatric disorders.Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) are techniques which measure changes in response to cognitive demand and/or connectivity between brain regions.As such, these approaches provide an opportunity for investigating the neural bases of behavioural and cognitive impairment in psychiatric populations, including BD. Structural neuroimaging Computed Tomography (CT)In the last two decades, the first important data about neuroanatomic abnormalities in BD were obtained by means of CT.More recently, the widespread use of MRI has brought several advantages over CT, particularly in terms of higher resolution of images of subcortical regions (Steffens, 1998).Although a typical pattern of abnormality has not been identified yet (Supprian, 2004), several brain structures were found to be affected in patients with BD according to imaging studies.CT provides excellent imaging data and rapid image acquisition at relatively low cost, it is widely available and more easily tolerated by patients, remaining the imaging modality of first choice in many clinical situations (Dougherty et al., 2004).CT consists of a series of slices or tomograms.Its measurements are performed at the periphery of the body.The image of each slice is acquired by means of an X-ray source and detectors positioned at 180 degrees on the other side of the body.By spinning the source and the detectors on one plane of the head, data are collected from multiple angles.A computer then processes X-ray attenuation measured from different points and uses specific algorithms to create a structural image within the plane.Ionic and non-ionic intravenous www.intechopen.",

      "title": "The neuropharmacology of sleep paralysis hallucinations: serotonin 2A activation and a novel therapeutic drug",
      "abstract": "Sleep paralysis is a state of involuntary immobility occurring at sleep onset or offset, often accompanied by uncanny \"ghost-like\" hallucinations and extreme fear reactions. I provide here a neuropharmacological account for these hallucinatory experiences by evoking the role of the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR). Research has shown that 5-HT2AR activation can induce visual hallucinations, \"mystical\" subjective states, and out-of-body experiences (OBEs), and modulate fear circuits. Hallucinatory experiences triggered by serotonin-serotonergic (\"pseudo\") hallucinations, induced by hallucinogenic drugs-tend to be \"dream-like\" with the experiencer having insight (\"meta-awareness\") that he is hallucinating, unlike dopaminergic (\"psychotic\" and \"life-like\") hallucinations where such insight is lost. Indeed, hallucinatory experiences during sleep paralysis have the classic features of serotonergic hallucinations, and are strikingly similar to perceptual and subjective states induced by hallucinogenic drugs (e.g., lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD] and psilocybin), i.e., they entail visual hallucinations, mystical experiences, OBEs, and extreme fear reactions. I propose a possible mechanism whereby serotonin could be functionally implicated in generating sleep paralysis hallucinations and fear reactions through 5-HT2AR activity. Moreover, I speculate on the role of 5-HT2C receptors vis-à-vis anxiety and panic during sleep paralysis, and the orbitofrontal cortex-rich with 5-HT2A receptors-in influencing visual pathways during sleep paralysis, and, in effect, hallucinations. Finally, I propose, for the first time, a drug to target sleep paralysis hallucinations and fear reactions, namely the selective 5-HT2AR inverse agonist, pimavanserin. This account implicates gene HTR2A on chromosome 13q as the underlying cause of sleep paralysis hallucinations and could be explored using positron emission tomography.",

      "title": "The Causes and Developmental Mechanism of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "With the recent development of sleep medicine, insomnia has been perceived as a disease from a simple symptom. As there are various causes in a disease, proper treatment according to each cause is necessary for a more effective treatment In general, insomnia is classified into five categrories of physical, physiological, psychological, psychiatric and pharmacological aspects. However, such categorizations are often insufficient in treating insomnia. Furthermore understanding of the developmental mechanisms of insomnia is required. The function of sleep is developed and maintained through the balance of the reciprocal forces of sleep and arousal. These forces are contantly regulated by what is called a circadian rhythm. Sleep is induced by this rhythm which is affected by factors such as awakening time in the morning, amount of intellectual function, amount and time length of physical exercise and sunlight Insomnia could develop when this rhythm is delayed and leads to a forbidden zone which is a very difficult period for inducing sleep about two to four hours before the routine bedtime. Whereas sleep gradually develops in line with the circardian rhythm, arousal can occur very abruptly by any cause triggered by emotional discomfort or anxiety. Such characteristic and emotional factors as perfectionism, separation anxiety, secondary gain, insecurity, and negative cognition may provoke the inner anxiety and fear for insomnia, which can lead acute insomnia to a chronic one. As chronic insomnia is developed by multiple causes and factors, integrated approaches through analysis of above mentioned factors will be more effective in the treatment of insomnia than a simple administration of hypnotics.",

Wanneer slaapgebrek een chronisch probleem wordt zouden er wel eens veranderingen in hersenen en lichaam kunnen optreden die ernstige gevolgen hebben voor de psychische en fysieke gezondheid. Zo is er vaak gesuggereerd dat verstoorde slaap kan bijdragen aan het ontstaan van stemmingsstoornissen als depressie. In dit proefschrift worden studies beschreven naar de neurobiologische gevolgen van chronische slaaptekort in ratten. De dagelijkse hoeveelheid slaap werd tot minder dan de helft gereduceerd en in de weken daarna werden de gevolgen bestudeerd voor hersensystemen en hormonale processen die mogelijk betrokken zijn bij depressie. Hoewel een enkele dag van slaaptekort nog geen effecten had op deze systemen, waren er na een week al duidelijk veranderingen meetbaar in de gevoeligheid voor de neurotransmitter serotonine en in de regulatie van de hypofyse-bijnier as, het hormonale systeem dat betrokken is bij de reactie op stress. Na een maand van slaaptekort traden er zelfs morfologische veranderingen op in het brein. Er was een duidelijke afname in de grootte van de hippocampus, een hersengebied dat een belangrijke rol speelt bij de regulatie van emoties en cognitieve processen. Veel van de waargenomen neurobiologische en hormonale veranderingen na chronisch slaaptekort in ratten komen sterk overeen met afwijkingen die zijn vastgesteld bij depressieve patienten. De resultaten van deze studies leveren dan ook een sterke ondersteuning van de hypothese dat verstoorde slaap niet enkel een symptoom is van depressie maar, bij een deel van de patienten, mogelijk een causale rol speelt bij het ontstaan van de stemmingsstoornis.",

      "abstract": "The use of ketamine for treatment of comorbid pain, depression, and substance use disorders (SUDs) is becoming an option of increasing interest, as multiple clinical studies demonstrate its efficacy. Ketamine's efficacy in this diagnostically complex population is mechanistically based on a wide array of affected brain areas in addition to presynaptic neurons of the spine. Efficacy has been shown in both depressive and pain disorders with durability lasting 3 to 4 weeks after discontinuation of ketamine. Although ketamine itself is a drug of potential abuse when used recreationally, its lasting effects without repeated daily use have also shown promise for patients with SUDs. Assisted psychotherapy concurrent with ketamine treatment can help dependent patients cultivate new perceptions and ideals consistent with sobriety. Decreased opiate cravings in patients with SUDs may be related to ketamine's effects on reducing opiate-induced hyperalgesia. Given this and additional properties, ketamine can help reduce opiate medication burden, augment opiates in the hospice setting, or acutely alleviate symptoms of opiate withdrawal.

A depressão pós-parto ocorre mais comumente 6 semanas após o parto, em cerca de 6,5% a 20% das mulheres. Embora as mulheres que sofrem de tristeza pós-parto tendem a se recuperar rapidamente, a depressão puerperal tende a durar mais tempo e afeta gravemente a capacidade das mulheres de retornar às funções normais. Por ser definida como um transtorno depressivo maior, exigem critérios de diagnóstico, como sintomas de humor deprimido ou a perda de interesse ou prazer nas atividades presentes por pelo menos duas semanas. Além disso, podem estar presentes distúrbios do sono, distúrbios do apetite, perda de energia, sentimentos de inutilidade ou culpa, diminuição da concentração e pensamentos suicidas. O diagnóstico e o tratamento da depressão pós-parto são desafiadores, isso porque as alterações nos padrões de sono e no apetite, além da fadiga excessiva, são rotina para as mulheres após o parto, e nem todo tratamento trará benefícios à paciente.

Na busca, foram utilizadas as palavras-chave “depressão puerperal”, “gestação” e “transtornos psiquiátricos”. Foram aplicados os filtros “revisão bibliografica” e “relato de caso”. A amostra de estudo foi composta por textos em português e inglês com publicação no intervalo entre os anos de 2020 e 2024. Aplicando-se esses critérios, 20 artigos foram pesquisados, dos quais 8 deles foram selecionados. Resultados: Os resultados destacam a prevalência significativa da depressão puerperal em todo o mundo, bem como fatores de risco conhecidos, como história prévia de transtornos mentais, falta de apoio social, eventos estressantes durante a gestação e parto complicado. Além disso, as abordagens de triagem e diagnóstico; intervenções terapêuticas, incluindo psicoterapia e farmacoterapia; e medidas preventivas para reduzir o impacto da depressão puerperal na saúde materna e infantil ainda são controversas e precisam ser individualizadas de acordo com cada paciente. Conclusões: A depressão puerperal é uma condição que tem se tornado cada vez mais comum e que requer atenção cuidadosa por parte dos profissionais de saúde. Estratégias de triagem eficazes, intervenções terapêuticas baseadas em evidências e apoio contínuo são fundamentais para identificar e tratar adequadamente mulheres afetadas por essa condição. Além disso, políticas de saúde pública que promovam o acesso equitativo a cuidados de saúde mental perinatais são essenciais para mitigar os efeitos adversos da depressão puerperal na saúde materna e infantil.",

      "abstract": "Abstract As bipolar disorder is a recurrent illness over the lifetime of the patient, a central aspect of its successful treatment is the prevention of new mood episodes rather than simply the stabilization of acute manic or depressive episodes. For decades lithium was the only effective medication available for this purpose. However, not all patients responded to lithium, particularly those with a rapid cycling course of illness (four or more affective episodes per year) or mixed states (meeting criteria for depressive and manic states simultaneously). Over the last 15 years or so, fortunately, many new medications have emerged to greatly expand therapeutic options for our patients. Anticonvulsants such as valproate, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine have all received FDA approvals for treatment of bipolar mood states. This article summarizes the roles that lithium and several anticonvulsants play in the current treatment of mood disorders, with attention to their mechanism of action, indications, dosing, and side effects.",

      "abstract": "Concussion patients often have a lot of things going on at the same time. Consider these three principles: (1) Ask the patient what’s bothering him the most. Often it is pain. Migraine headaches, for example, can be terrible. Try to deeply understand the patient’s life to figure out what matters most. (2) Ask the collateral source what is causing the most problems in the patient’s life. Often it is mood instability. “He’s not the same person” is a common complaint. Sometimes, the most important problems following concussion are not immediately apparent to the patient. (3) Look for the “top of the cascade”—one single problem that is the root cause of one or more additional problems. For example, sleep disruption can in turn worsen memory, attention, pain, mood disorders and many other symptoms. Major depression can impair virtually every aspect of life including energy, sleep, pain, attention, and memory.",

      "abstract": "1. Previously described methods of inhalation anæsthesia and hypoxia in psychiatric conditions have been reviewed. 2. A technique of nitrous oxide administration beyond the state of intoxication and avoiding the Stage of deep hypoxemia has been described. 3. Physiological changes with this form of anæsthesia are slight and the method may be considered safe. 4. After the anæsthesia, a period of facilitation of mental processes is observed, which is followed by a period of relaxation and sedation. 5. During the phase of facilitation, the patient has a feeling of increased well-being and shows greater spontaneity, less resistance, and enhanced insight, often expressing previously repressed ideational content and affects. 6. The period of sedation lasts for several hours and is not associated with drowsiness or confusion. Sleep is usually improved the following night and other sedation is often unnecessary. 7. In states of acute manic excitement, repeated daily administration of nitrous oxide has controlled and terminated the attack in some cases. 8. Nitrous oxide hypoxia produces some of the features of the \"shock treatments\" as well as of narcoanalysis, but it is safe, convenient, and simple in administration and may be used in ambulatory patients without interruption of their ordinary activities. 9. The theories on the pharmacological action of nitrous oxide and the reason for its choice are discussed.",

      "title": "The ICSD-3 and DSM-5 guidelines for diagnosing narcolepsy: clinical relevance and practicality",
      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disease manifesting as difficulty with maintaining continuous wake and sleep. Clinical presentation varies but requires excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) occurring alone or together with features of rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep dissociation (e.g., cataplexy, hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, sleep paralysis), and disrupted nighttime sleep. Narcolepsy with cataplexy is associated with reductions of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin due to destruction of hypocretin peptide-producing neurons in the hypothalamus in individuals with a specific genetic predisposition. Updated diagnostic criteria include the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and International Classification of Sleep Disorders Third Edition (ICSD-3). DSM-5 criteria require EDS in association with any one of the following: (1) cataplexy; (2) CSF hypocretin deficiency; (3) REM sleep latency ≤15 minutes on nocturnal polysomnography (PSG); or (4) mean sleep latency ≤8 minutes on multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT) with ≥2 sleep-onset REM-sleep periods (SOREMPs). ICSD-3 relies more upon objective data in addition to EDS, somewhat complicating the diagnostic criteria: 1) cataplexy and either positive MSLT/PSG findings or CSF hypocretin deficiency; (2) MSLT criteria similar to DSM-5 except that a SOREMP on PSG may count as one of the SOREMPs required on MSLT; and (3) distinct division of narcolepsy into type 1, which requires the presence of cataplexy or documented CSF hypocretin deficiency, and type 2, where cataplexy is absent, and CSF hypocretin levels are either normal or undocumented. We discuss limitations of these criteria such as variability in clinical presentation of cataplexy, particularly when cataplexy may be ambiguous, as well as by age; multiple and/or invasive CSF diagnostic test requirements; and lack of normative diagnostic test data (e.g., MSLT) in certain populations. While ICSD-3 criteria reflect narcolepsy pathophysiology, DSM-5 criteria have greater clinical practicality, suggesting that valid and reliable biomarkers to help standardize narcolepsy diagnosis would be welcomed.",

      "abstract": "Thus, an assumption of the personality of old age or of a state of fatigue or weakness, induced through the second signal system, leads to a substantial reduction in the cortical tonus, which spreads to the subjacent nerve structures. As a consequence there is a sharp inhibition of conditioned and, in part, of unconditioned reflexes. Moreover, active cortical inhibition suffers particularly, and external inhibition is more pronounced. Upon \"return\" from this state of \"inhibition\" to the customary, real age or condition, one observes steady inhibition and, in some cases, positive induction. This confirms the presence of cortical inhibition in an arbitrarily induced condition of age or fatigue. If the subject regards himself as being of a younger age or in a more vigorous situation than usual, this will induce a certain increase in the reflexes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Users describe the effects of GHB as a euphoric, pleasant intoxication and disinhibition similar to that produced by alcohol or benzodiazepines. In addition, some report increased libido and enhancement of the sexual experience (Chin et al. 1998; Laborit 1972). GHB gained notoriety among regulatory agencies as well as in the club/party scene because of increases in the numbers of adverse effects and overdoses associated with its use (most often when co-administered with other substances). These can include weakness, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, loss of peripheral vision, hypothermia, respiratory acidosis, decrease or loss of consciousness, and coma. Overdosed users generally regain consciousness within 1–5 hours without sequelae (Chin et al. 1992, 1999; Dyer 1991; Ross 1995). Because the median lethal dose (LD50) is only about five times the intoxicating dose (Vickers 1969), and because it is synergistic with alcohol, the risk of central nervous system (CNS) depression is greater with GHB than with other club drugs.",

      "abstract": "TCA are used for the treatment of major depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, chronic pain syndromes, and peripheral neuropathies associated with psychiatric and medical conditions that call for a higher rate of prescription drugs. Frequently observed toxic symptoms are sinus tachycardia and altered mental status. Severe toxic symptoms include altered mental status, dysrhythmia, seizure, and secondary complications. Serious cardiotoxicity can lead to ventricular dysrhythmia and a classic TCA electrocardiogram. Gluteal myonecrosis is reported in postoperative alcoholic states, unconscious conditions where patients remain in one position over a long period of time, strenuous physical training, or in crushing injuries. We report a case of gluteal myonecrosis after treatment with several drugs including TCA resulted in intoxication. The patient was mentally drowsy and had been lying down for 20 hours upon discovery. The patient presented on arrival to the ER with cardiotoxicity secondary to TCA intoxication and was treated. Two weeks following the incident, she complained of pain in the gluteal area. Subsequent management and investigation revealed that her gluteal myonecrosis was a result of delayed complication from a prolonged recumbent position and hemolysis due to drug interactions. She eventually recovered without the need for surgery (fasciotomy).",

      "title": "Autism Spectrum Disorder and Epilepsy: Pathogenetic Mechanisms and Therapeutic Implications",
      "abstract": "The co-occurrence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and epilepsy is a complex neurological condition that presents significant challenges for both patients and clinicians. ASD is a group of complex developmental disorders characterized by the following: (1) Social communication difficulties: challenges in understanding and responding to social cues, initiating and maintaining conversations, and developing and maintaining relationships. (2) Repetitive behaviors: engaging in repetitive actions, such as hand-flapping, rocking, or lining up objects. (3) Restricted interests: focusing intensely on specific topics or activities, often to the exclusion of other interests. (4) Sensory sensitivities: over- or under-sensitivity to sensory input, such as sounds, touch, tastes, smells, or sights. These challenges can significantly impact individuals' daily lives and require specialized support and interventions. Early diagnosis and intervention can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with ASD and their families. Epilepsy is a chronic brain disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked (≥2) seizures that occur >24 h apart. Single seizures are not considered epileptic seizures. Epilepsy is often idiopathic, but various brain disorders, such as malformations, strokes, and tumors, can cause symptomatic epilepsy. While these two conditions were once considered distinct, growing evidence suggests a substantial overlap in their underlying neurobiology. The prevalence of epilepsy in individuals with ASD is significantly higher than in the general population. This review will explore the epidemiology of this comorbidity, delve into the potential mechanisms linking ASD and epilepsy, and discuss the implications for diagnosis, treatment, and management.",

      "title": "Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome: Outpatient Management.",
      "abstract": "Approximately one-half of patients with alcohol use disorder who abruptly stop or reduce their alcohol use will develop signs or symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The syndrome is due to overactivity of the central and autonomic nervous systems, leading to tremors, insomnia, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, anxiety, and agitation. If untreated or inadequately treated, withdrawal can progress to generalized tonic-clonic seizures, delirium tremens, and death. The three-question Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption and the Single Alcohol Screening Question instrument have the best accuracy for assessing unhealthy alcohol use in adults 18 years and older. Two commonly used tools to assess withdrawal symptoms are the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale, Revised, and the Short Alcohol Withdrawal Scale. Patients with mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms without additional risk factors for developing severe or complicated withdrawal should be treated as outpatients when possible. Ambulatory withdrawal treatment should include supportive care and pharmacotherapy as appropriate. Mild symptoms can be treated with carbamazepine or gabapentin. Benzodiazepines are first-line therapy for moderate to severe symptoms, with carbamazepine and gabapentin as potential adjunctive or alternative therapies. Physicians should monitor outpatients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome daily for up to five days after their last drink to verify symptom improvement and to evaluate the need for additional treatment. Primary care physicians should offer to initiate long-term treatment for alcohol use disorder, including pharmacotherapy, in addition to withdrawal management.",

      "title": "Pseudopheochromocytoma",
      "abstract": "Introduction Pseudopheochromocytoma is a rare but often disabling syndrome of paroxysmal severe hypertension and symptoms of catecholamine excess, including feelings of anxiety, tremor, sweating and palpitations [1]. In some patients, other features are also present including chest pain, headache, nausea, dizziness, pseudoseizures and paradoxically low blood pressures. Episodes tend to have rapid onset and last from a few minutes up to a few hours and be followed by intense fatigue that can last for several days. During episodes, many patients feel as though they 'might die'. Although many of the presenting features of pseudopheochromocytoma resemble those of pheochromocytoma, the main difference is that there is no definite anatomical or biochemical abnormality, although evidence of mild to moderate catecholamine excess may be present, particularly during paroxysms. Other reported biochemical abnormalities in pseudopheochromocytoma include elevated peripheral plasma dopamine sulphate levels [2] but these are not present in all patients. Pseudopheochromocytoma has clinical similarities with both Page's syndrome [3] ('hypertensive diencephalic syndrome') which was first described in 1935, and autonomic epilepsy which is occasionally associated with tumours or cysts in the thalamic region [4] but can occur as an unexplained entity. To date, no anatomical thalamic abnormalities have been confirmed in patients with pseudopheochromocytoma. Psychological aspects Pseudopheochromocytoma is largely a diagnosis of exclusion, which requires careful screening for any treatable pheochromocytoma before the diagnosis is made. There is considerable overlap between pseudopheochromocytoma and panic disorder conditions and it is not known to what extent psychological factors can influence the often severe acute rise in blood pressure seen in patients with pseudopheochromocytoma during paroxysms. Indeed, pseudopheochromocytoma has been associated with a history of traumatic psychological experiences during childhood or a tendency to suppress distressing emotions, and psychotherapy has been useful in relieving symptoms in many patients [5]. Multifactorial causes Increasingly, we are realizing that in most complex disorders, including hypertension, it is the exception to find a unifactorial cause and in the vast majority of cases, a large number of factors act together to influence the development of the condition in any one individual. The same is likely to be true in pseudopheochromocytoma, where many different factors, including both somatic and supratentorial elements, probably interplay in any one patient to cause the clinical syndrome. It is also likely that there is heterogeneity among patients, with differences in the severity and clinical features which lead to the label of pseudopheochromocytoma. Secondary causes of pseudopheochromocytoma-like symptoms When assessing a patient with pseudopheochromocytoma-like symptoms, it is important to ascertain whether the syndrome may be secondary to another condition, e.g. obstructive sleep apnoea [6] or drug therapy, e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, sympathomimetic agents or reboxetine [7] all of which can raise sympathetic activity. Other conditions aside from pheochromocytoma that can present in a similar way to pseudopheochromocytoma include systemic mastocytosis, cocaine use and reninoma. Sympathoadrenal function in pseudopheochromocytoma In the current issue of the Journal, Sharabi et al. [8] have published one of the largest series of patients with pseudopheochromocytoma in the literature to date and have attempted to unravel some of the mechanisms underlying the condition, by studying the role of the sympathetic nervous system and adrenal function in pseudopheochromocytoma. This was a difficult study to do, partly due to difficulty recruiting patients with the true condition but also due to uncertainty as to what the primary endpoint should be, according to which the study should be powered. As a result of this, many measurements were made, with no single primary outcome measure defined. Plasma catecholamine levels and haemodynamic parameters were measured following the administration of various pharmacological manipulators of the sympathetic nervous system and adrenal function in a group of 11 patients with pseudopheochromocytoma and 14 healthy controls. Baseline levels of plasma catecholamines and metanephrine, the O-methylated metabolite of epinephrine, were also measured and functional imaging of the adrenal medulla was performed using the positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer [18F]fluorodopamine. Pharmacological manipulation of sympathoadrenal function The pharmacological agents administered in the study were as follows: the ganglion blocker trimethaphan, which is a competitive antagonist at nicotinic cholinergic receptors at autonomic ganglia and inhibits both sympathetic and parasympathetic outflow; yohimbine, which is a competitive α2-adrenoceptor antagonist, which increases adrenal production of epinephrine and norepinephrine by binding to preganglionic α2-adrenoceptors and blocking the negative feedback inhibition of catecholamine production; isoproterenol which is a β-adrenoceptor agonist; and glucagon which stimulates epinephrine production. Results The main findings of the current study were of increased adrenal epinephrine release and increased circulatory responses to catecholamines in the patients with pseudopheochromocytoma. In the current study, patients with pseudopheochromocytoma had higher baseline plasma epinephrine levels but similar norepinephrine levels to controls. In contrast, a previous study showed no difference between baseline plasma epinephrine or norepinephrine levels in patients with pseudopheochromocytoma and controls [9]. No abnormality in adrenomedullary function was observed on [18F]fluorodopamine PET scanning in the patients with pseudopheochromocytoma. Ganglion blockers When interpreting the effects of the ganglion blockade by trimethaphan, it is worth bearing a few points in mind. First, trimethaphan, in addition to blocking the autonomic ganglia, causes histamine release, unlike the alternative ganglion blocker, pentolinium. Trimethaphan also has a shorter half-life than pentolinium. Pentolinium is sometimes used as a diagnostic suppression test in the investigation of patients with possible pheochromocytoma [10]. The effects of ganglion blockade depend upon the level of preganglionic stimulation. Pentolinium is good at suppressing physiological elevations of epinephrine but has less effect if epinephrine levels are normal at baseline. In contrast, clonidine, which is also used as a suppression test in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, is not very effective in suppressing epinephrine, but suppresses norepinephrine levels well. The authors did not include the pentolinium suppression test as an evaluation of the pseudopheochromocytoma patients included in this study. In the current study, the results in response to trimethaphan are somewhat surprising in that there was a lesser fall in norepinephrine levels in patients with pseudopheochromocytoma than in controls. This could be explained by the fact that the pseudopheochromocytoma patients started with significantly lower baseline levels of norepinephrine than the controls and ganglion blockers are less effective at lowering norepinephrine levels from a lower baseline level. With regard to epinephrine levels, if as the authors suggest, there are higher baseline epinephrine levels in patients with pseudopheochromocytoma, one might expect to see an exaggerated drop in epinephrine levels in response to trimethaphan administration; however, the authors did not report the changes in epinephrine levels with trimethaphan. Potential role of dopamine in pseudopheochromocytoma The role of dopamine in pseudopheochromocytoma was not directly assessed in this study. Dopamine sulphate levels were found to be three-fold elevated in patients with pseudopheochromocytoma in one study [2] but in patients in the current study, plasma dopamine levels were normal. It is also known that dopamine antagonists can induce hypertensive crisis in patients with pheochromocytoma by blocking the presynaptic negative inhibition of norepinephrine release. Anecdotally, we have had some success in improving the symptoms of pseudopheochromocytoma by using low doses of the dopamine agonist cabergoline; however, the unproven benefits would need to be weighed against the reported association between some dopamine agonists and cardiac valvular fibrosis when used at high doses. Role of adrenoceptor sensitivity in pseudopheochromocytoma A previous study by Hamada et al.[9] showed that patients with pseudopheochromocytoma had a significantly greater systolic blood pressure response to a valsalva manoeuvre than patients with pheochromocytoma, essential hypertension or normal controls. The systolic blood pressure rise was suppressed by the prior administration of non-selective β-blockade or α1-blockade. They concluded that patients with pseudopheochromocytoma had β and α1-adrenoceptor hypersensitivity. It is known that β-blockers and α1-blockers relieve symptoms in some patients with pseudopheochromocytoma. Interestingly, while α-blockers are the mainstay of medical therapy for pheochromocytoma (sometimes combined with β-blockade depending on the degree of tachycardia on α-blockade, which is often related to the amount of epinephrine production), patients with pseudopheochromocytoma tend to have a slightly better response to β-blockade, although often α1-blockade is used in combination. Antidepressants may also have a role in the management of pseudopheochromocytoma. Conclusions While the current study represents an important addition to the limited literature on pseudopheochromocytoma, unfortunately it has not yet fully explained the mechanisms of pseudopheochromocytoma or provided any specific diagnostic test for the condition. The findings support the use of α-blockade and β-blockade in the management of patients with pseudopheochromocytoma but have not suggested any other possible treatments. The authors should, however, be congratulated on ascertaining and studying a cohort of patients with this rare but important condition. Further publications of well-phenotyped series of patients with pseudopheochromocytoma should be encouraged to help improve our understanding and treatment of the condition.",

      "abstract": "Migraine is a complex disorder with multiple aetiological factors. A variety of psychological factors have been reported to be either predisposing or precipitating causes of migraine. Among the predisposing factors have been various personality attributes; neurosis and other psychiatric disorders. Among the precipitating factors are emotional reactions, changes in life situation; various psychosocial stresses, periods of overactivity and 'let down' periods. In addition to the operation of the above psychological factors, which constitute a psychosomatic sequence of events, there are also mood changes which may accompany an attack of migraine associated with alterations in energy, concentration, and ability to work. There may also be a somatopsychic sequence of events in which the sufferer may react in various ways to an attack of migraine just as he may react to any other illness or disability.",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction occurs in men and women and the prevalence increases with age. Dysfunction can occur in one or more areas of the normal sexual response cycle: desire, arousal, or orgasm. It can also be due to pain. Family physicians should routinely screen all men and women for sexual dysfunction, given its high prevalence and high correlation with other conditions. Risk factors include use of prescription drugs (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, diuretics, antihormonals), recreational drugs, alcohol, and/or nicotine; certain health and lifestyle issues; and many chronic medical conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes. Diagnosis is based on clinical features; therefore, a detailed sexual history and focused physical examination are critical. Laboratory testing, imaging, and management are tailored to the suspected condition. Although some therapies require referral, education of patients about the normal sexual response cycle, discontinuation or changing of drugs, screening for and management of comorbid conditions, and counseling and guidance about lifestyle changes or use of devices all can be addressed in the family medicine setting.",

La explicacion de la asociacion entre consumo de sustancias y trastornos de personalidad presenta algunas difi cultades, ya que en muchas ocasiones se desconoce si la personalidad es la que determina el inicio en el consumo de drogas, si es el consumo de drogas el que lleva a un patron de personalidad desadaptativo, si el consumo de drogas lo que hace es modular una serie de rasgos previos, o si son independientes los patrones de personalidad y el consumo de drogas.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Identifying biomarkers for major depression is of high importance for improving diagnosis and treatment of this common and debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder, as the field seeks to move toward both personalized and more effective treatments. Here we focus on electroencephalography (EEG) or direct scalp voltage recordings as such a biomarker, with an emphasis on gamma and high gamma oscillations (or “rhythms”). In the last several decades, alpha and theta band rhythms have been found to provide information on depressive state as well as recovery, but the gamma band is less well characterized with respect to depression. We summarize some key findings on gamma rhythms (especially their amplitude) as a biomarker or endophenotype for major depression. These studies suggest: (1) under certain conditions gamma rhythms can distinguish subjects with major depression from healthy controls, (2) gamma may distinguish bipolar disorder from unipolar depression, (3) various pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments that counteract depression also alter gamma, (4) animal models of depression-like behavior show gamma abnormalities, with changes in gamma associated with therapeutic recovery. The most informative approaches in the future may combine profiles of gamma band power across the brain to assess ratios of activity across regions. Overall we have good evidence to suggest that gamma rhythms may provide objective information on major depressive disease status, but we will need further work to better define the precise measures to follow.",

      "abstract": "The author presents a new psychosomatic stress model. All the elements of the hypothesis are well known but, in this context, are published first. The following are the most critical aspects of the recommended chronic stress model. 1/ Stress contains both sympathetic and parasympathetic elements, but the latter predominate. 2/ The mediator of stress is carbon dioxide, the substance that can turn the psyche into soma. 3/ In humans, chronic stress is mainly social; people cause it to each other. Chronic social stress is created frequently due to deviations in civilisation, education and tolerance. 4/ The freeze response (or freezing behaviour) plays a subordinate role in the animal world; it lasts mainly for a maximum of minutes, while in humans, it dominates and can continue for decades. 5/ The decisive step of freeze is apnea, hypopnea, which occurs due to aversive psychological eff ects. After a more extended existence, mild chronic respiratory acidosis develops and most often appears in the clinical form of obstructive sleep apnea. 6/ Chronic hypercapnia can shape the metabolism into metabolic syndrome. 7/ After that, various cardiovascular and metabolic complications (hypertension, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, depression) may develop - partly due to genetic and lifestyle reasons.

In addition to physical symptoms related to nervous system hyperexcitability, withdrawal includes changes in mental state that may motivate renewed AOD consumption. The manifestations of addiction are associated with changes in nerve cell function by which the brain attempts to adapt to a drug's presence. These functional changes modulate a person's initial response to a drug, the establishment of long-term craving for the drug (i.e., addiction), and the persistent sense of discomfort that leads to relapse after abstinence has been achieved. Research is beginning to reveal how specific brain regions may be integrated to form neural circuits that modulate aspects of addiction.",

      "abstract": "Ayurveda “Science of life” is a unique combination of science and philosophy that balances the holistic aspects of health i.e. physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. Its aim is to promote and preserve physical and mental health and cure of ailments too. In order to lead a good quality of life both physical and mental health of a person should be maintained in good conditions. Now a days, even people know the importance of mental health as due to their busy lifestyle usually they succumb to unhealthy lifestyle which later pose harm to their health. Due to extreme stress in life people are becoming susceptible to various mental and lifestyle health issues like anxiety, depression, HTN, Diabetes and insomnia. Insomnia is defined as a condition where a person is unable to sleep or does not have a sound and sufficient sleep and wakes up usually tired and exhausted. The general causes of insomnia include stressful lifestyle, environmental influence, mental tension, changed food habits or any mental trauma. It is generally of two types: acute insomnia and chronic insomnia. The acute insomnia is referred to a condition one with short duration of few days to few weeks and the second chronic insomnia is which lasts for longer duration of few months to even years. Some of the major symptoms of insomnia include: difficulty in falling asleep at night, sleeplessness, waking up abruptly while sleeping and then not being able to fall asleep again, waking up tired and exhausted, irritability, sometimes wake up with headache, less concentration and low mood throughout the day, over thinking and worry related to sleep. There are various treatments available for this ailment in the form of oral medicines and therapies. In Ayurvedic treatment for insomnia some therapies such as Shirodhara and herbal medicines like Brahmi, Ashwagandha, Sarpgandha are known to produce calming and relaxing effect and result in sound and good sleep. This paper aims to compile and review the classical literature regarding management of Anidra; scientifically reported classical and non-classical sedative herbs; and clinical trials conducted on Anidra.",

      "title": "Moving interventions from after to before diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Some twenty years ago, the onset of psychosis was seen as the first sign of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Large scale epidemiological studies have since shown that, before the first psychotic episode, several deviations of normal development take place in (at least part of) the youngsters who later develop schizophrenia. While in childhood there is an average delay in reaching milestones such as walking, talking and reading, the most salient deviation during the teens is the decreased interaction with peers and decreased academic performance1. Children who later develop a psychotic disorder may have some deviant behavior, with schizotypal or schizoid features, which is expressed as few (or no) close friends and fewer social connections in sports, teams or hobbies. Occasional perceptual aberrations and magical beliefs are experienced by some 40% of children who later develop schizophrenia2, 3. In the second decade, cognitive decreases become apparent, which can be observed as lower school level than that of sibs and parents, doubling of classes or even quitting school4, 5. Finally, after puberty, subclinical psychotic symptoms emerge (or increase), which indicates the ultra high risk (UHR) period. Of course there are many exceptions, and some youngsters will develop a first psychosis out of the blue, with perfect social and cognitive skills antedating it. Yet, at least half of psychotic patients show a trajectory which provides clues for early recognition and interventions. All larger cohorts of UHR individuals show that cognitive decline is the clearest predictor of transition to psychosis5-7, together with severity of subclinical psychotic complaints. Animal models, genetic information, imaging studies in high risk groups, studies in children with 22q11 deletion syndrome, and post-mortem studies have shed light on neurobiological deviations that take place in these early phases, before the so-called first psychotic episode. Decreases in GABA functioning, especially of Chandelier cells, reduced NMDA receptor activity, increased oxidative stress and insufficient scavengers (especially glutathione), increased pro-inflammatory status of the brain and lower mitochondrial functioning add to varying degree to an individual's susceptibility towards developing schizophrenia. Some of these neurobiological deviations can be measured in vivo (i.e., glutathione and GABA concentrations by magnetic resonance spectroscopy; inflammatory status by positron emission tomography), whilst others cannot (density of Chandelier cells). This knowledge provides a basis for potential targeted treatment of specific susceptible subgroups of individuals with the same phenotype, but is not yet ready for clinical use. Epidemiology, cohort and case-control studies provide evidence of several risk factors occurring in the teenage period that can further increase risk of onset of psychosis. Among them are drug abuse, bullying, social exclusion, sleep deprivation, stressful events, inflammatory conditions and immigration. At the same time, pilot studies on interventions in the preclinical period have been performed, that showed efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (although not compared to an active control condition)8 and of nutritional supply of omega-3 fatty acids (although not replicated in a larger group)9. At present, we do not know everything we would like to know to act early to prevent transition to psychosis in vulnerable youngsters, but we do have some basic clues on which we can act already. Each year we wait to complete our knowledge, many youngsters go on to develop a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. This topic should be a high priority in psychiatric research, as even UHR individuals who do not develop psychosis tend to manifest (other) severe psychiatric problems. A psychiatric disease affecting an adolescent or young adult has a large impact on the person himself, but also on his family, surrounding and society at large. There are several ways forward, both for researchers and for health care workers. For the latter, schools are the most important partners for collaboration, since cognition is such an important risk factor. Cognitive decline is first detected at school, and lower functioning than in previous years, with a prominent deviation from sibs, should be a reason to contact health care workers who can screen for (subclinical) psychotic features. When these are present, a working alliance between mental care workers, family and school should be made to prevent further hits, i.e. prevent the youngster from starting to abuse drugs, actively avoid (or stop) being bullied and socially isolated, regulate exposure to stress and sleep. For researchers, individual neurobiological deviations at the UHR stage need to be tested for correction with specific interventions, such as supplementation with n-acetylcysteine to restore glutathione function, glutamatergic or GABA-ergic agents to improve signaling of the inhibitory interneurons, and omega-3 fatty acids or anti-inflammatory agents to restore optimal brain condition. In addition, CBT for UHR needs to be compared to other psychosocial interventions, and efficacy has to be tested at group level and in specific patient groups. In short, there is much work to do for all of us in order to prevent transition to psychosis of vulnerable youngsters, and we need to make haste. Iris E.

      "abstract": "The term addiction commonly used for drug addiction is uncontrolled use of alcohol, nicotine, opiates, heroine and other psychoactive substances. Apart from this some times it is also used for other compulsions. These unwholesome substances or bad habits are the remote causes for several others diseases. These bad habits are harmful for health but sudden discontinuation of these again produces some discomforts or diseases. These are known as withdrawal symptoms like cravings, irritability, insomnia, depression and anorexia, etc. Instead of withdrawal therapy, Ayurveda mentioned an attractive, logical, replacement therapy. It means unwholesome substances or bad habits should be replaced by good one, which is more constructive. The replacement therapy which should be very systematical and gradual is known as Satmyikarana process in Ayurveda. Satmya means suitability to some things, which are favourable for one’s own self. Satmyam nama yad yadatmanyupaseta (CS Vi-1/20). On the other hand, the substance that is unfavorable for one’s own self is known as Asatmya. Asatmyamiti tadvidyadyanna yati sahatmyatam (CS Sa-1/127). Satmya and Asatmya are also known as Upashaya and Anupashaya, respectively. Hita and pathya are frequently used as synonyms for Satmya and their antonym for Asatmya. Satmyikarana is a procedure of adaptation by gradual and logical giving up of Asatmya substance, on the other hand layer by layer acceptance of Satmya substance. In another word, making foreign substance homologous to body is also known as Satmyikarana. When persons are habituated to any unwholesome substances they feel happy with that. Absence of it creates emptiness or discomfort. Instead of being left blank, filling the blanks with another good one is more constructive. Administration of wholesome substances in this specific way may helps to avoid addictive stimulus and exhibit a healthier way to quench the thirst. It resists the appearance of withdrawal symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Abstract There are two major categories of mood disorders (also sometimes referred to as “affective” disorders): (1) depression, which includes major depression, dysthymia, depressive disorder not otherwise specified, bipolar depression, and depression caused by a medical condition or substance abuse; and (2) bipolar disorder, which includes mania (with or without depression), hypomania, cyclothymia, and bipolar disorder not otherwise specified. Some people have symptoms of both a bipolar and a depressive disorder at the same time, a condition referred to as a “mixed state.” Clearly, mood disorders come in many different varieties, and each case is different in some ways.",

      "title": "Stress and Insomnia – A Vicious Circle",
      "abstract": "Insomnia refers to the complaint of experiencing unsatisfactory sleep, typically characterized by difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep. Individuals with insomnia are dissatisfied with their sleep quality and perceive it as hindering their ability to perform well in work, school, and social settings. Common symptoms of insomnia include fatigue, decreased mood,irritability, general discomfort, and cognitive difficulties. Stress, on the other hand, is the result of emotional or physical tension triggered by various events that can lead a person to feel frustrated, angry, or anxious. Stress is the body&amp;#39;s response to a challenge or demand, and it is accompanied by the release of hormones. The specific physiological response to stressdepends on factors such as the type of stress, the individual's characteristics, their neuroendocrine system, and the combination of these elements, which collectively determine how the brain and body react to a particular stressor. The activation of the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a response mechanism triggered by stress. Disturbed sleep, particularly insomnia, is a common side effect of stress, varying in intensity. Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining both physical and mental well-being, making the physiological connections between sleep and stress vital in understanding the development of stress-induced pathophysiology. Current treatments for insomnia include Cognitive BehavioralTherapy, improving sleep hygiene, and employing psychological and pharmacological interventions. However, these approaches primarily aim to improve insomnia symptoms rather than addressing its underlying cause. In the context of Homoeopathy, the concept of constitution refers to an individual's unique structure, composition, nature, and physicalmakeup, influenced by both inherited qualities and environmental factors. Therefore, it is essential to individualize each case and administer a similimum remedy to achieve complete healing according to Homoeopathic principles. This review aims to explore the physiological and neuroendocrine changes that occur as a result of the interplay between stress and thedevelopment of insomnia.",

Psychologic dependence, however, is intense and is the primary problem in cocaine addiction. Although withdrawal symptoms are both somatic and visceral, severe depression is the dominant symptom. Therapy for withdrawal symptoms is not specific, but desipramine, bromocriptine and lithium have shown considerable promise. Acute overdose requires life support therapy. Appropriate pharmacologic interventions include intravenous diazepam to control central nervous system symptoms and propranolol or labetalol to control arrhythmias and hypertension.",

Furthermore cases of dyskinesia have been reported, which are already described in the literature after long term intake, as well as anticholinergic reactions. Despite of their use as antiallergic drugs, reports on hypersensitivity reactions due to antihistamines, up to anaphylactic reaction have been not infrequently received by the AKdA. In rare cases disturbances of blood cell formation have been reported besides observations of gastrointestinal disorders, increase of appetite and weight.

In most subjects with dysmorphophobia there was comorbidity of dysthymia or major depression. An improvement in the state of these patients, most often after implementation of complex therapeutic measures: psychotherapy as well as pharmacotherapy with neuroleptic and SSRI's or clomipramine has to do with withdrawal of delusions, whereas the symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder usually last for years.

      "abstract": "Marijuana ( Cannabis sativa ) is the most commonly used illicit drug worldwide as well as in the Unites States. Prolonged use of marijuana or repeated administration of its primary psychoactive constituent, Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), can lead to physical dependence in humans and laboratory animals. The changes that occur with repeated cannabis use include alterations in behavioral, physiological, and biochemical responses. A variety of withdrawal responses occur in cannabis-dependent individuals: anger, aggression, irritability, anxiety and nervousness, decreased appetite or weight loss, restlessness, and sleep difficulties with strange dreams. But the long half-life and other pharmacokinetic properties of THC result in delayed expression of withdrawal symptoms, and because of the lack of contiguity between drug cessation and withdrawal responses the latter are not readily recognized as a clinically relevant syndrome. Over the past 30 years, a substantial body of clinical and laboratory animal research has emerged supporting the assertion that chronic exposure to cannabinoids produces physical dependence and may contribute to drug maintenance in cannabis-dependent individuals. However, no medications are approved to treat cannabis dependence and withdrawal. In this review, we describe preclinical and clinical research that supports the existence of a cannabinoid withdrawal syndrome. In addition, we review research evaluating potential pharmacotherapies (e.g., THC, a variety of antidepressant drugs, and lithium) to reduce cannabis withdrawal responses and examine how expanded knowledge about the regulatory mechanisms in the endocannabinoid system may lead to promising new therapeutic targets.",

      "title": "Psychodynamic Aspects of Reserpine: Its Uses and Effects in Open Psychiatric Settings",
      "abstract": "1) Reserpine is a remarkable and useful drug. It has a definite place in psychiatry for the alleviation of selected symptoms. It is not in any sense a psychic “specific”. 2) The physiologic effects of this drug are relatively constant. The principal ones are a fall in blood pressure, a relative bradycardia, and in adequate dosage, a slowing of the patient's spontaneous activity; feelings of weakness, tiredness and of being held down. 3) There are other effects, which are predominantly psychological and it is felt that they have nothing to do with the physiological effects per se. They are the result of the way in which the physiological action fits into the patient's way of handling and expressing his conflict (i.e. defenses). When a patient does badly it is due to the way in which the physiological effects psychologically threaten the patient. A patient does well or badly depending on this, and we have seen enhanced anxiety as well as psychoses produced by both reserpine and chlorpromazine (8). 4) Because of the above, psychotherapeutic efforts are of the greatest importance, and when used, usually overshadow the effects of the drug. We feel that no patient is treated in a vacuum. Milieu and relationship is what counts most. The other factors, though important, are adjuvants. 5) A level of 10 to 40 mg./day will control most motor over-activity. Anxiety and most panics can be handled at between 2 and 10 mg./day. The average daily dose was 7 mg./day. The average length of treatment was 26 days. 6) Side effects are frequent, but are rapidly reversible. There were no serious or irreversible toxic effects. The drug is remarkably safe. 7) Reserpine is of about the same usefulness as chlorpromazine in psychiatry. Chlorpromazine is quicker acting. Reserpine is safer. When the G.I. tract is irritated or the site of symptoms, chlorpromazine is preferable. Cardiac or cardiovascular symptomatology might indicate a preference for reserpine, especially when bradycardia is desirable. Neither is a “specific” curative agent. Both are useful for the symptomatic relief of selected symptoms. Both have their contra indications. Neither is an effective substitute for intimate human contact with the patient. Both should be used along with psychotherapy.",

      "title": "NEUROPATI OPTIK TOKSIK AKIBAT ETAMBUTOL",
      "abstract": "Neuropati Optik Toksik (NOT) adalah kelainan pada fungsi penglihatan akibat kerusakan saraf optik yang disebabkan oleh zat beracun salah satunya adalah etambutol. Kejadian NOT terkait etambutol ini sangat bervariasi dari beberapa studi berkisar antara 0,5 - 35% penderita. Neuropati optik toksik dapat memberikan gejala berupa penurunan penglihatan yang berlangsung progresif, semakin memberat hingga dapat terjadi kebutaan. Meskipun hilangnya penglihatan ini bersifat reversibel saat etambutol diturunkan dosisnya atau dihentikan, beberapa pasien mengalami gangguan penglihatan permanen bahkan dengan dosis obat yang standar. Beberapa kasus progresifitas tetap berjalan meskipun obat telah dihentikan. Seringkali dijumpai perbaikan yang tidak sempurna. Bahkan ada pula yang mengalami kebutaan permanen. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah Melaporkan kasus Neuropati Optik Toksik akibat terapi Etambutol pada penderita TB. Seorang wanita usia 28 tahun, dengan keluhan pandangan kabur sejak satu minggu yang lalu dan dirasakan semakin memberat. Tidak didapatkan keluhan mata merah, nerocoh, maupun nyeri pada mata. Pasien juga mengeluhkan nyeri kepala terasa berat pada seluruh kepala disertai mual. Keluhan lain seperti kejang, penurunan kesadaran, kelemahan separo tubuh, kesemutan, merot, maupun pelo tidak didapatkan. Tidak ada riwayat diabetes maupun hipertensi. Pasien terdiagnosis TB paru satu bulan yang lalu, kemudian mulai menjalani pengobatan TB regimen HRZE dengan dosis standar sejak dua minggu ini. Pemeriksaan Fisik dan neurologis hanya didapatkan penurunan visus VOD 6/20, VOS 6/40, scotoma central, funduskopi macular reflex OS menurun, pemeriksaan lain dalam batas normal.  Pada pasien ini, keluhan pandangan kabur mulai dirasakan setelah satu minggu mengkonsumsi etambutol, durasi ini cukup cepat mengingat pada literatur disebutkan onset munculnya gejala mulai dua bulan hingga enam bulanan. Dosis etambutol yang dikonsumsi oleh pasien ini adalah dosis standar, yaitu 15 mg/kgBB. Pada pemeriksaan fisik& neurologis semua pemeriksaan normal kecuali status oftalmologis. Didapatkan VOD 6/20 VOS 6/20, scotoma central, funduskopi macular reflex menurun. Pemeriksaan laboratorium juga telah dilengkapi dan tidak didapatkan abnormalitas. Pada awalnya pasien juga mengeluh nyeri kepala disertai muntah. Sehingga neurologis juga memikirkan diferential diagnosis suatu proses intrakranial. Namun hal ini telah disingkirkan dengan hasil CT Scan kepala yang menunjukkan gambaran normal. Selama perawatan terapi yang diberikan adalah berupa anti inflamasi, neurotropik, obat simtomatis untuk keluhan nyeri kepala mual muntahnya, dan melanjutkan terapi TBnya tanpa etambutol. Evaluasi visus dilakukan setiap hari saat opname, dilanjutkan tiap minggu saat rawat jalan. Perbaikan mulai dirasakan oleh pasien setidaknya tiga hari setelah dilakukan penghentian regimen etambutol. Perubahan yang signifikan tampak setelah dua minggu penghentian. Kemudian tiga minggu setelah keluhan, di klinik rawat jalan pasien mengatakan bahwa penglihatannya sudah kembali normal, demikian pula hasil pemeriksaannya, VODS 6/6, scotoma central-, funduskopi dbn. Neuropati optic akibat etambutol dapat reversibel. Penghentian obat harus segera dilakukan bila didapatkan keluhan terkait penglihatan pada pasien, yaitu berupa penurunan visus, gangguan lapang pandang, maupun abnormalitas funduskopi. Dari evaluasi visus selama perawatan, pasien mengalami perbaikan visus sempurna dalam waktu tiga minggu setelah obat dihentikan.",

It results from a lack of thiamine (vitamin B1) and often occurs in chronic alcoholics, people with malnutrition, on dialysis or with other systemic disorders. It may also develop with atypical symptoms, which can considerably delay diagnosis. We present a case of a 61 year old man, non-drinker with no history of vomiting, who came to the primary care centre on several occasions due to several episodes of temporary loss of consciousness accompanied by general malaise and diffuse paraesthesia. Typical symptoms began to appear as the syndrome developed, such as memory loss producing Korsakoff's amnesia. The lack of a typical history contributed to a delayed diagnosis. After confirmingthediagnosis,�acompleteaetiologicalstudywasconductedthatdidnotreveal� any underlying factor. Parenteral thiamine produced partial recovery. Although diagnosis is mainly by clinical impression, diagnostic tests should be conducted such as analysis of vitamin B1 in serum and especially Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) which reveals characteristic signs. An aetiological study should also be conducted. Early diagnosis is essential in order to prevent neurological sequela.",

Patients may use nicotine, alcohol, cannabis, cocaine or other drugs of abuse in order to overcome symptoms associated with schizophrenia itself or with the side effects of the antipsychotic medications used to treat the underlying illness. The impact of substance abuse for comorbid substance abusers compared with nonabusing schizophrenia patients includes a lower quality of life, increased tardive dyskinesia, increased psychosocial problems, more relationship difficulties, cognitive deficits and even suicide. Patients with a dual diagnosis also tend to have higher relapse rates, higher rates of hospitalization, and by inference, increased healthcare costs.

      "title": "The Depressed Patient",
      "abstract": "DEPRESSION IS A PHENOMENON that most of us experience to a greater or lesser degree at some time in our lives. It is a psychophysiological state, manifested psychologically by feelings of sadness, worthlessness, hopelessness, of emptiness. There is a lack of interest in the events of the outside world. Activities that are usually enjoyed become flat, dull, meaningless. Physically, there is a slowing down of bodily functions. The respiratory rate is slow. The gastrointestinal slowdown results in retarded emptying of the stomach and intestines, leading to a loss of appetite, a feeling of fullness in the stomach, burping, and constipation. Muscle tension decreases, leading to drooping facies, the slumped posture, the slow, dragging gait. Eyeballs tend to be sunken and the eyes lacking in luster. Sleep disturbance is common. There may be difficulty in going to sleep, in staying asleep, or, on the other hand, there may be an increased desire for sleep. Along with a lessened interest in external events, there is a loss of interest in grooming and personal hygiene. The same dark, dull clothes may be worn day after day. These manifestations seem to reflect the depressed person's general lack of selfesteem and self-confidence, and his lack of belief that life can be worth living. The cognitive functions are slowed down. Questions are answered hesitantly, often after a pause. Conversation is seldom initiated and often confined to monosyllables and to reminiscing about past events, frequently of an unhappy nature. Cryng is frequent. Thinking requires conscious effort. Concentration is difficult. The attention span is short for topics unrelated to the feelings of the depression. The depressed person's attitude toward life itself varies from a feeling that this world is unfit to live in to a belief that one is not fit to live and that the world would be a better place if one were not in it, that is, if one were dead. The former set of attitudes is frequently an unspoken plea for succor and support. The latter, which usually occurs only in pathological states of deep depression, indicates a suicidal danger. The old adage that one who talks of suicide will not kill himself is unfounded. Anyone who talks of suicide should be regarded with concern and the matter investigated by someone skilled in dealing with psychiatric illness. Nursing care must be provided to protect the person against his self-destructive tendencies and to reduce the environmental hazards, although this latter is difficult in ordinary life situations. Constant supportive nursing care is probably more fruitful and much more comforting to the person involved.

      "abstract": "Introduction Several studies point to the importance that the complex formed by GABA and the benzodiazepine receptor play for cerebral dopaminergic transmission and, hence, to the pathophysiology of psychotic symptoms. The decrease in GABA neuratransmisión or the hypofunction of the system in the hippocampus, cortex and other limbic prefrontal or subcortical regions has consequences as emotional dysregulation, cognitive impairment and development of positive psychotic symptoms. Objectives We intended to show an additional practical example to the limited literature available based on a case linking the emergence of psychotic symptoms due to acute benzodiazepine withdrawal. Methods We present the case of a 21 year old man who was sent to the emergency room of our hospital after an episode of aggressiveness on the street. The patient showed a psychotic schizophrenic syndrome with significant emotional and behavioural impact with aggressive and bizarre movements. In parallel, restlessness, sweating, tremor, increased blood pressure and tachycardia were observed. Symptoms had started abruptly two hours earlier. The patient companion explained that he usually took Alprazolam at an of over 40 mg per day. He had decided to give up this consumption abruptly four days earlier. Discussion GABAergic deficits cause the imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission that may relate the pathophysiology of psychotic symptoms. The dysfunction of the GABAergic cortical interneurons could affect to the modulating response from the association cortex, which, could also relate with the appearance of these symptoms. Conclusion This case could relate a decrease in GABAergic transmission with the appearance of psychotic symptoms.

      "title": "Bipolar disorder: an overview",
      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic disorder characterised by abnormal mood changes and fluctuation in energy levels. The disease is characterised by a depressive episode, which can last up to a few months, and include low energy levels, hypersomnia, cognitive impairments, decreased sexual desire, carbohydrate craving, and weight gain. Conversely, bipolar disorder also has a stage of exhilaration and excitement, which can be classified as a manic episode. The typical presentation of these episodes of mania includes high energy hallucinations and delusions, sleep deprivation, fast speech and a constant need to be active. Risk factors that contribute to development of BD include the use of cannabis, influenza during the third trimester of pregnancy, as well as smoking during pregnancy, the use of cocaine, opioids, tranquilisers, stimulants and sedatives during pregnancy, and regular substance use during a period of a year. Parental loss before the age of five, war trauma and stress, as well as traumatic head injury may influence the condition. Clinical criteria are the mainstay of diagnosis of BD. Differentiating features, which were found to be related to BD, include early age of onset, family history, atypical features and mixed symptoms. Screening tools like the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) and Hypomania Checklist (HCL-32) have shown the ability to differentiate BD from major depressive disorder (MDD). Treatment differs between the different phases of BD, but lithium can be considered as initial monotherapy, since it is effective against manic, depressive and mixed relapses, and has shown better evidence for prevention of new episodes. It is also associated with a reduced risk of suicide and self-harm in BD patients.",

      "title": "Hipoglikemijski sindromi - dijagnostički i terapijski pristup i prikaz dva slučaja",
      "abstract": "Prevention of hypoglycemia is essential for preservation of brain metabolism and survival of the whole body. Normally, glucose is only substrate used by the brain to meet its metabolic requirements. When plasma glucose concentration decreases (e.g., during prolonged fasting or after administration of glucose-lowering drugs) several physiological responses are activated to prevent further decreases in blood glucose. The first response is known as counterregulation, a system that prevents and corrects hypoglycemia through the release of counterregulatory hormones. Ultimately traceable to neural glucose deprivation, symptoms of hypoglycemia include neurogenic (autonomic) and neuroglycopenic symptoms. Neurogenic symptoms (tremulousness, palpitations, anxiety, sweating, hunger, and paresthesias) are results of the perception of physiologic changes caused by the autonomic nervous system’s response to hypoglycemia. Neuroglycopenic symptoms (confusion, sensation of warmth, weakness or fatigue, severe cognitive failure, seizure, coma) are the results of brain glucose deprivation itself. Glycemic thresholds for symptoms of hypoglycemia shift to lower plasma glucose concentrations following recent episodes of hypoglycemia, leading to the syndrome of hypoglycemia unawareness-loss of warming symptoms of developing hypoglycemia. Thus, patients with recurrent hypoglycemia (e.g. those with tightly controlled diabetes or with an insulinoma) often tolerate abnormal low plasma glucose concentration without symptoms. Classification of symptoms of hypoglycemia, namely reactive versus fasting based on segregation by timing in relation to meals is no longer useful from a clinical point of view. Every patient with neuroglycopenic symptoms regardless of relation to food ingestion, requires comprehensive evaluation. Identification of the possible cause of hypoglycemia and selection of diagnostic modalities are facilitated by considering whether the patients appears to be healthy (with or without compensated coexistent disease) or ill (with a disease known to have a proclivity to develop hypoglycemia, or is hospitalized). Medications may mediate hypoglycemia in anybody, whether they appear healthy or ill. Optimal condition for confirming the presence and accurately diagnosing the type of hypoglycemic disorder occurs at the time of spontaneous spell. Otherwise, dynamic testing to generate conductive conditions should be conducted in any patients with a history of neuroglycopenic symptoms, regardless of relation to meal ingestion. Specific criteria regarding beta-cell polypeptide concentrations are required to establish hyperinsulinemia. Sulfonylureas in plasma should be measured with sensitive assays. Surgical management of insulinoma begins with simply considering the diagnosis then proceeding to establish absolutely the biochemical diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Among well-known side effects such as dizziness, nausea, headache and diplopia medical treatment of epilepsy may cause side effects on cognition, mood and behavior. In special constellations this can profoundly affect compliance with the medication as well as quality of life. Some patients are more vulnerable to side effects than others. Side effects can have profound impact on the development and future life of a patient. Some antiepileptic drugs (e.g. topiramate, zonisamide) show a more severe side effect profile than others (e.g. lamotrigine, levetiracetam). Thus, in the treatment of epilepsy, it is crucial to consider such possible side effects – especially in the beginning of or while changing the medical treatment. Specific neuropsychological examinations can monitor side effects on cognitive functions like concentration, memory or speech function. If this is not possible in an ambulant setting, specific screening instruments and repeated and precise interviews of patients and/or relatives can help to discover potential side effects. Because most side effects can be reversible, dosage modification or drug replacement is required as soon as incompatibilities are discovered.",

We performed the DST in 95 depressed inpatients to determine whether abnormal DST results were associated with individual symptoms of depression, latent behavioral \"factors,\" melancholia, or severity of depression. Initial insomnia, agitation, loss of sexual interest, and weight loss correlated significantly with nonsuppression. Using multiple regression, these four symptoms contributed independently to the variance in DST results and more closely associated with the DST results than did severity or the diagnosis of melancholia or endogenous subtype. Factor analysis failed to identify a factor that correlated with the DST results more significantly than did the individual symptoms. Our findings and a literature review suggest that DST nonsuppression associates with certain vegetative signs of depression but not with such symptoms as loss of interest or anhedonia nor with \"psychological\" symptoms such as guilt, worthlessness, helplessness, hopelessness, or suicidal ideation.",

Im Verlauf der letzten vier Jahre entwickelte sich bei der Patientin jeweils unmittelbar nach einer einwöchigen Hungerperiode eine akute paranoid-halluzinatorische Psychose, die 3-mal stationär behandelt werden musste. Psychotische Prodromalsymptome waren vor und zu Beginn der Hungerzeit nicht eruierbar, so dass ein kausaler Zusammenhang zwischen dem Hungern und der psychotischen Dekompensation gesehen werden kann. Anhand dieser Kasuistik wird die Hypothese diskutiert, dass während des Hungerns im Rahmen der Anorexia nervosa temporär eine Hyperaktivität des dopaminergen Systems entstehen könnte und dadurch der Übergang in eine paranoid-halluzinatorische Psychose erklärbar wäre. Der Fall zeigt, dass bei vulnerablen Patienten mit einer ähnlichen Anamnese von einer Hungerkur oder anderen eingreifenden Diätmaßnahmen dringend abgeraten werden muss. Der Hinweis auf das erhöhte Psychoserisiko könnte so einen therapeutischen Nutzen für die Behandlung der Anorexia nervosa bei solchen Patienten haben.",

If mild cerebral trauma such as we were investigating produced changes in the electroencephalographic tracing the abnormality disappeared within a period of minutes in the vast majority of cases. 2. Patients who gave a history of amnesia following cerebral trauma, but were clear mentally at the time the EEG was taken, showed only a slight increase in the percentage of abnormal records as compared to the control series. This was true even when the records were taken within a few hours of the accident. 3. If there was an impairment of consciousness of any degree at the time the EEG was taken, abnormality in the EEG was the rule. 4. Electroencephalographic records taken within 30 minutes after patients sustained head injury showed a greater percentage of abnormality than those taken after 30 minutes had elapsed. The rapid disappearance of abnormal electroencephalographic findings points, in our opinion, to some mechanism in concussion other than petechial hemorrhage, cerebral contusion, embolic phenomenon, or any other histopathological change which must of necessity require several days to disappear. 5. In the patients with abnormal electroencephalographic records the average velocity of the striking object or of the falling head at the time of impact was greater than the velocity necessary to produce concussion in experimental animals as determined by others. The average velocity of the striking object or falling head in patients who showed normal or borderline electroencephalographic records was less than the velocity necessary to produce concussion in experimental animals. 6. The study of the electroencephalographic records taken immediately following mild head injury was less reliable than clinical judgment in predicting time loss from work. An ultimate opinion of the value of EEGs in this respect will depend upon a study of a group of more severely injured patients.",

      "title": "Sleep In The Medical Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Many medical disorders can give rise to disturbances of sleep and alter sleep architecture. Sleep can be impaired by the medical conditions themselves or by the medications used to treat them. Several symptoms associated with medical disorders, such as pain, dyspnea, nocturia, and pruritus can potentially disturb sleep, with the severity of sleep complaints waxing and waning in relation to the course of the medical illness. More than one sleep pathology may be present in a particular patient. The sleep disturbance causes distress and functional impairment, and requires independent clinical management. Conversely, sleep impairment can alter the presentation and adversely affect the symptoms of a variety of medical conditions, including respiratory, cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal, rheumatologic and infectious disorders. Asthma is a disease characterized by episodic dyspnea and wheezing, reversible episodes of bronchoconstriction, and airway hyperreactivity to a variety of specific and nonspecific stimuli. Sleep disturbance in patients with asthma can result in complaints of insomnia (including early morning awakenings) or excessive sleepiness. In one study, three of every four asthmatics reported nocturnal awakenings occurring at least once weekly, whereas two-thirds had nocturnal awakenings at least three times a week. Sleep in patients with nocturnal asthma is characterized by poor sleep quality with frequent arousals. They may awaken repeatedly due to coughing, dyspnea, wheezing, and chest discomfort. Complaints of insomnia and/or excessive daytime sleepiness are not infrequent.",

In the clinical situation, sedation is an undesirable secondary effect after the utilization of these drugs.

These episodes were described as brief (20–30 s), vacant stares, associated with impaired awareness, hypersalivation, retching, vomiting, tongue thrusts, and pallor of the face and body. A few episodes exhibited tonic posturing of the upper limbs [Figure 1 and https://links.lww.com/IPCR/A7]. Other aspects of history were normal. There was no dysmorphism or neurocutaneous markers. Neurological examination was normal. Cranial Magnetic Resonance Imaging (epilepsy protocol) was normal. The drug-induced sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed multifocal epilepsy with bilateral occipital predominance [Figure 2]. A diagnosis of Self-Limited Epilepsy with Autonomic Seizures (SeLEAS) or \"Panayiotopoulos syndrome\" was made, based on semiology and EEG findings. Seizures stopped within 72 h of starting sodium valproate.Figure 1: The seizure semiology was a vacant stare with impaired awareness associated with hypersalivation, retching, vomiting and tongue thrusting, and pallor of the face and body, lasting for 20–30 s. There was no postictal drowsinessFigure 2: The interictal sleep electroencephalogram record shows frequent sharp wave, spike and slow wave (1–3 Hz, 300–500 microvolt) discharges arising from O1 and O2 with spread to adjacent electrodes, accentuated during photic stimulation. There are independent frequent sharp wave discharges from F3, F4, P3, and FP3 suggestive of multifocal epilepsy with bilateral occipital predominanceSeLEAS is a relatively frequent, benign epileptic syndrome characterized by predominant autonomic symptoms and/or focal onset motor seizures. The former include retching, emesis, changes in color (pallor, flushing, or cyanosis), pupillary dilatation, hypersalivation, cardiorespiratory, and thermoregulatory alterations.[1] Clinicians should be aware of this entity as these events are frequently misdiagnosed as acute encephalitis, syncope, migraine, cyclic vomiting syndrome, motion sickness, sleep disorder, or gastroenteritis.[2] Interictal EEG shows occipital spikes. Multifocal spikes with high amplitude sharp-slow wave complexes can also occur at various locations. Seizures will stop in most children within 2–3 years of the first episode. The risk of developing epilepsy in adulthood is similar to the general population. Anticonvulsant therapy (oxcarbamazepine, valproate, and levetiracetam) are indicated when seizure frequency is high.

      "abstract": "It is known that many physiological variables show a rhythmic variability along a time span, e.g.: day, week, month or year. It is possible that the temporal overlapping of a constellation of factors may act as favouring and/or triggering factors for the onset of several acute diseases. Among these, epistaxis shows a circadian variability too. Such pattern, characterised by a prevalent peak in the morning and a secondary one in the evening, strictly resembles that of arterial blood pressure. The lack of differences between the temporal pattern of hypertensive and normotensive subjects suggests that the physiological pattern of blood pressure, and not strictly a condition of hypertension, may play a favouring role in certain hours of the day, probably together other local factors.",

Research shows that the incidence of postpartum depression is 1 to 2 of 1000 births and that 25% of mothers who have just given birth experience severe postpartum depression and that in mothers giving birth to their next child around 20%. Symptoms of postpartum depression include depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure in the activity, impaired appetite, sleep disturbance, physical agitation or psychomotor slowdown, weakness, feeling useless, difficulty concentrating, even suicidal ideation. It is important to do an early diagnosis of postpartum depression to both prevent and make symptoms worse. Mothers with postpartum depression need to get broad and maximum management from various parties, including families, closest people, and health workers from multidisciplinary sciences. In its handling, non-pharmacological therapies can be given such as psychological therapy and changes in daily behavior and also pharmacological therapies that previously need to be consulted to doctors such as tricyclic antidepressant drugs (TCAs) to reduce symptoms of postpartum depression.",

      "abstract": "Approximately 2% to 9% of patients seen in a family physician's office have alcohol dependence. These patients are at risk of developing alcohol withdrawal syndrome if they abruptly abstain from alcohol use. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome begins six to 24 hours after the last intake of alcohol, and the signs and symptoms include tremors, agitation, nausea, sweating, vomiting, hallucinations, insomnia, tachycardia, hypertension, delirium, and seizures. Treatment aims to minimize symptoms, prevent complications, and facilitate continued abstinence from alcohol. Patients with mild or moderate alcohol withdrawal syndrome can be treated as outpatients, which minimizes expense and allows for less interruption of work and family life. Patients with severe symptoms or who are at high risk of complications should receive inpatient treatment. In addition to supportive therapy, benzodiazepines, either in a fixed-dose or symptom-triggered schedule, are recommended. Medication should be given at the onset of symptoms and continued until symptoms subside. Other medications, including carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, valproic acid, and gabapentin, have less abuse potential but do not prevent seizures. Typically, physicians should see these patients daily until symptoms subside. Although effective treatment is an initial step in recovery, long-term success depends on facilitating the patient's entry into ongoing treatment.",

Such observations support the view that stopping treatment is not equivalent to being untreated. With lithium, antipsychotics and antidepressants, there is consistent evidence that abrupt or rapid discontinuation is followed by earlier clinical worsening than with more gradual removal of treatment. Moreover, treatment discontinuation can complicate interpretation of responses to changes in treatment, including in clinical practice and in experimental treatment trials. Notably, terminating preceding treatments can lead to both discontinuation and carry-over effects that can have an impact on the interpretation of observed outcomes.",

Reappearance of seizures may be due to lack of protection and/or an abstinence syndrome. Seizures due to lack of protection occur following withdrawal of any antiepileptic drug when the epilepsy is not cured; they may not reappear for years (although over 80% occur within a year) and treatment then has to be restarted. They seem to be less frequent after withdrawal of carbamazepine or phenytoin than after withdrawing valproate, although the reason for this is not understood. Seizures due to an abstinence syndrome only occur after withdrawing benzodiazepines, phenobarbitone and primidone; they are seen in patients with both active and inactive epilepsy whilst the drug is being withdrawn and tend to be self-limiting. It is not necessary to reintroduce the drug when epilepsy is cured. Felbamate and vigabatrin cause seizures related to their withdrawal, but the mechanism of this is not clear. There is no scientifically established guideline for withdrawing antiepileptic drugs, but it is considered important to stop one at a time, starting with those which may cause abstinence syndromes, followed by the more toxic, less effective antiepileptic drugs, which cause more drug interactions and are more awkward to take.Further specific studies are necessary to establish the mechanisms of relapses and the scientific basis for withdrawal of antiepileptic drugs.",

Migraines are often characterized by throbbing pain in one area of the head that lasts 4 to 72 hours and is accompanied by symptoms such as sensitivity to light or sound, nausea, and vomiting. Some people experience visual disturbances (auras), which may appear as zigzag lines or flashing lights before or during a migraine. Migraines are estimated to affect more than 10% of the population worldwide, occur most often in people between the ages of 20 and 50, and are about 3 times more common in women than men. Having migraines can be debilitating and lead to missed days of school or work, inability to perform household responsibilities. There is no definitive cure for migraines, but treatments and lifestyle can help reduce the number of attacks in a person and shorten or reduce the severity of the attacks. Hormonal changes in women act as a stimulus. It seems that fluctuations in estrogen levels due to menstrual periods, pregnancy or menopause cause acute headaches. Certain foods and beverages such as salty processed food, caffeine etc... can trigger this disease in both men and women. But one of the most important causes of migraine is stress. Migraine attacks usually develops over hours, increases with normal physical activity. Sometimes this disease can be relieved simply by changes in lifestyle and daily habits, but sometimes it may be necessary to consult a doctor and diagnose it for improvement. Medical treatment and lifestyle modification together can help in getting rid of this disease.",

Possible causes of anxiety include various medical disorders in which anxiety is inherent, chronic illness, CNS stimulant intoxication, CNS depressant withdrawal, and primary psychiatric disorders, including the primary anxiety disorders. If none of these conditions is found, situational anxiety may be the diagnosis by exclusion. Generally, treatment should involve education and supportive psychotherapy, behavioral therapies designed to promote relaxation and adjustment to stress, and short-term pharmacotherapy. Although some clinical data from uncontrolled studies point to the possible importance of others drugs (eg, beta-blocking agents) in treating anxiety, the major pharmacotherapy rests with antianxiety drugs, particularly the benzodiazepine. Because each benzodiazepine appears to be relatively effective, a specific agent is selected for a particular clinical situation on the basis of its kinetic (especially its half-life) and side-effect profiles. A nonbenzodiazepine soon to be released in the United States, buspirone (Buspar), appears to be effective and nonaddictive and is not potentiated by alcohol. However, the final verdict as to its usefulness and safety in treating anxiety awaits results of further testing.",

      "abstract": "Sensory-perceptual alteration can be defined as when there is a change in the pattern of sensory stimuli followed by an abnormal response to such stimuli. Such perceptions could be increased, decreased, or distorted with the patient's hearing, vision, touch sensation, smell, or kinesthetic responses to stimuli. Such changes in the pattern of responses to stimuli lead to changes in a patient’s behavior, sensory acuity, decision-making process, and problem-solving abilities. This can lead to irritability, restlessness, poor concentration, fluctuating mental status, changes in communication due to inattention, and lack of focus. Furthermore, sensory deprivation in isolated patients can lead to anxiety, depression, aggression, hallucinations, and psychotic reactions. Any alteration in a patient's normal environment can result in stress especially if such alteration is involuntary. Sensory overload occurs when an individual experiences a stimulus that they are unable to manage and process. Usually, the second stimulus is filtered out by selective perception or coping behavior. However, in certain environmental conditions such as the emergency department, or due to specific underlying illnesses such as dementia, sensory overload can occur due to inadequate filtering of stimuli.Sensory deprivation occurs when an individual receives a stimulus that is reduced or below the threshold of normal. Risk factors to such alterations can be broadly due to acute illnesses, patient factors related to chronic medical conditions, aging, or due to environmental or iatrogenic causes. This typically occurs when the patient is placed in isolation, such as changes in the environment due to hospital admission or admission to isolated wards. While in isolation, there can be a reduction in the quantity and quality of stimuli and restriction of social interaction. Other risk factors that can lead to increased or decreased alteration in the processing of stimuli can be due to hearing impairment, loss of vision, loss of smell or taste, aging, trauma, electrolyte imbalance, seizure disorder, mental health problems, and genetic causes.",

Strong evidence indicates that the effect of stimulant drugs is mediated through a primary effect on brain dopamine, and further knowledge is now being acquired through studies on dopamine receptors, tolerance and reverse tolerance to amphetamines and the neural connections of dopaminergic sub-systems with other sub-systems in the brain. The forms of stereotypy induced by a restricted cage environment have been compared with other effects of this type of environment on behaviour and general health. This has led to a hypothesis that stereotyped behaviour may function as a survival (or defence) strategy in an unfavourable milieu. Some evidence indicates that brain dopamine is also involved in the mediation of stereotyped behaviour induced by the environment. The relevance of these results in clinical psychiatry is discussed. Stereotypy (and related disintegrated behaviour) is a well known feature of several mental diseases.",

      "abstract": "The incidence and prevalence of alcoholism in the elderly population are tendentially underestimated. There are some reasons for this fact. The pathway to the diagnosis of alcoholism may be considerably compromised in the often comorbid or multimorbid patient. To live up to an advanced age seems to be a good argument against chronic substance abuse. Elderly people and their relatives are often still more reluctant to report about socially stigmatizing disorders. On top of that, the amount of social control is reduced after the end of employment and upon entering retirement. Yet, if alcohol-withdrawal symptoms occur, e.g., following an admission of the addicted patient to a hospital, the missed diagnosis of alcoholism means a delay of the correct interpretation of such complications and of the necessary treatment. Aged patients with reduced physical and mental reserve capacity are at special risk of developing further serious complications. Progressive, sometimes irreversible decay of the cognitive functions in long lasting delirious states or, as an aftermath of withdrawal, epileptic seizures are of particular importance.",

It is often accompanied by a peculiar sense of discomfort, a desire to rest, and reduced motivation, referred to as fatigue sensation. Acute fatigue is a normal condition or phenomenon that disappears after a period of rest; in contrast, chronic fatigue, lasting at least 6 months, does not disappear after ordinary rest. Chronic fatigue impairs activities and contributes to various medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, epileptic seizures, and death. In addition, many people complain of chronic fatigue. For example, in Japan, more than one third of the general adult population complains of chronic fatigue. It would thus be of great value to clarify the mechanisms underlying chronic fatigue and to develop efficient treatment methods to overcome it. Here, we review data primarily from behavioral, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging experiments related to neural dysfunction as well as autonomic nervous system, sleep, and circadian rhythm disorders in fatigue. These data provide new perspectives on the mechanisms underlying chronic fatigue and on overcoming it.",

A principal manifestation of their self-regulation disturbances is evident in the way they attempt to self-medicate painful affect states and related psychiatric problems. Individuals select a particular drug based on its ability to relieve or augment emotions unique to an individual which they cannot achieve or maintain on their own. Addicts and alcoholics usually experiment with all classes of drugs, but discover that a particular drug suits them best. Usually, painful affect states interact with other problems in self-regulation involving self-esteem, relationships, self-care, and related characterological defenses, making it more likely that addicts will experiment with and find the action of a particular drug appealing or compelling. Stimulants have their appeal because their energizing properties relieve distress associated with depression, hypomania, and hyperactivity; opiates are compelling because they mute and contain disorganizing affects of rage and aggression; and sedative hypnotics, including alcohol, permit the experience of affection, aggression, and closeness in individuals who are otherwise cut off from their feelings and relationships.",

Anabolic-androgenic steroids, synthetic progestins, and antiepileptics are the most frequently implicated drugs in hyperandrogenism. The mechanisms of androgen excess are various: (1) intrinsic androgenic activity of the drug, (2) interaction with sex hormone-binding globulin, or (3) functional alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovary axis. Nevertheless, the physiology of these drugs remains generally unclear. Such is the case for valproate, which seems to induce a form of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) by increasing ovarian androgen synthesis. It should be remembered that it is always necessary to rule out other causes of androgen excess, especially an ovarian or adrenal tumor or PCOS, before attributing the symptom(s) to a drug.",

A third criterion has been used, including several minor symptoms [fatigue, sleep disorders, stiff ness …] and probable FMS has been defined by two criteria out of three.

      "abstract": "Substance abuse and hypertension are an important health concern, especially in adolescent and young adults presenting with elevated blood pressure and associated cardiovascular conditions. Illicit drugs including cocaine, marijuana, amphetamines, and methylenedioxymethamphetamine remain potential sources of acute or newly diagnosed hypertension. Cocaine is a powerful vasoconstrictor clearly related to hypertensive crises, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, sudden death, strokes, and seizures, although not a definite cause of chronic hypertension. Potential therapies for cocaine induced hypertension and vasoconstriction include nitroglycerin, alpha-blockade combined alpha-Ã -blockade, and calcium channel blockers. The use of Ã -blockers alone should be avoided because of possible paradoxical rise in blood pressure including slight increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Amphetamines and the newly abused 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine are powerful sympathetic stimulants which may mimic the action of cocaine. Ecstasy, or 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, has additional severe psychiatric effects and should be considered in psychoses, panic disorders, and attempted suicide with new onset hypertension. The treatment approaches to 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine toxicity needs further investigation. (c)2000 by Le Jacq Communications, Inc.",

      "title": "Cocaine Addiction as a Neurological Disorder: Implications for Treatment",
      "abstract": "Clinical and preclinical studies provide convincing evidence for persistent neurological/psychiatric impairments and possible neuronal degeneration associated with chronic cocaine/stimulant abuse. These impairments include multifocal and global cerebral ischemia, cerebral hemorrhages, infarctions, optic neuropathy, cerebral atrophy, cognitive impairments, and mood and movement disorders. These findings may encourage the placement of stimulant addiction into the category of organic brain disorders. Functional and microanatomical anomalies in the frontal and temporal cortex as well as other brain regions may be responsible for certain aspects of phenomenology and neuropsychopathology that are characteristic of stimulant polydrug addictions. These may include broad spectrum of deficits in cognition, motivation, and insight; behavioral disinhibition; attention deficits; emotional instability; impulsiveness; aggressiveness; depression; anhedonia; and persistent movement disorders. Although it is still debated whether the hypofrontality and other brain anomalies observed in stimulant abusers are a consequence or an antecedent of drug abuse, this debate seems purely academic and irrelevant with respect to the importance of compensating for these deficits in the development of treatment strategies. The neuropsychiatric impairments accompanying stimulant abuse may contribute to the very high rate of relapse in addicts that can take place after long periods (years) of abstinence. It is possible that the neurological deficits present in stimulant addicts, whether they are primary or secondary to stimulant abuse, are responsible for perpetual drug abuse which may be a form of self-medication (Weiss et al. 1991, 1992). In this context, addiction to stimulants, once fully developed, may represent a true biological dependency on drugs that temporarily compensate for existing neurological deficits. The concept of self-medication by drug addicts is supported by major theories of biological psychiatry. While a majority of drug addicts are polydrug users, there seems to be a preference for a particular type of drug among different populations of addicts. Addicts who experience distress, anxious dysphoria, and turbulent anger prefer the calming actions of opiates, whereas addicts with preceding attention deficit disorder, depression, or bipolar disorder often prefer stimulants (Khantzian 1985). Figure 1 presents conceptual relationships between brain damage and cocaine/stimulant abuse. More clinical studies are needed to establish unequivocally the epidemiological relationships between preexisting neurological deficits-resulting either from genetic, developmental, traumatic, or neurotoxic factors- and vulnerability to drug addictions. Nonetheless, deducing from the results of preclinical studies, it is conceivable that individuals with neurological deficits associated with attention deficit disorder, developmental neuroanatomical abnormalities, lead poisoning, alcoholism, posttraumatic brain lesions, and PTSD may be more vulnerable to stimulant addiction. This notion has significant empirical support as preclinical studies have shown that animals with lesioned prefrontal cortex became supersensitive to cocaine (Schenk et al. 1991) and animals with lesions at the amygdala, VTA, or raphe nuclei manifest more rapid acquisition of amphetamine self-administration than control rats (Deminiere et al. 1989). The above arguments, postulating neuropathology as an intrinsic component of stimulant addiction, should be taken into consideration with the caveat that the clinical manifestations of the disease are heterogenous and addicts may express varying stages and degrees of the disease as determined by environmental and genetic factors. Therefore, it is likely that stimulant addicts who have less advanced neuropathology may recover spontaneously after detoxification with proper nutritional and psychotherapeutic support if they can sustain abstinence.

      "abstract": "Optimal medications for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) would be effective, well tolerated, and long acting and not cause mood swings or worsen comorbid conditions. Current medications work on brain dopamine and/or norepinephrine systems, which are thought to be involved in ADHD. The medication class with the most evidence of efficacy in ADHD is stimulants, but they may be abused, are effective for only 4 to 12 hours, and may cause mood swings or increase tic severity. In recent years, alternative treatments have been explored. Tricyclic antidepressants have efficacy comparable to that of stimulants but may cause constipation, dry mouth, tremors, blood pressure changes, and potentially serious side effects including cardiac conduction and repolarization delays. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors may improve ADHD symptoms but are associated with severe dietary restrictions. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors have little or no effect in ADHD but may improve comorbid depression. Bupropion, although less effective than stimulants, may improve both ADHD symptoms and comorbid depression. Antihypertensive agents may improve impulsivity, hyperactivity, and comorbid tics but cause sedation or rebound hypertension. Atomoxetine, which is being developed for ADHD, reduces symptoms of ADHD without exacerbating comorbid conditions and is associated with only minor side effects, including subtle changes in blood pressure and heart rate. Before prescribing a treatment, physicians should consider the appropriateness and effectiveness of any medication for children with ADHD, who may be less tolerant of side effects and less able to monitor and express concerns about their well-being than adults.",

Accidental death and injury in this age group frequently is alcohol- or drug-related. Venturesomeness and impulsiveness combined with alcohol can produce disastrous results. Alcohol use is more likely to cause an adolescent to be sexually irresponsible, which can lead to sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy. There has been an alarming growth in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive rates recently among the adolescent population. Finally, teenagers who abuse alcohol are more likely to drop out of school, thus damaging their long-term employment prospects.DefinitionThe American Psychiatric Association in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM IV) defines alcohol dependence, a substance use disorder, as a maladaptive pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress as manifested by three of the following seven symptoms occurring during the same 12-month period: tolerance; withdrawal; use greater than intended; inability to cease use; time-consuming activities associated with use; social, occupational, or recreational dysfunction; and continued use despite knowledge of physical or psychological problems. Abuse is defined as one or more of the following: failure to fulfill major roles at home or school, recurrent use in hazardous situations, recurrent legal problems, and use despite persistent social or interpersonal problems.",

Gradual tapering of baclofen usually does not produce symptomatic adverse effects. However, abrupt termination of the drug, especially in an inpatient hospital setting, can lead to symptoms such as increased spasticity, agitation, confusion, hallucinations, and seizures. We present a case of a patient who initially presented with seizures and experienced hallucinations after abrupt cessation of the medication. She had baseline chronic kidney disease but presented with acute worsening of her renal function. Impaired renal function decreases baclofen clearance and causes increased concentration of baclofen in circulation.

It should be differentiated from occasional drug use, from drug abuse with minor consequences as well from medical drug dependency in which the individual does not seek a psychological effect. Drug addiction causes are multiple and include psychological, family, social and obviously biological factors (drug addicting potential). In to-day clinical practice, addiction to benzodiazepines or opioids prescribed for maintenance therapy and the newly described secondary addiction of later onset are predominant. Severe social consequences and many psychiatric and medical disorders in particular due to HIV infection also result from drug addiction. Depressive and psychotic disorders cause specific therapeutic problems when patients deny their troubles or when drug use produces special relief. These psychological disorders frequently underlie medical care needs.",

      "abstract": "Stressful life events have been linked to the onset of severe psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction in many patients.Moreover, vulnerability to the later development of such disorders can be increased by stress or adversity during development (e.g., childhood neglect, abuse, or trauma).This review discusses the methodological features and results of various models of stress in nonhuman primates in the context of their potential relevance for human psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction, particularly mood disorders and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system.Such models have typically examined the effects of stress on the animals' behavior, endocrine function ( primarily the HPA and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal systems), and, in some cases, immune status.Manipulations such as relocation and/or removal of an animal from its current social group or, alternatively, formation of a new social group can have adverse effects on all of these outcome measures that may be either transient or more persistent depending on the species, sex, and other experimental conditions.Social primates may also experience significant stress associated with their rank in the group's dominance hierarchy.Finally, stress during prenatal development or during the early postnatal period may have long-lasting neurobiological and endocrine effects that manifest in an altered ability to cope behaviorally and physiologically with later challenges.Whereas early exposure to severe stress usually results in deficient coping abilities, certain kinds of milder stressors can promote subsequent resilience in the animal.We conclude that studies of stress in nonhuman primates can model many features of stress exposure in human populations and that such studies can play a valuable role in helping to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the role of stress in human psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction.",

      "title": "Autistic phenomena in neurotic patients 1",
      "abstract": "I have described a group of patients who are seemingly successful in their professional and social lives, and who seek analysis ostensibly for professional reasons or for minor difficulties in their relationship. However, sooner or later they reveal phenomena which are strikingly similar to those observed in so-called autistic children. These autistic phenomena are characterized by an almost impenetrable encapsulation of part of the personality, mute and implacable resistance to change, and a lack of real emotional contact either with themselves or the analyst. Progress of the analysis reveals an underlying intense fear of pain, and of death, disintegration or breakdown. These anxieties occur as a reaction to real or feared separation, especially when commitment to analysis deepens. In the case I have described in detail the patient used various projective processes to deflect painful emotions either into other people, including the analyst, or into their own bodies. As a consequence the various objects or organs of the body swell up and became suffused with rage as a result of having to contain the unwanted feelings. This process leads in turn to intense persecutory fears and a heightened sensitivity to the analyst's tone of voice and facial expression. It would seem that the initial hypersensitivity of part of the personality is such as to lead it to anticipate danger to such an extent that it expels feelings even before they reach awareness. The sooner the analyst realizes the existence of this hidden part of the patient the less the danger of the analysis becoming an endless and meaningless intellectual dialogue and the greater the possibilities of the patient achieving a relatively stable equilibrium. Although the analyst has to live through a great deal of anxiety with the patient I feel that ultimately the results make it worth while.",

      "title": "Minor Depression and 'Subthreshold' Anxiety Symptoms in Older Adults: Psychosocial Therapies and Special Considerations",
      "abstract": "GENERATIONS A new focus on these common causes of distress and impairment. In recent years more attention has been given to identifying and treating mental disorders in older adults. By and large, these efforts have focused on disorders delineated in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Sta/Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). However, another class of disorders is also beginning to receive attention: mental disorders. Although these sets of symptoms do not meet the full criteria to be classified as specific mental disorders, they are nonetheless associated with clinically significant distress or impairment (Pincus, Davis, and McQueen,1999). In this article we will discuss two specific conditions, and subthreshold generalized anxiety disorder, and the evidence for the efficacy of psychosocial therapies for these conditions for older adults. MINOR DEPRESSION Minor depression is typically defined as the presence of at least two but fewer than five depressive symptoms, including depressed mood or loss of interest in normal daily activities, during the same two-week period with no history of major depressive episode or dysthymic disorder but with clinically significant impairment or distress (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Minor depression is highly prevalent in older adults in the community (9.9 percent) (Hybels, Blazer, and Pieper, 2001) and in primary care (5.2 percent) (Lyness et al., 1999). In mixed-age samples minor depression has been shown to be associated with levels of functional impairment comparable to those caused by medical illnesses (Wells et al., 1992) and with increased expenditures on medical care (Johnson, Weissman, and Klerman, 1992). Morbidity has been less extensively studied in samples of older adults, but the morbidity rates of elders with minor depression may be assumed to be at least comparable to samples with medical illnesses given the higher prevalence of complicating medical conditions. A recent study has shown minor depression to be associated with an increased risk for mortality in older men (Penninx et al., 1999). Although assessment of the prevalence of minor depression in racial and ethnic minority populations tends to be clouded by linguistic and cultural differences in expressing affective and somatic symptoms, recent research taking into account these measurement challenges indicates that minor depression is very common in older ethnic minorities in primary care. According to Arean and Alvidrez (2001), as many as io percent of older African Americans, 15 percent of older Latinos, and 12 percent of older Asians meet criteria for minor depression. SCREENING FOR MINOR DEPRESSION One of the most common instruments for screening and tracking depression in primary care is the Patient Health Questionnaire Nine-- Item Depression Module (PHQ-9). The patient fills out the questionnaire, and the information can yield a diagnosis of major or minor depression. While psychometric studies have yet to be done on the utility of the PHQ-9 with minority elders, the instrument is available in Spanish and Chinese. PSYCHOSOCIAL THERAPIES FOR MINOR DEPRESSION Empirically derived treatment guidelines have been established for major depression. However, a paucity of studies, which have yielded conflicting findings, means that no specific guidelines are currently available for pharmacologic or psychosocial treatment of minor depression. Psychosocial therapies are particularly appealing for older adults because they often have medical conditions as well, leading to an increased possibility of adverse drug interactions. Since the research on treating minor depression in older adults is so limited, we will review the evidence for psychosocial treatments of minor depression in both younger and older adults together. The interventions examined include cognitive-behavioral, interpersonal, and problem-solving therapy, as well as physical exercise. …",

The content of obsessions is ego‐dystonic, meaning that they are experienced as intrusive, unwanted, and generally inconsistent with one's self‐image, values, beliefs, and behaviors. Obsessions differ from ego‐syntonic thoughts about everyday problems (e.g., recurrent thoughts or worries about finances, occupation, relationships, and the like) and should be distinguished from the “brooding” ruminations that are common in depression. Typical obsessions include doubts about whether one did something adequately (e.g., turned off the stove); intrusive sexual, aggressive, or religious thoughts or images (e.g., horrific image of stabbing a friend); thoughts about contamination; and excessive concerns about symmetry or exactness. Individuals with Obsessive‐Compulsive Disorder (OCD) experience frequent obsessions that are severe enough to cause significant functioning impairment and try to suppress or neutralize their obsessions with other thoughts or compulsive actions. Unlike individuals with psychotic or delusional disorders, individuals with OCD generally recognize their obsessions as senseless and know that the obsessions originate in their own minds.",

      "abstract": "Antiepileptic drug selection is based on efficacy for specific seizure types and epileptic syndromes. For idiopathic generalized epilepsies with absence, tonic-clonic, and myoclonic seizures, the drug of choice is valproate. Secondary generalized epilepsies with tonic, atonic, and other seizure types are difficult to treat with any single drug or combination of drugs. The drugs of choice for absence seizures are ethosuximide and valproate. For control of tonic-clonic seizures, any of the other major antiepileptic drugs can be effective. If valproate cannot be used, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, or primidone is effective, but ethosuximide or a benzodiazepine needs to be added to control associated absence or myoclonic seizures. The drugs of first choice for partial epilepsies with partial and secondarily tonic-clonic seizures are carbamazepine and phenytoin. Increasing evidence suggests that valproate may be a third alternative. Phenobarbital and primidone are second choice selections because of side effects. A combination of two of these five major antiepileptic drugs may be necessary for inadequately controlled patients. Other epilepsy syndromes such as neonatal and infantile epilepsies, febrile epilepsy, and alcoholic epilepsy require specific drug treatment. For all these seizure types and epilepsy syndromes, treatment ultimately must be selected to provide maximal efficacy and minimal adverse effect for each individual patient.",

      "abstract": "The use of benzodiazepine medication is associated with a variety of acute and well-recognized withdrawal syndromes including anxiety, agitation, insomnia, and confusion. Catatonia has not previously been described. We report five patients who became catatonic after withdrawal of benzodiazepines. All five were older individuals (53-88 years) who had acutely become immobile, mute, and rigid with refusal or inability to eat or drink. Each of the five showed pronounced and rapid improvement after administration of low-dose lorazepam, which has previously been reported to be effective in the treatment of catatonia. Careful review of the records showed that each of the patients had been taking benzodiazepine medication for anywhere from 6 months to 15 years and that it had been rapidly tapered or abruptly discontinued 2 to 7 days before the onset of catatonia. These cases illustrate that severe and potentially life-threatening catatonia can develop in the wake of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Older individuals may be particularly vulnerable to this side effect. (J Clin Psychopharmacol 1996;16:315-319).",

      "abstract": "being persecuted.However, a variety of other themes is also possible, for instance the belief that the fillings in one's teeth are radio transmitters receiving extraterrestrial messages, or the belief that some outside agency has added or removed thoughts in one's brain.Negative symptoms, on the contrary, describe loss or significant impairment of normal psychological functions, such as blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passivity and apathy, and anhedonia (APA, 2000).Although this reduction in normal functioning may seem less dramatic as positive symptoms, particularly negative symptoms are associated with long periods of hospitalization and poor social functioning.Indeed, a patient's degree of negative symptoms appears to determine whether a patient is still able to function in society.Last, cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia comprise 'executive dysfunctions', including problems in maintaining goals, allocating attentional resources, evaluating and monitoring performance, and utilizing these capacities to solve problems. Diathesis-stress hypothesis of schizophreniaSchizophrenia is a complex illness, and its possible causes are still subject of debate.However, according to a widely adopted view, both a biological predisposition, and exposure to environmental stress are necessary ingredients for schizophrenia to become manifest -the so-called diathesis stress model (Zubin & Spring, 1977).A classical example of the association between environmental stress and the risk of developing schizophrenia, comes from studies of the 1944-1945 Dutch Hunger Winter (Susser & Lin, 1992;Susser et al., 1996;Susser et al., 1998).In this discrete period during the Second World War, there was a serious decline in food intake in six cities of western Netherlands.Among people born in these cities between 1944 and 1946, the most exposed birth cohort (i.e., conceived at the height of the famine) showed a twofold and statistically significant increase in the risk for developing schizophrenia (Susser & Lin, 1992).Since this particular famine, many others occurred worldwide, but these were less suitable for epidemiological investigations due to more disorganized conditions (St Clair et al., 2005).However, several years after the Dutch Hunger Winter, a similar occasion occurred in China.Specifically, from 1959-1961, people in affected provinces were starving and died in large numbers due to bad weather (for refs see (St Clair et al., 2005)).Among births that occurred during the famine years, the risk of developing schizophrenia in later life was significantly increased when compared to those born before or afterwards (St Clair et al., 2005).These 'natural experiments' suggest that prenatal stress, i.e., exposure to maternal nutritional deficiency, could increase the risk of schizophrenia in later life.However, evidence from many observational studies that have investigated the association between experience of stress in adulthood and acute onset of psychotic illness, has not been confirmative (Phillips et al., 2007).In particular, there is no consistent evidence that experience of stressful life events is able to trigger onset of psychosis.Findings from longitudinal studies on the other hand, are stronger in linking episodes of relapse in schizophrenia patients to an elevated rate of stressful life events (Phillips et al., 2007;Walker et al., 2008), thus providing additional evidence for a role of stress exposure in (the course of) schizophrenia.

      "title": "Gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders re-visited",
      "abstract": "The importance of gastrointestinal motility and gut perception in medicine has been long recognized. Physiologically, these key functions ensure normal unperceived feeding and digestion, crucial aspects of health and wellbeing. Conversely, pathophysiological disturbances may produce digestive symptoms, which are common in the general population and may range from the simply annoying to the incapacitating. In fact, major disturbances may lead to malnourishment, metabolic imbalance and general deterioration of the body. Altered normal gut motility may also disrupt gut homeostasis, induce changes in the gut flora and facilitate bacterial translocation from the intestine to other viscera (Fig. 1). Clinical recognition of gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders is largely based on the anatomic localization of their symptomatic expression (1-4). Thus, dysphagia, reflux symptoms and chest pain are normally associated with esophageal or gastroesophageal disturbances. Upper abdominal pain or discomfort, early satiety, nausea and vomiting, and other dyspeptic-like symptoms are usually ascribed to dysfunction of the stomach and/or upper small bowel. Bloating is a somewhat mysterious symptom that may be generated by motor/sensorial disturbances throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Diarrhea and/or constipation usually result from small bowel and/or colonic disorders. Ano-rectal symptoms usually derive from dysfunction of the pelvic floor, distal colon or sphincteric structures. Traditionally, clinical conditions were divided into somatic gastrointestinal motility disorders: achalasia, gastroparesis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction and so on, and functional disorders: dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome and a myriad of clinical syndromes and descriptions. The distinction between both groups was largely based on whether a propulsive failure was or not demonstrated by conventional imaging tests. Thus, a patient with recurrent abdominal pain and distension could be categorized either as a chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction (if dilated loops of bowel were visualized on Xrays) or irritable bowel syndrome (if nothing obviously abnormal was found). Application of more sophisticated and discriminating diagnostic tests (intestinal manometry, barostat, etc.) and histology increasingly showed that Gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders re-visited",

First, a case is presented of a 150-day delay period before the clinical manifestations of brain damage after a single brief (<1 day) exposure to dimethylmercury. The second example is taken from the Iraq outbreak of methylmercury poisoning in which the victims consumed contaminated bread for several weeks without any ill effects. Indeed, signs of poisoning did not appear until weeks or months after exposure stopped. The last example is drawn from observations on nonhuman primates and from the sequelae of the Minamata, Japan, outbreak in which low chronic doses of methylmercury may not have produced observable behavioral effects for periods of time measured in years. The mechanisms of these latency periods are discussed for both acute and chronic exposures. Parallels are drawn with other diseases that affect the central nervous system, such as Parkinson disease and post-polio syndrome, that also reflect the delayed appearance of central nervous system damage.",

      "title": "The effect of alcohol withdrawal syndrome severity on sleep, brain and cognition",
      "abstract": "Abstract In alcohol use disorder, drinking cessation is frequently associated with an alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Early in abstinence (within the first 2 months after drinking cessation), when patients do not exhibit physical signs of alcohol withdrawal syndrome anymore (such as nausea, tremor or anxiety), studies report various brain, sleep and cognitive alterations, highly heterogeneous from one patient to another. While the acute neurotoxicity of alcohol withdrawal syndrome is well-known, its contribution to structural brain alterations, sleep disturbances and neuropsychological deficits observed early in abstinence has never been investigated and is addressed in this study. We included 54 alcohol use disorder patients early in abstinence (from 4 to 21 days of sobriety) and 50 healthy controls. When acute physical signs of alcohol withdrawal syndrome were no longer present, patients performed a detailed neuropsychological assessment, a T1-weighted MRI and a polysomnography for a subgroup of patients. According to the severity of the clinical symptoms collected during the acute withdrawal period, patients were subsequently classified as mild alcohol withdrawal syndrome (mild-AWS) patients (Cushman score ≤ 4, no benzodiazepine prescription, N = 17) or moderate alcohol withdrawal syndrome (moderate-AWS) patients (Cushman score &amp;gt; 4, benzodiazepine prescription, N = 37). Patients with severe withdrawal complications (delirium tremens or seizures) were not included. Mild-AWS patients presented similar grey matter volume and sleep quality as healthy controls, but lower processing speed and episodic memory performance. Compared to healthy controls, moderate-AWS patients presented non-rapid eye movement sleep alterations, widespread grey matter shrinkage and lower performance for all the cognitive domains assessed (processing speed, short-term memory, executive functions and episodic memory). Moderate-AWS patients presented a lower percentage of slow-wave sleep, grey matter atrophy in fronto-insular and thalamus/hypothalamus regions, and lower short-term memory and executive performance than mild-AWS patients. Mediation analyses revealed both direct and indirect (via fronto-insular and thalamus/hypothalamus atrophy) relationships between poor sleep quality and cognitive performance. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome severity, which reflects neurotoxic hyperglutamatergic activity, should be considered as a critical factor for the development of non-rapid eye movement sleep alterations, fronto-insular atrophy and executive impairments in recently detoxified alcohol use disorder patients. The glutamatergic activity is involved in sleep-wake circuits and may thus contribute to molecular mechanisms underlying alcohol-related brain damage, resulting in cognitive deficits. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome severity and sleep quality deserve special attention for a better understanding and treatment of brain and cognitive alterations observed early in abstinence, and ultimately for more efficient relapse prevention strategies.",

      "title": "Current status of antidepressants: clinical pharmacology and therapy.",
      "abstract": "Effective antidepressants, including imipramine and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, were discovered serendipitously in the 1950s. Many additional agents have been introduced since then, but most are chemically or pharmacologically similar to those known for nearly four decades. Some recently introduced antidepressants offer either lesser or dissimilar side effects, but none exceeds older treatments in efficacy. Selective serotoninpotentiating agents and short-acting MAO-A inhibitors promise efficacy with greater safety. Progress is made difficult because atypical or treatment-resistant patients are more often available for study than typical patients, and because most studies must rely heavily on potentially misleading \"standard drug versus new drug\" comparisons. Rational development of novel or better agents is slow, in part, due to limited understanding of the biological basis of major affective disorders and some circularity in relating actions of known drugs to pathophysiologic hypotheses. Action mechanisms of antidepressants are subtle and complex: adaptive changes occur in brain monoaminergic neurotransmission following repeated administration of agents of the tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) type that may lead to net facilitation of alpha 1-adrenergic transmission. Important advances have been made in using plasma TCA levels to guide individualization of dosing, in exploring higher doses of antidepressants when ordinary doses prove ineffective, and in recognizing a broadening spectrum of possible indications for antidepressants in adults and children. These indications include panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, attention deficit disorder, and bulimia. Evidence for the prophylactic effects of antidepressants after the first months following recovery from an index episode of major depression is weak, and the treatment of common recurrent or chronic depression remains unsatisfactory. Gains have been made in increasing clinicians' and the general public's awareness of the common occurrence and appropriate treatment of major depression, even when the depression is associated with other medical or psychiatric disorders.",

Perhaps the result of chronic use, a significant deterioration in sleep is apparent over the first 3 weeks of abstinence, with no indication of recovery. Interestingly, the diminished sleep is not accompanied by subjective reports of poor or worsening sleep. Rather, subjective reports actually improve over abstinence, while sleep-related cognitive performance declines. A mechanistic understanding of the apparent difference in objective and subjective measures is currently lacking. Here we review the relevant literature on cocaine use and sleep, and discuss the possible relevance of this sleep disturbance in relationship to the underlying disorder and its treatment.",

      "title": "Clinical Neuropharmacology of Sleep Disorders",
      "abstract": "Within the context of the comprehensive treatment of sleep disorders, which includes medical, neurologic, psychiatric, and social interventions, use of medication is often indicated. Among the three benzodiazepine hypnotics that are available in the United States for the treatment of insomnia, flurazepam is effective for both sleep induction and maintenance, and it retains most of its efficacy over a 4-week period of nightly administration; temazepam is effective only for sleep maintenance, and triazolam improves both sleep induction and maintenance with initial but not with continued administration. Rebound phenomena are more frequent and intense with the more rapidly eliminated drug, triazolam, and to a lesser degree with temazepam. Also, with triazolam, certain behavioral side effects, such as amnesia and psychotic-like symptoms, have been reported. With flurazepam, which is a slowly eliminated benzodiazepine, daytime sedation is more frequent than with the other two drugs. When insomnia is secondary to major depression, antidepressant medication should be administered. Methylphenidate, amphetamines, or other stimulant medications are used for the symptomatic treatment of the sleepiness and sleep attacks of narcolepsy and hypersomnia. For cataplexy and the other two auxiliary symptoms of narcolepsy, imipramine or other tricyclics are the drugs of choice. Protriptyline and medroxyprogesterone have been used in treating mild cases of obstructive sleep apnea, but their efficacy is limited. Similarly, for the treatment of central sleep apnea, medroxyprogesterone and acetazolamide have shown only limited effects. Medication for patients with sleepwalking, night terrors, or nightmares should be prescribed judiciously, and primarily when treatment of an underlying psychiatric condition is desired. The neuropharmacology of sleep should also consider drugs that may cause sleep disorders. Medications with sleep disturbing effects include various antihypertensives, bronchodilators, and the energizing antidepressants. Withdrawal of REM-suppressant drugs, such as the barbiturates, may cause nightmares in association with a REM rebound. Occasionally, a drug or a combination of drugs may produce somnambulistic-like activity in some patients.",

      "title": "Evaluating and Managing Insomnia: Non-pharmacological Treatments",
      "abstract": "For about 40% of Americans, Insomnia is a major health issue that often leads to fatigue, reduced immunity, and dangerous driving. A good night sleep is essential for functioning and performance. It also influences mood, cognition, concentration, fatigue, and healing. Insomnia may be related to medical and psychiatric disorders, shift work, stimulants, travel, anxiety, pain, and other problems (e.g., poor sleep environment). People with insomnia (e.g., difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings and daytime drowsiness) tend to rely on alcohol, drugs, and other remedies. Insomnia may reflect sleep apnea or other medical or mental health disorders that require evaluation as well as poor sleep hygiene. Insomnia can be brief, episodic or chronic. Unfortunately, many people assume that insomnia is normal and do not report it to the nurse or seek treatment. Sleep deprivation impairs the person's physical, mental, and cardiac functioning. Often insomnia is treated with medications which may have side effectives or be habit forming. Individuals with insomnia need evaluation of the precipitants of insomnia, education about sleep hygiene, and information about non-pharmacological treatments. In clinic and hospital settings, nurses are in a pivotal position to identify sleep problems, educate patients, and refer them for follow up.",

In the first, depression or unipolar depression, the patient’s mood varies between being either normal or depressed; he or she never becomes excessively elated.

      "title": "Escitalopram-induced extrapyramidal symptoms",
      "abstract": "Sir, Serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used for a variety of clinical conditions due to their relatively safe side-effect profile. Among the various classes of antidepressants, SSRIs are the common offenders producing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPSs). The incidence of EPS is high with escitalopram (12%) followed by sertraline (11%), paroxetine (10%), and fluoxetine (8%).[1] The SSRIs produces reversible or irreversible motor disturbances through pathophysiological changes in basal ganglion motor system by altering the dopamine receptors postsynaptically.[2] A 34-year-old female presented with complaints of sadness of mood, crying spells, feeling lonely, decreased interest in day-to-day activities, lethargy and disturbed biological functions for the last 6 months. Her past and family history and personal history was noncontributory. General and systemic examination was within normal limits. Mental status examination revealed decreased psychomotor activity, depressed affect, depressive cognitions with well-preserved insight. A diagnosis of moderate depressive disorder was made, and she was started on escitalopram 10 mg/day along with clonazepam 0.5 mg at night time. She was maintaining well and escitalopram 10 mg was continued for the next 18 months as per patient's request. 18th month, she presented with complaints of slurring of speech, drooling of saliva, decreased bodily movements, and slowness in walking. Neurological examination revealed bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity, dysarthric speech, and tremor of hands. Routine biochemical tests and head MRI, EEG were done and were found to be normal. No history of any other drug use/abuse, head injury, seizures, fever or movement disorder was reported. A diagnosis of escitalopram-induced acute extrapyramidal syndrome was made after excluding other possible causes. Escitalopram was immediately discontinued, the patient was reassured, and trihexyphenidyl 2 mg bid was started. Follow-up after 2 weeks reported significant improvement. Subsequently trihexyphenidyl was stopped and dothiepin 50 mg/day was started to control the depressive symptoms. The patient was followed-up for the next 6 months without any symptom recurrence. The Naranjo probability scale applied retrospectively revealed a score of 6, pointing to a \"probable\" drug reaction. The data for escitalopram-induced EPS is rare except in few cases.[34] The potential risk factors for EPS induced by antidepressants are advancing age, female gender, preexisting extrapyramidal disorder, other concurrent neuroleptic medications and pharmacokinetic interaction through CYP2D6 inhibition.[1] Other than the female gender, none of these risk factors were present in our patient. Researchers have extrapolated a link between antidepressant-induced EPS and the CYP2D6 phenotype. On analyzing the risk factors for these reactions during treatment with SSRIs, including the CYP2D6 phenotype, serotonin, and dopamine transporter and receptor polymorphisms, it was noted that the risk of EPS with SSRIs seemed to increase with advanced age and the presence of the A1 allele of the dopamine D2 receptor gene Taq1A.[5] Being a young patient, the possibility of young-onset parkinsonian disease was considered in which, family history of parkinsonism is an important risk factor.[6] Our patient's history was not significant for either parkinsonism or any other movement disorder. In rat models of EPS induced by SSRIs, a specific effect on tyrosine hydroxylase, which is a speed-limiting enzyme of dopamine synthesis in substantia nigra has been reported. Tyrosine hydroxylase synthesis was significantly decreased by SSRIs in substantia nigra, and the serotonin transporter (SERT) inhibition can activate microglia and alter the regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine biosynthesis, and these changes may play a role in mediating the EPS associated with SERT inhibitors.[7] Drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP) may represent a preexisting vulnerability to future Parkinson's disease. Treatment of DIP involves discontinuation of the offending drugs, which usually promotes remission of the parkinsonian syndrome within a short time, although parkinsonism may sometimes persist and require dopaminergic treatment. One atypical feature in our patient was that compared to previously reported cases where EPS developed few weeks after initiation of escitalopram, in the index patient EPS developed only 2 years after starting escitalopram. However, the EPS was reversed after a short course of anticholinergic treatment. The reason for late onset of EPS needs further exploration. This is an attempt to create an awareness of drug-induced EPS as adverse reaction in patients taking escitalopram even after months or years of therapy so that timely recognition can prevent such adverse effects.

      "abstract": "Los trastornos de la conducta alimentaria (TCA) son trastornos multideterminados en los que los niveles biologico, psicologico y social influyen decididamente en su aparicion y mantenimiento. A nivel biologico las alteraciones que se producen en el organismo debido a la malnutricion y las conductas purgativas deben ser tenidas en cuenta para no confundir las manifestaciones psicologicas debidas a alteraciones somaticas con trastornos de la personalidad, ni con interacciones familiares disfuncionales. Por otro lado el abordaje puramente somatico es necesario, ya sea normalizando las constantes vitales, recetando farmacos psicotropos, o regulando una dieta adecuada. A nivel psicologico las alteraciones de la personalidad previa, una deficiente autoimagen y baja autoestima que se asientan sobre una base depresiva, se ven incrementadas por las conductas alimentarias disfuncionales. Estas alteraciones psicologicas deben ser estudiadas en detalle para incluirlas como objetivo terapeutico (Espina, 2003). A nivel social, la moda de la delgadez y el exito en la sociedad occidental, hace que personas susceptibles sean mas vulnerables a padecer trastornos alimentarios. Por otro lado, las relaciones familiares pueden tener unas caracteristicas, especialmente la dificultad de autonomizacion de sus miembros y las alteraciones de la comunicacion, que son terreno abonado para la aparicion de trastornos alimentarios en personas susceptibles. Estos factores, junto con acontecimientos vitales estresantes (separaciones, perdidas, fracasos...), pueden jugar un papel etiologico y, cuando el TCA esta establecido, actuar como factores de mantenimiento (Espina, 1998a).",

Dentro de las adicciones comportamentales se incluyen ludopatía, Internet y nuevas tecnologías, adicción a la comida, las compras y/o el sexo entre otras1 . Se considera la impulsividad un predictor de la adicción2 , en la impulsividad existe urgencia motivada por un estado de tensión que conduce a la acción derivada del estrés o ansiedad y la acción conduce a la relajación3 denominada compulsión, y podría constituir un eslabón en la cadena del desarrollo del comportamiento adictivo4 . Por ello un programa de intervención de enfermería para trastorno obsesivo compulsivo (TOC) y adicciones comportamentales podría ser útil para el tratamiento de ambas patologías5 . Objetivos: ❖ Aumentar la motivación al cambio y eficacia percibida en relación a conductas de riesgo. ❖ Reducir sintomatología clínica y mantener resultados en el tiempo. ❖ Ampliar recursos personales y familiares para mejorar funcionamiento psico-socio- laboral de la persona. Material y métodos: Se realizará una evaluación pre-tratamiento, una monitorización del tratamiento, evaluación post-tratamiento inicial y a los 6 meses6 .

Emovit was characterized by the predominance of sedative versus stimulating action and, hence, it was most effective in anxiety, asthenic-anxiety, depressive-paranoid and hypochondriac depressions, showing no effect in inhibitory depressions.

      "title": "HEALTH EFFECTS OF COASTAL DISASTERS AFTER THE WATER RECEDES",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce consistent death and injury patterns. Primary causes stem directly from the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, injury and drowning in tsunamis. Secondary causes are driven by common effects regardless of event type: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Cause of death may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. All of these relate not only to post-impact outcomes but also may affect primary event survival. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory, diabetic, and psychological disorders) and/or rely on recurring outpatient procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease); some conditions require home oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. All categories rely on maintenance care, lack of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants, particularly carbon monoxide. Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes, beyond preexisting conditions, include disrupted routine and lifelines and extended effects (e.g., prolonged disruption, personal loss, subsequent events). Most secondary health effects are recurrent and thus predictable well in advance of an incident. Even if they canâ€™t be prevented in entirety they can be lessened by awareness and deliberate action on the part of governments, institutions, support services, and individuals, including more realistic assumptions, expanded insurance coverage, and refocused preparedness campaigns.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCCIÓN La aparición de síntomas psicóticos es una de las complicaciones más frecuentes producidas por el consumo agudo o crónico de cocaína, apareciendo hasta en el 65-70% de los consumidores. El síndrome de Ekbom se ha relacionado con múltiples causas, entre ellas el consumo de estimulantes y con la abstinencia al alcohol. El paciente tiene la convicción delirante monotemática de estar infectado por parásitos, lo cual puede acompañarse de otras manifestaciones como alteraciones sensoperceptivas. OBJETIVOS Analizar el papel de la cocaína en la aparición del síndrome de Ekbom. MATERIAL Y MÉTODO Descripción de un caso clínico y su revisión bibliográfica. Varón de 56 años, sin antecedentes en Salud Mental. Ex consumidor de cannabis y cocaína. Como antecedentes somáticos presenta infección por VHC curada y VIH. Recae en el consumo de cocaína tras fallecimiento de un familiar en Enero 2022, siendo derivado a la Unidad de Hospitalización en Junio 2022 por convicción delirante paranoide y actividad alucinatoria. En la exploración psicopatológica el paciente presenta delirios de infestación y zoopsias. En la exploración física observamos escoriaciones y cicatrices que se corresponden con rascado. Sin embargo, en el examen clínico no se encuentran alteraciones que justifiquen estas lesiones. Al ingreso comienza con Olanzapina 10mg desapareciendo la sintomatología en un par de días. CONCLUSIONES Es necesario hacer un correcto diagnóstico diferencial, mediante un examen clínico exhaustivo, el cual, en este caso, no pone de manifiesto ninguna patología física que justifique el cuadro, a pesar de lo cual el paciente presenta absoluta convicción. La idea delirante se ha relacionado con el aumento de los niveles de dopamina en los ganglios basales por el bloqueo del transportador de dopamina que producen los psicoestimulantes como la cocaína. De esta forma, es imprescindible el cese del consumo de tóxicos y un correcto tratamiento con neurolépticos.",

      "title": "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Abstract Although diseases similar to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) have been recognized for centuries under various rubrics, strict diagnostic criteria for conditions dominated by medically unexplained chronic fatigue were first proposed in 1988. Current diagnostic criteria were originally crafted in 1994 by an International Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Study Group as an attempt to standardize patient populations included in research studies. The International CFS Research Case Definition requires chronic fatigue of at least six‐months duration; this fatigue cannot be substantially alleviated by rest, is not the result of ongoing exertion, and is associated with substantial reductions in occupational, social, and personal activities. In addition, at least four out of the following eight symptoms must occur with fatigue in a six‐month period: prolonged extraordinary postexertional fatigue, impaired memory or concentration, unrefreshing sleep, aching or stiff muscles, multijoint pain, sore throat, tender glands, and new headaches (Fukuda et al., 1994). Importantly, the research case definition precludes classification as CFS if a patient has an identifiable medical cause of being fatigued. Similarly, individuals with certain psychiatric conditions cannot be classified as CFS in research studies. Exclusionary psychiatric conditions include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and melancholic major depression. Notably, comorbidity with psychiatric disorders is relatively high. Recent data indicate that almost 60% of CFS cases in the population suffer from at least one comorbid psychiatric condition, with affective disorders being the most prevalent ones.",

      "title": "Children and Adolescents Who Have Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a chronic disorder associated with deficits in cognition, affect, and social functioning. The onset of illness can occur rarely as early as 5 years of age, but after the age of 13 years, the incidence increases steadily.Early-onset (before age 18 y) and very early-onset (before age 13 y) schizophrenia are diagnosed by using the same criteria as in adults, and these forms appear to be continuous with the adult form of the disorder. Youths who have schizophrenia are predominantly males, have high rates of premorbid abnormalities and higher ratings on negative and positive symptoms, and often exhibit poor outcome.Schizophrenia is a phasic disorder, with individual variability. The phases are: According to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, at least two of the following symptoms should be present for a significant period of time during a 1-month period: Only one symptom is needed if the delusions are bizarre, hallucinations include a voice providing running commentary on the person’s behavior or thinking, or two or more voices are conversing with each other.Another criterion is the deterioration of social, occupational, and self-care functioning below the level achieved before onset. For children and adolescents, this includes the failure to achieve age-appropriate levels of interpersonal, academic, or occupational development. The disturbances also must be present for at least 6 months.Conditions in the differential diagnosis must be excluded, such as mood disorders (especially bipolar disorder), pervasive developmental disorders, nonpsychotic emotional and behavioral disturbances (including posttraumatic stress disorder), and organic conditions. The list of potential organic causes is vast and encompasses: seizure disorders, central nervous system lesions (eg, brain tumors, head trauma), neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Huntington chorea, lipid storage disorders), metabolic disorders (eg, endocrinopathies, Wilson disease), developmental disorders (eg, velocardiofacial syndrome), toxic encephalopathies (eg, abuse of substances such as amphetamines, cocaine hallucinogens, phencyclidine, alcohol, marijuana, and solvents; medications such as stimulants, corticosteroids, or anticholinergic agents; and other toxins such as heavy metals), and infectious diseases (eg, encephalitis, meningitis, or human immunodeficiency virus-related syndromes).Intoxication or withdrawal from drugs or alcohol can mimic nearly every psychiatric disorder, including mania, schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorders. Physiologic manifestations and urine drug screening are critical in diagnosing a substance-induced psychosis, but substance use disorders also are common among patients who have schizophrenia. As many as 50% of affected patients have a history of alcohol or illicit drug dependency. For this reason, urine drug screening is critical to evaluate the cause of psychotic exacerbation. If psychotic symptoms persist for more than 1 week after drug detoxification, a primary psychotic disorder is more likely.Laboratory and neuroimaging procedures are not helpful in diagnosing schizophrenia, but they are used to rule out other neurologic or medical problems. They should be justified on the basis of the clinical presentation and findings in either the history or the physical examination.Once the diagnosis is established, it needs to be reassessed longitudinally because misdiagnosis at the time of onset is common. Most children who have hallucinations do not have schizophrenia.The treatment of schizophrenia in children and adolescents combines psychopharmacologic agents and psychosocial interventions. Therapies vary, depending on the individual patient characteristics and the stage of the disorder. Both factors are specific for the symptomatology (positive and negative) of the disorder and general in relation to the psychological, social, educational, and cultural needs of the child and the family.Schizophrenia rarely occurs before age 13 years, but the onset increases steadily during adolescence, peaking between ages 15 and 30 years. It is believed to be a neurodevelopmental disorder; there is no evidence of causation from psychological or social factors. Adult schizophrenia is associated with perinatal complications, abnormal brain structure and size, minor physical anomalies, and disruption of fetal neural development (especially in the second trimester of gestation). Early developmental delays, including cognitive, language, and communication delays, and neurobiological abnormalities (deficits in smooth pursuit eye movements, autonomic responsivity, and neuroimaging findings) may be early manifestations of the disorder. Approximately 10% to 20% of children who have schizophrenia have intelligence quotients in the borderline to mentally retarded range. Outcome is predicted best by premorbid and cognitive functioning, negative symptoms, and behavioral problems. The risk of self-inflicted and unintentional injury related to psychotic thinking is high and is associated with high rates of mortality.Psychopharmacology includes traditional neuroleptics that block dopamine receptors and atypical antipsychotics that have a variety of effects, such as antagonism of serotonergic receptors. Psychoeducational therapy for patients and families include education about the illness and social skills training for the patient. Unfortunately, studies on the effectiveness of these interventions in children are limited.The Practice Parameter for the Assessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents with Schizophrenia of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry referenced previously is important reading for care of these patients.",

      "abstract": "Migraine headache is a prevalent condition that places a substantial burden on the healthcare system. It is known that certain foods, food additives, alcohol, caffeine, stress, sensory stimuli, disruptions in sleep-wake patterns, hormonal changes, and many other things may trigger migraines. Red wine is a frequently reported trigger for migraines and other headaches but it is unclear what substance(s) in red wine triggers headache and why red wine is more associated with headache than white wine, sparkling wines, or spirits. Implicated as headache triggers are biogenic amines (histamine, phenylethylamine, tyramine, and others), phenols, polyphenols, and sulfites. Enzymatic action in the metabolism of phenols and polyphenols may cause fluctuations in dopamine and serotonin levels which, in turn, have been implicated as headache triggers. The role of sulfotransferase enzymes and dopamine appears to offer a promising explanation of the red wine headache. The investigation of potential red wine triggers may better elucidate headache pathogenesis.",

      "title": "Rapid cycling bipolar disorder and atypical anorexia nervosa: changes in drug metabolism",
      "abstract": "Introduction Bipolar disorder (BD) is a complex mental illness described by recurrent episodes of mania and depression. One subtype of the illness is rapid cycling BD, characterized by experiencing four or more extreme mood swings within a year. Diagnosing and treating BD can be complicated by comorbid conditions, such as atypical anorexia nervosa (AAN), marked by disordered eating and disturbing weight-related thoughts. Objectives To discuss the diagnosis and treatment plan of a patient with rapid cycling BD, who experienced adverse effects from prescribed medication and later was diagnosed with comorbid AAN. Methods We present a case of a 21 year-old man initially presenting with anxiety, low mood, and obsessive weight-related thoughts, ultimately diagnosed with major depression and mixed anxiety disorder. Results 21 year-old man was diagnosed with major depression and mixed anxiety disorder, initially treated with mirtazapine and fluoxetine (limited success), later attempting escitalopram and bupropion combination (partial remission). After 2 years the patient discontinued the treatment due to feeling “euphoric”, subsequently experiencing depression and manic episodes – the initial diagnosis was rapid cycling BD. The treatment was changed to sodium valproate (up to 1500 mg/day) and aripiprazole (up to 10 mg/day), however extremely rare adverse medication effects (nosebleeds, diarrhea with blood admixture, “high-frequency sounds”) were reported. Throughout valproate treatment, the patient experienced persistent diarrhea. During hospitalization for treatment adjustment lithium carbonate was introduced at a starting dose of 900 mg/day, maintaining blood lithium levels between 0.4 mmol/l and 0.49 mmol/l. Later the dose was adjusted and a therapeutic lithium blood level was reached with 1575 mg/day of lithium carbonate. Additionally, risperidone was prescribed, however, the patient experienced an uncommon adverse reaction – nasal congestion. Subsequently, amisulpride was introduced, which provoked severe anxiety and fear, resulting in medication discontinuation. During the latest outpatient visit, fluoxetine was added to the treatment due to observed depressive symptoms. Throughout the treatment, the patient episodically intermittently starved, had persistent distressing thoughts about weight and was diagnosed with AAN. While planning further treatment it was hypothesized that comorbid AAN might affect drug metabolism and the patient was referred to a specialized inpatient facility for eating disorder management. Conclusions This case report highlights the complexity of psychiatric disorders and the importance of monitoring and adjusting treatment based on patient response and side effects. Additionally, it emphasizes comorbid conditions significance in influencing the primary disorder’s dynamics as well as the metabolism and effectiveness of psychiatric medications.

      "title": "PL1 * ADDICTION AS A REWARD, STRESS AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION DISORDER",
      "abstract": "Drug addiction has been conceptualized as a chronically relapsing disorder of compulsive drug seeking and taking that progresses through three stages: binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect, and preoccupation/anticipation. Via these stages, drug addiction impacts multiple motivational mechanisms and can be conceptualized as a disorder that includes elements of positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement. Three key neurobiological circuits are engaged in the motivational changes driving addiction that involve dysregulation in incentive salience- reward systems, sensitization of brain stress systems, and deficits in executive function systems. Specific neurocircuitry/neurochemical elements in these structures include the basal ganglia (incentive salience- reward deficits involving dopamine), the extended amygdala (recruitment of the brain stress systems involving corticotropin releasing factor) and the orbitofrontal/prefrontal cortex (executive function deficits involving glutamate). The combination of dysregulated incentive salience-reward function, sensitized stress systems and disrupted orbitofrontal/prefrontal executive function provides a powerful motivation for compulsive drug use and the loss of control over drug taking. Understanding the neurocircuitry neuroadaptations in the reward, stress and executive function systems will provide new insights into identifying vulnerability to addiction and novel treatments for addiction.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a disorder characterized by chronic sleep disturbance associated with daytime disability or distress, such as memory impairment and fatigue, that occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep. Insomnia may present as difficulty falling/staying asleep or as sleep that is nonrestorative. Studies show a strong correlation between insomnia and impaired quality of life. Pain conditions and depression are commonly associated with insomnia, either as secondary or comorbid conditions. In addition, a greater incidence of anxiety, alcohol and drug dependence, and cardiovascular disease is found in people with insomnia. Data indicate insomnia results from over-engaged arousal systems. Insomnia patients experience increased metabolic rate, body temperature, and heart rate, and elevated levels of norepinephrine and catecholamines. Pharmacologic options for the treatment of insomnia include benzodiazepine hypnotics, a selective melatonin receptor agonist, and sedating antidepressants. However, insomnia may be best treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy and instruction in good sleep hygiene, either alone or in concert with pharmacologic agents. Studies on the effects of insomnia treatment use variable methodologies or do not publish negative results, and there are currently no studies of treatment focusing on morbidity. Further research is necessary to better understand the effects of insomnia therapies on medical and psychiatric disorders. In this Clinical Information Supplement, Thomas Roth, PhD, describes the nature of insomnia and its pathophysiology. Next, Andrew D. Krystal, MD, MS, reviews morbidities associated with insomnia. Finally, Joseph A. Lieberman III, MD, MPH, provides an overview of therapeutics utilized in patients with insomnia, including behavioral therapies and pharmacologic options.",

During mood swings, there may be features of psychosis (delusions and hallucinations) that are mood-congruent. Although psychotic symptoms are seen only in a minority of patients, they explain the early terminology of manic–depressive psychosis. Stage 1a is defined as mild or non-specific symptoms of mood disorder and intervened as formal mental health literacy; family psychoeducation; substance abuse reduction; cognitive behavioral therapy. Euphoric means the experience of pleasure or excitement and intense feelings of well-being and happiness. Certain natural rewards and social activities, such as aerobic exercise, laughter, listening to or making music, and dancing, can induce a state of euphoria. Racing thoughts are consistent, persistent, often intrusive thoughts that come in rapid succession. There is a direct link between depression and anxiety and racing thoughts. Whereas jumping from topic to topic as in the flight of ideas can be observed by others, ascertainment of racing thoughts requires asking the child whether his or her thoughts seem to be going too fast.",

      "title": "The Treatment of Acute Agitation in Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Acute agitation is a nonspecific term applied to an array of syndromes and behaviors. It is frequently defined as an increase in psychomotor activity, aggression, disinhibition/impulsivity, and irritable or labile mood. Etiologies of acute agitation include medical disorders, delirium, substance intoxication or withdrawal, psychiatric disorders, and medication side effects. Treatment of acute agitation requires both environmental and pharmacologic intervention. Patients should be calmed with sedating agents early in the course of treatment, allowing for diagnostic tests to take place. Failure to correctly diagnose causes of agitation may lead to delayed treatment for serious conditions, and can even exacerbate agitation.The most common cause of agitation in patients with schizophrenia is psychotic relapse due to medication nonadherence. Pharmacologic treatment options for these patients include lorazepam and antipsychotic agents. Lorazepam causes nonspecific sedation and treats some substance withdrawal, but has little effect on psychosis. First-generation antipsychotics treat psychosis and, at high enough doses, cause sedation, but may induce extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). Some second-generation antipsychotics have been approved for the treatment of agitation in schizophrenia. These agents treat psychosis with a favorable EPS profile, but are comparatively expensive and cause risks such as hypotension. However, avoiding EPS may reduce patients' resistance to antipsychotic treatment. In this expert roundtable supplement, Joseph Battaglia, MD, provides an overview of the definition of acute agitation. Next, Delbert, G. Robinson, MD, outlines evaluation methods for actue agitation. Finally, Leslie Citrome, MD, MPH, reviews interventions for acute and ongoing management of agitation.",

      "abstract": "The clinicopathological conference is a time honoured exercise in which a participant is given a clinical protocol and tries to make a diagnosis. It has been variously lauded as an instructive teaching exercise or derided as an unreal situation.\r\n\r\nThe cases are often puzzling. What, for example, is one to make of a wasted man, deathly pale, with web-like thin hair, exaggerated sensitivity to noise, odours, light, or touch, where the course of the disease fluctuates with intermittent agitation or depression?\r\n\r\nOr what sudden epidemic illness would cause high fever, profuse generalised bleeding, and death within half an hour?\r\n\r\nAnd what about a dishevelled 39 year old man with a history of alcohol and possibly opiate use, presenting with lethargy and confusion but remaining afebrile, becoming delirious and combative, and dying within four days.\r\n\r\nThe first two cases, products of Edgar Allan Poe's lugubrious imagination, defy diagnosis. The symptoms of the cadaverous looking man in The Fall of the House of Usher have been attributed, perhaps not too convincingly, to acute intermittent porphyria (JAMA 1989;261: 863-4 [PubMed]). One can only speculate what might have caused the hideous pestilence with “sharp pains, sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores with dissolution... the incidents of half an hour” (The Mask of the Red Death).\r\n\r\nFor the third case, a Dr Michael Benitez at one time suggested rabies. It is a case unsolved since 1849, when the patient boarded a train in Richmond, disappeared for five days, was found confused in a Baltimore tavern, dishevelled, in someone else's clothes, then taken to a city hospital, where he died delirious after several days. Delirium tremens, encephalitis, and malaria have been considered, but some think he was robbed and mugged. Others postulated that this being during an election, Poe (for it was the author himself) was drugged by a “repeater” gang and taken to vote at different polling booths, then abandoned.\r\n\r\nThere are further mysteries: firstly, the body was exhumed in 1875 and relocated, but there is speculation that the gravediggers dug up the wrong body; and secondly, for several years after 1949 an anonymous visitor would come on Poe's birthday and place a half bottle of Martel cognac on his grave.",

      "abstract": "The importance of sleep has been reported for decades. Epilepsy is a heterogeneous disorder comprising multiple elements that might influence sleep and wakefulness. Notably, animal studies show disruptions of the circadian molecular system in different models of epilepsy, along with altered rest-activity and other circadian rhythms. So far, studies of molecular circadian systems in people with epilepsy are lacking, prompting further research. Seizures-the primary and most debilitating symptom of epilepsy-and interictal activity disrupt regular sleep and sleep-wake rhythms. Alterations in one's sleep structure are seen in both drug-naïve and drug-resistant patients with epilepsy. In particular, low sleep efficiency, a reduction in total sleep time, and changes in sleep stages were found in both homogenous and mixed samples of epilepsy patients. Both ictal and interictal activity were also shown to be associated with changes in peripheral circadian phase biomarkers such as melatonin and cortisol. Moreover, epilepsy comorbidities, antiseizure medications, and a variety of syndromes can be a cause of sleep problems or even sleep disorders. Sleep disorders vary depending on various comorbidities and syndromes, and encompass all major groups of sleep disorders defined in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders. Controversial findings on the effects of various antiseizure medications were found in the literature. However, medications such as benzodiazepines, gabapentinoids, and barbiturates are particularly associated with excessive daytime sleepiness. Overall, a sleep evaluation must be included in the management of every patient with epilepsy.",

The most important toxic effect of the a-adrenergic agonist phenylpropanolamine is hypertension, which may result in hypertensive encephalopathy or intracerebral hemorrhage. The therapeutic index of phenylpropanolamine is low, and severe hypertension may occur after ingestion of less than three times the therapeutic dose. Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine may also cause hypertension, as well as tachyarrhythmias due to β-adrenergic stimulation. Toxic reactions from caffeine are characterized by agitation, seizures, tachyarrhythmias, and hypotension. Management of toxic reactions to over-the-counter stimulants includes control of hypertension with a rapidly acting vasodilator, β-blockers for tachyarrhythmias, and control of seizures.

      "title": "PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEMS OF THE GERMAN OCCUPATION",
      "abstract": "A description of patients seen in an Army psychiatric clinic in Germany can give only a general idea of the personality problems encountered. A great many patients with fundamentally psychiatric problems are treated in other clinics. Perhaps even more important in regard to the dependent and War Department civilian population is that the majority of individuals with neurotic tendencies fostered by occupation life probably do not seek medical attention at all. The somewhat artificial pattern of occupation life encourages the development of latent neurotic potentialities. The diminished force of such restrictive and inhibiting factors as home and church influences, social pressures exerted by other community groups, and the precariously balanced moral and ethical feelings imbued during early life is not compensated for by the rather rigid, paternalistic, impersonal, often frustrating framework of Army organization. This, and the lack of accustomed recreational and intellectual outlets, often stimulate the development of behavior such as heavy drinking or sexual promiscuity. Such behavior, although basically maladaptive, serves its function in the given situation. Another factor is the continual frustration with regard to normally minor aspects of daily life, such as transportation, and the obtaining of commodities and services through legal Army channels, as neither of these are legally obtainable to any degree from the German economy. In addition, the constant, though often unnoticed, underlying tension incident to living in a hostile country, surrounded by the most desolate ruins, may give rise to a sense of imprisonment, poorly controlled irritability, or other symptoms not sufficient to warrant a clinic visit. The innate hostility of Americans to anyone \"foreign\" is a complicating factor contributing to the relative social insularity of the Americans and the lack of opportunity for social interplay of a normal variety between the average American and Germans of corresponding class. The distinction between conqueror and conquered is a sharp one, emphasized not only by obvious differences in nutritional state, clothing, shelter, and transportation, but also by the frequent signs forbidding German use of certain facilities. The social distance between the two groups is such that, except for a minority, contact with the native population is usually at the level of the \"putzfrau,\" and the \"fraulein,\" and the blackmarketeer. The American leaving the Occupied Zone often feels that he knows little more about the psychology of the Germans than he did shortly after his arrival. Certain efforts have been made to stabilize American community life. In place of an enforced bachelorhood of several months, during which the husband is alone in Germany, the Army is transporting married couples overseas together. The commodity-dispensing system is being operated more efficiently. Rail transport is improving, and there is an increasing number of private vehicles. Dependents are becoming more active in such civic-minded affairs as the German Youth Activity, and the Army is attempting to encourage educational pursuits among troops. A strenuous effort is also being made to curb the blackmarket. However, these things have not as yet materially affected the interpersonal exchange between members of the various groups in the Zone, or the basic tensions and conflict-breeding situations that are present. It is to be expected, therefore, that psychiatric problems associated with the social and psychological environment of Occupied Germany will continue to be seen in occupational personnel.",

The role of both of these substances, serotonin and noradrenaline, in the function of these mechanisms is still, however, a matter of discussion. In the last ten years it has been shown that many antidepressive drugs are not only effective in the treatment of depression but also in the treatment of many other psychiatric disorders. These include for example panic anxiety attacks, compulsive-obsessive symptoms, premenstrual tension disorder etc. It appears from the treatment of these disorders that serotonin is of greater importance than noradrenaline.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterised by reduced dopamine levels in the substantial nigra. This may lead to typical motor features such as bradykinesia, resting tremors and rigid muscles, as well as non-motor symptoms such as neuropsychiatric symptoms, sleep disorders, autonomic dysfunction, and sensory disturbances. Inhibitors of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) are used to alleviate symptoms by reducing monoamine oxidase-catalysed degradation of dopamine; hence, preserving functional levels of dopamine. The very first MAO-B inhibitor used therapeutically was selegiline, followed by rasagiline, its indane derivative which has superior efficacy and selectivity. Both inhibitors can be used as monotherapy or in combination with other anti- Parkinson drugs. Safinamide, a reversible MAO-B inhibitor that utilises both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic mechanisms, was recently approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) (2015) and U.S. FDA (2017) as an add-on therapy for patients with mid- or late-stage Parkinson’s disease. Furthermore, MAO-B inhibitors were found to be associated with potential neuroprotective and disease modifying effects. However, evidence of their efficacy and role in PD models is scarce and warrants further investigation.",

Using correlational studies and structural analyses, evidence is provided that unusual sleep experiences, dissociation, and schizotypy belong to a common domain. It is demonstrated that unusual sleep experiences show specificity to dissociation and schizotypy compared to other daytime symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression, substance use) and other sleep disturbances (e.g., insomnia, lassitude/fatigue). The paper also outlines the methodological limitations of the existing evidence and makes suggestions for future research. Finally, three models for the overlap of daytime and nighttime symptoms are reviewed, including biological abnormalities, trauma, and personality traits. Although further research is needed, it is suggested that daytime and nighttime symptoms result from problems with sleep-wake state boundaries, which may be precipitated by stress or trauma. In addition, association between daytime and nighttime symptoms can be attributed to the higher order personality trait of Oddity.",

Today we can choose from a confusingly large array of drugs which can quickly control these two kinds of emotional and behavioural disorders. Everyday practice shows that these two groups of symptoms, seemingly so different from one another, can be treated with the same drugs. If we probe more deeply into the matter, we find that the similarities in these effects include not only inhibition of aggressiveness and anxiety but also their enhancement, activation, and provocation. These effects seem to form a regular pattern: those that increase aggressiveness (sympathicomimetics, catecholamines, ‘activating’ antidepressants, psychostimulants, and anti-Parkinsonics (cholinolytics)) also tend to increase anxiety, while those that decrease aggressiveness (beta-blockers, neuroleptics (major tranquillisers), ‘sedative’ antidepressants, minor tranquilisers, hypnotics, analgesics, and anticonvulsants) also tend to decrease anxiety.",

      "abstract": "Hypertension is an independent risk factor of cardiovascular diseases. Several factors contribute to its development, including chronic stress, which may induce hypertension by increasing sympathetic activity. The signs of increasing sympathetic activity can be primarily detected in the initial phase of hypertension, which is characterized by the increase in cardiac output. In addition to the hemodynamic consequences (increase in cardiac output, tachycardia, coronary vasoconstriction, proarrhythmia), the increase in sympathetic activity has many harmful effects. Numerous metabolic (insulin resistance, dyslipidemia), structural and trophic effects (endothelial dysfunction, vascular hypertrophy, myocardial hypertrophy), as well as thrombotic and humoral processes (procoagulation, enhancement of thrombocyte aggregation, sodium retention, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis) may develop and consequently damage body functions at many targets. Several different antihypertensive drug classes are available for reducing increased sympathetic activity, including peripheral alpha and beta blockers and compounds with central effects. First generation antihypertensive drugs with central mechanisms of action (e.g. clonidine, guanfacine, alpha-methyldopa) is currently rarely administered and only for a few indications as they have a significant adverse events profile. Among second generation compounds with central effects, rilmenidine stimulates imidazoline-1 receptors and thus beneficially influences mild or moderate hypertension that involves enhanced sympathetic nervous system activity.",

Upon cessation of exposure, follow‐up neurobehavioural tests, including the cognitive ability screening instrument and the mini‐mental state examination, gradually improved and eventually became normal. Although no further toluene exposure was noted, non‐specific symptoms reappeared whenever the subject smelled automotive exhaust fumes or paint, or visited a petrol station, followed by anxiety with sleep disturbance. During hospitalization for a toluene provocation test, there was no difference between pre‐challenge and post‐challenge PaCO2, PaO2, SaO2 or pulmonary function tests, except some elevation of pulse rate.

Here, we highlight the withdrawal symptoms following the termination of gabapentin, and their treatment. The symptoms of varying severity in gabapentin withdrawal underline the importance of progressively decreasing the dose on a schedule of several months before ceasing the drug completely.

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), previously known as battle fatigue syndrome or shell shock, is a severe mental disturbance condition that is normally triggered by the experience of some frightening/scary events or trauma where a person undergoes some serious physical or mental harm or threatened. PTSD is a long-life effect of the continuous occurrence of traumatic conditions, leading to the production of feelings of helplessness, intense fear, and horror in the person. There are various examples of events that can cause PTSD, such as physical, mental, or sexual assault at home or working place by others, unexpected death of a loved one, an accidental event, war, or some kind of natural disaster. Treatment of PTSD includes the removal or reduction of these emotional feelings or symptoms with the aim to improve the daily life functioning of a person. Problems which are needed to be considered in case of PTSD like ongoing trauma, abusive or bad relationships. Various drugs which are used for the treatment of PTSD include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (citalopram, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, etc.); tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline and isocarboxazid); mood stabilizers (Divalproex and lamotrigine); atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole and quetiapine), etc. In this review, we have covered the different risk factors, case studies related to various treatment options with different age group of peoples with PTSD and their effects on them. We have also covered the symptoms and associated disorders which can play a key role in the development of PTSD.",

Common presentations include: (1) generalized convulsive status epilepticus or complex partial status epilepticus that continue despite initial therapies; (2) stupor or coma following a generalized convulsive or complex partial seizure; or (3) stupor or coma following brain surgery or acute brain injury. When status epilepticus continues or recurs 24 hours or more after the initiation of anesthetic therapy, or recurs on the reduction or withdrawal of anesthesia, it is termed super RSE. Published evidence on optimal management of RSE consists largely of case reports or small series. The mainstay of treatment is the administration of anesthetic agents titrated to electrographic seizure control. Adjunctive therapies include hypothermia and immunosuppression and less commonly, surgery, electrical stimulation therapies, and induction of ketosis. Patients with cardiopulmonary complications and prolonged duration of drug-induced coma tend to have worse post-treatment functional outcomes. However, significant improvement over time can occur in survivors, and thus treatment is justified even in patients who require prolonged anesthetic coma. The strongest predictors of outcome are duration of anesthetic coma, etiology, and development of cardiopulmonary complications.",

      "abstract": "Hunger und andere Formen der Mangelernahrung konnen verschiedene Konsequenzen fur den Organismus nach sich ziehen, wie zum Beispiel eine Herzinsuffizienz, eine Fettleber, Formen der Protein-Energie-Malnutrition wie Kwashiorkor und Marasmus und schlimmstenfalls den Tod. Bisher weniger grundlich untersucht sind die Folgen extremer Unterernahrung fur die Psyche. Menschen, die unter Hunger leiden, wirken antriebs- und kraftlos und lethargisch. Man konnte vermuten, dass sie depressiv sind. Aber erfullen sie wirklich die Diagnosekriterien einer klinischen Depression? Die Beantwortung dieser Frage konnte wichtige Hinweise darauf bergen, welche langfristigen Konsequenzen etwa auf eine Hungersnot oder ein weiteres Ansteigen der Pravalenz der Anorexia Nervosa folgen konnten. Dies konnte sowohl relevant fur die Arbeit von Arzten, Oecotrophologen, Psychologen und anderen therapeutischen Berufsgruppen sein als auch, auf einer globalen Ebene, bedeutsame Informationen fur die okonomischen Folgen beinhalten, die auf eine von Mangelernahrung betroffene Gesellschaft zukommen. So konnte eine durch Hunger induzierte erhohte Depressionspravalenz weitere Kosten fur das wahrscheinlich ohnehin gebeutelte Gesundheitssystem eines betroffenen Staats nach sich ziehen. Zudem ist es fur Menschen, die zusatzlich zu den korperlichen Entbehrungen des Hungers unter Symptomen der Antriebslosigkeit, Hoffnungslosigkeit, Interesse- und Freudlosigkeit leiden, um einiges schwerer, Kraft und Motivation fur den Wiederaufbau eines Landes zu finden. Die vorliegende Arbeit beschaftigt sich daher damit, ob Mangelernahrung zum Entstehen einer Depression fuhrt und welcher Art die gefundenen Symptome sind. Mangelernahrung ist ein weltweit verbreitetes Phanomen, das verschiedene Ursachen haben kann. Wahrend Hunger ein groses Problem in armeren Landern darstellt, entwickeln vor allem in den industrialisierten Landern immer mehr Menschen Essstorungen. Die in dieser Arbeit formulierten Hypothesen wurden anhand einer Zusammenfassung der Literatur und der wichtigsten Studien uberpruft. Es wurde gefunden, dass Mangelernahrung nicht zu einer klinisch diagnostizierbaren Depression, aber dennoch zu ausgepragten depressiven Symptomen fuhrt, die sich nach einer Normalisierung der Nahrungsaufnahme zuruckbilden. Diese Auswirkungen beschranken sich nicht auf einen somatischen Symptombereich, sondern finden sich ebenso in psychischen und kognitiven Gebieten. Weitere insbesondere experimentelle Forschungsarbeiten zur Kontrolle dieser Ergebnisse waren wertvoll fur die Weiterentwicklung des Verstandnisses der Interaktion von Mangelernahrung und Symptomen psychischer Erkrankungen.",

      "abstract": "The effects of methamphetamine used as a recreational drug include central nervous system stimulation that can induce euphoria, increased alertness, intensity of emotions, anorexia, and increased sexuality.! In toxic doses methamphetamine induces agitation, anxiety, hallucinations, delirium, seizures, and even death. Hyperthermia can result from druginduced central nervous system abnormalities, muscular hyperactivity, or seizures. Cardiovascular complaints include chest pain, palpitations, and dyspnea,2,3 and dysrhytlunias, tachycardia, hypertension, and myocardial ischemia are not uncommon.4,5 We report the cases of two patients who arrived and were admitted to our hospital at the same time, both manifesting some of the above-described effects, but whose conditions were accompanied by some abnormalities not usually seen with methamphetamine. These effects included hypotension, pulmonary edema with hypoxia, and an initial leukopenia followed by leukocytosis. These manifestations might be more easily explained by hypothesizing that an endotoxin was a contaminant in the drug used.",

      "title": "Homicides with Partial Limbic Seizures: Is Chemical Seizure Kindling the Culprit?",
      "abstract": "Recreational intermittent, subthreshold amounts of alcohol and/or drugs might evoke chemical kindling of nonconvulsive, simple partial seizures in the limbic system, with secondary, brief, prefrontal lobe dysfunctioning; preserved core consciousness; and memory for the bizarre, out-of-character, motiveless, unplanned homicidal acts performed during a fleeting psychosis. Such acts persisted for 2 to l0 minutes despite forceful external interruption in three single, white male loners. In contrast, five nonusers, with otherwise similar symptomatology, aborted their homicidal attacks on external interruption, in a previously proposed syndrome with only experiential kindling with memory revival of past hurts in limbic psychotic trigger reaction. Thus, this article hypothesizes that either chemical kindling alone or as a superimposition on experiential kindling might occur in the form of unusual persistence or enhancement of partial seizures.",

      "title": "Mental fatigue and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is an extremely disabling symptom both in healthy people and in various diseases. Physical fatigue is characterized by limitations in physical functioning, while mental/cognitive fatigue involves difficulties in concentrating and performing cognitive tasks. Mental and physical fatigue exist in both pathological and physiological fatigue. Fatigue is primarily an adaptive physiological process. It is a signal to have a rest and helps conserve energy to prevent injury, which can be useful after intense work, or when the body’s defenses need to be redistributed, for example, during infectious disease. It is important to distinguish between fatigue or tiredness and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice. Chronic fatigue syndrome has multisystem manifestations and affects millions of people globally. Although the exact aetiology of chronic fatigue syndrome is uncertain, the studies point to neurological, immunological, autonomic and energy disorders. The main sings of chronic fatigue syndrome are debilitating fatigue that is worsened by activity, poor exercise tolerance, unrefreshing sleep and cognitive impairment. Reduced information processing speed is the most common cognitive impairment in chronic fatigue syndrome. Other manifestations include decreased reaction time, working memory, and attention. These symptoms must persist for at least 3–6 months for a diagnosis to be made. As there are no specific tests for chronic fatigue syndrome, a diagnosis can be established on the basis of a medical history and physical examination. Although there are no standards-based methods specific to chronic fatigue syndrome, clinicians can reduce the severity of symptoms using pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment approaches that have proved their efficacy in clinical practice. In particular, nootropics are widely used in asthenic conditions and chronic fatigue syndrome. Fonturacetam is a nootropic drug that directly activates brain integration activities, promotes memory consolidation, and improves concentration and mental activity.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Sleep is a vital neurochemical process involving sleep-promoting and arousal centers in the brain. Insomnia is a pervasive disorder characterized by difficulties in initiating or maintaining or non-refreshing (poor quality) sleep and clinically significant daytime distress. Insomnia is more prevalent in women and old age and puts sufferers at significant physical and mental health risks. This review summarizes published data on the current and emerging insomnia drug classes, rationale for development and associated risks/benefits. (Summary of Product Characteristics and Medline search on \"hypnotic\" or specific drug names and \"Insomnia\"). Areas covered: GABAA receptor modulators facilitate sleep onset and some improve maintenance but increase risk of dependence, memory, cognitive and psychomotor impairments, falls, accidents and mortality. Melatonin receptor agonists improve quality of sleep and/or sleep onset but response may develop over several days. They have more benign safety profiles and are indicated for milder insomnia, longer usage and (prolonged release melatonin) older patients. Histamine H-1 receptor antagonists improve sleep maintenance but their effects on cognition, memory and falls remain to be demonstrated. Late-stage pipeline orexin OX1/OX2 and serotonin 5HT2A receptor antagonists may hold the potential to address several unmet needs in insomnia pharmacotherapy but safety issues cast some doubts over their future. Expert opinion: Current and new insomnia drugs in the pipeline target different sleep regulating mechanisms and symptoms and have different tolerability profiles. Drug selection would ideally be based on improvement in the quality of patients' sleep, overall quality of life and functional status weighed against risk to the individual and public health.",

Those comorbidities are much more common when social phobia is left neglected and untreated. It is characterized by excessive fears to one or most social situations (circumscribed versus generalized type). Social phobia has its onset typically in childhood or early adolescence and it is associated with significant functional impairment. Although cognitive behavioral therapy and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are considered the mainstay treatment of this disorder, other psychotropic agents can be of value in the management of this condition. This review discusses the efficacy of beta-bockers, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, D-cycloserine, buspirone and atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of social anxiety disorder.",

All types of psychotropic drugs, antianxiety drugs, antidepressants, thymoregulators, neuroleptics, and beta-blockers are used, with two main indications: (a) to prevent or to treat the withdrawal syndrome and (b) to diminish the psychopathological factors related to alcoholism (anxiety or depression, for example), in order to avoid pathological recourse to alcohol. Recently, attempts have been made to decrease the craving for alcohol in humans after detoxification. Although psychotropic drugs are often used in the management of alcoholics, such management is not limited to them, but also includes psychotherapy and social measures.",

Improved glycemic control achieved by insulin, insulin secretagogues or thiazolidinedione therapy is generally accompanied by weight gain. It is a problematic side effect of therapy due to the known deleterious effect of weight gain on glucose control, increased blood pressure and worsening lipid profile. Weight gain may be lessened or prevented by adherence to diet and exercise or combination therapy with metformin. Weight gain is also common in psychotropic therapy. The atypical antipsychotic drugs (clozapine, olanzepine, risperidone and quetiapine) are known to cause marked weight gain. Antidepressants such as amitriptyline, mirtazapine and some serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) also may promote appreciable weight gain that cannot be explained solely by improvement in depressive symptoms. The same phenomenon is observed with mood stabilizers such as lithium, valproic acid and carbamazepine. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) that promote weight gain include valproate, carbamazepine and gabapentin. Lamotrigine is an AED that is weight-neutral, while topiramate and zonisamide may induce weight loss.",

Insomnia may be the primary problem, or it may be associated with other conditions. Insomnia can be caused by physical factors along with psychological factors. Extreme wake leads to energy consumption, hunger, and increase appetite and if reaches the limit to be called insomnia, digestion is not performed completely. Many prescribed drugs can interfere with sleep, like certain antidepressants and medications for asthma or vital sign. Many over-the-counter medications—like some pain medications, allergy and cold medications, and weight-loss products—contain caffeine and other stimulants which will disrupt sleep.

The right dose differentiates a poison from a remedy.’’ 1 Many drugs of abuse encountered by emergency physicians (EP) are also therapeutic agents. However, when these drugs are taken in excess or recreationally to obtain a ‘‘high,’’ the inherent toxicity becomes apparent. Many substances taken in overdose cause an alteration in mental status. Agents as diverse as carbon monoxide, cyanide, and antiepileptic drugs can lead to life-threatening central nervous system (CNS) depression. Pharmaceuticals such as methylxanthines and drugs used for attention-deficit disorder can lead to severe agitation, delirium, and seizures. Some of these drugs may be abused. As Paracelsus articulated, any toxin in an extreme dose can lead to poisoning. Altered mental status commonly plays a part with toxicity. However, discussion in this review is restricted to drugs of abuse (Table 1).",

      "title": "Depression and the menopause: why antidepressants are not enough?",
      "abstract": "Background Gender differences, related to varying sexual hormone levels and hormone secretion patterns across the lifespan, contribute to women's vulnerability to mood disorders and major depression. Women are more prone than men to depression, from puberty onwards, with a specific exposure across the menopausal transition. However, controversy still exists in considering fluctuation/loss of estrogen as a specific aetiologic factor contributing to depression in perimenopause and beyond. Aims To briefly review the interaction between changes in menopausal hormone levels, mood disorders, associated neuropsychological co-morbidities and ageing, and to evaluate the currently available therapeutic options for perimenopausal mood disorders: (a) treatment of light to moderate mood disorders with hormonal therapy (HT); (b) treatment of major depression with antidepressants; (c) the synergistic effect between HT and antidepressants in treating menopausal depression. Results Depression across the menopause has a multifactorial aetiology. Predictive factors include: previous depressive episodes such as premenstrual syndrome and/or postpartum depression; co-morbidity with major menopausal symptoms, especially hot flashes, nocturnal sweating, insomnia; menopause not treated with HT; major existential stress; elevated body mass index; low socioeconomic level and ethnicity. Postmenopausal depression is more severe, has a more insidious course, is more resistant to conventional antidepressants in comparison with premenopausal women and has better outcomes when antidepressants are combined with HT. Conclusion The current evidence contributes to a re-reading of the relationship between menopause and depression. The combination of the antidepressant with HT seems to offer the best therapeutic potential in terms of efficacy, rapidity of improvement and consistency of remission in the follow-up.",

      "title": "Acute dystonic reaction due to a combination of chloroquine and doxycycline in an emergency psychiatry setting",
      "abstract": "Sir, Acute dystonic reactions are extrapyramidal side effects that are seen after the initiation or a rapid increase in the dose of neuroleptic drugs, mainly typical antipsychotics, and have a varied presentation, such as torticollis, trismus, “mouth opening” dystonia, grimacing, dysarthria, oculogyric crisis, blepharospasm, and swallowing difficulties.[1] They frequently present to clinicians in an emergency setting and may sometimes be tricky to handle. Drug-induced movement disorders usually have a clear temporal relationship between medication initiation and symptom onset (some typically occurring with first dose).[1] They are also dose – dependent, and with the exception of tardive syndromes, have a complete resolution after discontinuation of the offending agent.[1] Mechanisms underlying drug-induced movement disorders involve blockade, facilitation, or imbalance of dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, and cholinergic neurotransmission in the basal ganglia.[1] Chloroquine is a drug commonly used for the treatment of malaria and has been reported to have gastrointestinal problems, headaches, blurring of vision, and itching as the common side effects.[2] Dystonia induced by chloroquine, although rare, is not really new and is mentioned in patient information leaflets.[2] However, such incidents are rare and mainly have been reported with the first dose. No case reports on acute dystonic reactions with a stable dose of chloroquine or with doxycycline are available. In view of current coronavirus disease pandemic, several combinations of antibiotics and antivirals are being tried and this report necessitates an exercise of caution for possible adverse drug reactions. CASE REPORT A 23-year-old man presented to an emergency psychiatry setting with the complaints of difficulty in lowering his gaze, up-rolling of eyeballs, and difficulty in jaw opening for the last 2 h. On examination, the patient was conscious, cooperative, and oriented. He had difficulty in opening his mouth and lowering his gaze. He appeared to have an acute dystonic reaction presenting with trismus and oculogyric crisis. Other aspects of his general examination were unremarkable. His systemic examination, which included an exhaustive neurological examination, was normal. All baseline investigations, including complete blood counts, serum electrolytes, liver and renal function tests, and random blood glucose, were within normal limits. His resting electrocardiogram was also normal. There was no past history of similar complaints or of any transient ischemic attack, and he had neither a family history of dystonia nor a history of alcohol ingestion, cigarette smoking, or use of illicit drugs or history of taking psychotropic medications. On enquiry, the patient yielded that he had fever for the past 3–4 days, for which he was taking some medications from a physician. All his blood parameters were normal, and he had tested negative for dengue and malaria. However, as it is a common practice in India to empirically start a patient on antibiotics, he had been started on chloroquine (500 mg once daily dosing) and doxycycline (100 mg twice a day). It was after his third dose that he had developed an acute dystonic reaction. Immediately, an injection of promethazine 50 mg was administered intramuscularly. After 15 min, there was some relief in his symptoms. Later on, after giving an injection of intravenous diazepam 5 mg, the patient's symptoms improved considerably. He was kept was observation for 2–3 h and later discharged on oral diazepam 5 mg once daily for 3 days. He was asked to discontinue the antibiotics, and on follow-up, the patient had no further complaints and reported 100% improvement. DISCUSSION Rampant use of antibiotics and their amalgamations has concerning effects such as antimicrobial resistance and higher occurrence of adverse side effects. While most side effects appear nonchalant, there are a few which could be life-threatening, such as acute dystonic reaction. Oculogyric crisis is the only form of acute dystonia that may occur, while the patient is receiving a stable dose of an antipsychotic drug; it may be provoked by alcohol, emotional stress, fatigue, or suggestion.[3] Given the paucity of literature on chloroquine- and doxycycline-induced acute dystonic reactions, we report a case of an acute dystonic reaction presenting as oculogyric crisis with trismus in a patient who was on a stable dose of chloroquine and doxycycline, being empirically treated for fever with a combination of antimalarial and broad-spectrum antibiotic. At a standard dose for malaria treatment, the common adverse effects of chloroquine include gastrointestinal problems, headaches, nightmare, blurring of vision, and itching. Using the Naranjo algorithm, the patient appeared to have probable adverse drug reaction when chloroquine was considered as a cause (score = 6). If doxycycline is considered as a cause alone, the score would be 5 indicating probable adverse drug reactions due to it. The difference of scoring occurs only on the first question of the algorithm as no report mentions dystonia due to doxycycline. This also sheds light on the importance of the first question of the Naranjo algorithm and the need to report such possible adverse reactions. Acute dystonic reactions usually result due to dopamine receptor-2 (D2) blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway, which results in an excess of striatal cholinergic output.[1] The pathophysiological mechanism underlying chloroquine-associated acute dystonic reaction suggests a reduction in the forebrain catecholamine levels and an inhibition of neuronal calcium uptake.[4] Gamma aminobutyric acid has been postulated to play a role in the pathophysiology of acute dystonic reactions, and this is supported by the effectiveness of benzodiazepines in reducing chloroquine-induced acute dystonic reactions.[1] This also explains why our patient improved with diazepam and promethazine had minimal effect on him. There is no available literature on doxycycline-induced acute dystonic reactions, and whether this drug had a contribution in the development of oculogyric crisis in our patient is uncertain. The combination of chloroquine and doxycycline has been shown to be synergistic in the treatment of malaria with increased efficacy of chloroquine on addition of doxycycline.[5] This could perhaps also predispose patients on this combination to develop rare side effects such as dystonia. Doxycycline has been shown to protect dopaminergic neurons and increase levels of dopamine in certain areas of the brain and can theoretically lead to dystonia.[6] Hence, we advocate an index of suspicion for oculogyric crisis whenever these drugs are being prescribed, especially in combination.

      "abstract": "Akathisia is characterized by subjective discomfort and motor restlessness. The motor hyperactivity can express itself by frequent changes of posture, constant limb shaking or restless pacing. If symptoms of akathisia are severe, treatment becomes extremely complicated and patients may even become suicidal as seen in the case described here. In the literature, different forms of akathisia are distinguished (Barnes and Braude, 1985): the acute form of neuroleptic-induced akathisia (recent onset, related to an increase in antipsychotic drug dose), pseudoakathisia (motor signs but no subjective symptoms), and chronic or tardive akathisia. The acute form of akathisia is well known and described (Zubenko et al., 1984a,b). In a retrospective analysis of clinical features and therapeutic trials for tardive akathisia, Burke et al. (1989) showed that almost all of the 52 cases developed this chronic form after an average of 4.5 yr following neuroleptic drug initiation, 34% even within 1 yr. Twenty-six of the patients who were able to stop taking dopamine antagonists still had symptoms of akathisia persisting for 0.3-7 yr (mean = 2.7 yr).",

The frequency and severity of the psychological disturbances are difficult to determine because many factors confound the interpretation of evidence whether it results from open case reports, controlled clinical trials, or neuropsychological testing. Concern about potential problems should not preclude trying an AED if other properties make the agent otherwise appropriate because the occurrence of adverse effects is often unpredictable in any given individual. Impairment can be minimized by gradual titration of dose and limiting total dose as clinically possible. If psychological problems arise and fine titration of the AED cannot eliminate the problem, the drug can be discontinued without permanent life threatening sequellae.",

      "title": "Alcohol Abuse",
      "abstract": "Introduction Alcohol and illicit drug use and associated problems within the adolescent population continue to be a great concern. Accidental death and injury in this age group frequently is alcohol- or drug-related. Venturesomeness and impulsiveness combined with alcohol can produce disastrous results. Alcohol use is more likely to cause an adolescent to be sexually irresponsible, which can lead to sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy. There has been an alarming growth in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive rates recently among the adolescent population. Finally, teenagers who abuse alcohol are more likely to drop out of school, thus damaging their long-term employment prospects. Definition The American Psychiatric Association in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM IV) defines alcohol dependence, a substance use disorder, as a maladaptive pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress as manifested by three of the following seven symptoms occurring during the same 12-month period: tolerance; withdrawal; use greater than intended; inability to cease use; time-consuming activities associated with use; social, occupational, or recreational dysfunction; and continued use despite knowledge of physical or psychological problems. Abuse is defined as one or more of the following: failure to fulfill major roles at home or school, recurrent use in hazardous situations, recurrent legal problems, and use despite persistent social or interpersonal problems.",

Dystonia is often classified by etiology, and may be primary (sporadic or familial) or secondary. Secondary causes of dystonia have accompanying neurological deficits or an identifiable structural or metabolic lesion. Classification of dystonia based on etiology has undergone extensive modifications as new genetic bases for some forms of dystonia and other primary neurological diseases have been identified. (Chapters 3 and 8). Secondary dystonia can be further classified into symptomatic dystonia and the dystonia plus syndromes. Symptomatic dystonia is due to an identifiable brain disease, an obvious brain or peripheral insult, or a hereditary or sporadic degeneration of the brain. The dystonia plus syndromes (1) have accompanying neurological signs and/or clinical and laboratory findings suggestive of neurochemical disorders, without evidence of an underlying neurodegenerative process (Table 1).",

It may also happen that the presence of a chronic disease changes the social situation of a patient, who then responds to the change by developing depression. Among the various systemic diseases, endocrine diseases, viral infections, collagen disease, pancreatic cancer, vitamin B12 deficiency, and folic acid deficiency are particularly likely to cause depression. Drugs, including interferon, methyldopa, and steroids, may also be the cause of depression. The depression seen in organic brain disease (secondary depres- sion) includes depression in convalescence from disturbance of consciousness caused by head trauma or encephalitis, poststroke depression, and depression in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or other neurodegenerative diseases. The symptoms of depression associated with a medical condition are basically the same as those in endogenous depression, including depressed mood, sadness, diminished mental activity, and impatience. However, depression associated with chronic organic brain disorders is characterized by the predominant symptoms of diminished intellectual capacity, apathetic tendency, lability of mood, retardation in thinking and speech, and flat affect, whereas depressive mood, insomnia, anorexia, low self- esteem, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and suicidal ideation are mild.",

We present a subgroup of patients with the following pattern of symptoms and historical detail: (1) severe sexual and physical abuse by family members; (2) relatively good premorbid professional and marital adjustment (considering later difficulties) though characterized by (3) hypomania, binge eating, and morbid obesity. A pronounced shift in eating behaviors follows (4) medical trauma (e.g., injury, cancer, surgery) that occurs after age 30, interrupts previous hypomanic adaptation, and leads to severe restriction, purging, and dramatic weight loss (e.g., 100 lb). Although only one patient met full criteria for anorexia nervosa, weight loss and starvation were serious enough to provoke further medical crises in all patients. Finally, (5) during both weight loss and weight restoration patients demonstrated significant dissociative disturbance, including dissociated mood and personality states (i.e., multiple personality disorder), self-destructive behavioral episodes repeating early trauma, and avoidance of food as a way to manage PTSD symptoms. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

      "abstract": "Drug-induced dystonia (DID) is a rarely diagnosed adverse reaction to a sufficiently large number of drugs. Acute DID (ADID) occurs soon after starting to take a drug or raising its dose, and switching from one antipsychotic medication to another, especially to its injectable dosage form. Tardive DID (TDID) develops a few months or years after starting drug intake or 3 months after stopping therapy. The diagnosis of TDID is based on the persistence of dystonic hyperkinesis for more than 1 month, the use of a dopamine receptor blocking agent, and the absence of other causes of its development. The risk factors for DID are male sex; young age (less than 30 years of age); a history of dystonic reactions; hypocalcemia, alcohol use while taking the drug. DID is most commonly related to therapy with antipsychotics, metoclopramide, antidepressants, and antiepileptic drugs. The short-term use of anticholinergic drugs (benzotropin, diphenhydramine) is effective in treating ADID. Anticholinergic drugs and atypical antipsychotics (clozapine, quetiapine), benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants (baclofen), and dopamine reuptake inhibitors (tetrabenazine) are used to treat TDID. To prevent DID, it is very important that a physician should be aware of that this unwanted adverse reaction may occur and that a drug with the lowest risk for DID should be chosen.",

Some of the earliest physical signs—any one of which associated with a particular form of insanity will almost infallibly indicate the first stage of this special disorder—are the intermittent pulse, the irregular or contracted pupil, the quivering lip or embarrassed articulation. The second stage is marked by loss of power in the upper extremities, by a gait more or less unsteady, by diminished sensation in the cutaneous nerves, or by the loss of some of the special senses. In the third period the disease approaches its climax, in an entire want of motory power, and by an impairment of all the nervous functions so universal, that although organic life may, under careful treatment, be prolonged for a considerable time, the patient may be said to exist rather than to live. Epileptiform attacks may precede or accompany any one of these stages. They sometimes very distinctly mark out their boundaries, or the disorder may run its course without any recognised convulsive seizures.",

      "title": "Lifestyle medicine for depression",
      "abstract": "The prevalence of depression appears to have increased over the past three decades. While this may be an artefact of diagnostic practices, it is likely that there are factors about modernity that are contributing to this rise. There is now compelling evidence that a range of lifestyle factors are involved in the pathogenesis of depression. Many of these factors can potentially be modified, yet they receive little consideration in the contemporary treatment of depression, where medication and psychological intervention remain the first line treatments. “Lifestyle Medicine” provides a nexus between public health promotion and clinical treatments, involving the application of environmental, behavioural, and psychological principles to enhance physical and mental wellbeing. This may also provide opportunities for general health promotion and potential prevention of depression. In this paper we provide a narrative discussion of the major components of Lifestyle Medicine, consisting of the evidence-based adoption of physical activity or exercise, dietary modification, adequate relaxation/sleep and social interaction, use of mindfulness-based meditation techniques, and the reduction of recreational substances such as nicotine, drugs, and alcohol. We also discuss other potential lifestyle factors that have a more nascent evidence base, such as environmental issues (e.g. urbanisation, and exposure to air, water, noise, and chemical pollution), and the increasing human interface with technology. Clinical considerations are also outlined. While data supports that some of these individual elements are modifiers of overall mental health, and in many cases depression, rigorous research needs to address the long-term application of Lifestyle Medicine for depression prevention and management. Critically, studies exploring lifestyle modification involving multiple lifestyle elements are needed. While the judicious use of medication and psychological techniques are still advocated, due to the complexity of human illness/wellbeing, the emerging evidence encourages a more integrative approach for depression, and an acknowledgment that lifestyle modification should be a routine part of treatment and preventative efforts.",

      "abstract": "La prise en charge des défaillances vitales est une urgence ; elle ne doit pas être retardée par la réalisation d'examens complémentaires ni par un traitement évacuateur et/ou épurateur. Les troubles neurologiques sont très fréquents au cours des intoxications par médicaments ou produits illicites (coma, encéphalopathies, convulsions, mouvements anormaux). Il n'existe pas de corrélation entre leur intensité et la sévérité de l'intoxication. La gravité immédiate d'un coma d'origine toxique est liée à sa profondeur. Mais la gravité potentielle et donc le pronostic final dépendent du mécanisme de toxicité et des complications associées. Le traitement symptomatique des manifestations neurologiques est une urgence et une prise en charge médicalisée précoce des patients inconscients est recommandée. Les complications respiratoires dues à l'altération de la conscience (dépression respiratoire centrale, obstruction mécanique des voies aériennes supérieures, pneumopathie d'inhalation, SDRA) sont fréquentes au cours des intoxications médicamenteuses et peuvent altérer le pronostic d'intoxications a priori bénignes. La prise en charge des complications respiratoires comporte peu d'éléments spécifiques à l'étiologie toxique et peut aller de l'observation simple aux techniques de ventilation, voire d'échanges gazeux extracorporels, les plus sophistiquées, sans que l'intérêt de ces dernières ait été validé en toxicologie. Les complications cardiovasculaires peuvent survenir de façon extrêmement précoce, ce qui justifie un transport médicalisé vers l'hôpital de tout patient intoxiqué, même chez un patient asymptomatique. Les formes à libération prolongée sont responsables d'une symptomatologie retardée et prolongée. Les mécanismes de toxicité sont souvent intriqués. La connaissance du ou des mécanismes impliqués dans un état de choc d'origine toxique est primordiale pour un traitement adapté. Il existe des spécificités de traitement des collapsus toxiques (sels molaires de bicarbonate de sodium, sels de calcium, glucagon à forte dose, insuline euglycémique) et l'indication d'une assistance circulatoire devant une intoxication par stabilisant de membrane réfractaire au traitement médical doit être discutée avant que ne survienne une défaillance multiviscérale irréversible. Les hépatites toxiques médicamenteuses sont globalement responsables de 20 % des hépatites fulminantes. En cas d'hépatite fulminante, le transfert vers un centre de transplantation doit être précoce. Management of drug-induced organ failure is a medical emergency that should not be delayed by any additional examination or attempt at decontamination. Drug-induced neurological disturbances are very frequent in acute poisonings (coma, encephalopathy, seizures, and abnormal movements). There is no correlation between their magnitude and the severity of the poisoning. The immediate severity is related to the depth of drug-induced coma. However, the outcome depends on the mechanism of toxicity as well as the occurrence of complications. Supportive treatment of neurological manifestations is a medical emergency and the early medical management of unconscious patients should be recommended. Drug-induced respiratory distress (including central respiratory depression, obstruction of the airways, aspiration pneumonia, and ARDS) is frequent in drug-induced poisoning and may alter the final outcome of non-life-threatening poisonings. Supportive treatment of drug-induced respiratory distress is rather non-specific including medical observation, mechanical ventilation, and even sophisticated methods like extracorporeal removal of CO2 whose efficiency in drug-induced poisoning remains to be determined. Drug-induced cardiovascular disturbances may occur early and abruptly. Thus, the transfer of all patients poisoned with cardiotropic drugs requires medical supervision, even in asymptomatic patients. Sustained release drugs may cause a delay in onset of sustained toxic effects. The mechanisms of toxicity are frequently associated. The precise knowledge of the different mechanisms involved in a drug-induced cardiovascular shock is mandatory for providing adequate supportive treatment. There is some specificity regarding the treatment of drug-induced cardiovascular shock including the administration of molar sodium bicarbonate, calcium salts, high-dose of glucagon, and insulin. The indication of extracorporeal life-support should be considered in case of poisonings involving membrane-stabilizing agent, refractory to conventional treatment, before the onset of irreversible multiorgan failure. Drug-induced hepatitis globally accounts for 20% of fulminant hepatitis. Fulminant hepatitis requires considering the early transfer in center specialized in liver transplantation.",

The condition is multi-factorial, dependent on lifestyle, mood and personality, as well as on familial factors but no single factor in isolation is sufficient to explain the delay in sleep timing. Refusal to attend school may be important in some instances but will not explain cases with delayed age of onset. In half the subjects the delay in sleep phase started in childhood or adolescence. The syndrome causes severe disruption to education, work and family life. Polysomnography, motor activity monitoring of rest-activity cycles, plasma melatonin profiles and urinary melatonin metabolite excretion are normal. Different patterns of sleep phase delay seen in the syndrome include stable, progressive, irregular and non-24 hour sleep-wake cycles. These patterns may result from different social and other Zeitgebers (\"time-markers\", for example sunrise, sunset) in the normal environment. Treatment by forced sleep-wake phase advance or with melatonin resulted in a partial sleep-phase advance but this was not maintained on stopping treatment.",

      "abstract": "Rebound insomnia followed the withdrawal of three benzodiazepine hypnotic drugs, each of which had been administered in a single nightly dose for only short-term periods. The intense worsening of sleep is attributed to the short duration of the action of these drugs. A hypothesis involving benzodiazepine receptors in the brain is proposed in which there is a delay or lag in replacement of endogenous benzodiazepine-like molecules after the abrupt withdrawal of exogenous drugs.",

The clinical manifestations of drug‐induced parkinsonism are often indistinguishable from idiopathic Parkinson's disease. However, some subtle differences may exist: for example drug‐induced parkinsonism is often associated with tardive dyskinesias, bilateral symptoms and the absence of resting tremor, etc. Besides toxins ( eg manganese, carbon monoxide or MPTP), many drugs are known to produce parkinsonism: dopamine blocking drugs (true neuroleptics used as antipsychotics: phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes but also sulpiride, “hidden” neuroleptics prescribed as anti‐nausea or anti‐vomiting drugs (such as metoclopramide and other benzamide derivatives), dopamine depleting drugs (reserpine, tetrabenazine), alpha‐methyldopa, calcium channel blockers (flunarizine, cinnari‐zine, etc). The putative role of other drugs ( eg fluoxetine, lithium, amiodarone) as well as the therapeutic management of this side effect are reviewed.",

      "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is neurodevelopmental disorder that begins in the first three years of life and last a lifetime. Core symptoms are impaired social interaction and communication, repetitive behaviors and a restrictive range of interests. Associated symptoms include anxiety, seizures, speech and language disorders, inability to concentrate, mood swings, sleep disorders, disorder of eating patterns, gastrointestinal disorders, tantrums and autoaggressive behavior. It is a disease of multifactorial and unexplained pathophysiology, which is probably a combination of genetic factors, environmental factors, a compromised immune system and the biology of the brain itself. There is currently no therapy to reduce or eliminate core symptoms, so drugs from different pharmacotherapeutic groups are empirically used. There are medications that are in the research stages that potentially affect the core symptoms: acamprosate, memantine, dextrometorphan hydrobromide/quinidine sulfate, riluzole, divalproex sodium, arbaclofen, bumetanide, L1-79, atomoxetine, methylphenidate, DMXB-A, donepezil, buspirone, oxytocin and OPN-300, vasopressin, balovaptan, folinic acid, vitamin D3, mecasermin, rapalogues and stem cell therapy. Among the non-pharmacological therapies that have proven effective are adjusted physical activity, music therapy, cognitive-behavioral and social-behavioral therapy. Considering the complex clinical image, high degree of dysfunction and reduced quality of life of patients, multimodal approach and specialists of different profiles should be included in the treatment of this disease. Only with this approach can the desired therapeutic outcomes be achieved, whereby a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures is the basis of therapy.",

Symptoms and complaints could be misinterpreted. Differential diagnostic assessments would be difficult either if the person has OCD or another diagnostic entity with OCD related symptoms. If clinicians in residential or outpatient settings do not realize this, the patients may suffer from inadvertent pharmacological treatment efforts, to no avail. A representative case of the former is presented. Withdrawal of all psychotropic medications cold turkey did not increase symptom load during the following weeks, indicating little benefit from medications. Because of continued complaints from the patient, psychotropic medications were gradually reintroduced, without any improvement. OCD patients may not be helped by extensive use of psychotropics and doctors responsible for them should employ other methods of reducing OCD symptoms than lumping together diverse psychotropics. There is evidence for the value of intensive cognitive behaviour therapy, but also for addressing the social conditions of the patients.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY The aim of this survey was to define the criteria for eliminating medication. In the first place the patient should not have had a seizure for 10 years. So long a period may seem excessive to some, but we believe that this study demonstrates that it is not too long; even after 10 years without seizures, several patients experienced them again when medication was stopped. As to absences, it is doubtlessly unnecessary to continue anti‐petit mal medication in many patients, but in all cases it is necessary to continue treatment to prevent possible generalized seizures. We propose the following considerations in each case: the clinical‐EEG form of the epilepsy; the number of seizures suffered by the patient, absence of repeated seizures or status and early initiation of medication; absence of permanent neurological or mental deficit; negative family history of seizures; absence of other antecedents, especially in the partial epilepsies (traumatic antecedent of epilepsy, however, is generally of good prognosis); absence of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities or prompt normalization of the EEG with medication (persistent focal activity does not however contraindicate eliminating medication when there have been no seizures). Abrupt elimination of medication is contra‐indicated; medication should be reduced slowly, generally over a period of more than 1 year. An increase in EEG abnormalities on reduction of medication makes a return to previous doses obligatory. Using these criteria, we have been able to eliminate medication in nearly half our patients. It is of course possible that some of them may have new seizures; according to Juul‐Jensen (1968), seizures may reappear as long as 5 years after medication has been stopped.",

People with ADHD usually experience the following types of symptoms: (1) Attention means a person may have difficulty staying on task, sustaining focus, and staying organized, and appear not to listen, even when spoken to directly. (2) Hyperactivity means a person may seem to move about constantly, including in situations when it is not appropriate or excessively fidgets, taps, or talks. They may often be on the go, in constant motion, and have trouble playing or doing an activity quietly. (3) Impulsivity means a person may act without thinking or have difficulty with self-control. Impulsive behavior also occurs when their desire for reward is not satisfied or temporarily put on hold. An impulsive person may interrupt others or make important decisions without considering long-term consequences. Those people’s behaviors are more severe, occur more often, and interfere with or reduce the quality of how they function socially at school or in professional life.",

Both the manic and the catatonic attacks seem to be superimposed on the basic depressive or schizophrenic illnesses. The attacks can be counteracted or suppressed by psychotropic drugs such as alpha-methyldopa, disulfiram, reserpine, haloperidol or chloropromazine which interfere with the catecholamine metabolism or their receptor sites. The involvement of the catecholamines may however be secondary to primary defects in the thyroid, the hypothalamus or the limbic system. The strict periodicity in periodic catatonia points to an accumulation of some active metabolite which may be produced centrally during the interval. At a certain level it may trigger the switch-mechanism and then be reduced during the catatonic phase. In periodic catatonia both the basic schizophrenic disease as well as the periodic manifestations are compensated by thyroxine-thyroid treatment.",

The disease manifests in episodes of binge eating, accompanied by attempts to get rid of the food eaten by vomiting, taking laxatives, exercising, or reducing food and calorie intake during other meals, along with excessive concerns, regarding weight and appearance. The disease is more common in the Western culture, among women, especially among younger aged (usually beginning in late adolescence). The onset of the disease is influenced by biological and environmental factors. Due to laxative use, hypokalemia and arrhythmias may develop; due to vomiting – enamel damage and voice changes. Bulimia nervosa is diagnosed, if, during the last 3 months, the patient had at least 1 episode of binge eating per week, accompanied by compensatory actions (vomiting, taking laxatives, exercising, or reducing food and calorie intake during other meals). Treatment is started with psychotherapy, if it does not help or the patient is additionally diagnosed with depression, SSRI or SNRI treatment is added. 80% of treated patients achieve remission of the disease. Aim: to determine the epidemiology, etiology, symptoms, diagnostics, treatment, and prognosis of bulimia nervosa. Methods: a systematic review of the literature was performed using the PubMed medical database. Selected articles examining the etiology, epidemiology, symptoms, diagnostics, treatment, and prognosis of bulimia nervosa. English word combinations were used for search: bulimia nervosa, eating disorder, bulimia, bulimia diagnostics, bulimia treatment. Conclusions: after systematic literature review was conducted, the epidemiology, etiology, symptoms, diagnostics, treatment, and prognosis of bulimia nervosa were presented.

Clinical manifestations of the AWS begin as soon as the alcohol consumption is interrupted or diminished after a long period of ingestion of great quantities of alcohol. The clinical manifestations include symptoms of autonomic hyperactivity, like sweating, tachycardia over 100 bpm, tremor, insomnia, nausea or vomiting, transitive visual, tactile, or hearing hallucinations, or even illusions, psychomotor agitation, anxiety and epileptic crisis.",

      "abstract": "Stress exposure is associated with psychiatric conditions, such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is also a vulnerability factor to developing or reinstating substance use disorder. Stress causes several changes in the neuro-immune-endocrine axis, potentially resulting in prolonged dysfunction and diseases. Changes in several transmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glucocorticoids, and cytokines, are associated with psychiatric disorders or behavioral alterations in preclinical studies. Complex and interacting mechanisms make it very difficult to understand the physiopathology of psychiatry conditions; therefore, studying regulatory mechanisms that impact these alterations is a good approach. In the last decades, the impact of stress on biology through epigenetic markers, which directly impact gene expression, is under intense investigation; these mechanisms are associated with behavioral alterations in animal models after stress or drug exposure, for example. The endocannabinoid (eCB) system modulates stress response, reward circuits, and other physiological functions, including hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activation and immune response. eCBs, for example, act retrogradely at presynaptic neurons, limiting the release of neurotransmitters, a mechanism implicated in the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects after stress. Epigenetic mechanisms can impact the expression of eCB system molecules, which in turn can regulate epigenetic mechanisms. This review will present evidence of how the eCB system and epigenetic mechanisms interact and the consequences of this interaction in modulating behavioral changes after stress exposure in preclinical studies or psychiatric conditions. Moreover, evidence that correlates the involvement of the eCB system and epigenetic mechanisms in drug abuse contexts will be discussed.",

      "abstract": "During adolescence physical, psychic and social changes occure more rapidly and to a greater extent than during any other period of live. The marked changes concern not only the outern appearence, but also its intrapsychic representations, the body image. The complex integrative processes towards the identity as man or woman cannot be mastered without a certain emotional and physical instability. This is particularly the case if, in addition, nearly infantile disturbances in the socialisation or conflicts specific for this life period are, or have been, present. They can in the sense of a disposition lead to the manifestation of more or less severe crisis in adolescence. These crises interfere not only with the body image, but in many cases with the somatic functions as well. In the study three general aspects of this developmental problem are discussed as far they are relevant in the therapy of psycho-somatic disturbances in adolescents. 1. The implication of the adolescent phase in the course of psycho-somatic diseases. 2. Diseases which mainly occure in adolescence and are predominantly confined to this life period or are mainly influenced by it. 3. The influence which conflicts and phase-specific anxieties and fantasies exercise on the development and establishment of a mature body image and an adult identity.",

      "abstract": "The relationship between alcoholism and depressive disorder is complex. Nevertheless it is necessary to analyse this relationship in order to take in charge properly the patients with such a comorbidity. Firstly, some alcoholic patients may develop a major depressive disorder in their life without any relationship with their alcoholism (accidental co-occurrence). Secondly, the vast majority of alcoholic patients have experienced depressive symptoms, specially during withdrawal. Finally, some alcoholics may present a severe depressive episode that require a specific treatment, the alcoholism being explained (secondary alcoholism) or not (primary alcoholism) by the depressive disorder. The alcoholism/depression comorbidity majors the consequences of alcoholism, increases the frequency of hospitalisation, and worsens the prognostic. It is thus important to detect such a comorbidity, although the evaluation of mood is complex in alcohol-dependent patients. The age at onset of each disorder, and the modification of one disorder during partial remission of the other, help to distinguish primary and secondary alcoholism. Antidepressive drugs are mainly limited to severe depression, primary depression, and depression with a high risk of suicide.",

The movement disorder disappeared on cessation of the drug within a time period corresponding to the expected wash-out for the different preparations. The emergence of dyskinesic symptoms coincided with a significant deterioration in mental state after an initial good response to the particular medication. Considering the apparently selective action of the serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, these cases suggest that movement disorders and psychiatric symptoms are unlikely to be due to single neurotransmitter mechanisms and that a disturbance of the balance between the different systems is a more likely hypothesis.",

It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma. Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

      "abstract": "Although the advent and widespread use of ataractic drugs has more or less eclipsed lobotomy as a method of dealing with severe psychotic states, variations and adaptations of the operation still can be used with benefit in certain pretty well defined circumstances.\"Chemical lobotomy\" and regressive electroshock bring about alterations in behavior superficially resembling those of lobotomy, but without the changes in personality that are the object of lobotomy. These desirable changes consist in increased extraversion, decreased preoccupation with self and decreased sensitivity to the opinions of others. With restricted operations, undesirable changes-the \"frontal lobe syndrome\"-do not occur. OPERATIVE FAILURES ARE DUE TO THREE MAIN CAUSES: (a) Preoperative emotional deterioration; (b) progress of the underlying disease; (c) relapse, possibly due to inadequate operation. Lobotomy is advisable if the patient does not show sustained improvement after a year of active treatment by other indicated means. The operation often represents the turning point in effective treatment. After the first year of ineffective treatment valuable time is being lost, with danger of fixation and deterioration. Then it is safer to operate than to wait. The future of psychosurgery lies in prompt application, in favorable patients, of selective operations that will reverse the trend of illness. There is particular need for further exploration of the temporal lobes in the hope of finding some procedure that will suppress hallucinations. Some 90 per cent of patients remaining in hospitals after psychosurgery are experiencing hallucinations. If these phenomena can be eliminated without producing serious personality defects, another large field for the application of psychosurgery will be opened.",

      "title": "Psychosis: impact on the patient and family.",
      "abstract": "Psychosis represents a milestone in the progression of PD, often severely taxing caregivers and frequently warranting nursing-home placement. This step is often necessary because caregivers cannot tolerate, among other stressors, their loved ones' sexual aberrations and irrational accusations (which can be caused by paranoid ideation). Other salient features of parkinsonian psychosis comprise vivid nightmares, which often herald its onset; hallucinations, which are principally visual and stereotypical in content; agitation; aggression; delirium; and confusion that exceeds the typical erosion in mentation. Hallucinosis and paranoid ideation may in turn precipitate weight loss; food may be deemed inedible because of imagined contaminants, for instance, either worm infestations or a delusional fear of poisoning by the caregiver. Parkinsonian psychosis exhibits an age predilection; correlates with the duration of disease and levodopa therapy; and may be associated with increases in the dosage of this agent or other drugs given, either as monotherapy or with levodopa. Levodopa or dopamine agonist toxicity can lead to psychosis because of dopaminergic hypersensitivity. Unfortunately, attempts to diminish this untoward effect (eg, reducing the levodopa dosage, introducing neuroleptics) may curb the psychosis but also erode control of parkinsonian features. To avert this \"dopamine dilemma,\" we have tested a selective serotonin antagonist (ondansetron), which essentially attenuated visual hallucinosis, improved delusional ideation and confusion, and was well tolerated. Other agents that can be tried for parkinsonian psychosis include the atypical neuroleptics olanzapine and clozapine.",

      "abstract": "Clinically, patients with Delirium Tremens (DT) and acute alcohol hallucinosis (impending DT) appear excited with vivid false perception. Cerebral blood flow and eeg correspondingly point to hyperexcitability in the CNS during these conditions. Clinical trials with barbital treatment in alcohol withdrawal shows that the amount of drug and the drug plasma concentration is the same no matter whether the physical signs of withdrawal are accompanied by hallucinations and clouding of consciousness. The psychotic signs in DT and acute alcoholic hallucinosis develops after many years of alcoholism as does seizures. We hypothesize that physical withdrawal is determined by the degree of physical dependence developed during the most recent drinking period whereas the psychotic signs and seizures are due to a cumulated CNS hyperactivity developed over many years of repeated alcohol intoxication and withdrawal. Changes of electrolyte concentrations in plasma or CSF do not play an important role in the pathogenesis of DT and related clinical states except that changes in calcium and inorganic phosphate metabolism indirectly point to changes in membrane excitability. A new model for a study of rapidly repeated intoxication and withdrawal episodes in rats has shown that repetition of episodes augments the convulsive component of withdrawal whereas the non-convulsive signs are dependent on the most recent episode only. The augmentation of the convulsive component correlates with regional differences in brain glucose consumption. Furthermore, synaptic proteins and acidic phospholipids may be involved in the development of CNS hyperexcitability during alcohol withdrawal. In conclusion both clinical and experimental studies indicate that severe alcohol withdrawal reactions may consist of two components: 1) Physical withdrawal signs determined by recent physical dependence. 2) A long term cumulated CNS hyperexcitability relating to seizures and psychotic signs during withdrawal. This state is elicited by alcohol withdrawal but it represents a cumulated and permanent or long lasting CNS dysfunction in alcoholics. The precise biochemical/pathophysiological mechanisms for the development of the two-component dysfunction still remain to be clarified in detail.",

Depressive conditions are major clinical problems that occur throughout life and often require a specialized treatment, but the use of the antidepressant compounds is often endangered by the risk of formidable side effects, requiring to stop the treatment or to use medicine doses that cannot determine the desired therapeutic results. These are reasons for the impressive expansion of the research on the depression types, with emphasize on etiological and etiopathogenetical studies, allowing the discovery of compounds with good therapeutic potential and an appropriate pharmacological profile to reduce the side effects. Diabetes (diabetes mellitus) is a major public health problem, with increasing costs and frequency in recent years. Late diagnosis, inadequate treatment, lack of ongoing monitoring or ignorance of the disease can have serious consequences for the health of that individual, his family and his community. The mental state of a patient with diabetes is different from one moment to the next and varies with the stage of the disease and the appearance of various complications. The stress of chronic illness, the pressure to have a lifestyle and a diet according to medical recommendations, sadness, anger and even denial of the disease, are feelings experienced by patients with diabetes at least once in their lives.",

Also, children and adolescents, females, people with learning disabilities, or people who experience violence in the home seem to have a greater risk of developing PTSD after a traumatic event. The websites of psychiatry organizations describe the symptoms of post-traumatic stress as ranging from sleeplessness, nightmares to grief and depression – with accompanying physical signs such as headaches and irregular heartbeats.

Unmada is classified into five (vataja, pittaja, kaphaja, sannipataja and agantuja) types, and \"Vataja Unmada\" (VU) is one among them. The description of VU is available in all major Ayurvedic classical texts, and it comes under \"Doshaja\" (psychiatric disorder which occurs due to the aggravation of doshas) category. Studies or scientific literature on VU has been lacking, and the present work is focused on to explore this condition. The etiopathology of VU denotes deficiency of various nutritional factors such as vitamins, minerals, omega-3-fatty acids, amino acids, and antioxidants. Lacking or deficiency of these nutritional factors leads to structural and/or functional damage and degeneration of the brain (neurodegenerative or demyelinating pathology) which ultimately leads to the manifestation of different degenerative psychiatric disorders. The clinical picture of VU resembles various psychiatric or neuropsychiatric conditions such as \"disorganized schizophrenia\" or \"hebephrenia\" or \"catatonia\" or \"dementia\" or \"bipolar disorder with psychotic features\" or \"mania with psychotic features,\" or \"organic or secondary psychoses.\" VU is a treatable condition, and it can be managed successfully by \"Panchakarma\" procedures along with internal medicines.",

Human exposure to aerosols from ichthyotoxic cultures (> or = 2000 cells/ml) has been associated with narcosis, respiratory distress with asthma-like symptoms, severe stomach cramping, nausea, vomiting, and eye irritation with reddening and blurred vision (hours to days); autonomic nervous system dysfunction [localized sweating, erratic heart beat (weeks)]; central nervous system dysfunction [sudden rages and personality change (hours to days), and reversible cognitive impairment and short-term memory loss (weeks)]; and chronic effects including asthma-like symptoms, exercise fatigue, and sensory symptoms (tingling or numbness in lips, hands, and feet; months to years). Elevated hepatic enzyme levels and high phosphorus excretion in one human exposure suggested hepatic and renal dysfunction (weeks); easy infection and low counts of several T-cell types may indicate immune system suppression (months to years). Pfiesteria piscicida is euryhaline and eurythermal, and in bioassays a nontoxic flagellated stage has increased under P enrichment (> or = 100 micrograms SRP/L), suggesting a stimulatory role of nutrients.

Our data point to a critical need to characterize their chronic effects on human health as well as fish recruitment, disease resistance, and survival.",

It is unlikely that the therapeutic mechanisms of amphetamines in MBDS are exerted on or reflected in physiological sleep patterns. Neither MBDS children nor normal young adults showed withdrawal elevations of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep after administration of amphetamines in constant dosage. Young adults showed REM rebounds only when the dosage was increased prior to withdrawal. In contrast to sedative-hypnotics, stimulant drugs do not reduce eye movement activity during REM sleep. This difference is emphasized for the specificity hypothesis-that different classes of psychoactive drugs differentially alter physiological sleep patterns—would be untenable if sedatives and stimulants produced the same effects on sleep.",

The seizures typically occurred several hours after his last alcohol intake at home (early withdrawal seizure) and 22 days after his last intake of alcohol (14 days after the last dose of diazepam substituting for alcohol: late withdrawal seizure) on the ward. Psychiatrists in charge of this patient found it difficult to attribute his seizures to alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) because of the atypical onset. The patient responded to diazepam resumption and valproate combination. This case highlights the need to always consider AWS as a possible cause of seizures and to gradually decrease diazepam as a substitute for alcohol. Moreover, in this patient, MCI may have induced vulnerability in the brain for AWS and the patients' older age might have decreased liver function leading to delayed onset of the seizures after diazepam withdrawal.",

      "title": "Vulnerability to addictive behaviors: the Associational Memory‐Appetitive Systems Relations Model",
      "abstract": "The concept of behavioral addictions invites controversy, but is slowly penetrating psychiatric consensus. Any addiction involves five components1: a) existence of appetitive needs and b) repeated attempts at satiation of these needs through ingestion of a substance or engagement in a behavior (appetitive effects), followed at some point by c) preoccupation with obtaining appetitive effects (e.g., craving, tolerance), d) loss of control over time spent engaged in appetitive effect-related behavior (e.g., duration, relapse), and e) undesired or negative consequences (such as failure to meet work, familial and social obligations; suffering physical injury; emotional turmoil) resulting from continued engagement in the behavior2. The fundamental underlying perspective is that addiction involves disruption of appetitive functioning; that is, of behavior directed towards fulfilling specific human psycho-socio-biological needs3. It has been theorized that addictive phenomena operate through appetitive mechanisms involving, in part, a misleading, temporary subjective sense of neurobiological fitness4, 5. This experience may be identified through subjective changes in a) affect (e.g., feelings of joy, or merely improvement of affect), b) level of arousal (e.g., alertness or sedation/calm), or c) cognition (e.g., clarity, enlightenment, or decrease in tempo of stream of thought). One may learn to associate in memory the appetitive need (internal cue) with the contexts (location, time of day, situation) and behavior (e.g., sex, work) that led to its temporary subjective satiation, even though the result may not actually be biologically adaptive. The Associational Memory-Appetitive Systems Relations Model of addiction describes how appetitive motives may become excessive, atypically elicited, or misdirected5. There are four main components of this model. First, it is acknowledged that addictions (e.g., alcohol use) have a substantial genetic component (e.g., between 10 and 50% is accounted for by genetics). The model theorizes that one's appetitive needs are impacted by one's genetics. Individuals with a genetic predisposition to substance or behavioral addictions may have a different physiological reaction when engaging in certain behaviors (e.g., involving valence of subjective reward, dissociation of wanting and liking, or involvement of counteradaptation processes). The neurochemistry of an individual can potentially create an inclination toward maladaptive appetitive functioning. DNA epigenetic processes such as cytosine methylation may impact gene expression in the nucleus accumbens (part of an appetitive motivation pathway) subsequent to initial recreational drug intake and possibly involvement in other addictive behaviors. Prolonged periods of stress, particularly at a young age (adverse childhood experiences), may lead to disruption in brain reward cascade functioning. Such disruption, in turn, may increase one's vulnerability to addictive behavioral rewards. Second, the social and physical environmental settings that one traverses will impact what information one learns and how one thinks, and may facilitate which behaviors one may select to perform. Daily life social \"pushes\" (stresses, social influence) and \"pulls\" (seductions) provide possible avenues of addiction. For example, encouragement by peers to engage in drug use or marketing the \"excitement\" of local casinos may push or pull one to explore an addictive substance or behavior. Production and distribution routes of various addictive behaviors will impact what is available to the potential \"consumer\". Accessibility and awareness of nearby addictive behavior will impact which behaviors one will initiate. Third, one's lifestyle inputs also impact what behaviors may \"pop\" to mind in daily life. A child who grows up with parents who were engaged in addictive behaviors may be relatively likely to tie appetitive needs fulfillment to an addiction-related lifestyle through vicarious learning3, or else be quite wary to fall victim to such a behavior pattern. In addition, through vicarious experiences, one may learn the vocabulary associated with an addictive behavior (e.g., cannabis \"head high\" versus a \"body high\"). That is, one may be socialized and prepared at a young age for entrée into involvement with an addictive behavior later on. When one contemplates trial of an addictive behavior, it should be mentioned that acquisition skills are needed to be able to engage in the behavior with minimal conflict. This includes behavior-specific conversation initiation skills (i.e., knowing how to meet a \"supplier\" and acquire the addictive behavior; for example, arranging a purchase of cocaine, or time with a sex worker) and a means of exchange (e.g., money or favors for drugs). Involvement in different addictions may vary over the course of human development. For example, persons as young as three years of age may suffer from television addiction. Persons as young as eight years of age may become addicted to caffeine. There are many behaviors that could be experienced as appetitive and become addictive (e.g., tobacco, alcohol, and other drug misuse; binge overeating/food addiction; shopping; electronic media-related; love and sex; workaholism; exercise; and gambling)3. A large minority or a majority of people have tried at least once engaging in various addictive behaviors (e.g., overeating, alcohol use, overspending). More-than-initial trial of an addictive behavior is partly a function of attraction to that behavior. Attraction-related variables include the social image associated with the behavior (e.g., mentioned in the recovery movement, of being \"hip, slick and cool\"), what one's peers are engaged in (peer social influence), as well neurobiological effects of engaging in the behavior. Fourth, it is through the process of associative learning that appetitive needs come to be subjectively satiated through adaptive or maladaptive behaviors. Associative learning and memory have been considered in several recent models of addictive behaviors. Cues in an environment that otherwise would be considered innocuous can stand out to be emotionally salient when influenced by motivational states6. These cues can range from eating behavior being triggered when seeing fast food sign cues or eating locations, or a drug user becoming excited or agitated when in sight of his/her drug of choice. Some individuals may not, through deliberate cognition, recognize that their decisional processes are being influenced by maladaptive or extreme reward cues. It has been proposed7 that appetitive motivation is controlled through a dual process of deliberate, conscious, executive, regulatory cognition interacting with relatively automatic, implicit processes, in response to addiction-related cues. Over time, in part due to relatively automatic prompting by multiple cues, one may experience excessive thoughts about and desire to perform a behavior. In turn, excessive time may be spent to plan and engage in the behavior, and possibly recover from its effects (e.g., from \"hangovers\"), and less time may be spent on other activities, despite diminishing appetitive effects1, 8. One is most vulnerable to initial and continued trial of an addictive behavior if the initial consequences are experienced as \"filling the gap\" in one's sense of well-being (i.e., of being satiated, fulfilled). A widely used saying within the recovery movement is that at first the addiction \"does something for the person\" and then it \"does something to the person\". In conclusion, appetitive needs are instinctually embodied in every human being from birth. For at least the past one hundred years, researchers have been exploring the parameters of appetitive needs in human beings9. The interface between one's genetics, social and physical environmental cues, lifestyle situations, development and adaptation (epigenetics and associative learning), and associative memory, may underlie addictive behavior. There is a lot to be learned from an appetitive needs perspective on what is at the root of an addictive process. Appetitive needs which might be explored include those of dominance/leadership, respect, being part of a herd, providing nurturance or being nurtured, and obtaining pleasure3, 5. More research is needed to explore a taxonomy of appetitive needs, and how different appetitive needs act as sources of vulnerability factors and may transform into specific addictive behaviors.",

Binge eating is defined as eating a large amount of food within a discrete time period accompanied by a sense of lack of control over eating during the episode. Examples of inappropriate compensatory behaviors include self-induced vomiting, fasting, excessive exercise, and laxative or diuretic misuse. Additionally, patients with BN experience body image disturbance, where their self-evaluation is unduly affected by weight and body shape concerns. Bulimia nervosa typically begins in late adolescence or young adulthood. Patients either are typically of normal weight or are overweight. Physical examination and laboratory findings are typically normal; however, medical complications can include electrolyte disturbances, cardiac arrhythmia, and dental caries. Fluoxetine and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly used to treat BN. A nutritional consultation is another important component of care. Finally, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and family therapy are the psychotherapies of choice.",

      "abstract": "Much of the data reported here regarding American Indian (AI) people has originated from specific areas with particular peoples. Thus, one must be cautious in applying information from one tribe to the hundreds of tribes living across the United States. As with any people, psychiatric disorder may be a pre-existing rationale for using alcohol. Or alternatively, alcohol may lead to various psychiatric disorders, such as organic mental conditions, posttraumatic stress disorder, or other conditions. A third alternative is that both alcoholism and other psychiatric disorder merely happen to affect the same person by chance. Recognizing alcoholism and treating it in a timely manner before disabling or even permanent psychiatric disorders ensue are key strategies. In addition, clinicians must be able to recognize and then either treat or refer co-morbid patients for appropriate care. Some psychiatric disorders, such as panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and various organic mental disorders may occur more often in some AI groups. Other co-morbid conditions, such as eating disorders, may occur less often among AI patients with alcoholism. It could be argued that resources should go solely to preventive efforts, thereby negating the need for psychiatric services. However, successful prevention of alcoholism may hinge upon, and increase the need for greater psychiatric services in AI communities.",

      "title": "Chronic mild stress-induced anhedonia model of depression",
      "abstract": "A cote symptom of human depressive disorder is anhedonia, the loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities. Anhedonia, measured as subsensitivity to reward, can be induced in rats by a regimen of repeated, mild, unpredictable stressors. Here, the hedonic state of rats was assessed using an intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) procedure. The ICSS frequency threshold was determined before, during and after a period of exposure to the stress regimen. After 13 days of repeated mild stress, the ICSS threshold was significantly increased, suggesting a gradual decrease of sensitivity to reward. This anhedonic slate lusted throughout the stress period. When stressed anhedonic animals were given electroshock treatment, the stress-induced increase in ICSS threshold was rapidly and completely reversed. Moreover, biological markers of human depression such as reduced latency to the first REM sleep episode or increased time spent in REM sleep were also found in electroencephalographic recordings of chronically stressed animals. These sleep abnormalities were observed beginning in the second week of a three-week stress regimen and progressively disappeared after termination of stress. In conclusion, these data provide further evidence supporting stress-induced anhedonia in rats as a unique animal model of human depression combining convergent elements of biological, etiological, symptomatological and therapeutic validity.",

      "title": "The Potential Benefits of Chromium and Selenium Supplementation Across Psychiatric Disorders and Symptoms",
      "abstract": "The conception of psychiatric disorders as systemic diseases implies an important role of nutrition in mental health. Essential trace elements are present in very small amounts in the body, yet they are essential for many physiological functions. Little is known about the potential role of chromium and selenium supplementation in mental disorders and other populations. To contribute to filling this gap, this review is focused on the possible benefits of chromium and selenium, alone or in combination with pharmacological treatments, in the treatment of mental disorders or psychiatric symptoms. Chromium and selenium show promising effects on psychiatric symptoms across mental disorders. Selenium may have benefits on anxious-depressive symptoms in healthy populations and groups at risk of nutritional deficits and psychiatric symptoms, for example, women in the post-partum. In addition, chromium was linked to improved insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism, which can benefit not only metabolic health but also mood regulation, with specific benefits on atypical symptoms of depression, such as appetite/weight gain. Selenium plays a role in reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, which may suggest positive effects on psychopathology and other conditions linked to these mechanisms. Both trace elements may affect positively mental health and cardio-metabolic-inflammatory conditions, which have a strong link with psychiatric disorders and their prognosis. Despite the evidence is not conclusive, chromium and selenium supplementation are interesting options to investigate in future research on the personalization of treatment in mental disorders.",

      "abstract": "Principles of benzodiazepine selection are outlined for various psychiatric indications and diverse populations (the elderly, and drug and alcohol abusers). Benzodiazepines are still among the most commonly used classes of medications, and they differ in their pharmacodynamic properties. They have varied uses as monotherapy or as adjunctive medication because of their efficacy in the treatment of conditions involving a dysfunction of the GABAergic system or where neuronal inhibition is required. In multiple therapy, benzodiazepines augment the efficacy of other drugs such as lithium in mania, antipsychotics in psychotic agitation and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in panic disorder. Benzodiazepines can produce dependence and tolerance in most patients; predisposed individuals are at greater risk. Short- and intermediate-beta half-life compounds carry a greater risk of rebound and withdrawal reactions, and drug dependence than long acting agents. Adverse effects include sedation, psychomotor and cognitive impairment, memory loss, potentiation of other central nervous system depressants and treatment-emergent depression. Drug potency and beta elimination half-life are reviewed and compared as pharmacokinetic variables.",

It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

      "title": "Acute Bronchial Asthma",
      "abstract": "Four hundred and six asthmatic attacks occurred in 9 patients with severe, chronic bronchial asthma who had been studied intensively in psychiatric or (in two instances) psychoanalytic interviews. Feelings and fantasies concomitant with asthma tended to be dominated by absorption in the physical illness. At times this appeared to serve as a protection against obvious psychological problems. In somewhat more than half of the episodes other emotional concomitants appeared after asthma had become established. The vast majority of these were depressive--a sense of sadness, helplessness, and hopelessness, at times accompanied by ideas of a dangerous or poisonous inner substance. Contrasting with these, in somewhat less than half of the attacks there were prodromal emotionaxl manifestations which preceded and led directly into acute asthma. The principal prodromal feature was excitement, usually with an angry or anxious coloring, occasionally elated and erotic, resembling a miniature hypomania. We suggest that in asthma an initial phase of drive arousal and excitement is followed by a later phase of drive restraint and inhibition. Antecedent changes in the environment occurring in the 48 hours prior to an attack varied widely. Eight categories could be discerned, the two most prominent being loss of a person and closeness to a person. Most of the categories could be divided into one of two groups: events which seemed to lead to frustration of powerful impulses and those which seemed to stimulate erotized or dangerous wishes. We postulate that both types of event, although neither is of itself specific for asthma, might activate a respiratory apparatus having both intake and expulsion functions, which has become vulnerable to psychological as well as physiological stress.",

The majority of unwanted actions of beta2 agonists belong to the former category and result from stimulation of beta receptors in organs and tissues other than the bronchi. Physiologists have appreciated that the catecholamine response to such stimuli as fear, stress, and exercise produce many different effects in the body. When beta2 agonists are administered for the purpose of bronchodilatation (and increased mucociliary transport, reduced bronchial venous congestion, and inhibition of chemical mediator release), their other sympathomimetic actions could then be described as \"unwanted\". Beta2 agonists are established treatment for asthma, both acutely and in conjunction with inhaled corticosteroids for long-term management. Many of the acute effects of these drugs are relevant to asthma morbidity and mortality.",

On the other hand, these drugs can generate transient anterograde amnesia and may diminish aspects of task performance. Research on the impact of alprazolam and other “tranquilizing” drugs has generally focused on tasks that remain below the complex efforts of managerial or professional personnel. Alprazolam‐induced reduction of anxiety under challenging conditions might aid complex task performance, yet anterograde amnesia might interfere. In the present research, managers participated in validated complex simulation tasks. In a double‐blind, dual crossover design, placebo, 0.5 mg, or 1.0 mg alprazolam was administered on 2 occasions during the task day. Drug treatment diminished performance on measures that require sequential actions but improved performance on measures less subject to short term memory but more determined by long‐term style of functioning. Thus, depending on task requirements, positive or negative alteration of performance might occur.",

We present a patient who at the age of 19 developed several schizophrenia - suspect symptoms. Soon inexplicable general seizures where observed. He was treated with antipsychotics, but had two bouts of malignant neuroleptic syndrome. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) gave some symptom relief and he continued on maintenance ECT for years with weekly intervals. Interruption of this treatment pattern rapidly increased symptom load. After seven years a lorazepam provocation test was performed as he had a new relapse after 3 weeks without ECT. In the ensuing hours his aggressiveness and nonsense speaking rapidly diminished. Kahlbaums observation of seizures as part of a catatonia was not understood in this case. The publication of the new DSM-V diagnosis of catatonia may hopefully reduce the probability of treating a patient for schizophrenia for years without access to a more targeted medication and ECT plan.",

The higher occurrence of driving mishaps is not surprising given that the core symptoms of ADHD are inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Safe driving habits can diminish the risk, however. The first step is to inform patients of the dangers of driving; the significance of adolescence, ADHD, and medication can be underscored in a written agreement. Strategies to promote safer driving--especially optimally dosed long-acting stimulant medication taken 7 days a week--may be critical. A number of measures lead to safer driving by reducing potential distractions during driving (eg, setting the car radio before driving, no drinking or eating or cell phone use while driving, no teenage passengers in the car for the first 6 months of driving, and restricted night driving).",

Objectives We report the case of a male patient aged 58 with multiple previous admissions for behavioral alteration symptoms, including exhibitionism. He is referred as irritable, uninhibited and sleeping disorders. There is a risk of flight as he is difficult to be held so it is feared that he can be run over by a car. He shows a marked self-referentiality. Methodology The patient is admitted. He properly gets used to the rules of the Ward. Pharmacological adjustment is performed. During his admittance he shows no behavior disorders neither episodes of self or hetero aggression and poor impulse. He properly makes comments of what happened during his stay. He responds well to treatment prescribed. Sleep pattern is restored. Results Schizophrenia (undifferentiated) 295.90 (F.20.3); intellectual disability mild 317 (F70); neurocognitive disorder (possible). Conclusions This is unusual case because it is normal that the sexual function of such patients is adversely affected, not finding numerous cases of disinhibition in our medical consultation. This is due to the different aspects that are affected, biological (drugs), psychological and social levels. We have different therapeutic alternatives to address this problem. However, they may hinder sociability and patient rehabilitation. Disclosure of interest The authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a heterogeneous mental illness and one of the leading causes of disability worldwide.Poor understanding of neurobiology of depression and neural mechanisms of antidepressant drugs could be associated to their serendipitous discoveries.The first line of antidepressant medications (tricyclics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors) are apparently ineffective in several patients.In principle, some of these antidepressant medications increase monoamine transmission directly (through serotoninergic or adrenergic receptors) or indirectly (by inhibiting the enzymatic breakdown and transport of serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmitters).Meanwhile, other mechanistic hypotheses of antidepressant drugs have been linked to cholinergic transmission, γ-amino butyric acid, neuronal plasticity, hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, reward system, receptor activation or blockade (κ opioid receptor, cannabinoid receptor, cytokine-regulated pathways, Melatonin receptor), protein/enzyme inhibition (histone deacetylase, tissue plasminogen, vasopressin receptor, NK1 receptor antagonists, phosphor-diesterase inhibitors, circadian gene products.This review sought to highlight the neural structures, biomolecules and circuits that participate in the mechanisms of the first line antidepressant drugs.The contents of this review were retrieved from globally available database (Science Direct, PubMed, ACS, SciFinder, Scopus, Web of Science among others).Findings showed that, most of the first line antidepressant drugs are associated with different side effects and delayed therapeutic effects.The side effects are consequences of multiple interactions or mechanisms of antidepressant drug's action.The delayed effect otherwise called therapeutic action lag has been worsened by low level of adherence to long term antidepressant treatment.Researchers are still groping in the dark in their attempts to understand mechanisms of antidepressant drugs, promote development of fast acting drugs, improve medical diagnosis, drug prescription and ensure effective treatment of depression with little or no side effects of drugs.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is a heritable psychiatric condition, that is, associated with lifelong distress and impairment. There has been a long-standing interest in the early-life origins of BD, not least because as many as 50% of adults with BD report onset of their symptoms during childhood and adolescence.1 In this article, we present evidence on the assessment and treatment of BD and related conditions in young people. We also discuss the recent controversy about BD in children and adolescents that has led to the introduction of the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM)-5.\n\n### Diagnostic features\n\nBD is characterised by episodes, that is, distinct periods of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive or irritable mood. During these episodes, patients experience symptoms such as grandiosity, distractibility, decreased need for sleep, pressure of speech, an increase in activity, flight of ideas and psychomotor agitation. These episodes are required to last by at least 4 days to diagnose hypomania or at least 7 days to diagnose mania. The insistence on episodic mood changes is crucial and prevents clinicians from rating symptoms such as the chronic concentration problems of a child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as evidence for mania.2 Manic episodes are extremely rare in children and relatively rare in adolescents according to epidemiological studies in the UK and the USA.3\n\n### Acute treatment\n\nPharmacotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for acute mania. Aripiprazole, quetiapine and risperidone are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of mania in children and adolescents, and olanzapine in approved only for adolescents. A comparative analysis of randomised, placebo-controlled trials in youth BD established that atypical antipsychotics have better efficacy and tolerability compared with anticonvulsants and lithium (effect size atypical antipsychotics 0.65, CI 0.53 to 0.78 vs …",

      "title": "CAUSES AND MANAGEMENT OF STRESS AT WORK",
      "abstract": "tress has been defined in different ways over the years.Originally, it was conceived of as pressure from the environment, then as strain within the person.The generally accepted definition today is one of interaction between the situation and the individual.It is the psychological and physical state that results when the resources of the individual are not sufficient to cope with the demands and pressures of the situation.Thus, stress is more likely in some situations than others and in some individuals than others.Stress can undermine the achievement of goals, both for individuals and for organisations (box 1).Signs of stress can be seen in people's behaviour, especially in changes in behaviour.Acute responses to stress may be in the areas of feelings (for example, anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue), behaviour (for example, being withdrawn, aggressive, tearful, unmotivated), thinking (for example, difficulties of concentration and problem solving) or physical symptoms (for example, palpitations, nausea, headaches).If stress persists, there are changes in neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, autonomic and immunological functioning, leading to mental and physical ill health (for example anxiety, depression, heart disease) (box 2, fig 1). 1 Situations that are likely to cause stress are those that are unpredictable or uncontrollable, uncertain, ambiguous or unfamiliar, or involving conflict, loss or performance expectations.Stress may be caused by time limited events, such as the pressures of examinations or work deadlines, or by ongoing situations, such as family demands, job insecurity, or long commuting journeys.Resources that help meet the pressures and demands faced at work include personal characteristics such as coping skills (for example, problem solving, assertiveness, time management) and the work situation such as a good working environment and social support.These resources can be increased by investment in work infrastructure, training, good management and employment practices, and the way that work is organised.Historically, the typical response from employers to stress at work has been to blame the victim of stress, rather than its cause.Increasingly, it is being recognised that employers have a duty, in many cases in law, to ensure that employees do not become ill.It is also in their long term economic interests to prevent stress, as stress is likely to lead to high staff turnover, an increase in sickness absence and early retirement, increased stress in those staff still at work, reduced work performance and increased rate of accidents, and reduced client satisfaction.Good employment practice includes assessing the risk of stress amongst employees.This involves:c looking for pressures at work which could cause high and long lasting levels of stress c deciding who might be harmed by these c deciding whether you are doing enough to prevent that harm. c HOW STRESS IS CAUSEDThe degree of stress experienced depends on the functioning of two protective physiological mechanisms:c \"Alarm reaction\".When confronted with a threat to our safety, our first response is physiological arousal: our muscles tense and breathing and heart rate become more rapid.This serves us well when the threat is the proverbial bull in the field rushing towards us.We either fight or flee.Present day threats tend to be more psychological-for example, unjustified verbal attack by a superior at work.It is usually not socially acceptable to act by \"fight or flight\", and an alternative means of expressing the resultant emotional and physical energy is required.This falls in the arena of assertive communication.c \"Adaptation\".The second adaptive mechanism allows us to cease responding when we learn that stimuli in the environment are no longer a threat to our safety.For example, when we first spend time in a house near a railway line, our response to trains hurtling past is to be startled, as described above.Over time, our response dwindles.If this process did not function, we would eventually collapse from physical wear and tear, and mental exhaustion.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety symptoms and disorders are common in community settings and in primary and secondary care. Symptoms can be mild and transient, but many people are troubled by severe symptoms that cause great personal distress, and which impair social and occupational function. The societal burden associated with anxiety disorders is considerable, but many of those who might benefit from treatment are not recognized or treated by healthcare professionals. By contrast, some patients receive unnecessary or inappropriate treatment. Recognition relies on keen awareness of the psychological and physical symptoms which are seen in all anxiety disorders, and diagnosis rests on the identification of the particular anxiety disorders. The need for treatment is determined by the severity and persistence of symptoms, the level of associated disability and impact on everyday life, the presence of coexisting depressive symptoms and other features such as a good response to or poor tolerability of previous treatment approaches. Choice of treatment is influenced by patient characteristics, patient and doctor preferences, and the local availability of potential interventions. There is much overlap between the different anxiety disorders for evidence-based and effective therapies (such as the prescription of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or undergoing individual cognitive–behavioural therapy) but there are also important differences, and for this reason it is helpful to become familiar with the characteristic features and evidence-base for each anxiety disorder.",

      "title": "Main neuroendocrine features and therapy in primary sleep troubles.",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is a sleep trouble in which the patient has difficulties in falling or in staying asleep. There are patients who fall asleep easily, but wake up too early; others have troubles in falling asleep and a third category has troubles with both falling and staying asleep. Independent of the type of insomnia, the final result is a poor-quality sleep, responsible for depressive or irritable mood, loss in concentration, learning and memory capacities. Sleep is essential to emotional and physical health. Inadequate sleep over a period of time is increasing the risks for obesity, diabetes, heart disease and depression. People suffering of chronic insomnia show an increased predisposition for psychiatric problems. People who had sleep troubles reported impaired ability to fulfill tasks involving memory, learning, logical reasoning and mathematical operations. New studies show that insomnia might be a result of the decrease of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurochemical responsible for the decrease of activity in many brain areas. Lower brain GABA levels were also found in people with major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders. Hypnotics, such as benzodiazepines are acting increasing the activity of the GABA neurons. Exposure to stress is associated with a greater risk for insomnia, with individual differences. Stress activates the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Increased activity of HPA axis is stimulating the secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone, further inducing sleep disruption. Insomnia is also associated with depression and anxiety disorders, in which the HPA axis is characteristically overactive. People who show predisposition to sleep troubles have a hyperactive sympathetic nervous system, they are usually suffering from hyperarousal and they have a more intense response to stressful events. Primary sleep troubles (insomnia) has no apparent causes, is lasting more than one month, and is affecting approximately a quarter of the adult population. Secondary insomnia is associated with chronic heart and/or lung diseases, medication which interfere with onset or duration of sleep, constant change of the sleep habits, restless leg syndrome, etc. Besides lifestyle changes and cogn itive-behavioral therapy, in the treatment of insomnia are used hypnotic medicines, advised to be prescribed on short-term cures of one or two weeks. Benzodiazepines are inducing and maintaining sleep. Longer use is responsible for severe side effects--dependency and withdrawal syndrome, daytime drowsiness and dizziness, low blood pressure, memory troubles and change in the melatonin secretion during night-time period. For these reasons were created non-benzodiazepines hypnotics--zolpidem, zaleplon, which are as effective as benzodiazepines, but have fewer side effects. Nevertheless the use of these hypnotics is also restricted to 7-10 days. Zopiclone (Imovane) another short-acting non-benzodiazepine hypnotic has a different chemical structure, but a pharmacologic profile similar to that of the benzod iazepines; the treatment should be of maximum four weeks. Besides generally known concerns related to the use of hypnotics (residual sedative effects, memory impairment, rebound insomnia, abuse, dose escalation, dependency and withdrawal problems) it was signaled a risk of death associated with the use of current hypnotic medications.",

In both cases 1) a hypomanic/manic episode induced by the use of antidepressants, 2) agitated depression, 3) physical withdrawal syndrome, and 4) spontaneous episodes in the natural course of the illness were the 4 different states that were taken into consideration for differential diagnosis.

      "title": "Should You Use an Anticonvulsant to Treat Impulsivity and Aggression",
      "abstract": "Mr. V, age 29, is a US Army veteran who presents to the psychiatric emergency department because of increasing aggression. He recently returned from deployment overseas and lives with his parents. Mr. V's mother reports that he has been increasingly unstable and describes an incident during which he punched a hole in his bedroom window after a temporary slowdown in the home's Internet connection. The workup and review of the history rules out substance abuse, posttraumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, seizure disorder, and personality disorders. He is currently taking only omeprazole, 40 mg/d, for acid reflux. The psychiatrist considers prescribing an antiepileptic medication to treat the agitation. Why this choice of agent? According to DSM-5, patients who have repeated episodes of aggression can be given a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder, but such behavior can occur secondary to other psychiatric diagnoses (Table 1, page 50). No medications are FDA approved for aggression.(1) Aggression and associated verbal and physical acts fall into 2 subtypes: impulsive type and premeditated (predatory) type. Impulsive aggression generally is described as an emotionally charged aggressive response characterized by a loss of behavioral control. Premeditated aggression, on the other hand, is characterized as purposeful, goal-oriented, and requiring forethought or planning. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Pharmacotherapy is directed primarily at treating impulsive aggression because this subtype is thought to be caused by neurologic deficits that can affect a person's ability to process, and react appropriately to, external stimuli. Agitation can result from neuronal hyperactivity.(2) Agents such as antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have the potential to reduce the intensity and frequency of such behaviors.(2) In this article, we focus on the use of AEDs for treating impulsive aggression in adults. Reviewing the evidence for AEDs The neurobiology of aggression involves multiple neurotransmitters, intracellular pathways, and ion channels.(3) AEDs have several mechanisms of action, however; primary mechanisms include action on sodium and calcium channels and modulation of [gamma]-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, and carbonic anhydrase. (2), (3) Agent-specific mechanisms of actions are listed in Table 2. Phenytoin. Several double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have found a statistically significant difference between phenytoin and placebo for treating impulsive aggression, as measured by the Overt Aggression Scale (OAS) (a) or a modified version (MOM/ OAS-M). (1), (2), (4) Researchers found that phenytoin, 300 mg/d, but not 100 mg/d, decreased impulsive aggression. (4) Valproate. Trials of valproate for decreasing aggressive behaviors have produced mixed results with regard to primary outcome when used at standard dosages and within the therapeutic range measured by serum concentration. (2), (3) In a pooled analysis of studies that met stringent criteria (randomized, controlled trial, aggressive behavior as primary outcome, patients free of organic illness or neurologic illness), Jones and colleagues(1) reported that valproate/divalproex did not produce statistically significant results compared with placebo for treating impulsive aggression. Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine. Double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and case studies of carbamazepine have shown mixed results. In contrast, oxcarbazepine has been found to significantly decrease aggressive behavior, measured by OAS/MOAS/ OAS-M scores. (2), (3) Total daily dosages of oxcarbazepine ranged from 1,500 to 2,400 mg.(2-4) It has been speculated that oxcarbazepine might be a useful option for treating impulsive aggression because of its therapeutic value in temporal lobe seizures--a subtype of seizure disorder that involves the limbic system, which also modulates aggressiveness. …",

      "abstract": "Summary: Status epilepticus (SE) is denned as recurrent epileptic seizures without full recovery of consciousness before the next seizure begins, or more‐or‐less continuous clinical and/or electrical seizure activity lasting for more than 30 min whether or not consciousness is impaired. Three presentations of SE are now recognized: recurrent generalized tonic and/or clonic seizures without full recovery of consciousness between attacks, nonconvulsive status where the patient appears to be in a prolonged “epileptic twilight state,” and continuous/repetitive focal seizure activity without alteration of consciousness. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) encompasses a broad spectrum of clinical presentations from repeated overt generalized tonic‐clonic seizures to subtle convulsive movements in a profoundly comatose patient. Thus, GCSE is a dynamic state that is characterized by paroxysmal or continuous tonic and/or clonic motor activity, which may be symmetrical or asymmetrical and overt or subtle but which is associated with a marked impairment of consciousness and with bilateral (although frequently asymmetrical) ictal discharges on the EEG. Just as there is a progression from overt to increasingly subtle clinical manifestations of GCSE, there is also a predictable sequence of progressive EEG changes during untreated GCSE. A sequence of five patterns of ictal discharges has been observed: discrete electrographic seizures, waxing and waning, continuous, continuous with flat periods, and periodic epileptiform discharges on a relatively flat background. A patient actively having seizures or comatose who exhibits any of these patterns on EEG should be considered to be in GCSE and should be treated aggressively to stop all clinical and electrical seizure activity to prevent further neurological morbidity and mortality.",

      "title": "Management of Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy",
      "abstract": "Introduction Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPn) is a common adverse effect of many anticancer drugs, such as platinum analogs, antitubulins (eg, taxanes and vinca alkaloids), bortezomib, and thalidomide. It can present as sensory symptoms in the hands and/or feet, typically in a “stocking-glove” pattern; pain, numbness, or tingling; or motor symptoms, manifested as weakness, cranial nerve deficits, or autonomic neuropathy. In a recent meta-analysis of 31 CIPn studies involving 4179 patients, the aggregate prevalence of CIPn was 48%. Within the first month of completing chemotherapy, the prevalence of CIPn was 68.1%; after 6 or more months of completing chemotherapy, the prevalence of CIPn decreased to 30.0%. The course of CIPn can be unpredictable, and although some symptoms may improve with time, others may persist or worsen as a result of permanent nerve damage. There are limited data on the natural history of CIPn in long-term cancer survivors, who are beyond 1 year of completing chemotherapy. Patients with breast cancer, who received taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy, had neuropathy symptoms up to 2 years after completing treatment, and patients with colon cancer receiving oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy had numbness or tingling of hands and feet up to 6 years from starting treatment. One of the challenges in managing and preventing CIPn is that the exact pathophysiology is not well understood. The hypothesized mechanisms of taxane-induced neuropathy include the disruption of the axonal microtubule structure and a deficit in axonal energy supply from the toxic effect of chemotherapy on mitochondria in primary afferent neurons. CIPn due to vinca alkaloid therapy is thought to be due to alterations in the neuronal cytoskeleton that cause axonal degeneration. Platinum agents are thought to cause CIPn by exerting damage in the dorsal root ganglion through mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal apoptosis, either by Dna crosslinking or oxidative stress. Despite investigations leading to hypotheses of several mechanisms of CIPn, none has resulted in clinically relevant therapeutic interventions. Several studies have attempted to identify risk factors for CIPn development, which also vary with different chemotherapeutic agents. Some of the clinical factors implicated in the development of CIPn include baseline neuropathy, the presence of diabetes, smoking history, and decreased creatinine clearance. In addition, there is interest in pharmacogenomics and identifying genes that may play a role in the development of CIPn. although numerous genes have been investigated, such as GSTP1, CYP2C8, and AGXT, there have been no conclusive findings. One of the clinical implications of CIPn is that the symptoms can result in treatment dose reduction or discontinuation, which may ultimately affect overall survival.

      "abstract": "Sports-related concussions continue to generate widespread interest. A concussion is a complex pathophysiologic process, with or without loss of consciousness, that results in a disturbance of brain function. Risk factors include age &lt;18 years, female sex, and history of a previous concussion. A sideline physical examination with standardized assessment tools can assist diagnosis. Management for suspected concussion begins with immediate removal from play and requires clinical follow-up. Symptoms are usually self-limited and resolve within 2 to 3 weeks. Initial treatment consists of a reduction in cognitive activity and physical rest. A stepwise return-to-play protocol, taking into consideration state laws, with a gradual increase in activity until the athlete is able to perform full activity without symptoms should be followed. Neuropsychologic testing may be used as a tool in management. For prolonged concussion, physical rehabilitation or medications for headaches, mood, or sleep disturbance may be required. Education, rule changes, and equipment improvements may assist in prevention. The long-term consequences of concussions are not fully understood and merit additional research.",

This paper reviews the frequency and features of this outcome, and its association with relapse. Residual symptoms occur in many depressed patients after acute treatment. They span the typical symptoms of depression, except those characteristic of severe disorders. Other persistent abnormalities include social dysfunction, dysfunctional attitudes, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis overactivity, shortened REM sleep latency, and mood lowering after tryptophan depletion. Associations of some of these with residual symptoms are not clear. There is growing evidence for similar residual symptoms in bipolar disorder, particularly bipolar depression. The most important consequence of residual symptoms is a much-increased risk of relapse, particularly in the first year. Residual symptoms are a strong indication for vigorous and longer than usual continuation of antidepressant treatment in order to prevent relapse. There is good evidence for the use of cognitive therapy as an adjunct.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background and aims To review early case reports and experimental inductions of amphetamine and methamphetamine psychosis, prior to the prohibition of these drugs, to gain a better understanding of the nature and aetiology of methamphetamine psychosis. Methods Papers considered were historical case reports and case series of psychosis relating to the use and misuse of prescription amphetamine, focusing upon papers by Young &amp; Scoville (1938), Connell (1958), and three subsequent experimental studies published in the early 1970s (Griffith 1972, Angrist &amp; Gershon 1970 and Bell 1973), where psychosis was induced in volunteers using high‐dose amphetamine and methamphetamine. Results High‐dose methamphetamine and amphetamine can result in a paranoid psychosis which remits rapidly (within days) of discontinuing use. The central feature is paranoia occurring in a clear state of consciousness. This may be accompanied by other psychotic symptoms (e.g. hallucinations). Pre‐existing schizophrenia is not necessary, and the syndrome is not due to sleep deprivation. Conclusions Research findings from the 1930s to the 1970s suggest that paranoid psychosis should be considered a probable consequence of high‐dose methamphetamine use. Individuals who experience psychotic symptoms for any substantive period after intoxication has ended should be suspected of having a functional non‐organic psychosis, or a latent vulnerability thereto.",

Neurologic and autonomic signs and symptoms may mimic serotonin or neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Patients were typically younger and had coexisting substance abuse disorders to other drugs. Also presented is a case of a 23-year-old male with an acute phenibut abstinence syndrome.

      "abstract": "Chronic diseases often require long-lasting pharmacotherapy. Administration of some medicines on a daily routine may cause troublesome adverse effects thus discouraging the patient from further treatment. An abrupt withdrawal of formerly continuous pharmacotherapy not proceeded by the professional medical consultation may endanger the patient either due to the relapse of the disease or the onset of withdrawal symptoms that, despite some opinions, are not limited only to potentially addictive medications. These symptoms may be mistaken for a clinical manifestation of a yet another medical condition of the ill leading to a vicious cycle of repeated diagnostics – additional pharmacotherapy – discontinuation of treatment due to drug intolerance – novel symptoms – repeated diagnostics etc., especially in the elderly. Unfortunately, even some medical doctors tend to forget that administration of specific drugs should not be stopped suddenly because certain withdrawal symptoms are more harmful than mild drug-induced adverse reactions. On the other hand, this is the clinician’s individual decision whether to stop or to continue the treatment in the presence of drug intolerance reported by the patient as many “practical” guidelines either do not give any recommendations or the statements are too general to be helpful in every-day practice. Therefore, the authors review the data on the causative factors and clinical implications of a sudden drug withdrawal, including mainly stricte non-addictive medicines in use for diseases of high incidence in general population.

The peak blood alcohol concentration (BAC) after a single amount of alcohol is reached 30-45 minutes after ingestion, depending on the rate of absorption and whether food has been taken. Alcohol is a pharmacological intoxicant that suppresses the brain and the rest of the central nervous system. Alcohol interferes with the ability to form new memories, particularly when it is taken in intoxicating amounts. Mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced memory impairments include disruption of neurotransmission in the hippocampus, a brain region that plays a central role in the formation of new memories. A common consequence of clinically significant alcohol intoxication is memory loss for events that occurred while the person was intoxicated—a form of anterograde amnesia.",

Tolerance to cannabis‐induced cardiovascular and autonomic changes, decreased intraocular pressure, sleep and sleep EEG, mood and behavioral changes is acquired and, to a great degree, lost rapidly with optimal conditions. Mechanisms appear more functional than metabolic. Acquisition rate depends on dose and dose schedule. Dependence, manifested by withdrawal symptoms after as little as 7 days of THC administration, is characterized by irritability, restlessness, insomnia, anorexia, nausea, sweating, salivation, increased body temperature, altered sleep and waking EEG, tremor, and weight loss. Mild and transient in the 120 subjects studied, the syndrome was similar to sedative drug withdrawal. Tolerance to drug side effects can be useful. Tolerance to therapeutic effects or target symptoms poses problems. Clinical significance of dependence is difficult to assess since drug‐seeking behavior has many determinants. Cannabis‐induced super sensitivity should be considered wherever chronic drug administration is anticipated in conditions like epilepsy, glaucoma or chronic pain. Cannabis pharmacology suggests ways of minimizing tolerance and dependence problems.",

Partial response to treatment is defined as less than 50% reduction in depression-rating scores. Before diagnosing treatment-resistant depression or partial response to treatment, adherence to adequate doses and duration of medications should be confirmed. Management strategies include adding psychotherapy, switching antidepressant medication class, or augmenting with additional medications. Current guidelines recommend augmentation with a second-generation antidepressant, an atypical antipsychotic, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, or a triiodothyronine medication as pharmacologic options. Ketamine and esketamine can also be used as augmentation for treatment-resistant depression and may help reduce suicidal ideation. Electroconvulsive therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation may be effective. Pharmacogenetic testing has limited evidence and is not recommended. Nonpharmacologic therapies include psychotherapy, exercise, and focused dietary changes.",

Particularly if the symptoms seem progressive or there is involvement of other organ systems, further evaluation is warranted. Visual abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and liver involvement are among the symptoms commonly associated with some neurodegenerative disorders. Clinical course is important to consider, as a relapsing course will be more suggestive of an inflammatory/autoimmune etiology.

      "abstract": "Abstract A case is described of a severe depressive episode following withdrawal from anabolic steroids which were being misused to enhance body-building. The subject was a twenty-two year old unemployed male who had left school without formal qualifications and had been brought up by his grandparents since his parents' separation. He had been a bodybuilder for four years and misused combinations of oral and parenteral anabolic steroids in increasing doses for two years. His depressive symptoms included lowered mood, loss of energy, anhedonia, suicidal preoccupations, disturbed sleep, poor appetite and impaired concentration. It is proposed that unusually prolonged exposure to steroids followed by withdrawal was the most likely cause of the depression in this case and that biological vulnerability to affective disorder may explain the severity of the episode. Misuse of steroids needs to be considered in young physically active people presenting with depression.",

Attention deficit disorder (ADD) is not a disease in itself, usually, but rather a mistaken diagnosis when distractibility or impulsivity is caused by mood illnesses or anxiety states.

      "abstract": "Depression and Parkinson's DiseaseParkinson's disease (PD) is generally considered to be a neurological disorder.However, because of the frequency of mood and other psychiatric complications, PD could be considered a neuropsychiatric disease.In fact, James Parkinson himself observed in 1817 that depression is commonly associated with PD. 1 The estimated prevalence of depression in PD varies according to the type of mood assessment applied (interview versus self-report questionnaire), diagnostic criteria or definition of depression (the number and type of symptoms required), and research setting (community-based versus neurology clinic). 1,2However, overall the data suggest that at any given time 20-40% of individuals with PD are experiencing depression of some type.4][5] Depression can be difficult to diagnose in PD because of the overlap between symptoms of depression and PD.For example, the biological symptoms typical of depression-such as low energy, insomnia or excessive sleep, weight loss, diminished sexual function, and an emotionless face-can be directly related to the neuroanatomical disruption characteristic of PD.These symptoms are not necessarily evidence of depression and, conversely, the psychomotor slowing of depression might be accidentally overlooked in a patient with PD. 2,6 Depression in PD could be considered an understandable reaction to a disabling chronic illness.However, some researchers believe that depression may be a part of the disease and caused by neurological changes. 2,7This notion is supported by the fact that depression sometimes precedes the diagnosis of PD.Of course, the cause of depression in patients with PD could be a combination of a subjective reaction to the illness and the brain changes brought about by the disease. 5The consensus is that depressive symptoms should be addressed and treated by physicians regardless of whether these symptoms are part of PD itself or due to a separate cause. 1,8,9e psychiatric complications of PD require attention because they can exacerbate the already considerable physical challenges brought on by the disease.In fact, an international survey of patients with PD discovered that depressive symptoms were the most important factor in patient quality-of-life ratings. 10,11Another reason to treat depression in PD is that reports of care-giver burden correlate significantly with patients' depression and quality of life. 12",

      "abstract": "Medical rehabilitation is a multi-professional / interdisciplinary process aimed at enhancing and restoring functional ability (activity and participation) and quality of life to people with im-pairments or disabilities. Rehabilitation is applied throughout the continuum of care. COVID-19 patients may develop a myriad of acute medical problems (linked to the virus per se, or as con-sequences of the invasive procedures), which can cause acute, post-acute and long-term conse-quences requiring rehabilitation. Information about short and long-term sequelae of COVID-19 indicate an increasing need for rehabilitation. The paper is focused on two main aspects: rehabil-itation of the severe neurological disabilities that occurred during the acute phase and continu-ing in the chronic phase (i.e., different neurological sensory-motor and cognitive deficits sec-ondary to stroke, encephalitis, seizures, encephalopathies). The other main issue is generated by the disruption of regular rehabilitation in people with neurological disabilities and chronic dis-eases (people living with sequels after stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis) due to quarantine, social isolation, movement restriction, and other healthcare systems ’disruptions. Methods Internet literature search (Lit Covid and PubMed) using the following keywords (Covid-19, Coronavirus, neurological complications, rehabilitation). During 2020-2021 were published 88 papers (in 2020 = 54, and in 2021= 54), with 21 reviewes (2020 = 15; 2021 = 8), and 2 systematic reviews, refearing neuroreabilitation in Covid-19 subacutre and long-term cas-es. Discussion REH-COVER Cochrane Rehabilitation WHO initiative (“Rapid Living Systematic Reviews Second Edition, called 2020”), contains the main cornerstones for a tailored rehabilita-tion programme, the best (current) available rehabilitation evidence on recovery interventions, for the patients living with sequelae of COVID-19. Conclusions More than two years since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is obvious that rehabilitation services play a crucial role in post-COVID recovery trajectories. A further achievement of research and evidence focussed on the clinical management, comprehensive treatments, and efficacy need to be targeted on short and long-term (neuro)-rehabilitation service models of care, for COVID-19 survivors.

His symptoms were exacerbated in the wintertime but were not related to meals or sleep. He denied excessive sweating, sensory abnormalities, difficulty with facial or bulbar muscles, and episodes of dark urine. Medical and family history was negative. Cramps and contractures may be identical clinically. The former is more common in neurogenic disease, whereas in myopathies they are more likely to be contractures or myotonia. True cramps occur without provocation. If they are exercise induced (in which the pain has a quasistoichiometric relation to muscle work), they are more suggestive of contractures and suggest abnormal muscle metabolism. Other features of cramps are explosive onset, occurrence in parts of one muscle, occurrence at rest (especially in a muscle in a contracted position) or after triggering movement (either minor or forceful), and relief by passive stretch.",

      "abstract": "Drug dependence is a chronically relapsing disorder, manifested as an intense desire for the drug, with impaired ability to control the urges to take the drug, even at the expense of serious adverse consequences. These behavioral abnormalities develop gradually during repeated exposure to a drug of abuse, and can persist for months or years after discontinuation of use, suggesting that this addiction can be considered a form of drug-induced neural plasticity. Many neurotransmitters, including gamma-aminobutyrric acid (GABA), glutamate, acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin and endogenous opioid peptides, have been implicated in the effects of the various drugs of abuse. Dopamine has been consistently associated with the reinforcing effects of most of them. There is, in addition, a growing body of evidence that the endogenous cannabinoid system might participate in the motivational and dopamine-releasing effects of several drugs of abuse. This review will discuss the latest advances on the mechanisms of cannabinoid dependence and the possible role of the endocannabinoid system in the treatment of addiction, not only to marijuana but also to the other common illicit drugs.

      "title": "Uncomplicated depression is normal sadness, not depressive disorder: further evidence from the NESARC",
      "abstract": "We write to update the results of our recent paper 1 suggesting that uncomplicated depressive episodes are not in fact disorders and should be excluded from the diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD). We also address some concerns expressed about our claims. The concept of \"uncomplicated depression\" is essentially a generalization to all stressors of the \"bereavement exclusion\" that appeared in DSM-IV (and was eliminated in DSM-5). Uncomplicated depression is defined as a response to a stressor that satisfies current DSM-5 five-symptoms-for-two-weeks criteria for MDD but is better explainable as a normal distress response, as evidenced by the fact that it lasts no longer than six months and does not include any of the following pathosuggestive symptoms: marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms, and psychomotor retardation. Uncomplicated episodes thus contain only depressive symptoms common in general distress reactions (e.g., sadness, moderate withdrawal or role impairment, decreased interest in usual activities, insomnia, decreased appetite, difficulty concentrating, fatigue). In our recent paper 1, using longitudinal data from the Epidemiological Catchment Area (ECA) study 2, we found that in those with lifetime uncomplicated MDD at baseline, the one-year recurrence rate (3.4%) was not significantly different from the background MDD incidence rate in those who never previously had MDD (1.7%), but both were dramatically lower than recurrence rates in other (\"complicated\") MDD (14.6%). Thus, in terms of recurrence risk, uncomplicated MDD is different from other MDD but indistinguishable from no-MDD-history. We concluded that \"consideration should be given to eliminating uncomplicated episodes as a class from MDD diagnosis\". However, that study had several limitations. We 3 therefore replicated and broadened the analysis using an entirely different, more recently collected longitudinal community data set – the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC, 4) – that allowed a more clinically meaningful 3-year follow-up window and use of an expanded set of three clinically important validators (depression recurrence, suicide attempt, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)), as well as other advantages in measuring impairment and clinical significance. Due to data-set limitations, only single-episode uncomplicated cases could be evaluated in this study. The results were that people with single-episode uncomplicated major depression had rates during follow-up of MDD recurrence (6.9%), GAD (4.3%), and suicide attempt (0.1%) that were not significantly different from background rates for those who never had MDD (6.1%, 2.7%, and 0.3%, respectively), but were dramatically and significantly lower than rates for both single-episode complicated cases (19.5%, 7.8%, and 0.8%, respectively) and multiple-episode cases (27.1%, 11.2%, and 1.7%, respectively) 3. The results were not explainable by group differences in severity or treatment rates. Given the replication's success, we concluded that uncomplicated MDD is a benign condition that is typologically distinct from the rest of MDD, thus supporting our earlier thesis that uncomplicated MDD is in fact a form of normal sadness. However, in a commentary on the replication, Maj 5 expressed some concerns about the evidence provided by our study. These previously unaddressed concerns are now considered. In MDD, the quality of remission, and especially the number of residual depressive symptoms, is important both because subthreshold depression is harmful in itself and such symptoms predict recurrence and may indicate a latent pathology. Yet, Maj notes, our studies did not report the residual symptom levels among those not experiencing MDD during the follow-up. To address this concern, we analyzed the average number of MDD symptom groups experienced during follow-up by individuals in each of our baseline MDD groups who did not have recurrences during the follow-up period. In each of the four baseline wave 1 lifetime MDD history groups, the mean number of residual symptom groups experienced by those who had no wave 2 recurrences during the 3-year follow-up period was: 0.37 (95% CI: 0.35-0.39) for the no lifetime MDD history group (N=25,514); 0.49 (95% CI: 0.34-0.65) for the lifetime uncomplicated single episode group (N=379); 0.75 (95% CI: 0.65-0.85) for the lifetime complicated single episode group (N=1,756); and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.91-1.10) for the lifetime multiple episodes group (N=1,876). Thus, there is not a significant difference in the number of symptoms during follow-up between the no-MDD-history group and the uncomplicated single episode MDD group. There is no \"residual symptom\" problem indicating implicit pathology or risk of recurrence among the uncomplicated group above the non-MDD baseline. In contrast, the complicated single episode and multiple episode groups both experienced significantly higher residual symptom levels than the no-history and uncomplicated single episode groups. In sum, recovery in uncomplicated depression generally returns to population baseline levels of depressive symptoms, which is unlike the recoveries of those with other MDD. Maj 5 also argued that the 3-year follow-up may have been too short to detect recurrences in uncomplicated cases because recurrence after recovery can occur after longer intervals. He noted, for instance, that in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Collaborative Depression Study, the median time to first recurrence of MDD in people who had fully recovered from their index episode was over 4 years 6. However, the baseline NESARC data used in our study were lifetime MDD data at interview 1. Thus, the duration of the follow-up was not just three years. In fact, many of the individuals classified with lifetime MDD at wave 1 had not had their last MDD episode for some years prior to the wave 1 interview, so the average time interval since recovery was potentially much greater than three years. Thus, to address Maj's concern, we calculated for each of our MDD groups the average time from the end of the last episode to the wave 1 interview to obtain a more accurate approximation of the time intervals from the last episode to the outcome reported for wave 2. The mean years of remission prior to wave 1 assessment for each group were: 9.1 (95% CI: 7.9-10.3) for the lifetime uncomplicated single episode group (N=417); 9.1 (95% CI: 8.6-9.6) for the lifetime complicated single episode group (N=2128); and 3.9 (95% CI: 3.6-4.2) for the lifetime multiple episodes group (N=2501). Thus, the average time from the end of the last episode to the beginning of the wave 2 follow-up period was lengthy, about nine years for both uncomplicated and complicated single-episode cases and about four years for multiple episode cases. This substantial time interval is more than enough for elevated recurrence rates to emerge during the examined 3-year window, and such elevated rates did occur for the single-episode complicated cases but not for the uncomplicated cases at the same 9-year average time since the baseline episode. Our recent replication and extension 3 of our earlier results 1 supports the predictive validity of the uncomplicated versus complicated depression distinction across stressors, supplementing a previous study supporting concurrent validity 7. A course with elevated recurrence relative to population baselines is generally considered the single most salient identifying feature of depressive disorder versus normal sadness 8 and a primary rationale for inferring underlying dysfunction 9, yet no such elevation occurs for uncomplicated depression. The evidence thus supports two conclusions. First, uncomplicated depression is not similar to, and is typologically distinct from, major depressive disorder. Second, given the lack of differences between uncomplicated depression and no history of MDD in crucial negative sequelae including recurrence, suicide attempt, and GAD, uncomplicated depression is best interpreted as an intense normal emotional episode. The additional analyses presented here in response to Maj's 5 concerns regarding quality of recovery and duration of follow-up substantially strengthen the support for these conclusions. Jerome C.

This review describes findings relating to sustained work stresses commonly found in our advancing technological world. Researchers report decrements in sustained performance as a function of fatigue, especially during and following one or more nights of complete sleep loss, or longer periods of reduced or fragmented sleep. Sleep loss appears to result in reduced reaction time, decreased vigilance, perceptual and cognitive distortions, and changes in affect. Sleep loss and workload interact with circadian rhythms in producing their effects. These interactions are a major source of stress in work situations requiring sustained work in continuous operations and have implications for theoretical models of sustained perceptual and cognitive functioning.

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and, in type one, cataplexy, often accompanied by disrupted nocturnal sleep, parasomnias, and other impairments. This study aims to explore patients’ perceptions and emotional experiences of these symptoms. Methods A qualitative study was conducted using narrative semi-structured interviews with 25 narcolepsy patients, guided by a structure approved by a multidisciplinary expert board. The interviews, conducted at the patients’ homes or hospitals, were transcribed, inductively analyzed to develop a codebook, and subjected to thematic analysis. Results The onset and manifestation were key themes for each symptom. EDS was often described as “microsleeps” or “shutting off,” causing embarrassment when occurring publicly and influenced by factors such as the weather, seasons, or menstruation. Cataplexy was commonly triggered by positive emotions or situations, including sexual intercourse, with patients often suppressing emotions to prevent episodes, leading to misinterpretations by others as drunkenness. Nocturnal sleep disturbances, including vivid dreams, nightmares, sleep paralysis, and hallucinations, led to negative emotional experiences. Overall, narcolepsy symptoms significantly impacted patients’ emotional well-being. Conclusion The burden of narcolepsy is deeply tied to patients’ perceptions and emotional experiences, significantly affecting their quality of life, yet few studies have used qualitative approaches to explore their perspectives.",

      "title": "Post-operative central anticholinergic syndrome",
      "abstract": "Central anticholinergic syndrome is defined as an absolute or relative reduction in cholinergic activity in the central nervous system [1]. In anaesthetic practice the syndrome was originally described in connection with drugs with central anticholinergic actions, such as hyoscine butylbromide (scopolamine) [2]. Later, many other drugs with no direct anticholinergic effects were implicated. This may be by modulation of other neurotransmitters which reduce cholinergic activity, but the mechanisms by which the syndrome occurs have not been fully explained [1]. The reported clinical features of the central anticholinergic syndrome in the post-operative period are non-specific. If they are all components of the syndrome the central nervous system would be widely involved (Table 1). There are said to be two forms of the syndrome: hyperactive or depressed. Peripheral anticholinergic symptoms may also occur but could by masked by peripheral cholinesterase inhibitors. Diagnosis rests on clinical features, exclusion of other conditions, and a positive response to a centrally acting cholinesterase inhibitor, usually physostigmine [1].Table 1: Reported clinical features of post-operative central anticholinergic syndrome The incidence of the post-operative syndrome has been estimated as 9.4% after general anaesthesia and 3.3% after regional anaesthesia with sedation [1], although an incidence as high as 40% has been claimed [5]. In their paper in this issue of the journal [6], Link et al. report an incidence of 1.9% in a broad mix of 962 adults after general anaesthesia, with a subgroup of women recovering from major gynaecological surgery having an incidence of 10%. These figures are in stark contrast with experience in the UK where central anticholinergic syndrome is diagnosed rarely. United Kingdom anaesthetists are either unaware of the syndrome, or do not believe it exists. Choice of anaesthetic technique and drugs may be an important determinant of reported incidence. Anaesthetists who use long acting drugs (benzodiazepines or barbiturates) will see a large number of patients who recover slowly from anaesthesia. Link et al. state that less than 3% of their study population were given droperidol as part of their anaesthetic, but eight of 18 patients with the syndrome received between 2.5 and 25 mg. The total number of patients given diazepam and phenobarbitone premedication is not stated, but nine of 18 affected patients received one of these drugs. What constitutes normal recovery from anaesthesia and a definition of what is abnormally prolonged are not stated. Clearly, the earlier that features of the syndrome are sought the higher will be their incidence in the post-operative period. Interindividual variations in anaesthetic drugs and technique, as well as variations in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, must also be taken into account. From the clinical features it is obvious that the list of differential diagnoses is long. As there is no diagnostic test, the diagnosis is made by exclusion of hypoxia, hypercapnia, hyperthermia, hypothermia, urea and electrolyte and acid-base disturbances, endocrine abnormalities, and neurological disturbance from surgery, vascular disease or trauma [1]. The extensive list of symptoms and signs means that central anticholinergic syndrome is a potential diagnosis in patients with just about any form of neurological abnormality, and that the incidence could be inversely proportional to the rigour with which other diagnoses are excluded. In some settings, rigorous exclusion of all other conditions may be simply impossible in the immediate post-operative period. The diagnosis, therefore, is heavily dependent on a response to physostigmine, whose central effects extend beyond the cholinergic system [7,8]. Perhaps central anticholinergic syndrome is a misnomer, and central physostigmine responsive syndrome is a more accurate description. This does not mean that post-operative central anticholinergic syndrome should be dismissed out of hand. The case report by Sun [9] cannot easily be explained by any other diagnosis. This is a report of three general anaesthetics in one patient, who took 14 and 10 h to regain full consciousness after repair of retinal detachment under general anaesthesia that included reversal of neuromuscular blockade with neostigmine and atropine. On the third occasion, an identical anaesthetic to the second was given but without reversal of neuromuscular blockade. This time the patient was fully conscious 10 min after the end of the anaesthesia. Physostigmine was not available in the hospital involved. Physostigmine shortens wakening times after general anaesthesia [10]. However, its duration of action is about 30–60 min after intravenous (i.v.) injection [11] and, in common with other 'antidotes' such as naloxone and flumazenil, there is a danger of later recurrence of symptoms. Reported side effects of physostigmine in this setting include nausea and vomiting, abdominal cramps [10,12,13] and bradycardia and hypotension [13]. It would therefore seem appropriate to avoid treating one drug's side effects with another drug that exposes patients to other risks. We should accept that some patients recover from anaesthesia more slowly than others, and perhaps the safest course of action is to observe and support them during this time. Careful choice of anaesthetic technique and drugs tailored to individual circumstances should reduce the need for prolonged support. Until a more rigid definition is available, preferably supported by a controlled trial, differences in the reported incidence of post-operative central anticholinergic syndrome seem likely to continue.

      "abstract": "We have pointed out that one defensive adjustment of POW's to stress is withdrawal. If the stresses are not too severe the person will withdraw physically if possible, or in any case will refuse to allow himself to become involved with the environment to as great an extent as possible. Certain kinds of overt behavior will be inhibited and most emotional responses will be suppressed. If the environment is severely stressful and physically depriving as well, the individual may regress into a more complete withdrawal and adopt a maladaptive state of dependency in which he ceases to take care of himself even to the point of death. We have labelled this type of defense \"apathy\" and distinguish it from states like catatonic stupor, or depression. \"Apathy\" appears not to be a single absolute reaction, but a syndrome which can vary markedly in degree. One major symptom in the syndrome is reduced or modulated affect, but only in extreme cases can one speak of true apathy or affectlessness. Other symptoms are listlessness, uncommunicativeness, lack of spontaneity, indifference, slowed reactions, lack of enthusiasm, and lack of initiative. It is important to note that underlying the overt lack of emotional spontaneity may lie great quantities of pent-up feelings, and that these will continue to be a problem to the individual when he is no longer in the environment that produced the \"apathy syndrome.\" The apathy syndrome serves to maintain personality integration in the face of severe reality and psychological stresses.",

Symptoms of grief include physical and psychological changes including body aches, anxiety, and emotional pain. Grief has been conceptualized both as a series of stages or phases and as a period of meaning‐making. Furthermore, a variety of factors related to characteristics of the griever, the nature of the loss, and available support may influence grief processes and health outcomes. When grief becomes particularly distressing or prolonged, individuals can experience complicated grief, which is tied to more negative grief outcomes. Individuals with stronger support networks may experience improved health effects during bereavement.",

The development of specific phobias may result from the pairing of a specific object or situation with the emotion of fear. Flowers are usually perceived as pleasant stimulus, producing a relaxing effect on our mind and body, but here we present a rare case, wherein flowers are perceived as a malevolent stimulus and producing phobic anxiety in an eleven-year old boy, leading to avoidance behaviors and much interference in normal functioning. He was diagnosed to have Specific Phobia of natural environment type with Somnambulism and treated with SSRI (escitalopram) and Behavior Therapy (systematic desensitization).

      "title": "Subthalamic stimulation in Parkinson’s disease: restoring the balance of motivated behaviours",
      "abstract": "Addictions to dopaminergic drugs or to pleasant behaviours are frequent and potentially devastating neuropsychiatric disorders observed in Parkinson's disease. They encompass impulse control disorders, punding and dopamine dysregulation syndrome. A relationship with dopaminergic treatment is strongly suggested. Subthalamic stimulation improves motor complications and allows for drastic reductions in medication. This treatment might, therefore, be considered for patients with behavioural addictions, when attempts to reduce dopaminergic medication have failed. However, conflicting data have reported suppression, alleviation, worsening or new onset of behavioural addictions after subthalamic stimulation. Non-motor fluctuations are also a disabling feature of the disease. We prospectively investigated behaviour in a cohort of 63 patients with Parkinson's disease, before and 1 year after subthalamic stimulation using the Ardouin scale, with systematic evaluation of functioning in overall appetitive or apathetic modes, non-motor fluctuations, dopaminergic dysregulation syndrome, as well as behavioural addictions (including impulse control disorders and punding) and compulsive use of dopaminergic medication. Defined drug management included immediate postoperative discontinuation of dopamine agonists and reduction in levodopa. Motor and cognitive statuses were controlled (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, frontal score). After surgery, the OFF medication motor score improved (−45.2%), allowing for a 73% reduction in dopaminergic treatment, while overall cognitive evaluation was unchanged. Preoperative dopamine dysregulation syndrome had disappeared in 4/4, behavioural addictions in 17/17 and compulsive dopaminergic medication use in 9/9 patients. New onset of levodopa abuse occurred in one patient with surgical failure. Non-motor fluctuations were significantly reduced with improvements in off-dysphoria (P ≤ 0.001) and reduction in on-euphoria (P ≤ 0.001). There was an inversion in the number of patients functioning in an overall appetitive mode (29 before versus 2 after surgery, P ≤ 0.0001) to an overall apathetic mode (3 before versus 13 after surgery, P < 0.05). Two patients attempted suicide. Improvement in motor fluctuations is linked to the direct effect of stimulation on the sensory-motor subthalamic territory, while improvement in dyskinesias is mainly explained by an indirect effect related to the decrease in dopaminergic drugs. Our data suggest that non-motor fluctuations could similarly be directly alleviated through stimulation of the non-motor subthalamic territories, and hyperdopaminergic side effects might improve mainly due to the decrease in dopaminergic medication. We show an overall improvement in neuropsychiatric symptomatology and propose that disabling non-motor fluctuations, dopaminergic treatment abuse and drug-induced behavioural addictions in Parkinson's disease may be considered as new indications for subthalamic stimulation.",

      "abstract": "Patients with the combination of cannabis abuse and psychosis are difficult to treat. The intoxicated state has many similarities to schizophrenia. Like other drugs with abuse potential cannabis affects the brain's reward system. It has not been possible to show major structural changes in the cerebrum, but by electron microscopy structural changes can be shown in animals especially in the hippocampus. The drug is taken in order to escape reality, and a vicious circle tending to maintain the person's abuse pattern which includes reduced energy, judgment and memory may be established. Cannabis may cause toxic psychosis, with a tendency to recurrent psychoses with continued abuse. There is no convincing support for the assumption that cannabis can cause chronic functional psychosis following cessation of abuse. Schizophrenic patients who use cannabis are often trying to reduce the discomfort caused by symptoms in the prodromal phase. By continued abuse positive psychotic symptoms are worsened. Antidepressant drugs may diminish the depressive elements of the disease. Some cannabis users are especially sensitive and develop toxic psychosis. Patients with repeated toxic psychosis may erroneously be diagnosed as schizophrenics. It is therefore important to be aware that a psychotic state may be caused by abuse of cannabis, and adjust treatment to this fact.",

      "abstract": "Abstract MDMA, methamphetamine, GHB, and ketamine are all capable of producing acute adverse psychological experiences in normal users and exacerbating symptoms in those with underlying psychological disorders. They also to varying degrees pose the risk of long-term neuropsychiatric consequences. Although dependent patterns of use are not commonly seen with this group of drugs, methamphetamines certainly can result in the very rapid development of severe dependence. Most acute presentations are typically short-lived and self-limiting and are only very rarely life-threatening. The precipitation of an underlying psychiatric disorder or an exacerbation of premorbid traits may well be one of the longer term consequences of heavy use of these drugs. In those who present with acute drug-related psychological symptoms there should be an emphasis on follow-up since in some cases the symptoms will represent the onset of a persistent independent disorder which requires treatment. Users who have experienced acute psychological problems should be encouraged to make the attribution that there may be something inherent in them that makes them susceptible to experiencing the unpleasant reactions with a drug and that they are likely to remain vulnerable to those adverse experiences. This may be difficult to accept for potentially vulnerable young people who may prefer to think that the experience was not enjoyable because the drugs were not good – ‘it was a bad pill’.",

      "title": "Some implications of conditioning theory for problems of drug abuse",
      "abstract": "Viewing the development of drug cults as a conditioning process, examples are given of specific effects of alcohol, barbiturates, opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, marihuana, LSD and other psychotomimetic drugs that can reinforce continued use of the drug in question through facilitation of specific patterns of behavior that serve to gratify specific biological and socio-culturally generated human needs. It is hypothesized that, through repeated temporal contiguity between such primary reinforcement and the performance of rituals prescribed by those who are already members of the drug cult, novitiates eventually learn to perceive the magical drug-effects defined by the cult and to experience them even without benefit of the drug when the rituals are performed (secondary reinforcement), thereby becoming a new, full-fledged member of the cult. It is suggested that the maintenance of secondarily reinforced behavior in the absence of further programmed reinforcement by the drug is a consequence of previous classical conditioning of primary drug effects and possibly, of interoceptive conditioning. Some therapeutic applications of conditioning theory are indicated, with special reference to the possible use of specific drug antagonists to facilitate extinction of drug-seeking behavior. Expansion of basic psychopharmacological research as well as of educational and social ameliorative efforts are stressed as desiderata for eventual control of the problem of drug abuse.",

Furthermore, in laboratory studies pramipexole has proved to exert neuroprotector effects and its use in clinical practice from the early stages of the disease has been related to a delay in the appearance of motor complications (fluctuations and dyskinesias). It has recently been shown that it is especially valuable in the treatment of tremors and is also effective in improving certain non-motor symptoms such as depression. Pramipexole is free of the severe side effects (fibrosis and valve disease) linked with ergotic dopaminergic agonists and causes fewer digestive and dysautonomic alterations. Other undesirable side effects of treatment with non-ergotic agonists, such as hallucinations, the appearance of oedemas and drowsiness, can be minimised by carefully selecting the patients. Further studies need to be conducted to help define the long-term effects of dopaminergic agonists on the progress of the disease and also to show the differences between non-ergotic agonists in clinical practice.",

Although PBD has biological underpinnings, cognitive, behavioral, and environmental stressors can trigger or exacerbate depressive and manic symptoms.

Despite there are a number of commercialized dopaminergic agonists that are currently being used successfully in the first stages of the disease, they often fail to provide sustained clinical benefit for a long period due to the appearance of side-effects such as augmentation, sleepiness, nausea, hypothension, and compulsive behaviors among others. New dopaminergic agonists with less side effects are being developed. These novel compounds offer an alternative when the disease progresses and patients fail to respond to standard dopaminergic treatments or side-effects increased. Chemistry, and in particular chemical synthesis, has played a major role in bringing synthetic dopaminergic agonists to the clinic and continues to be crucial for the development of new and necessary drugs for long-term treatments with less undesired side effects. A number of structural modifications of parent compounds have led to enhanced agonism but also partial agonism or even antagonism of one or more dopamine receptors. In some cases, these activities are accompanied by agonist effect at serotonin receptors which suggests a potential clinical application in the treatment of schizophrenia In this review, chemical synthesis of dopaminergic agents, their affinity, and the corresponding agonist/antagonist effects will be highlighted.

      "title": "Atypical presentation of domperidone-induced galactorrhea",
      "abstract": "Sir, Domperidone is a dopamine (D2) receptor antagonist and is regularly prescribed to treat dyspeptic symptoms.[1] In women who have not been nursed for a year, milky breast discharge is defined as galactorrhea, which is one of the side effects of domperidone. Other side effects of domperidone include xerostomia, loose stools, headache, rashes, abdominal cramps, and constipation.[2,3] Galactorrhea might be due to surplus prolactin release or enhanced prolactin sensitivity within the breast tissue. Prolactin rise is the most common cause and is often linked to menstrual irregularities.[4] Galactorrhea may be a sign of a range of disorders which include chest wall ailments, medications, or pathological issues such as pituitary tumors and can also occur with breast wall stimulation. Medications which function by preventing D2 receptors or lessening dopamine production such as drugs used in the treatment of depression, psychosis, acid peptic disease, and hypertension, and medications with estrogen and some analgesics can lessen the inhibition of pituitary by the hypothalamus, leading to a rise in the prolactin secretion, which can result in galactorrhea.[5] Domperidone-induced euprolactinemic galactorrhea is exceptionally unusual. We report the case of a female patient with euprolactinemic galactorrhea who was prescribed a combination of domperidone and pantoprazole for upper gastrointestinal symptoms. A healthy 30-year-old multiparous woman with no comorbidities presented with chief complaints of bilateral galactorrhea for a 1-week duration. She had no menstrual irregularities, and her last menstrual period was 10 days before the presentation. She was on domperidone and pantoprazole combination therapy for the past 1 week which was prescribed by a general physician for dyspeptic symptoms. She developed galactorrhea 4 days following the drug intake. There was no history of using other drugs such as contraceptive pills, antidepressants, antituberculosis drugs, antipsychotics, or antihypertensives. She did not have any visual disturbances or symptoms indicative of raised intracranial pressure. On examination, bilateral breast tenderness was present along with milk secretion from both breasts. Serum prolactin was normal (17 ng/ml) and thyroid function tests were normal (total t3:139.4ng/dl, total t4:8.76 μg/dl, and thyroid-stimulating hormone: 3.16 mIU/L). We assumed domperidone to be the probable cause for her galactorrhea; hence, the drug was stopped immediately. Galactorrhea resolved completely within 1 week of stopping the drug and she is on regular follow-up. Using the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale, the case causality was evaluated. The Naranjo Adverse Drug Scale result was 7, indicating a \"probable\" link between reactions with the drug. Medication-induced galactorrhea may be confirmed by stopping the medication for 3 days or more and by reassessing the levels of prolactin.[5] It should be noted, however, that levels of prolactin would not return to normal within 3 days in some patients and may require a week or more to normalize. Antipsychotic medications such as quetiapine, imipramine, escitalopram, risperidone, and fluvoxamine have been reported to be linked to euprolactinemic galactorrheas.[4] Thyrotropin-releasing hormone hyperresponsiveness has been proposed as an etiologic cause for euprolactinemic galactorrhea. Although our patient's thyroid function tests were normal, thyrotropin-releasing hormone sensitivity should have been done for more information. Despite the fact that domperidone-induced hyperprolactinemic galactorrhea has been described in prior reports; this instance seems to be an unusual manifestation of the side effects of the drug.

      "title": "[Psychological stress and sudden death].",
      "abstract": "Recent studies provide relevant evidence that psychological stress significantly influences the pathogenesis of sudden cardiac death. Psychological stress expresses a situation of imbalance, derived from a real or perceived disparity between environmental demands and the individual's ability to cope with these demands. A situation of psychological stress may include different components: personality factors and character traits, anxiety and depression, social isolation and acute or chronic adverse life events. In particular, it has been documented that a sudden extremely hard event, such as an earthquake or a war strike, can significantly increase the incidence of sudden death. Nevertheless, each one of these factors, if not present, can balance a partially unfavorable situation; this overview suggests a multifactorial situation where almost all elements are present and in which the relative influence of each one varies according to the individual examined. Sudden death occurs when a transient disruption (such as acute myocardial ischemia, platelet activation or neuroendocrine variations), occurring in a patient with a diseased myocardium (such as one with a post-necrotic scar or hypertrophy), triggers a malignant arrhythmia. Psychological stress acts at both levels: by means of a \"chronic\" action it contributes to create the myocardial background, while by means of an acute action it can create the transient trigger precipitating sudden death. In the chronic action two possible mechanisms can be detected: the first is a direct interaction, which contributes to cause a hypertension status or to exacerbate coronary atherosclerosis consequent to endothelial dysfunction; the second one acts through adverse health behaviors, such as a poor diet, alcohol consumption or smoking. In case of acute psychological stress, the mechanisms involved are mainly the ability to trigger myocardial ischemia, to promote arrhythmogenesis, to stimulate platelet function, and to increase blood viscosity. Finally, some individuals have a sympathetic nervous system hyper-responsitivity, manifesting as exaggerated heart rate and blood pressure responses which result in accelerated atherosclerosis.",

      "abstract": "Dementia and depression are common disorders in old age. Dementia typically manifests itself as a neurodegenerative disease that affects cognitive functions such as memory, orientation and speech. Dementia is common in old age and its frequency increases from 1% in 65 year olds up to 50% beyond 90 years. Depression usually appears as an episodic disease which extends in length from a few weeks up to many years. The core symptoms of depression include depressed mood, loss of interests and pleasure and loss of will to live. Cognitive disorders may accompany depression and are considered separate from dementia, and were thus named pseudo-dementia, presuming that these cognitive disorders will disappear as the depressed mood will remit. Lately it has been documented that depression may precede dementia, particularly in Alzheimer's disease. Although correlation never proves causation we discuss three possibilities, not mutually exclusive: 1) Certain brain changes may manifest first as depression and later as dementia. 2) Depression and dementia have partially overlapping biological causes. 3) Certain biological changes associated with depression may lead to dementia. Dementia and depression show many common biologic features such as white matter changes in the brain, reduction of hippocampus volume, changes in the serotonergic and noradrenalinergic systems and abnormalities in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.",

      "abstract": "There is increasing evidence to challenge the traditional view that the initiation of drug treatment in Parkinson's disease (PD) should be delayed until the patient has significant disability such as to affect work or social function. Firstly, to delay treatment sentences the patient to protracted impairment of quality of life that could be improved by therapy. Secondly, there is evidence to support the notion that earlier rather than later initiation of treatment leads to better long term motor benefit. The selection of which drug to begin must be tailored to the patient's individual characteristics and circumstances. Monoamine oxidase B inhibitors result in a mild improvement in motor function compared to dopamine agonists or levodopa. They are well tolerated, easy to use once a day drugs and there is evidence that early use of Rasagiline improves motor outcome. Dopamine agonists lead to a substantial improvement in motor function and are, or will shortly be, available as once a day drugs. They are generally well tolerated but can be associated with exacerbating confusion or hallucinations and with behavioral changes. Levodopa is the most potent of the dopaminergic drugs. It is routinely combined with a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor and can also be used with a catecholo-o-methyl transferase inhibitor for enhanced absorption. The most important limiting factor for the use of levodopa is the emergence of motor complications. These are related to a number of factors including the dose of levodopa and the duration of its use.",

Caffeine is an adenosine antagonist. An antagonist of adenosine can lead to the release of dopamine into the synaptic cleft, which can induce psychotic symptoms in vulnerable individuals. The patient had consumed caffeine in the form of up to eight energy drinks daily. She experienced persecutory delusions alongside auditory and visual hallucinations. She did not have a history of psychotic disorder but did have a history of generalized anxiety disorder. Upon cessation of caffeine, her symptoms resolved within five days. She remained caffeine-free and symptom-free 18 months later when reviewed in the community. This case highlights the potential psychiatric consequences of excessive caffeine consumption and identifies the need to screen for excessive consumption of caffeine in individuals presenting with new psychotic symptoms or worsening of pre-existing psychotic symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Chronic diseases often require long-lasting pharmacotherapy. Administration of some medicines on a daily routine may cause troublesome adverse effects thus discouraging the patient from further treatment. An abrupt withdrawal of formerly continuous pharmacotherapy not proceeded by the professional medical consultation may endanger the patient either due to the relapse of the disease or the onset of withdrawal symptoms that, despite some opinions, are not limited only to potentially addictive medications. These symptoms may be mistaken for a clinical manifestation of a yet another medical condition of the ill leading to a vicious cycle of repeated diagnostics – additional pharmacotherapy – discontinuation of treatment due to drug intolerance – novel symptoms – repeated diagnostics etc., especially in the elderly. Unfortunately, even some medical doctors tend to forget that administration of specific drugs should not be stopped suddenly because certain withdrawal symptoms are more harmful than mild drug-induced adverse reactions. On the other hand, this is the clinician’s individual decision whether to stop or to continue the treatment in the presence of drug intolerance reported by the patient as many “practical” guidelines either do not give any recommendations or the statements are too general to be helpful in every-day practice. Therefore, the authors review the data on the causative factors and clinical implications of a sudden drug withdrawal, including mainly stricte non-addictive medicines in use for diseases of high incidence in general population.",

      "title": "Modern Treatment of Status Epilepticus in Adults",
      "abstract": "Status epilepticus is a serious epileptic condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It can be divided into four stages: developing (seizures leading up to status epilepticus), established (>5 minutes convulsive status epilepticus, nonconvulsive/focal status epilepticus >10 min), refractory (failure of two adequately dosed antiseizure medications in different drug classes), and super-refractory (persisting despite >24 hours of anesthesia). All seizure types can develop to status epilepticus. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus has the largest potential for brain damage. The drug treatment algorithms for status epilepticus generally go through three stages, starting with benzodiazepines: lorazepam, midazolam, or diazepam as first line drugs, moving to levetiracetam, valproate or fos-phenytoin as second-line drugs, ending, if necessary, with anesthetics like propofol or midazolam. Lacosamide, topiramate, phenobarbital, brivaracetam, and perampanel are potential alternatives, and pentobarbital is commonly used when long-term anesthesia is needed. Super refractory status epilepticus is the form that usually causes the most concern. Treatment guidelines for newer treatment alternatives are often based only on case reports and small patient series. Such alternatives include ketamine, immunotherapy, ketogenic diet, inhalation anesthetics and hypothermia, and several surgical neurostimulation procedures. This chapter provides an overview of current treatment alternatives, with particular focus on refractory status epilepticus and super-refractory status epilepticus.",

      "title": "Striatum, Dopamine and Automatism in Cocaine Addiction and Relapse : Pharmacological and Behavioral Investigation",
      "abstract": "For many, drug taking may continue on an occasional basis for a long time; however, some individuals lose control of their drug use and are unable to stop. The transition from casual use to addiction is accompanied by drug-induced changes in the brain, followed by associated changes in behavioral functions. One of the most problematic aspects of addiction is the enduring vulnerability to relapse that persists even long after withdrawal symptoms have abated. Rodent models of drug self-administration (SA) show that re-exposure to the drug itself, drug associated cues or stress are major triggers of relapse. While different classes of drugs vary in their primary pharmacological mechanisms, they all share an acute effect of raising dopamine (DA) levels in the striatum. Following repeated use, the addictive properties of psychostimulants such as cocaine (COC) are believed to take place through the induction of neuroadaptations within the mesocorticolimbic DA system.The striatum is a major target of the DA system, where DA acts on two families of metabotropic receptors (D1-like or D2-like) that are segregated into two pathways of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and have different roles in addiction and relapse. For instance, while systemic D2 receptor (D2R) stimulation induces reinstatement of COC seeking in rats, D1 receptor (D1R) stimulation does not. DA signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) responds to rewarding and aversive stimuli; in turn, the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) plays a key role in the transition to compulsive use, and the habitual aspects of drug-seeking after prolonged drug SA. Despite several works examining their role in relapse, the results remain somewhat unclear. Given their critical but differential involvement in COC seeking, here we investigated the role of D1R and D2R receptors of the NAcc and DLS in relapse, employing pharmacological manipulations, as well as assessing their protein expression using an animal model of COC SA. Our results showed a double dissociation between the actions of both DA receptors (DARs) in the striatum. Pharmacological activation of the D1R, but not D2R of the NAcc induces reinstatement of COC seeking, whereas the same effect is triggered by the activation of D2R, but not D1R of the DLS. Also, the reinstating effects of the systemic D2R stimulation is blocked by D1R or D2R antagonists injected into the NAcc or D1R antagonist into the DLS, while being blunted by the D2R inhibition in the DLS. These results convey an interaction between both receptor subtypes, likely relying on ascending spiraling connections associating the ventral and the dorsal striatum through midbrain-reaching loops. Finally, we found the reinstatement of COC seeking elicited by D1R or D2R agonists in either region is not due to changes in DAr expression.These results enticed us to examine the behavioral mechanisms underpinning reinstating behavior. Though initially goal-directed, COC seeking is argued to become habitual after extended training. This progression is believed to initially elicit functional changes within the NAcc, and gradually hijack the circuitry of the dorsal striatum. The activation of D1R in the NAcc and D2R in the DLS has been associated with the processing of rewarding properties and habitual responding for drugs, respectively. Therefore, we aimed to assess whether the reinstatement of COC seeking triggered by the D2R stimulation within the DLS would involve incentive motivational or reinforcing processes likely underlying those induced by the D1R stimulation within the NAcc. Also, we aimed to assess whether the D1R stimulation within the NAcc involves the overtaking of the behavioral control by habitual stimulus-response mechanisms which may be involved in the reinstatement of drug-seeking after the D2R stimulation in the DLS.",

Several classes of drugs, including benzodiazepines, azapirones, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, antihistamines, alpha(2)delta Ca++ channel modulators, and atypical antipsychotics are consistently beneficial in patients with GAD. Cognitive therapy is also effective as a first-line treatment. When individualizing treatment, drug dose ranges and side effect profiles need to be considered, as well as the patient's comorbid conditions. Doses may need to be reduced for elderly or medically ill patients or those taking other medications. Doses may need to be increased for refractory cases. Common comorbid conditions with GAD include depression, alcohol or drug abuse, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. In patients with significant depression, an antidepressant is more likely to succeed than a benzodiazepine. Generalized anxiety disorder is a chronic illness that requires long-term treatment. Remission is attainable but can take several months, and stopping medication increases the risk of relapse within the first year of initiating treatment.",

      "title": "Anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive–compulsive disorder",
      "abstract": "Anxiety symptoms and disorders are common in community settings and primary and secondary care. Symptoms can be mild and transient, but many people are troubled by severe symptoms causing great personal distress and impairing social and occupational function. The societal burden from anxiety disorders is considerable, but many who might benefit from treatment are not recognized or treated. Recognition relies on keen awareness of the psychological and physical symptoms of all anxiety disorders, and accurate diagnosis on identification of the specific features of particular disorders. Need for treatment is determined by the severity and persistence of symptoms, level of associated disability, impact on everyday life, presence of coexisting depressive symptoms and other features such as good response to or poor tolerability of previous treatments. Choice of treatment is influenced by patient characteristics and patient and doctor preferences. There is much overlap between different anxiety disorders in evidence-based and effective therapies (e.g. prescription of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or course of cognitive behavioural therapy), but there are important differences. It thus helps to become familiar with the characteristic features and evidence base for each disorder.",

Através de los últimos años se ha comprobado que ciertos individuos son más sensibles a desarrollar una conducta adictiva hacia objetos actividades o personas o un mismo individuo puede desarrollar unas conductas adictivas y a la vez una adicción a drogas. En cambio otras pueden desarrollar con mayor facilidad una conducta adictiva a las actividades, a las máquinas u objetos o a las personas de manera exclusiva, permanente y/o sucesiva, a la cual se le denomina personalidad adictógena. Una de estas patologías es la conducta adictiva al juego llamada también ludopatía y es la que desarrollaremos en este trabajo. Se presentan las características clínicas del trastorno, las diferentes etapas del proceso adictivo, incidiendo en los mecanismos cognitivos. Se propone una clasificación del adicto al juego. AbstractThe addicionology field is more extensive these days than many years ago because it comes up pathology some at chemical substance addiction but there aren't a psychoactive substance in use, this pathology is calling for the specialists \"addictive behaviors\" or none conventional addictions. Through the years in clinical and hospitals we can see that some people are more sensitive to develop an addictive behavior besides a chemical addiction, and others can develop easily an addiction to the activities, machines, objects or persons of exclusive permanent and successive way. One of this interesting and complexity pathology is the gambler addictive behavior, calling also ludopatia and the following are the clinical profile. Characteristics of gambling are presented, the stages of the addictive process, especially on cognitive mechanisms. A classification of gambler is presented.",

      "title": "When and How to Investigate the Patient with Headache",
      "abstract": "The common complaint of headache usually has a benign cause, most often a primary headache syndrome. The history and neurologic and general physical examinations usually permit a definitive diagnosis. When in doubt, diagnostic testing is indicated. Certain historical and examination findings increase the likelihood of a secondary headache disorder and the need for diagnostic testing. These include (1) recent head or neck injury; (2) a new, worse, worsening, or abrupt onset headache; (3) headache brought on by Valsalva maneuver or cough; (4) headache brought on by exertion; (5) headache associated with sexual activity; (6) pregnancy; (7) headache in the patient over the age of ~50; (8) neurologic findings and/or symptoms; (9) systemic signs and/or symptoms; (10) secondary risk factors, such as cancer or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Less worrisome are headaches that wake the patient from sleep at night, always occur on the same side, or show a prominent effect of change in posture on the patient's pain. Diagnostic studies include neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, and blood tests, which are selected depending on the patient's history and findings. For most patients, the diagnostic test of choice is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain is usually obtained in the setting of trauma or the abrupt onset of headache. CSF examination is useful in diagnosing subarachnoid bleeding, infection, and high and low CSF pressure syndromes.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome that is often associated with psychiatric, neurological and/or medical conditions. In order to make a diagnosis of catatonia, the clinical picture must be dominated by three or more of the following symptoms; cataplexy, waxy flexibility, stupor, agitation, mutism, negativism, posturing, mannerisms, stereotypies, grimacing, echolalia, and echopraxia. We present a case of a 58-year-old female with no prior psychiatric history who presented to the psychiatric emergency room with a three-week history of feeling depressed, anhedonic, hopeless, helpless, and worthless, associated with poor sleep, poor concentration, low energy, significant weight loss due to lack of appetite, and suicidal ideations after she saw her ex-boyfriend holding hands with another woman. Patient exhibited symptoms such as mutism, hyperextension of spine, clinching of jaw, psychomotor retardation which suggested probable diagnosis of catatonia at the background of major depressive disorder nonresponding to treatment. This case report demonstrates the need for a high index of suspicion and early screening for catatonia in psychiatric patients given the high morbidity and mortality that is associated with this condition if delayed or undiagnosed",

One problem with the monoamine hypothesis is that the timing of antidepressant effects on neurotransmitters is generallyfaster (within minutes) than the timing of the antidepressant effects on mood (reaching maximal effect in days to weeks). One theory toexplain the ultimate mechanism of delayed therapeutic action of antidepressants is the \"neurotransmitter receptor hypothesis of antidepressant action,\" which proposes that antidepressants, no matter what their initial actions on receptors and enzymes, eventually cause a desensitization or \"down-regulation\" of key neurotransmitter receptors in a time course consistent with the delayed onset ofantidepressant action of these drugs.",

Spectroscopic magnetic resonance has found some signs of neuronal injury and glial proliferation, predominantly in frontal lobes. Functional neuroimage techniques have found defects in blood brain perfusion, that can be persistent during some months, after detoxification, and that have been associated to the presence of cognitive impairment and other neuropsychological disturbances. Furthermore a reduction in dopaminergic receptor D2 density has been fond in the cerebral cortex and a decrease in the binding to the dopamine transporter, in basal ganglia and thalamus, might be related to a hipodopaminergic state of the brain, due to chronic cocaine abuse. Cognitive and mood symptoms, and behavioral disturbances shown by cocaine abusers, while in a recovery therapeutic program, can be related to brain organic disturbances, induced by cocaine, and can increase the early relapse risk.",

This apparent lack of response is either due to \"pseudo-resistance\" (a failure to have received and adhered to a recognized and effective treatment or treatments for their condition) or to true \"treatment resistance.\" Pseudo-resistance can be due to clinician errors in selecting and delivering an appropriate treatment effectively, or to patient nonadherence to a course of treatment. True treatment resistance can be due to unrecognized exogenous anxiogenic factors (eg, caffeine overuse, sleep deprivation, use of alcohol or marijuana) or an incorrect diagnosis (eg, atypical bipolar illness, occult substance abuse, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder).

In addition, 30-40% of adults report complaints about sleep quality lifetime, and10-15% report chronic insomniaBenzodiazepines (BZDs) are commonly prescribed to treat insomnia and sleep disorders. BZDs show a rapid sedative and anxiolytic effect, successfully used in the acute treatment of insomnia as well as anxiety, agitation, or anxiety associated with any type of psychiatric disorder. Their use is associated with potential side effects such as residual daytime sleepiness, ataxia, and dizziness. Long-term BZDs use may lead to drug abuse, tolerance, drug dependency, and abstinence. For instance, BZDs abrupt withdrawal can lead to severe symptoms such as insomnia and/or rebound anxiety, an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, nausea and/or vomiting, sweating, diarrhea, convulsions, and other neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Objectives This e-poster aimed to summarize evidence regarding the effect of BZDs treatment on human Sleep Architecture. Methods A bibliopgraphical review was performed using PubMed platform. All relevant articles were found using the keywords: benzodiazepines, sleep architecture, insomnia. Results Prolonged use of benzodiazepines leads to an increase of time spent in stages 2 and a decrease of time in stages 1, 3, and 4. The increased NREM stage 2 is associated with a subjective improvement in sleep quality. The decrease in NREM sleep time in stages 3 and 4 is usually associated with lesser “rest” for the brain, which leads to a lack of concentration. Conclusions BZDs use modified sleep architecture in the short and long term. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "title": "Hypoactive Delirium Caused by Pulmonary Embolus in an Elderly Adult",
      "abstract": "Delirium is frequently observed in individuals aged 65 and older (10–30%).1 Delirium has an acute onset—within hours to days—and exhibits a fluctuating course. Delirium is characterized by distorted attention, reduced awareness of the environment, alteration in at least one cognitive area (disturbed memory, orientation, language, perception), and change in sleep cycles.2 Because of the wide range of clinical presentation, clinicians often do not identify or misdiagnose cases of delirium individuals; hypoactive delirium presenting with lethargy, confusion, and indifference to the environment is the most difficult to diagnose subtype, despite being the most commonly occurring type in elderly adults.3 An 87-year-old woman was brought to the geriatric department because of forgetfulness (not recognizing her children), being introverted, distractibility, indifference to the environment, lack of appetite, refusal to take medications, and hallucinations such as seeing her deceased husband in the room for the previous 2 days. She had no known cognitive deficiency. Physical examination showed a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a body temperature of 37.4°C. All systemic examinations were normal. Assessment of mental condition revealed cognitive and perception problems with disturbances of memory and orientation. Psychomotor activity was found to be poor, and she gave short answers to questions during the interview and refused to talk. Based on these clinical findings and symptoms, the newly developed clinical picture was thought to be hypoactive delirium, and she was admitted to the geriatric service. Examination immediately after admission revealed a sinus rhythm electrocardiogram with no pathological characteristics. She had leukocytosis (13,000/μL). Biochemistry showed normal liver, thyroid, and kidney functions, with no electrolyte imbalance. Urinalysis showed no evidence of infection. No pneumonic consolidation or effusion was detected on chest X-ray. Brain tomography ordered to exclude cranial pathology due to acute mental alteration revealed no pathological findings. Sedimentation was 90 mm/h (normal <15 mm/h), C-reactive protein was 115 mg/L (normal 0.1–8.2 mg/L), and lumbar puncture performed to exclude aseptic meningitis and encephalitis was normal. On the fifth day, she was persistently encouraged to mobilize because she did not want to get out of bed and wished to sleep continuously, but she developed exertional dyspnea and syncope. D-dimer was 13,115 mg/L (normal 0–0.5 mg/L), so thoracic tomography was ordered. Filling defects at the main and segmental branches of the pulmonary arteries consistent with embolus were observed on both sides, being more prominent on the right side, and minimal pleural effusion was observed on the left side (Figure 1). Lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasonography findings were consistent with subacute deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity. She was started on 1 mg/kg of enoxaparin sodium twice daily, with the addition of warfarin on the third day. On the fifth day of anticoagulation therapy, the delirium was completely resolved, and she was discharged. During outpatient follow-up, warfarin treatment was regulated to maintain an international normalized ratio level of 2.5–3.5, and she developed no new delirium. Delirium is associated with poor functional capacity, likelihood of admission to a nursing home, mortality, morbidity, and admission to the hospital.4, 5 Hypoactive delirium is the most commonly encountered subtype in elderly adults. Unlike the other subtypes, individuals behave as if they are sedated and do not harm themselves or others; as a consequence, clinicians often do not identify such individuals or misdiagnose them with depression or dementia. Simple conditions such as untreated urinary system infection, constipation, and pain may cause delirium in elderly adults, although life-threatening conditions such as myocardial infarction and stroke can also cause it.6 Pulmonary embolus (PE) may not always cause typical symptoms as dyspnea; it is asymptomatic (32% of cases) or may present with atypical symptoms as acute confusion, chest and back pain, and syncope.7 Rarely, one of the atypical clinical presentations of PE may be delirium, as mentioned in this case report, and PE should be investigated in elderly adults presenting with delirium, even in the absence of typical symptoms. In conclusion, while assessing the etiology of delirium, clinicians should remember that one of the acute conditions leading to development of delirium is PE, particularly in elderly adults.

The syndrome manifests itself in the form of a tetralogy composed of extrapyramidal symptoms, a change in the level of conciousness, elevated body temperature and autonomic instability. It is also associated with secondary laboratory findings such as increased creatine kinase and leucocyte count. Treatment includes stopping the neuroleptic drugs, application of dopaminagonists, benzodiazepines and fluid replacement. If the patient, after an episode of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, has a psychotic relapse, neuroleptica can be recommended after a break of one to four weeks.

En la consulta del medico de cabecera el paciente tiende a negar o minimizar tales alteraciones, centrando sus quejas en una dificultad motora que le llega a incapacitar para la ejecucion de sus tareas habituales. En la exploracion neurologica dirigida, el paciente esta consciente, orientado y alerta. Lenguaje parco, de comprension y nominacion preservadas.

      "abstract": "Research supports anecdotal evidence that eating disorders often initially develop in conjunction with adolescent transitions, but evidence is growing that other transitions, including menopause, can also trigger these disorders. Over the course of more than three decades of working with and supervising therapists working with individuals with a wide range of eating-related symptoms, including anorexia, bulimia, compulsive overeating, binge eating, avoidant/restrictive eating, and other variations, I have often seen that even small changes can also trigger the behaviors. For example, a number of clients report that they binge on Sunday nights as they start thinking about going back to work the next day. Visits to family (not necessarily a small transition, of course) are also frequent triggers.This article will address some of the possible interplay between unmanageable and/or unformulated affects, on the one hand, and shifts in an individual's sense of self, on the other, which can occur in the course of a transition. Clinical material from my long-term, two-part work with a client who developed symptoms in adolescence and had a recurrence during COVID will illustrate some of these complex interactions and some of the ways that an integrative, psychodynamically-oriented framework can be used to work with these issues.",

However, a few case reports have described neuropsychiatric symptoms following PPI use. In this report, we present a case of visual hallucinations secondary to PPI usage and propose possible mechanisms. In this case, a 65-year-old man with no psychiatric history developed acute visual hallucinations following initiation of omeprazole, in the absence of delusions, paranoia, and other psychotic symptoms. The visual hallucinations began after the patient started treatment with omeprazole and resolved almost immediately upon discontinuation of omeprazole. To treat symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease, omeprazole was replaced with famotidine, and the visual hallucinations did not recur after the omeprazole had been discontinued. No other psychotic signs or symptoms were present in this patient throughout the duration of his hospitalization. Although the scientific literature provides limited information on psychosis related to PPI use, a growing number of case reports and studies in recent years have suggested that neuropsychiatric symptoms may occur after PPI use. It is our hope that this case report adds to the scientific and medical knowledge in this area.",

The commonest illicit drug is cannabis. Others include lysergide (LSD), which like cannabis is obtained wholly from unlawful sources. Amphetamines (and other central nervous stimulants) and barbiturates (and other central nervous de pressants) are also taken illicitly though their source originally may have been legitimate for example, they may have been stolen from pharmacies or overprescribed by doctors. Finally, opiates may find their way on to the black market from diversion of prescribed drugs on the one hand to smuggling of Chinese heroin on the other.",

So far, SCZ treatment mainly includes medication, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), psychotherapy, and rTMS treatment.",

      "abstract": "Relapse is a major characteristic of drug addiction disorders and remains the primary problem for treatment. Recently, there has been hope that these disorders may be amenable to pharmacological treatments that have successfully treated other psychopathological disorders. Pharmacological approaches to drug abuse have tended to be guided by the primary drug used by the individual, though substitution has been the guiding principle in some instances, as in the case of methadone maintenance in opioid addiction. Alternatively, blockade or antagonism of the effects of the primary drug being abused has been tried, as in the case of using naltrexone to treat opioid or alcohol addiction. Though reportedly successful in some populations, it is not clear that these approaches effectively control craving for ‘highs’ or euphoric experiences or a return to drug use as a response to stressful life experiences. Recent experimental studies of the factors that induce craving and relapse to drug use in both humans and laboratory animals, such as drug‐related cues, re‐exposure to the drug itself, or exposure to stressful events, have shown that the effects of these different events are mediated by dissociable neurochemical circuitry. Another finding that emerges from these studies is that the motivation underlying drug seeking induced by events that precipitate relapse is intensified by the duration and amount of pre‐exposure to a drug and the passage of time since withdrawal of the drug. One implication of such findings for the treatment of addiction is that whatever approach is taken, treatment will have to be multifaceted and maintained over an extended period of time after the initial termination of drug use.",

Several neurochemical and molecular changes take place in the brain during the first phase of drug use which lead to dependence, addiction and drug abuse. DEVELOPMENT. Every drug of abuse acts through similar neurophysiological mechanisms, mostly based on the abnormal activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system. Although the addicted brain tries to adapted to the drug action, there are permanent neural changes at the cellular and molecular levels which seem to underlie the addictive process and the emergence of abstinence symptoms after drug taking stops. Furthermore, these neural changes appear to subserve the emergence of cravings once the abstinent syndrome has been overcome. Cravings are the main factor leading to relapse, and they are often initiated by exposure to drug related cues.",

In women, OCD commonly starts in the early 20s, and is often chronic; thus it coincides with the typical childbearing years for many women and pregnancy and/or birth is a consistently cited triggering factor.1\n\nPerinatal OCD is OCD that occurs in pregnancy or postnatally. It may be a new and sudden onset in those with no previous history or an exacerbation of existing OCD. Symptoms commonly orientate around the baby and caregiving. Pregnancy onset has been more associated with fears of accidentally harming the baby by contamination (for example, ‘my hands may be contaminated’), with related compulsions including excessive washing, restriction of diet and, postnatally, avoidance of activities and contact with others such as playgroups, and minimal child handling, reducing mother–child interaction.

      "abstract": "Background Schizophrenia and bipolar disorders are chronic illnesses that commonly present with symptoms of acute agitation and aggression. These symptoms must be managed rapidly to prevent potential harm to the patient and others, including their caregivers, peers, and health care workers. A number of treatment options are available to clinicians to manage acute agitation and aggression, including non-pharmacologic behavioral and environmental de-escalation strategies, as well as biological treatment options such as pharmacologic agents and electroconvulsive therapy. We summarize the available biological treatment options for patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder presenting with acute agitation or aggression in the inpatient setting, focusing on antipsychotics. Methods The following searches were used in PubMed to obtain the most relevant advances in treating schizophrenia or bipolar disorder with acute agitation and aggression: (agitation, agitated, aggression, aggressive, hostile, hostility, violent, or violence) and (schizophr*, psychosis, psychot*, psychos*, mania, manic, or bipolar) and (*pharmacologic, antipsychotic*, neuroleptic*, antiepileptic*, anti-seizure*, mood stabilizer*, lithium, benzodiazepine*, beta blocker, beta-blocker, alpha2, alpha-2, *histamine*, electroconvulsive, ECT, shock, or transcranial). Individual searches were performed for each drug class. The studies were limited to peer-reviewed, English-language, and human studies. Most were placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or meta-analyses. Results Among pharmacologic agents, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, and lithium have been studied in randomized trials. Some typical and, more recently, atypical antipsychotics are available as both oral and short-acting intramuscular (IM) formulations, with 1 typical antipsychotic also available as an inhalable formulation. Conclusions Among the pharmacologic agents studied in RCTs, atypical antipsychotics have the best evidence to support efficacy both in oral and short-acting IM formulations, as well as in one instance in an inhalable formulation.",

      "abstract": "The weakening of the repression barrier that occurs in sleep and in other altered states of consciousness, such as free association during the process of psychoanalytic therapy, may be produced in a relatively simple fashion during transcendental meditation. An impressive aspect of this phenomenon is that, during the meditation, the intense emotional affect that would ordinarily accompany this ideation, e.g., when obtained by free association, seems to be markedly reduced or almost absent. During meditation, thoughts and ideas may appear that are ordinarily repressed, such as intense hostile-aggressive drives, murderous impulses, and, occasionally, libidinal ideation. Evaluation of electroencephalogram records in patients and subjects using the relaxation techniques reveals remarkable periods of intrahemispheric alpha and theta synchrony at times, even for inexperienced subjects. In a Transcendental Meditation meditator who has been meditating for more than 4 years, there occurs synchronous alpha activity upon closing the eyes, even before starting to meditate on the temporal, central, and occipital cortical areas.",

      "title": "Chronic Hypotension",
      "abstract": "Understanding the causes and treatment of chronic hypotension is of benefit to affected patients and may also shed light on the physiology and genetics of mechanisms of blood pressure control. Symptomatic hypotension (almost always with a blood pressure fall ^ 20/10 mm Hg) may reflect unrecognized medication effects or a variety of other causes. Autonomic neuropathies include those secondary to diabetes, peripheral autonomic impairment (the Bradbury-Eggleston syndrome), central autonomic impairment (the Shy-Drager syndrome), or newly described gene defects such as dopamine-β-hydroxylase deficiency (which causes the absence of norepinephrine with an accumulation of dopa-mine). Baroreceptor dysfunction causes wide swings in blood pressure that are unrelated to posture, whereas a variety of stimuli (cough, micturition, or carotid sinus pressure) may precipitate paroxysmal parasympathetic activation, and sympathetic orthostatic hypotension associated with hypovolemia may occur with mitral valve prolapse or as an idiopathic condition. The differentiation of these and other causes of symptomatic hypotension may in many cases lead to beneficial therapy. Am J Hypertens 1992;5:200S-205S",

      "title": "Practical Recommendations for Hypnotic Switching in Insomnia Management: A Canadian Expert Clinical Framework",
      "abstract": "Insomnia disorder is a complex condition in which patients experience difficulties with sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, or early morning awakening. Chronic insomnia is defined as dissatisfying sleep quality or quantity, occurring at least three times per week, that has persisted for at least three months. Insomnia is common, with a higher incidence in certain subpopulations, including older adults (≥65 years of age) and patients with psychiatric and physical comorbidities, such as depression, anxiety, dementia, restless leg syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic pain, and alcohol or substance use disorders. Individuals experiencing insomnia often have disrupted sleep architecture, with polysomnography showing reduced time spent in the rejuvenating slow wave and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stages. As such, insomnia can seriously impair daytime functioning, cognition, and quality of life. Further, insomnia may result in a higher risk of various conditions, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes, though the association between insomnia and these comorbidities is likely bi-directional. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, the diagnosis is often missed or trivialized in medical practice. Given the profound impact of chronic insomnia, a proactive diagnosis and successful treatment is essential. The primary non-pharmacologic treatment option available for insomnia is cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which focuses on sleep hygiene techniques, sleep restriction, circadian rhythm therapy, and cognitive therapy. Although CBT-I is the first-line treatment for insomnia and should always be recommended, it may not always be available in a timely manner, it can be costly and not every patient can afford it, some patients choose to opt out, and may not be sufficient as a single therapy approach. Thus, in many cases, pharmacotherapy may be needed in addition to or instead of CBT-I to treat insomnia and improve daytime functioning and associated cardiovascular and metabolic risks. Of note, patients also often self-medicate with over-the-counter medications, including cannabis products. Currently, commonly prescribed medications for insomnia include benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZDs; e.g., lorazepam, clonazepam) and Z-drugs (e.g., zolpidem, zopiclone, eszopiclone).10 In addition, despite their risks, antidepressants (e.g., trazodone, mirtazapine), and antipsychotics (e.g., quetiapine) have also been used to treat insomnia despite being off-label and promoting sleep indirectly.",

Consumidor de cannabis desde hace 5 años, con aumento en el ultimo año a 6 unidades al día, presentando de forma puntual fenómenos de autorreferencialidad e ideas de perjuicio en contexto de consumo así como cierto aislamiento. En primero de ingeniería consulta en psiquiatría por animo bajo, dificultad en la concentración y procrastinación. Se inicia tratamiento con metilfenidalto de liberación prolongada hasta 36 mg con parcial respuesta y buena tolerancia. Al aumentar a 54 mg al día el paciente comienza de forma instalada con soliloquios y risas inmotivadas, fenómenos autorreferenciales e ideas delirantes de perjuicio centrada en vecinos. Además presenta movimientos corporales repetitivos y desorganizados que el paciente justifica “como si estuviera imitando a personajes de videojuegos”, por lo que se ingresa en unidad de hospitalización breve. Se suspenden los estimulantes, sin mejorar los síntomas por lo que se inicia paliperidona hasta 18 mg al día con buena respuesta y remisión de la sintomatología psicótica. El paciente es derivado a hospital de día para mejoría funcional en todas las esferas Discusión La psicosis inducida por estimulantes es un cuadro atípico (1/660) que remite en general a las 72 horas tras la retirada del fármaco. La presencia de síntomas psicóticos en el pasado al consumir cannabis y la permanencia de éstos al retirar el estimulante obligar a ampliar el diagnóstico diferencial a trastornos de esfera psicótica a confirmar en evolución y donde es imprescindible una abstinencia completa a sustancias y supone un reto para el tratamiento de TDAH en estos pacientes.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: The co-existence of depression and chronic disease is frequent. This association leads to a worse evolution, of both the psychiatric framework and the chronic disease. However, the depression diagnosis is not always evident and even when it is identified correctly it is often under-treated, either for reasons imputable to the doctor or due to the patient's poor adhesion to the therapeutics. Description of the case: Maria frequently attends medical appointments complaining of dizziness, tinnitus, fatigue and bone and joint pains. The identified health problems include entities with a potential aetiological role in these symptoms, which are overvalued by the patient. However, the latter complied only irregularly with the pharmaceutical therapeutics and kept lifestyle detrimental to the control of such health problems. After multiple appointments of similar pattern she admitted, upon questioning, irritability, anhedonia, tendency for social isolation, hypersomnia and depressive humour, which she attributed to her physical aflictions. After several attempts to introduce anti-depressive medication, which the patient waived a few days later, alleging side effects, medical appointments at fortnight intervals resulted in a better compliance with the therapeutics, both anti-depressive and other, less complaints and better control of her chronic diseases. Comment: The emphasis on the somatic symptoms and the fact that they could be explained within the context of the patient's co-morbidity, therefore withdrawn as criteria of depression suspicion, led to the masking of the latter over time. The doctor must always consider the frequency of depression associated with chronic diseases, in order to achieve better diagnosis acuity. The inclusive approach, accounting for symptoms that are irrespective of being explained by the coexisting pathology, lessens the risk of not diagnosing an oligosymptomatic depressive framework, notwithstanding the fact that it may generate false-positive features. On the contrary, the excluding approach used for some time retarded the (false-negative) diagnosis and the treatment, with repercussions on the control of the whole health problems and on the patient's quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol shows a high affinity by nervous system, and that explains the behaviour-altering effects of drinking. Te nervous system affinity of alcohol is due to biochemical and metabolic characteristics of this substance: 1) Alcohol is rapidly and homogeneously distributed by body tissues and fluids, penetrating through body barriers, including the hematoencephalic one. 2) Because of its great liposolubility, it interacts with lipoid component in neuronal membrane causing long-term changes in neuronal conductance, and long-term structural changes. Behaviour disturbances in alcohol-abusing persons are related with: 1) Alcohol acute effects on neuronal membrane and synapses consisting in transitional disturbances on membrane potential and neurotransmission function. 2) Alcohol long-term effect causing by brain adjustment in synaptic transmission. 3) The relative irreversible disturbances induced by structural synaptic damage. 4) Other conditions related with alcohol abuse but not directly causing by it, such as nutritional deficiencies, and pathologic conditions seen in chronic alcoholism. In clinical practice we usually find disorders due to acute effects of ethanol on brain like different disorders related with alcohol intoxication; disorders due to tolerance development, such as withdrawal syndrome; and those chronic ad multicausal conditions with different degree of reversibility which are consequences of structural brain damage, like Wernicke-Korsakoff encephalopathy, alcoholic neuropthaty, and alcohol induced dementia.",

      "abstract": "Exposure to stressful situations is among the most common human experiences. These types of situations can range from unexpected calamities to routine daily annoyances. In response to stressors, a series of behavioral, neurochemical, and immunological changes occur that ought to serve in an adaptive capacity. However, if those systems become overly taxed, the organism may become vulnerable to pathology. Likewise, the biological changes, if sufficiently sustained, may themselves adversely affect the organism's well-being. Several factors may dictate an individual's response to environmental stressors, including characteristics of the stressor (i.e., type of stressor and its controllability, predictability, and chronicity); biological factors (i.e., age, gender, and genetics); and the subject's previous stressor history and early life experiences. Research on the physiological and psychological responses to different types of stressful stimuli is presented, focusing particularly on processes that may be relevant to the development of alcohol use disorders. Stressful events may profoundly influence the use of alcohol or other drugs (AODs). For example, the resumption of AOD use after a lengthy period of abstinence may reflect a person's attempt to self-medicate to attenuate the adverse psychological consequences of stressors (e.g., anxiety). Alternatively, stress may increase the reinforcing effects of AODs.",

These include finding it difficult to control the need to use the drug and feeling the use of the drug to be more important than more normal things such as family or work. When the person does not use the drug for an amount of time, they may suffer from withdrawal. When a person is addicted, they are usually addicted to a class (a specific kind) of drug. For example, Heroin is a drug that is in the Opiate class, which means that a person addicted to Heroin may also be seen to have an addiction to other opiates such as Morphine. A person who may easily become addicted to drugs is said to have an addictive personality. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders defines drug addiction as a mental disorder. Drug addiction is often linked with other mental disorders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn the present book, fifteen typical literatures about drug addiction published on international authoritative journals were selected to introduce the worldwide newest progress, which contains reviews or original researches on human health, illegal drugs, neuroscience, psychology, ect.

We introduce the ideas of psychotomimetic compensation and psychotomimetic sensitization to explain this paradox. Psychotomimetic compensation refers to a stress or drug induced compensation against stress (see Fig 1) that is facilitated by engagement of neurotransmitter/modulator systems (endocannabinoid, serotonergic, glutamatergic and dopaminergic) that mediate the effects of common psychotomimetic drugs (see Fig 3). Psychotomimetic sensitization occurs after repeated exposure to stress and/or drugs (Fig 3) and is evidenced by the gradual intensification and increase of psychotic-like experiences over time. Theoretical and practical implications of this model are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Summary Overtraining, a decrease in performance despite training that does not disappear after 2 weeks of relative rest, accompanied by symptoms like fatigue, anorexia, and muscle and joint pain, mood changes and feeling burnt out or stale is a frequent syndrome in endurance athletes. It is generally the result of excessive activity from training and competition in combination with insufficient rest. It can be exacerbated and/or triggered by other stresses. Excluding other illnesses its diagnosis is made on history and serial exercise test data, no simple discriminative laboratory tests exist yet. Treatment is rest and gradual reintroduction of training. Prevention is possible and can be done by carefully monitoring subjective exertion from training and general mood combined with simple exercise test results. Its aetiology is not well known. The cytokine model of excessive stress leading to a generalized inflammatory state may explain the overtraining syndrome and represents an interesting avenue of further research to improve the diagnosis and management of this frequent and debilitating health problem in athletes.",

      "abstract": "Various factors contribute to a predisposition towards the excessive consumption of alcohol: socio-demographic factors, a disturbed family background or certain neurological disorders in childhood, a family background of heavy drinking or total abstinence, or a genetic predisposition towards the biochemical reactions of excessive drinking. Alcohol dependence is the last of several stages which begin with drinking on \"social occasions\" during adolescence or even childhood, which may lead to certain people drinking excessively in certain social surroundings; this may easily become a habit if the subject moreover suffers from psychological problems inducing him to consume greater quantities more frequently to overcome inhibitions or to escape. This increased consumption leads in turn to psychological dependence, and toxicomania becomes apparent since if drinking is suddenly stopped, giving rise to neuro-vegetative disorders, these only disappear when further alcohol is consumed. This vicious circle is completed by psychological problems affecting personal relationships and professional activities. Thus for the alcoholic, for whom at the outset drinking was usually merely a social habit, the consumption of alcohol has become an escape from the reality of his situation, often drinking solely to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and therefore the appropriate therapy in these cases is detoxication.",

      "title": "Interpretative aspects of toxicological results",
      "abstract": "Forensic drug testing, by definition, is performed for legal or regulatory purposes and is often termed 'forensic toxicology'. Interpretation of forensic toxicology data depends on the type of specimens analyzed (e.g., blood, urine or breath) and the legal purpose of the testing. For impaired driving cases, interpretation is typically performed in the context of alcohol or drug concentrations specified in national or regional legislation. Impairment may or may not need to be proven, depending on the charges laid. For workplace and related drug testing the issue to be proven is simply the presence or absence of one of a small number of abused drugs at or above a specified concentration (the 'cut-off'); the determination is use of a specified drug, not whether that drug caused impairment. Drug-facilitated crime, including sexual assault, is more complex because the substance used/administered could be any one of a very wide range with potentially sedating properties. The inevitable delay in collecting blood or urine after the event will cause the concentration of most drugs to fall dramatically – typically well below the concentrations expected at the time of maximum effect – which is why analysis of hair from the victim may be useful. Post-mortem forensic toxicology is the most difficult subspecialty to deal with because of the wide range of drugs involved and difficulty of interpretation. Post-mortem changes can cause some blood drug concentrations to increase markedly after death in an unpredictable manner, whereas others deteriorate rapidly. Interpretation of post-mortem toxicology results requires considerable experience and a sound knowledge of anatomy and physiology, plus the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of individual drugs. This chapter discusses the approaches to interpretation of results in each of the main areas of forensic toxicology.",

      "abstract": "The DSM-III (American Psychiatric Association 1980) criteria for dysthymic disorder selected a heterogeneous group of patients who overlapped with major depression and personality disorders in ways that were difficult to interpret. DSM-III-R (American Psychiatric Association 1987) revised the dysthymia criteria by (1) distinguishing early from late age of onset; (2) providing separate designations for primary and secondary states of dysthymia; (3) including a category of chronic major depression; and (4) revising the specific content of criteria. The performance characteristics of the new criteria set are yet to be tested--a necessary next step to inform the discussions that will culminate in DSM-IV. The remaining areas of greatest controversy are whether (1) early onset, primary dysthymic disorder should be redefined as depressive personality and placed on Axis II; (2) \"double-depression\" represents a real clinical phenomenon or a definitional artifact; and (3) the content of the diagnostic criteria can be made more specific for chronic depressions. The implications of possible changes and the workings of the DSM-IV Affective Disorders Work Group are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a prevalent but poorly understood condition mainly characterized by debilitating, persistent or recurrent fatigue; increased physical and mental fatigability; cognitive impairment and widespread musculoskeletal pain. Despite intensive treatment research, the role of pharmacotherapy in the illness remains uncertain.An updated review is given of pharmacotherapy in CFS, with a focus on non-antidepressant, controlled drug trials performed between 1988 and August 2009.Antiviral, immunological and antibiotic therapies, although sometimes associated with symptom amelioration, can be more harmful than beneficial in CFS. Stimulants seem to benefit some CFS patients but their long-term effects is uncertain. Although antidepressants are not curative for the illness, they might be useful for some symptomatic aspects and co-morbid anxiety and depression. There is little or no evidence that CFS patients benefit from other pharmacological agents (e.g., steroids) or from dietary supplements and complementary medicine products. Future research into treatment should take specific subgroups into account and should target immunological aspects of the illness as well as the complex relationships between CFS, stress and depression.Pharmacotherapy can currently not be considered first-line treatment in CFS and should always be used in a context of self-management and rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Benzodiazepine dependence: a shadowy diagnosis.",
      "abstract": "When benzodiazepines were introduced into clinical practice in the 1950s they were hailed as efficacious minor tranquillizers, largely devoid of unwanted side effects, in contrast to the barbiturates and similar drugs that they largely superseded. It was 30 years before the phenomenon of low-dose dependence on benzodiazepines was recognized. Benzodiazepine dependence differs from other psychotropic drug addictions because the benzodiazepines do not produce either euphoria or drug-seeking behaviour (except in those who are already addicted to other drugs). However, benzodiazepine use is associated in some individuals with a marked withdrawal (abstinence) syndrome that provides the best evidence of dependence. Just over half the people prescribed long-term benzodiazepines do not develop any sign of a withdrawal reaction (Fig. 1): this reflects factors including the type of benzodiazepine prescribed, the dosage and duration of treatment, as well as characteristics of the patient. Individuals with passive-dependent personalities appear to be more likely to experience withdrawal symptoms than other patients, although this remains a controversial issue. Therefore benzodiazepine use should follow certain guidelines, and if these are adhered to the benzodiazepines will continue to be valuable drugs in clinical practice.",

Depuis la découverte des effets antidépresseurs de la kétamine, il existe un regain d’intérêt pour cette classe de molécules. En effet, la psilocybine et l’acide lysergique diéthylamide (LSD) gagnent de la popularité en tant que traitement pour la dépression et l’addiction, la 3,4-méthylènedioxyméthamphétamine (MDMA) pour l’état de stress post-traumatique, et l’ibogaïne pour l’addiction. Malgré des profils pharmacologiques distincts, ces différentes drogues partagent une cinétique d’action similaire : leurs effets thérapeutiques se font ressentir dans les heures suivant l’administration et perdurent au-delà de leur élimination par l’organisme. Ceci suggère des mécanismes plastiques et neurogéniques impliquant entre autres des facteurs trophiques. Cette revue explorera la littérature concernant les effets de ces différents composés sur les neurotrophines, ainsi que les adaptations plastiques qui sont mises en place dans les heures et jours suivant l’administration, afin de comprendre leur potentiel thérapeutique étonnant.",

A well-described discontinuation syndrome occurs with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, common symptoms including dizziness, headache, nausea and lethargy. Rare antidepressant discontinuation syndromes include extrapyramidal syndromes and mania/hypomania. All these syndromes, even isolated discontinuation symptoms, share three common features that facilitate diagnosis; abrupt onset within days of stopping the antidepressant, a short duration when untreated and rapid resolution when the antidepressant is reinstated. Clinicians need to be familiar with strategies for the prevention and management of such symptoms. Preventive strategies include warning patients about the possibility of discontinuation symptoms, encouraging good antidepressant adherence and tapering antidepressants at the end of treatment. Most symptoms are mild and short-lived. Consequently symptoms that follow planned termination of an antidepressant can often be managed by providing an explanation and reassurance. More severe symptoms should be treated symptomatically or the antidepressant restarted, in which case symptoms usually resolve within 24 h. More cautious tapering can then follow.",

      "title": "Prevalence and characterization of the insomnia syndrome in an outpatient oncology clinic",
      "abstract": "18612 Background: Insomnia is an often overlooked symptom. One potential reason for this neglect is that insomnia is viewed as a normal and temporary reaction to the cancer diagnosis or treatment. Patients themselves may fail to report their sleep difficulties to their physicians for similar reasons. Previous work in understanding insomnia has been limited by the lack of an operational definition of the insomnia syndrome, small sample size and varied instruments for symptom detection. Hence, the proportion of cancer patients meeting diagnostic criteria for the insomnia syndrome is not well known. Recently the diagnosis of the insomnia syndrome has been redefined using a combination of criteria derived from the International Classification of Sleep Disorders and the DSM-IV. The criteria includes)difficulty in initiating and/or maintaining sleep, whereby sleep-onset latency and/or wake after sleep onset is greater than 30 minutes; sleep efficiency (ratio of total sleep time to total time spent in bed) lower than 85%; difficulties occurring at least 3 nights per week; difficulties occurring for at least 6 months; and difficulties causing marked distress or significant impairment in daytime functioning (eg, fatigue, disturbed mood, performance deficits). Methods: 100 consecutive oncology patients were surveyed using the above criteria for the insomnia syndrome. Symptom assessment was also included. Results: The incidence of the insomnia syndrome seems to correspond to previously reported incidences.Patient have more problems staying asleep than going to sleep. Patients may have dramatic inversions of their sleep/wake cycle yet feel that they do not have insomnia. Pain is the most commonly associated symptom associated with insomnia. Conclusions: There is a great need for better tools to asssess the symptom of insomnia. Focusing on specific characteristics of insomnia and distinguishing the insomnia syndrome versus the symptom of insomnia is an effective way establish if there is a need for specific therapy. The addition of symptom assessment further improves the characterisation insomnia. Characteristics of insomnia experienced by the patient may help direct specific treatment modalities. Pain is a frequently associated symptom with insomnia. No significant financial relationships to disclose.",

Palliative sedation refers to the intentional clinical practice of suppressing consciousness to control refractory symptoms during the last days or hours of life, in a manner that is ethically acceptable to the patient, family and healthcare providers. The intractable symptoms, which have proven non-responsive to all other interventions, are contained by the induction and the continuance of deep sedation. Deep sedation may need to be maintained until death; the duration is usually in the range of 1–6 days. Trial releases of deep sedation can be orchestrated, if required, by withholding the dose or administering flumazenil. The dosage necessary to induce deep sedation is variable.",

Alcohol addiction encompasses a three-stage cycle that becomes more intense as alcohol use progresses: <italic>binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect</italic>, and <italic>preoccupation/anticipation</italic>. These stages engage neuroadaptations in brain circuits that involve the basal ganglia (reward hypofunction), extended amygdala (stress sensitization), and prefrontal cortex (executive function disorder). This chapter discusses key neuroadaptations in the hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic stress systems and the critical role of glucocorticoid receptors. These neuroadaptations contribute to negative emotional states that powerfully drive compulsive alcohol drinking and seeking. These changes in association with a disruption of prefrontal cortex function that lead to cognitive deficits and poor decision making contribute to the chronic relapsing nature of alcohol dependence.",

(2) There are a lot of legal areas where only the psychiatric or psychological expert opinion is required: i.e., the question of criminal responsibility during a trial, the assessment of legal capacity and the capability to will, for decisions about the custody of children etc. This is demonstrated with some cases as an example.",

      "abstract": "Cardiac valve disease can involve one or more of the four heart valves. Chronic valve damage may remain asymptomatic for long periods but ultimately leads to haemodynamic overload of the heart. The most common causes of valve disease are rheumatic diseases, infections, chronic renal failure, malformations, and genetic diseases. Valve disease is often attributed to degeneration with no known cause.The frequency of drug-related valve disease has long been underestimated. Most implicated drugs have serotonergic properties, such as fenfluramine-derived amphetamines, including benfluorex. Rye ergot derivatives can also be implicated: these include dopamine agonists (bromocriptine, lisuride, pergolide and cabergoline), migraine treatments (methysergide, ergotamine and dihydroergotamine), and drugs used for cognitive and neurosensory deficits (nicergoline, dihydroergocryptine, etc.). \"Ecstasy\", an amphetamine, is sometimes also involved. The risk increases after a few months of exposure. Drug withdrawal is sometimes followed by an improvement. Patients exposed to a drug known to cause valve damage should be informed of the risk and receive long-term monitoring to detect these lesions before they become irreversible. The possible role of a drug should always be considered when cardiac valve disease is diagnosed, in order to facilitate active research and to avoid exposing other patients to this risk.",

The diagnosis of a chronic and recurrent mental disorder influences a person’s self-image and has a strong impact on all members of the family. In the adjustment to the diagnosis, each individual usually undergoes a process in which a variety of beliefs and emotions may arise that will have to be dealt with, in parallel to education about and acceptance of the disorder. It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

We present two case reports to highlight the occurrence of co-morbid psychopathology in association with antihistamine abuse and dependence.<br>Case I used high doses of pheniramine for about 2 years and became suspicious of his wife; he even doubted the paternity of his yet-to-be-born child. The associated behavioural abnormalities suggested that he was acting out on the delusion. He also had seizures associated with the intake of a high dose of pheniramine. Case II had multiple substance use, and dependence on alcohol and pheniramine. He demonstrated abnormal behaviour suggestive of psychosis and organic brain syndrome that persisted for a few days and remitted on discontinuation of the substances. These two cases demonstrate the occurrence of psychotic syndromes associated with heavy pheniramine use.

Prudent primary care and mental health clinicians should screen for insomnia using valid and reliable tools when clients report sleep difficulties. When screening is positive, further assessment with a sleep diary is warranted. The primary treatment for insomnia is CBT-I, and pharmacological treatment may provide temporary support for no more than 2 to 4 weeks.

      "title": "Reducing inhibition: A promising new strategy for the treatment of schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder presenting with positive (hallucinations, delusions, psychomotor agitation), negative (flat affect, anhedonia), and cognitive (impaired executive functions) symptoms. Current therapeutic approaches include second generation antipsychotics that primarily alleviate positive symptoms via modulation of dopaminergic and serotonergic transmission. These treatments remain moderately effective with between 10% and 30% of patients showing little symptomatic improvement, and an additional 30% to 60% experiencing partial improvement or severe side effects during antipsychotic therapy (Lehman et al., [[5]Lehman A.F. Lieberman J.A. Dixon L.B. TH McGlashan Miller A.L. Perkins D.O. et al.Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia, second edition.Am J Psychiatry. 2004; 161: 1-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar]). Current pharmaceutical developments aim to target other neurotransmitter systems, specifically the glutamatergic system. The end goal of these novel approaches is to restore the excitatory/inhibitory balance (E/I) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) [[6]Moghaddam B. Javitt D. From revolution to evolution: the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia and its implication for treatment.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2012; 37: 4-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar]. Prefrontal E/I imbalance is thought to be a major contributing mechanism to schizophrenia pathology, especially cognitive symptoms [[4]Kehrer C. Maziashvili N. Dugladze T. Gloveli T. Altered excitatory-inhibitory balance in the NMDA-hypofunction model of schizophrenia.Front Mol Neurosci. 2008; 1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar]. Specifically, observations that N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) antagonists such as ketamine and MK-801 induce phenotypes resembling positive and cognitive symptoms led to the conclusion that hypofunction of glutamatergic signaling via NMDA-R underlie some of the schizophrenic symptoms [[6]Moghaddam B. Javitt D. From revolution to evolution: the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia and its implication for treatment.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2012; 37: 4-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar]. Restoring glutamatergic neurotransmission in schizophrenia is the therapeutic approach taken by Fan et al. [[2]Fan H.-R. Du W.-F. Zhu T. Wu Y.-J. Liu Y.-M. Wang Q. et al.Quercetin reduces cortical GABAergic transmission and alleviates MK-801-induced hyperactivity.EBioMedicine. 2018; ([current issue])Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (16) Google Scholar]. They used quercetin, a natural flavonoid that acts as a negative allosteric modulator for GABAA receptors (GABAA-Rs), to reduce inhibition in the PFC and potentiate glutamatergic transmission, effectively alleviating the positive symptom of MK-801-induced hyperactivity in mice [[2]Fan H.-R. Du W.-F. Zhu T. Wu Y.-J. Liu Y.-M. Wang Q. et al.Quercetin reduces cortical GABAergic transmission and alleviates MK-801-induced hyperactivity.EBioMedicine. 2018; ([current issue])Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (16) Google Scholar]. This approach can be seen as controversial given observations of GABAergic neurotransmission abnormality in the schizophrenia brain. Impaired parvalbumin (PV)-dependent GABAergic transmission is recognized to be one of the main molecular mechanism responsible for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia [[3]Gonzalez-Burgos G. Lewis D.A. NMDA receptor hypofunction, parvalbumin-positive neurons, and cortical gamma oscillations in schizophrenia.Schizophr Bull. 2012; 38: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar]. Similarly, other research has demonstrated that reducing GABAergic transmission in the PFC by blocking GABAA-Rs induces some positive and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia in rodents [[1]Enomoto T. Tse M.T. Floresco S.B. Reducing prefrontal gamma-aminobutyric acid activity induces cognitive, behavioral, and dopaminergic abnormalities that resemble schizophrenia.Biol Psychiatry. 2011; 69: 432-441Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar]. Therefore, GABA agonists or positive allosteric modulators are also under investigation as novel therapeutics for schizophrenia, aimed at calibrating prefrontal E/I balance by reducing excitation [[8]Vinkers C.H. Mirza N.R. Olivier B. Kahn R.S. The inhibitory GABA system as a therapeutic target for cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia: investigational agents in the pipeline.Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2010; 19: 1217-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar]. Despite this, the findings from Fan et al. [[2]Fan H.-R. Du W.-F. Zhu T. Wu Y.-J. Liu Y.-M. Wang Q. et al.Quercetin reduces cortical GABAergic transmission and alleviates MK-801-induced hyperactivity.EBioMedicine. 2018; ([current issue])Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (16) Google Scholar] support the therapeutic effects of negatively modulating GABAA-R in a rodent model of MK-801-induced hyperactivity. The exact mechanisms involved are elusive and require further study. Potentially, regulation of GABA transmission by quercetin could act through two distinct mechanisms in the PFC. First, quercetin might act in a cell type-specific manner. Future research should examine whether quercetin acts primarily upon GABAA-Rs on inhibitory or excitatory neurons in the PFC and determine the resulting net effect on prefrontal E/I balance. For instance, quercetin could inhibit GABAA-Rs on hypofunctional PV-expressing cells, thereby promoting excitatory drive onto these cells and subsequently restoring appropriate levels of inhibition onto prefrontal pyramidal neurons. In support of this hypothesis, NMDA-R antagonists like ketamine and MK-801 act first on PV-expressing cells as these neurons exist in a more depolarized state with a higher number of open NMDA-Rs compared to excitatory neurons [[3]Gonzalez-Burgos G. Lewis D.A. NMDA receptor hypofunction, parvalbumin-positive neurons, and cortical gamma oscillations in schizophrenia.Schizophr Bull. 2012; 38: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, [6]Moghaddam B. Javitt D. From revolution to evolution: the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia and its implication for treatment.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2012; 37: 4-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar]. Cell type-specific electrophysiological recordings after treatment with quercetin would help address these questions. Alternatively, quercetin's therapeutic effects may involve homeostatic mechanisms. Blocking GABA receptors classically increase excitation. However, if excitation on a given neuron increases beyond a set point, homeostatic mechanisms can intervene to reduce excitation onto that cell in an effort to maintain balance. In schizophrenia, when prefrontal GABAergic transmission is impaired, blocking GABAA-Rs with quercetin may push synaptic activity levels above the threshold to trigger homeostatic mechanisms and restore inhibition and functional E/I balance. This phenomenon has been reported in other regions of the brain where elevated activity levels can cause compensatory increases in the amplitude and/or frequency of inhibitory post-synaptic currents [[9]Wenner P. Mechanisms of GABAergic homeostatic plasticity.Neural Plast. 2011; 2011: 489470Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar]. Though this idea remains highly speculative, it would be an interesting hypothesis to test in future studies with quercetin, possibly by measuring electrophysiological changes to inhibitory currents, or by examining posttranslational modifications to the GABAA-R scaffolding protein gephyrin and other proteins involved in the structure and function of GABAergic synapses. The findings of Fan and colleagues are especially notable given a recent publication describing two case studies in which augmenting conventional antipsychotic treatments with quercetin improved therapeutic outcomes in schizophrenia patients [[7]Schwartz D.L. Quercetin as an augmentation agent in schizophrenia.J Clin Psychopharmacol. 2016; 36Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar]. Together, these provide early evidence in both rodents and humans for a novel, unexplored treatment that targets the interplay between excitation and inhibition in the PFC. Interestingly, several GABAA-R inverse agonists have shown potential for treating cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia [[8]Vinkers C.H. Mirza N.R. Olivier B. Kahn R.S. The inhibitory GABA system as a therapeutic target for cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia: investigational agents in the pipeline.Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2010; 19: 1217-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar], and negative allosteric modulation of α5-containing GABAA-Rs may be beneficial for depression, another disorder marked by prefrontal E/I imbalance [[10]Zanos P. Nelson M.E. Highland J.N. Krimmel S.R. Georgiou P. Gould T.D. et al.A negative allosteric modulator for alpha5 subunit-containing GABA receptors exerts a rapid and persistent antidepressant-like action without the side effects of the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine in mice.eNeuro. 2017; 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar]. Moving forward, future research should investigate the cognitive effects of quercetin treatment and aim to elucidate its therapeutic mechanisms of action. Prefrontal E/I balance is critical for healthy emotional and cognitive functioning, and understanding how GABA antagonism fits into the puzzle of E/I interactions may prove invaluable for treating multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. The authors declare no conflicts of interest. Quercetin Reduces Cortical GABAergic Transmission and Alleviates MK-801-Induced HyperactivityAn imbalance between neuronal excitation and inhibition represents a core feature in multiple neuropsychiatry disorders, necessitating the development of novel strategies to calibrate the excitatory–inhibitory balance of therapeutics. Here we identify a natural compound quercetin that reduces prefrontal cortical GABAergic transmission and alleviates the hyperactivity induced by glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist MK-801. Quercetin markedly reduced the GABA-activated currents in a noncompetitive manner in cultured cortical neurons, and moderately inhibited spontaneous and electrically-evoked GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic current in mouse prefrontal cortical slices.

Ambos trastornos pueden ser primarios, el trastorno de ansiedad puede ser secundario (inducido) al consumo de drogas, o viceversa. El DSM-IV-TR1 describe 12 trastornos de ansiedad y 10 trastornos de ansiedad inducidos. Para poder realizar un adecuado diagnostico y diagnostico diferencial de los trastornos de ansiedad primarios o de los inducidos es necesario que transcurra un tiempo de abstinencia. El DSM-IV-TR senala la necesidad de que transcurran 4 semanas desde el ultimo consumo. Cuando el paciente toma benzodiacepinas de semivida corta o sustancias como la heroina, este tiempo es adecuado, pero cuando consume benzodiacepinas de semivida larga o metadona pueden ser necesarias varias semanas para poder realizar el diagnostico, lo cual no siempre es posible en la practica clinica. Por ello, para establecer un diagnostico diferencial adecuado es necesario realizar una historia clinica completa y valorar los posibles antecedentes personales o familiares de trastornos de ansiedad,indicadores de la existencia de una ansiedad primaria. El trastorno de ansiedad inducido por sustancias incluye aquellas entidades clinicas en las que la ansiedad es de caracter prominente, es decir, las crisis de angustia o las obsesiones o compulsiones predominan en el cuadro clinico. Ademas se debe demostrar que los sintomas aparecen durante la intoxicacion o tras el primer mes de abstinencia y/o que son secundarios al consumo de la sustancia. Los sintomas no deben aparecer en el transcurso de un delirium y deben provocar malestar clinicamente significativo o deterioro social, laboral o de otras areas importantes en la actividad. diagnosticos se cumplen en el curso de una intoxicacion, especificando entonces de inicio durante la intoxicacion, o si se cumplen durante o poco despues de la abstinencia, especificando en este caso de inicio durante la abstinencia. En el DSM-IV-TR no se acepta la existencia del trastorno de ansiedad inducido por nicotina ni por opiaceos. Etiopatogenia Se ha planteado que tanto el uso de sustancias como los trastornos de ansiedad pueden ser primarios o secundarios (inducidos) por lo que la relacion entre el consumo de sustancias y la ansiedad es controvertida. En muchos trabajos esta documentada la coexistencia de ambos pero en ocasiones es muy dificil dilucidar cual de ellos es el primario. Se han propuesto tres hipotesis explicativas sobre la relacion entre ambos trastornos3,4: 1. Los trastornos de ansiedad promueven el uso patologico de alcohol u otras sustancias. Algunos autores proponen que el alcohol u otras sustancias, por sus posibles efectos ansioliticos, pueden ser utilizados por los pacientes como autotratamiento de su ansiedad. En este sentido, tambien es posible que la ansiedad empeore o reactive un consumo de sustancias preexistente. Las evidencias de algunos estudios sugieren que la ansiedad social es un motivo importante para el consumo de alcohol5, ya que mejoraria las expectativas y la creencia de mayor autoeficacia en situaciones de ansiedad social.",

Tearfulness often precedes or accompanies such emotional outburst. In addition to these emotional symptoms, mild physiological symptoms similar to those seen in a panic attack, such as palpitations, dizziness, trembling and so on, may appear. Immediately after this emotional outburst, distressing trains of thought or images related to recent or past unpleasant events are experienced and ruminated on repeatedly. They are often manifested as flashbacks with or without visual images. Since these conditions are the bitterest experiences for most patients, they may cope with them in various ways such as deliberate self-harm. These patients generally have a more or less depressive mood. These conditions are considerably different from a panic attack, in that the emotional and cognitive storm dominates the physical one. The author named this condition as an Anxious-Depressive Attack (ADA). In this study, we present five cases of ADA and discuss their psychopathology and differential diagnoses.

It includes a number of somatic drugs (e.g. proton pump inhibitors, opioids, triptans, fingolimod, corticosteroids, antiepileptics, nootropics, antiparkinsonians, denosumab, beta-blockers, laxatives, nasal vasoconstrictors, etc.). This type of unintended effect, often underestimated, generally results from a drug-induced homeostatic imbalance that persists after the drug has been discontinued. Taking this risk into account right from the initial prescription should make it possible to prevent such complications, by encouraging intermittent use of the drug, or by applying a very gradual reduction in dosage when a regular treatment is stopped.",

One 13-year-old subject with male sex has the symptom, where the subject's behavior resembles autistic behavior such as being very hyperactive, experiencing tantrums (biting his own hand or throwing things if his desire is not fulfilled), losing language skills and speech, ability to intertwine poor social interaction, as well as developmental deterioration or abnormality after experiencing the normal phase at the age of two years, followed by a real loss of trained skills. The method used for children who have disintegration syndrome is by motion therapy with the aim that the subject can maximize concentration and focus in order to be able to survive in an activity or activity and be able to use fine and rough motor skills with flexibility. The result of this therapy is that there is a slight change from the previous behavior, namely an increase in concentration behavior, eye contact becomes longer than usual and is not easily tantrum and more obedient.",

      "title": "Stress and immunity: minireview.",
      "abstract": "Stress, a state of threatened homeostasis, may be induced by various physical or psychological factors (stressors), including antigenic stimulation. Stressful experiences may affect both physical/psychological well being and immune functioning of humans and animals; the ongoing immune reaction may affect other physiological functions and psychological comfort. The molecular basis of these effects involves a network of multidirectional signalling and feedback regulations of neuroendocrine- and immunocyte-derived mediators. The consecutive stages of the multistep immune reactions might be either inhibited or enhanced owing to the previous and/or parallel stress experiences, depending on the kind of stressor and the animal species, strain, gender, or age. Therefore, the final results of stress-induced alteration of immune reactions are difficult to predict. The effect of a particular stressor on immune functions varies according to the previous stress experience of the individual (e.g. social confrontation, sterile saline injection) while various stressors may act in the same or in opposite ways on the same immune parameter. In general, the efficacy of immune response depends on the neuroendocrine environment on which it is superimposed. Conversely, neural and endocrine responses depend on the concurrent immune events upon which they are superimposed. It seems that the consequences of stress on the immune functioning are generally adaptive in the short run but can be damaging when stress is chronic.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY A new syndrome, paradoxical intoxication, has been defined in which high levels of hydantoins, and in one instance carbamazepine, produced an increase in seizures with little or no evidence of intoxication; a decrease in these levels produced an improvement in seizure control. This syndrome occurs often but not exclusively in those people who are less astute in assessing their neurologic status and therefore may experience unexpectedly higher blood levels of their anticonvulsants. Instances have been documented with serum levels above 40 jugm/ml for phenytoin or mephenytoin alone, or above 50 jugm/ml of combined hydantoins phenytoin and mephenytoin, and when the level is in the range of 20 yugm/ml and above for carbamazepine. Possible mechanisms underlying the syndrome are reviewed. Appropriate therapy is a reduction of the dose of the drug in question. RÉSUMÉ L'intoxication paradoxale est un syndrome caracterise par une augmentation des crises survenant lorsque les concentrations seriques d'hydantoine ou de carbamazepine sont elevees et le peu d'effets secondaires generalement observés a des tels taux. 9 cas sont rapportes. Les taux de phenytoine ou de mephenytoi'ne donnees seules, étaient superieurs a 40 /Ltg/ml; le taux total d'hydantoine était superieur a 50 jLtg/ml (chez les patients avec phenytoine et mephenytoi'ne associees); le taux de carba‐mazepine eta it supfrieur a 20 /ig/ml. La frequence des crises diminuait a nouveau si Ton reduisait la dose. RESUMEN La intoxicación paradojica consiste en un aumento de la frecuencia de ataques cuando la concentracidn de hidantoinas o carbamazepinas en suero es elevada. Los habituales sfntomas que se observan con tales concentraciones son escasos. Se presentan 9 casos. Los niveles sericos de fenitoina o mefenitoina administra‐das por separado fueron superiores a los 40 μg/ml; los de la hidantoina total (en pacientes tomando fenitoina y mefenitoina) fueron superiores a los 50 μg/ml y los de carbamazepina por encima de 20 /ig/ml. El aumento de los ataques se controla reduciendo la dosis. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Die paradoxe Intoxikation ist ein Syndrom, das charakterisiert ist durch eine zunehmende Anfallsfrequenz bei hoher Serumkonzentration von Hydantoinen oder Carbamazepin jedoch nur geringen Nebenwirkungen verglichen mit denen, die gewohnlich bei derartigen Blut‐spiegeln zu sehen sind.

      "title": "Psychosocial Might a pleasure improve anhedonia and depression",
      "abstract": "Introduction Anhedonia (a reduction of the abil­ ity to feel pleasure) is considered a key symptom in major depression and may influence some of its most imp ortant symptoms, such as apathy, difficulty in concentrating and main­ taining attention, and gloomy mood. Various pleasurable sensations seem to be useful both in anhe donia and in depression. These pleasures are more intense than the usual daily ones, and their greater intensity could mean they can still be felt by a certain number of anhedonic individuals. Hypothesis Feeling a pleasant stimulus enhances the user’s sensitivity to subsequent rewards, so subsequent pleasures can be felt more strongly for a certain time. In this way, a pleasure strong enough to be still felt by some anhe­ donic individuals might reinforce their sensitivity to other rewards, enabling them to regain previously faded or lost pleasures, hence impro­ ving the anhedonia. Evaluation of Hypothesis Anhedonia is a key symptom of major depression and may influence some of its symptoms; hence an improve­ ment in anhedonia, produced by a pleasure strong enough to be felt, might positively influence the life of depressed people. Consequences of Hypothesis Since many symptoms of depression could be influenced by anhedonia, ameliorating anhedonia may alleviate also these symptoms of depression. Conclusion A pleasure, strong enough to be felt, might allow anhedonic and depressed persons to regain, for a certain time, previously lostnormal pleasures, thus enabling them to temporarily lead a more enjoyable life.",

      "title": "Managing drug-induced psychosis",
      "abstract": "AbstractSubstance-induced psychosis is a secondary psychotic disorder resulting from drug abuse, characterized by one or more psychotic episodes. Drug-induced psychosis is expected to resolve after a 30-day period of sobriety, however, individuals with this condition are more likely to develop severe drug addiction. Compared to primary psychosis, participants with drug-induced psychosis exhibit poorer family history of psychotic diseases, higher insight, fewer positive and negative symptoms, more depressive symptoms, and greater anxiety. Substance-induced psychosis is strongly associated with the emergence of bipolar illness or schizophrenia spectrum disorder, with an increased chance of developing schizophrenia at a younger age. Episodes of self-harm after substance-induced psychosis are strongly linked to an elevated likelihood of developing schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Effective treatment involves ruling out emergencies, investigating underlying causes, and addressing acute intoxication and withdrawal. Management includes dynamic assessment, intervention, and vigilant monitoring in cases of suicidal behaviour. Antipsychotics may be used for short term, with gradual discontinuation when a person is in a stable condition. Relapse prevention strategies, both medication and non-medication-based, are crucial in long-term management. Conversion rates to schizophrenia or bipolar disorder can be as high as one in three individuals, with cannabis users and those with early-onset substance abuse at the highest risk.Keywords: Drug-induced psychosispsychotic disordersbipolar disorderschizophreniarisk Authors' contributionAll authors participated in all stages of the review.Disclosure statementLB worked as a scientific consultant for Libbs and Jansen.

      "title": "Sensitization to Drugs",
      "abstract": "The word “sensitization” is used to refer to a number of different but related effects. For example, in immunology, sensitization refers to the hypersensitivity to an antigen (often an allergen) that can develop upon repeated exposure to the antigen. In the study of learning, sensitization refers to a form of nonassociative learning whereby exposure to a stimulus (an unconditional stimulus, US) increases subsequent responsiveness to the same or other stimuli, even though they were not explicitly paired. Similarly, in pharmacology, the word sensitization has come to refer to an increase in a drug effect upon successive exposures to a drug or hypersensitivity to a drug in animals that were exposed to the drug in the past (Fig. 1). For example, one unconditional effect of drugs such as amphetamine or cocaine is to produce psychomotor activation, often measured as an increase in forward locomotion. Under some circumstances, the repeated administration of psychostimulant drugs results in a progressive increase in this drug effect, whereby successive injections of the same dose produce greater and greater psychomotor activation. Furthermore, exposure to one drug (e.g., amphetamine) can also render animals hypersensitive to the locomotor-activating effects of other drugs (e.g., cocaine or morphine). When exposure to one drug (or another stimulus, such as stress) renders an animal hypersensitive to another drug or stimulus, this is called “cross-sensitization” (Kalivas and Barnes 1988; Robinson and Becker 1986; Stewart and Badiani 1993).",

Se considera que en mas de las tres cuartas partes de los mayores deprimidos pueden persistir sintomas residuales, dando lugar a estados postdepresivos en forma de depresiones menores, depresiones subum- brales o depresiones subsindromicas. Entre estos sintomas residuales mas frecuentes en los estados postdepresivos destacan las dificultades de concentracion, el enlenteci- miento, la astenia, los sintomas somaticos, los trastornos del sueno o la hipocondriasis. En los mayores son mas frecuentes las de- presiones subclinicas o subsindromicas, que frecuentemente aparecen tras la mejoria de un trastorno depresivo mayor. Los factores que se asocian para la aparicion de estas depresiones subsindromicas son de tipo so- ciodemografico (ausencia de contactos so- ciales), empeoramiento funcional, historia previa de trastornos afectivos, antecedentes de trastornos vasculares cerebrales o facto- res existenciales (preocupaciones sobre el futuro, baja percepcion de salud,..).

The factors that are associated for the appearance of these subsyndromic depressions are sociodemo- graphic factors (loss of social contacts), functional impairment, previous history of affective disorders, history of cerebrovascu- lar disorders or existential factors (concerns about the future, low perception of health, ..).

El ataque de panico se describe como la aparicion subita de miedo y/o malestar intensos que alcanza su maxima expresion en minutos y han de presentarse al menos cuatro de los trece sintomas fisiologicos y cognitivos descritos (APA, 2013).\nEn terminos generales se estima la prevalencia anual en Estados Unidos y varios paises europeos en torno al 2-3% en los adultos y adolescentes (APA, 2013). \nEl trastorno de panico conlleva un alto grado de deterioro de la calidad de vida e insatisfaccion (Comer et al., 2011; Barrera y Norton, 2009), mayor probabilidad de intentos de suicidio y suicidio consumado (Nepon et al., 2010), aumento de disfuncion cognitiva y emocional (Deckersbach et al., 2011), asi como con costes economicos y sociales sustanciales (Batelaan et al., 2007; de Graaf, Tuithof y van Dorsselaer 2012).\nLa terapia cognitivo-conductual ha sido ampliamente estudiada y es un tratamiento psicologico eficaz para el trastorno de panico (Hoffart et al., 2016; Kaczkurkin y Foa, 2015; Porter y Chambless, 2015; Sanchez-Meca et al., 2010; Arch y Craske, 2009; Hoffmann y Smits, 2008). La duracion promedio del tratamiento es de 12 a 15 sesiones, pero incluso los tratamientos mas breves han demostrado ser eficaces siempre que estos tratamientos mantengan los elementos centrales de la intervencion estandar (Taylor, Jakubovski y Bloch, 2015). Las dos formas principales de terapia cognitivo conductual desarrolladas para el trastorno de panico han sido el tratamiento de control de panico del grupo de Barlow (Barlow y Cerny, 1998; Barlow y Craske, 2000) y la terapia cognitiva del grupo de Clark (Clark y Salkovskis, 1989). Ambos tratamientos incluyen los componentes de psicoeducacion acerca del panico, reestructuracion cognitiva, la exposicion a las sensaciones corporales interoceptivas temidas y exposicion en vivo a situaciones temidas, pero dando mayor peso a la exposicion el grupo de Barlow y al componente cognitivo el grupo de Clark.\nAunque el tratamiento para el trastorno de panico ha demostrado un exito significativo, hay mucho margen de mejora, las tasas de respuesta inadecuada al tratamiento (Smits et al., 2012; Frentz et al., 2014; Gloster et al., 2015; Bandelow y Ruther, 2004) y la necesidad de tratamiento adicional permanecen altas (Arch, Wolitzky-Taylor, Eifert, y Craske, 2012; Casey et al., 2004; Bandelow y Ruther, 2004; Smits et al., 2012, Frentz et al., 2014; Landon y Barlow, 2004; Smits et al., 2012, Frentz et al., 2014). Por lo tanto, sigue habiendo una clara necesidad de nuevas estrategias terapeuticas, combinaciones de las ya existentes o bien, personalizar el tratamiento segun las caracteristicas del paciente, para aumentar las tasas de respuesta al tratamiento, especialmente entre pacientes refractarios.\nSi bien hay muchos tratamientos cognitivo-conductuales bien establecidos para los trastornos de ansiedad y el panico, la investigacion centrada en la mejora de los factores de riesgo permanece aun en una etapa incipiente (Feldner, Zvolensky y Schmidt, 2004; Schmidt et al., 2007; Schmidt y Keough, 2010). En los ultimos anos se ha ido abriendo paso el interes por el estudio de los factores de riesgo para el panico asi como el desarrollo de intervenciones eficaces para el tratamiento de los mismos (Zvolensky, Schmidt, Bernstein y Keough, 2006). En el caso del trastorno de panico, se sabe que un factor de riesgo cognitivo es la sensibilidad a la ansiedad y que es una variable de diferencias individuales bien establecida que refleja una tendencia estable a temer las sensaciones corporales asociadas con la excitacion ansiosa (Reiss y McNally, 1985). \nPor otro lado, pese a contar con un gran numero de estudios donde se demuestra la eficacia de las terapias cognitivo-conductuales para el panico, estos se basan en paquetes terapeuticos que constan habitualmente de unas 12-15 sesiones (Taylor, Jakubovski y Bloch, 2015). Recientemente han adquirido especial enfasis los estudios de programas de tratamiento mas breves y facilmente aplicables en los servicios de Salud Mental a los que puedan acceder un mayor numero de pacientes (Deacon y Abramowitz, 2006; McHugth, Smits y Otto, 2009; Keough y Schmidt, 2014).\nHasta la fecha, la mayor intervencion centrada en la reduccion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad se ha llevado a cabo por Schmidt et al. (2007) y Schmidt y Keough (2010). Ha sido realizada sobre individuos no clinicos con alto indice de sensibilidad a la ansiedad mediante los programas ASAT (Anxiety Sensitivity Amelioration Training) y el protocolo revisado ASERT (Anxiety Sensitivity Education and Reduction Training), consiguiendose una reduccion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad cercana del 60% en un mes de seguimiento comparado con un grupo control (Keough y Schmidt, 2012; Schmidt et al., 2014). \nEn nuestro pais no contamos con estudios donde se evalue la eficacia de tratamientos breves que tengan como diana terapeutica la disminucion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad aplicados en el entorno de un Centro de Salud Mental, sobre muestras clinicas.\nEl presente estudio tuvo como objetivo evaluar la eficacia en la disminucion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad de un tratamiento breve (una sesion) con dos componentes (psicoeducacion y exposicion interoceptiva) en pacientes con trastorno de panico con o sin agorafobia. Para ello se realizo un diseno cuasi-experimental de dos grupos de pacientes adultos (edad 18-65 anos) del Centro de Salud Mental de Pontones (Madrid) con trastorno de panico. El grupo experimental lo formaron 37 pacientes y el grupo control 39, con medidas pre, postratamiento y de seguimiento al mes y a los tres meses tras el tratamiento, a los cuales, al grupo experimental se le aplico un tratamiento basado en psicoeducacion y exposicion interoceptiva y al grupo control, un tratamiento-placebo basado en psicoeducacion general para la salud. A los pacientes se les administro en cada momento de la evaluacion el Indice de Sensibilidad a la Ansiedad que evalua el miedo a los sintomas fisiologicos, cognitivos y sociales de la ansiedad; la subescala Rasgo del Inventario de Ansiedad Estado-Rasgo que evalua un factor que comprenderia las diferencias individuales, relativamente estables, para responder ante situaciones percibidas como amenazantes con un aumento en la ansiedad (ansiedad rasgo) y la Escala de Inadaptacion que evalua en que medida el trastorno de panico afecta a diferentes areas de la vida cotidiana del sujeto como trabajo, vida social, tiempo libre, relacion de pareja y convivencia familiar, junto con una valoracion global\nLos resultados indicaron que el tratamiento basado el psicoeducacion para el panico y exposicion interoceptiva disminuyo significativamente los niveles de sensibilidad a la ansiedad asi como la interferencia que el trastorno de panico producia en la vida de los sujetos, efectos, ambos, que el tratamiento-placebo no logro. Se observo tambien que el tratamiento experimental, asi como el control-placebo, no lograron cambios significativos en la variable ansiedad-rasgo. Los cambios observados aumentaron en el seguimiento.\nSe puede concluir que el tratamiento compuesto por psicoeducacion para el panico y exposicion interoceptiva se muestra eficaz para disminuir la sensibilidad a la ansiedad y el grado de interferencia que el trastorno de panico produce en la vida de los pacientes y que el tamano del efecto del tratamiento es grande y se incrementa con el paso del tiempo. La sensibilidad a la ansiedad como diatesis cognitiva para el trastorno de panico se ha mostrado como una diana terapeutica maleable en los pacientes con trastorno de panico. Sin embargo, el tratamiento experimental no se ha mostrado eficaz para disminuir la variable ansiedad-rasgo.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a disorder which occurs in a large number of people, it can have a lot of different causes. Short lasting (acute) insomnias are mostly results of stressful situations which a person experiences in his or hers life, and they usually end when the source of the stress is removed. Chronic insomias have different causes and they are frequently associated with psyhological problems. Treatment of insomnia, depending on the severity, cause and the individual patient, can be simple or very complicated. Acute insomnia usually doesn't require special therapy, or if therapy is needed it is not long lasting and usually it doesn't show severe complications with it's use. Chronic insomnia can have different causes and it's therapy is usually long lasting. Pharmacotherapeutic possibilities of insomia treatment are usually based on administration of benzodiazepine receptor antagonists (benzodiazepines and Z-drugs), but there are other options, such as antidepressants, ramelteon, melatonin, valerian, H1-antihistaminics and L-tryptophan. Benzodiazepine receptor antagonists show good results in shortening sleep onset latency, sleep duaration and sleep quality. Problems with the use of bendodiazepine receptor agonists are shown in daytime simptoms (fatigue, hangovers, restlessness) and the possibility of tolerance and dependence after longer use. Non pharmacological treatment are thought of as different methods of psyhological bihevioral therapy. The advantage here is that they show good results in shortening sleep onset latency, sleep duaration and sleep quality, and they are safe as a long term therapy option. The problem with this type of therapy is that it is expensive, it requiers specially trained experts and it doesn't show immediate results. Combined therapy has all the advantages of psyhological bihevioral therapy, with avoiding side effects which occure with pharmacological treatments. Alternative methods, such as acupuncture, acupressure, yoga and tay-chi are other methods of insomnia treatment, but there are not a lot of studies in this field, and the ones that have been made have inconsistent results. When choosing a therapy option, one should always have in mind that it can be long lasting, and therefore the individuality of each patient should get the most attention, so the best possible, but affordable option can be determined.",

      "abstract": "The concept of a 5-HT related, anxiety and/or aggression-driven, stressor-precipitated depression is formulated and discussed. It comprises the following elements. The 5-HT ergic disturbances found in some depressed individuals - and of them particularly lowered CSF 5-HIAA - are linked to the anxiety- and the aggression-components of the depressive sydrome. In this type of depression - called 5-HT related depression - dysregulation of anxiety and/or aggression are primordial and mood lowering is a derivative phenomenon. In other words this is a group of anxiety/aggression-driven depressions. The 5-HT ergic impairment in certain types of depression is a trait-phenomenon, ie, persists during remission. This disturbance makes the individual susceptable for perturbation of anxiety- and aggression-regulation. Anxiety and (overt or suppressed) anger, are core constituents of the stress-syndrome. Thus, the 5-HT ergic disturbance will induce a heightened sensitivity for stressful events, ie, the latter will induce more readily than normal, stress phenomena , among which anxiety and anger. The latter psychological features induce lowering of mood and thus \"drive\" the patient into a fullblown depression. Furthermore it is predicted that anxiolytics and serenics (ie, anti-aggressive drugs) that act via normalisation of 5-HT ergic circuits, will exert a antidepressant effect in 5-HT related depression, in addition to their therapeutic actions in anxiety disorders and states of increased aggressiveness, respectively. The exact nature of the 5-HT ergic impairment in 5-HT related depression has yet to be elucidated.",

This article reviews both clinical and biologic predictors of treatment response and makes recommendations for future studies. The tricyclic antidepressants remain the drugs of choice in major depressive disorders. Lithium has a place in bipolar depressions. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors have a role in depressions accompanied by marked anxiety and/or panic symptoms, in patients who have previously responded to them, and as a second-choice treatment in those depressed patients who have not responded to tricyclic antidepressants. Electroconvulsive therapy or additional antipsychotic drugs are frequently necessary in very severe and delusional depressions. Biologic predictors of response, despite some interesting leads that may in the long term be of considerable importance, are not yet sufficiently established to be of routine clinical usefulness, although either dexamethasone nonsuppression or a shortened rapid eye movement latency may identify depressed patients who require biologic treatment.",

Also, some of them have been shown to be effective in the depressive phase of unipolar mood illness.

He was brought to the emergency room in a state of hyporeflexic coma. All parameters were normal except for a very discrete metabolic alkalosis and severe hypokalemia with 1,3 millimoles of potassium. General measures and complementary examinations were performed. Potassium values were replenished. As the potassium values standardized, a process of consciousness recovery was initiated. It was interpreted as a hypokalemic coma. Conclusions: hypopotassemia is a common imbalance, with repercussions in the different systems; this imbalance can result in alterations of the cardiovascular dynamics, progressive muscle weakness and coma. Therefore, in case of symptoms similar to hypokalemia, it is required to work on its diagnosis and treatment.",

In clinical practice it is important to distinguish between idiopathic chronic fatigue (primary or functional asthenia) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Fatigue can also be classified by neuromuscular and/or cognitive and mental fatigue. The article discusses the neuroanatomical basis and focuses on the neurocognitive theory of pathological fatigue. In addition the relationship between mental stress, fatigue and cognitive impairments such as subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are also discussed. We discuss the rationale that for treatment of asthenic conditions accompanied by cognitive dysfunction it is justified to use combination therapy - fonturacetam and a preparation containing nicotinoyl-GABA and Ginkgo Biloba.Астенические состояния характеризуются повышенной утомляемостью, нарушением повседневного функционирования и снижением работоспособности.

In assessing for the clinical significance of obsessions, persistence is first assessed, followed by distress and resistance. The interviewer should list and rate each obsession identified by the child using the Feelings Thermometer. Meanwhile, in assessing for compulsions, the frequency of the repetitive behavior is rated. Diagnosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder requires the presence of persistent obsessions, which are repetitive and difficult to control, and/or compulsions, or both (more than 1 hour each day). In addition, the symptoms must cause marked distress or cause significant interference in functioning. Recognition by the child that the symptoms are excessive or unreasonable is not necessary to make the diagnosis in children.",

The diagnostic criteria require the history of one or more depressive episodes in the absence of a history of mania. In contrast to adults, youth may experience predominantly irritable rather than sad mood. The assessment of depression should include a psychiatric evaluation, medical history, and focused laboratory studies to rule out medical and/or substance-related causes. The evaluation should also consider potential precipitants such as recent losses, interpersonal problems, or trauma. The patient should be asked directly about suicidal ideation, plans, and past attempts. Psychotherapy alone or in combination with antidepressant therapy is effective for the treatment of pediatric depression. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) are the most well-studied psychotherapies. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line medication class and should be considered in moderate to severe cases of depression.",

The pathophysiology of fatigue is unknown. The role of various mechanisms has been suggested, including the effect of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6) on glutaminergic transmission, hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction, disturbances of astroglia metabolism and decreased levels of the neurotransmitters noradrenaline and serotonin. The diagnosis of fatigue syndrome is based on exclusion of depression and additional organic conditions (anaemia, cardiovascular disorders, kidney diseases or hypothyroidism). The treatment of fatigue syndrome is complex. Physical activity, rehabilitation, psychotherapy and avoidance of factors which may increase fatigue, such as fever, anxiety, depression, pain, sleep disturbances, as well as some drugs like opioids and benzodiazepines, are important. Pharmacological treatment leads to slight improvement. Amantadine, modafinil and pemoline are administered to such patients.",

      "abstract": "In this chapter, we examine some of the pharmacological properties of benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and other sedative-hypnotic compounds, including orexin (hypocretin) receptor antagonists and melatonin receptor agonists (Figure 43–1 ). Sedative drugs moderate excitement, decrease activity, and induce calmness, whereas hypnotic drugs produce drowsiness and facilitate the onset and maintenance of a state that resembles normal sleep in its electroencephalographic characteristics. Although these agents are central nervous system (CNS) depressants, they usually produce therapeutic effects at dosages much lower than those that cause coma and generalized depression of the CNS. History of sedative-hypnotic development. Some sedative-hypnotic drugs retain other therapeutic uses as muscle relaxants (especially benzodiazepines), antiepileptics, or preanesthetic medications. Although benzodiazepines are used widely as antianxiety drugs, it is not known whether their effect on anxiety is truly distinct from their effect on sleepiness. Sedative-hypnotics are also important drugs for neuroscientists. These substances modulate basic behaviors such as arousal and response to stress. As our understanding of the molecular structure of the γ -aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A ) receptor has increased, the mechanisms of these drugs' cellular activity have become clearer. In 2000, it was learned that human narcolepsy with cataplexy was associated with deficiency of orexin (or hypocretin), a newly discovered neuropeptide (Nishino et al. 2000). Although replacement therapies for orexin-deficient narcolepsy using synthetic, small-molecule orexin receptor agonists are not yet available, a dual orexin receptor antagonist has been developed and was approved for the treatment of insomnia in 2014. Further understanding of the sedative-hypnotics' modes of action could thus help to elucidate the neurochemical and neurophysiological processes that control sleep and sleep-related physiology and behaviors.",

Episodes could be provoked by stress, heat, or excitement. The patient had a history of multiple drug abuse. He described relief of neurologic symptoms after amphetamine consumption. The patient was currently treated for depression with psychosomatic symptoms but had never received anticonvulsants. Routine laboratory testing revealed a slight increase of creatine kinase, creatinine, and liver enzymes. Recurrent episodes of intermittent cerebellar dysfunction with dysarthria and ataxia of gait, stance, and limbs suggested episodic ataxia (EA).",

When this responsibility is questioned as a result of some change in mental state, a clear cut and absolute statement of presence or absence of mental capacity seems to be expected. This is not necessarily a helpful approach or consistent with clinical observations. Where the individual is impaired due to alcohol, narcotics, barbituates and other drugs this limitation of mental capacity is rarely total. The situation is similar in states of fatigue, hunger or chronic illness, or even of emotional disturbance. The problem of impairment, even when only partial, is that a pattern of behaviour may emerge, due to disturbances in perception, judgment, and coordination which are grossly deviant from that of the individual in a sober state and do not represent his desire or intent in that state. The extent to which this person is addicted and the extent to which permanent brain damage exists also influence the degree of manifest disturbance when alcohol or drugs are used. These have pertinence in considering the culpability of persons accused of murder and other serious crimes, especially in attempting to determine appropriate sentence or disposal.",

Desde hace aproximadamente un año, el paciente refiere percepciones visuales de pequeños animales (“bichos”) que asocia con palomas o gallinas, así como sensaciones táctiles compatibles con formicación. Estas percepciones son interpretadas como infestación corporal, llegando a relacionarlas con la ingesta alimentaria o vía nasal. No se evidencian lesiones dérmicas ni signos objetivos de infestación. El uso de insecticida ha sido reforzador de la convicción delirante. La sintomatología se presenta en el contexto de pérdida visual severa, sin evidencia de psicosis activa ni trastorno del ánimo mayor, aunque se detecta componente afectivo reactivo vinculado al duelo prolongado por fallecimiento de su esposa. Se han considerado dos entidades clínicas como principales diagnósticos diferenciales: el síndrome de Charles Bonnet (alucinaciones visuales complejas secundarias a déficit visual, sin ideación delirante estructurada)1 y el síndrome de Ekbom o delirio de parasitosis (trastorno delirante somático caracterizado por creencia firme de infestación, frecuentemente acompañado de alucinaciones táctiles)2. Dado el contenido delirante persistente, la falta de crítica y la asociación con conductas compensatorias (uso de insecticida), el cuadro clínico se orienta hacia un síndrome de Ekbom con posible base sensorial y afectiva. Se recomienda intervención interdisciplinar con Psiquiatría para valorar inicio de tratamiento antipsicótico a dosis ajustadas a edad y comorbilidad, revisión de tratamiento psicotrópico (trazodona, zolpidem) y activación de redes de apoyo social. Este caso ilustra la complejidad diagnóstica de los trastornos perceptivos en el adulto mayor, así como la interacción entre déficits sensoriales, factores afectivos y creencias delirantes en el contexto geriátrico5.",

      "abstract": "Most people who suffer serious traumatic brain injury (TBI) have a period of loss of consciousness and post-traumatic amnesia that typically means that they do not recall the moment of injury itself. They may also have a gap in memory stretching from some time prior to injury to some time after the injury. Therefore despite going through the traumatic experience of a motor vehicle accident or assault or fall the individual may have no recollection of the incident itself. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mood disorder characterized by re-experiencing (flashbacks, nightmares), avoidance and arousal symptoms (e.g. hypervigilance) in relation to having experienced, witnessed or been confronted by an event involving death or serious injury that results in feelings of fear, helplessness or horror (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). In the context of amnesia for the traumatic event, the question as to whether PTSD can occur after TBI, has been the subject of some debate (Sbordone and Liter 1995; Bryant et al. 2000; Williams et al. 2002; Sumpter and McMillan 2006). However, it is generally accepted now that, through various different mechanisms, PTSD can occur after TBI (Bryant, 2001). Some people who suffer a closed head injury have partial recall of the incident (Creamer et al. 2005) with some experiencing specific ‘islands’ of memory for traumatic events (King, 1997).",

Sleep apnea syndromes are classified as obstructive, central or mixed: obstructive when the respiratory muscles continue to contract but airflow is not obtained, central when respiratory effort is not present, and mixed when elements of both obstructive and central apnea are present. Approximately 4 percent of adult men and 2 percent of adult women are believed to have these conditions. In addition to having symptoms such as snoring, headaches, depression, decreased libido and fatigue, patients with sleep apnea are at risk for a range of severe complications secondary to recurrent hypoxia and hypercapnia during sleep. Diagnosis may require an overnight polysomnogram in addition to the history, a physical examination and a laboratory assessment. Less cumbersome diagnostic modalities are being developed. Treatment options include weight reduction, change in sleeping position, avoidance of sedatives, use of continuous positive airway pressure and surgical treatment.",

      "title": "Alcohol-Induced Blackout",
      "abstract": "Blackouts from acute alcohol ingestion are defined as the inability to recall events that occurred during a drinking episode and are highly prevalent in both alcoholic and nonalcoholic populations. This article reviews the clinical manifestations, epidemiology, risk factors, cognitive impairment, and neurobiology associated with alcohol-induced blackout, with special emphasis on the neurochemical and neurophysiological basis, and gender differences. Two types of blackout have been identified: en bloc, or complete inability to recall events during a time period, and fragmentary, where memory loss is incomplete. The rapidity of rise in blood alcohol concentration is the most robust predictor of blackout. Alcohol impairs different brain functions at different rates, and cognitive and memory performance are differentially impaired by ascending versus descending blood alcohol concentration. Cognitive and memory impairment occurs before motor impairment, possibly explaining how a drinker appearing fully functional can have little subsequent memory. Blackouts are caused by breakdown in the transfer of short-term memory into long-term storage and subsequent retrieval primarily through dose-dependent disruption of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell activity. The exact mechanism is believed to involve potentiation of gamma-aminobutyric acid-alpha-mediated inhibition and interference with excitatory hippocampal N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation, resulting in decreased long-term potentiation. Another possible mechanism involves disrupted septohippocampal theta rhythm activity because of enhanced medial septal area gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic neurotransmission. Women are more susceptible to blackouts and undergo a slower recovery from cognitive impairment than men, due in part to the effect of gender differences in pharmacokinetics and body composition on alcohol bioavailability.",

They increase the availability of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, as well as tyramine. The side effect profile of MAOIs can be attributed to alterations in neurotransmitter concentrations as a result of MAO inhibition, the anticholinergic properties of the drugs, and interactions with other medications. The anesthesia provider needs to ensure careful perioperative management of patients on these medications to provide drug-drug interactions and a safe anesthetic.",

      "abstract": "La toxicité cérébrale du cannabis est marquée principalement par des effets cognitifs, addictifs et psychotomimétiques. Troubles cognitifs Plusieurs études ont montré que l’administration aiguë de Δ-9-THC, principal principe actif du cannabis, et que la consommation régulière de cannabis entraînaient des troubles de l’attention, de la mémoire, en particulier de la mémoire de travail et de la mémoire épisodique ainsi que des troubles des fonctions exécutives. Ces troubles ont un impact sur l’apprentissage, les acquisitions scolaires, la conduite d’un véhicule et les tâches complexes. Ils sont liés à la dose, à la fréquence, à la durée d’exposition et à l’âge de la première consommation. Ils peuvent disparaître après sevrage, mais des anomalies durables s’observent chez les sujets ayant débuté leur consommation avant l’âge de 15 ans. Effets addictifs La fréquence sur la vie entière de la dépendance au cannabis, caractérisée essentiellement par le craving , la perte de contrôle de la consommation et le retentissement important sur la vie familiale/professionnelle/sociale est, d’après certaines études, de 1 % en population générale. Le syndrome de sevrage, décrit en 2004, pourrait être inclus dans le DSM-5. Effets psychotomimétiques Fréquents, les symptômes psychotiques induits par la consommation de cannabis (idées de référence, de persécution) disparaissent spontanément dans les 24 heures. Ils durent parfois plusieurs semaines dans les pharmacopsychoses. Neuf études longitudinales ont montré que les sujets qui avaient fumé du cannabis avaient deux fois plus de risque environ que les sujets abstinents, de présenter ultérieurement des troubles psychotiques. Le risque, dose-dépendant, est plus élevé lorsque la consommation de cannabis a débuté avant l’âge de 15 ans et chez les sujets qui ont des antécédents familiaux de troubles psychotiques. L’évolution de la schizophrénie est aggravée par la consommation de cannabis. Toxicité cérébrale du cannabis Elle est liée à l’interaction du Δ-9-THC sur les récepteurs cannabinoïdes cérébraux CB1, localisés principalement dans l’hippocampe, le cervelet, le cortex frontal, le striatum et les ganglions de la base. Plusieurs études ont retrouvé que la consommation de cannabis pouvait interférer avec le système endocannabinoïde cérébral lors de la maturation du cerveau à l’adolescence. Elle favorise aussi des troubles vasculaires cérébraux. Les études d’imagerie cérébrale ont retrouvé que les effets du cannabis, modérés en cas d’usage simple, étaient marqués chez les consommateurs réguliers par une diminution dose-dépendante de la densité de substance grise au niveau de l’hippocampe, des régions parahippocampiques et de l’amygdale.",

No references for antiepileptic drugs and especially for lamotrigine are known regarding pharmacologically induced RBD. Case Report: We report a case of a 68-year-old man already suffering from RBD, who developed very brief episodes of epigastric discomfort followed by impaired consciousness and was given a diagnosis of epilepsy. Lamotrigine was started at 25 mg/d, reached a maximum of 100 mg/d after 2 months and was retained at this dose for 1 more month. During this period there was a slight decrease in the episodes of impaired consciousness and no appreciable changes in the frequency and intensity of RBD symptomatology. Immediately following the abrupt discontinuation of lamotrigine, RBD symptomatology was severely aggravated, with dreams becoming more vivid and frightening and occurring almost every night. RBD symptomatology gradually subsided over 2 months, reaching levels comparable to those before lamotrigine. The impaired consciousness episodes remained unaffected and were considered to be nonepileptic. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that abrupt withdrawal of lamotrigine may worsen symptoms of comorbid idiopathic RBD.",

      "title": "What treatment options exist for alcohol abuse?",
      "abstract": "A 47-year-old man with a long history of alcohol dependence and impaired control over intake has refused all the approaches suggested to him (e.g., detoxification followed by residential treatment, Alcoholics Anonymous, cognitive–behavioural therapy). He maintains a reasonable psychosocial adjustment (i.e., family relations, work, leisure), and physical damage (neurological, cardiovascular, liver functions) is still minimal. What can his family physician offer him?\r\n\r\nAmong the emotional and psychological problems treated by primary care physicians, alcoholism is one of the most frequent. However, little of the accumulated knowledge in alcoholism research over the past 20 years has percolated to clinical practice. Psychopharmacological agents in alcohol abuse treatment are largely ignored. At least 3 reasons are easy to identify:\r\n\r\n· Alcohol dependence, when not too severe, is not perceived as an addiction and is not put on the same footing as addictions to illicit substances.\r\n\r\n· Craving for alcohol is not linked with the long-term alterations in neuronal activity of neurotransmitter systems that alcohol abuse induces.\r\n\r\n· Their effects on treatment retention and drinking outcomes are significant but modest. The placebo groups in the clinical trials show usually so much improvement (Malec E, et al. Buspirone in the treatment of alcohol dependence: a placebo-controlled trial. Alcohol Clin Exp Res 1996;20:307-12; Kranzler HR. Pharmacotherapy of alcoholism: gaps in knowledge and opportunities for research. Alcohol Alcohol 2000;35:537-47) that large samples are necessary to demonstrate the superiority of the active medication. What does it mean? That the most important factor in the control group resides in the patient motivation (belief, expectation, readiness to change) and in the therapist's skill in enhancing motivation.\r\n\r\nThe good news concerning the psychotherapeutic approach in alcoholism is that current evidence shows that a brief intervention, easy to learn by nonspecialists, is among the most efficacious and not inferior to more intensive and more costly approaches. Severe cases, as well as less severe ones, can be handled in that way (Miller WR, Rollnick S. Motivational interviewing. 2nd ed. New York: Guilford Press; 2002). Treatment consists of detailed assessment, feedback, an empathic and nonconfrontational approach and systematic resolution of ambivalence.\r\n\r\nAmong the pharmacological adjuvants that can facilitate such brief interventions are opioid antagonists (naltrexone [50 mg/d], approved by the US FDA in 1994, and acamprosate [1.3–2 g/d], in use in Europe for 14 years and currently under review by the FDA). They interfere with the brain neurotransmitter systems that produce the rewarding effects of alcohol and have been shown to contribute significantly to prolong abstinence. Craving scores fall significantly within a few weeks. These antidipsotropic medications are low risk. Lengths of trials have extended to 1 year or more. Reported side effects for naltrexone are nausea, headaches, dizziness and arthralgia; renal insufficiency is the only known contraindication of acamprosate.\r\n\r\nOther psychopharmacological agents, such as buspirone or bromocriptine, contribute to the improvement of alcohol-induced psychopathology (anxiety, depression, aggressiveness), but have no demonstrated effect on craving and relapse prevention.\r\n\r\nThe family physician's current best choice is to learn the motivational interviewing principles and techniques, combined or not with anticraving medication.",

      "abstract": "Participation in endurance activities is popular and growing. Proper hydration is important for performance and to avoid medical complications. Overconsumption of fluids, in combination with inadequate secretion of the hormone arginine vasopressin can lead to exercise associated hyponatremia (EAH). These two factors are the main underlying mechanism for the development of EAH, leading to water retention and a dilutional hyponatremia. EAH is defined biochemically by serum \nsodium concentrations < 135 mol/L during or up to 24 hours after exercise. Athletes may be asymptomatic, or symptomatic, with mild cases presenting with non-specific symptoms and signs, such as nausea, vomiting or weight gain. Severe cases or cases of exercise associated hyponatremic encephalopathy (EAHE) may present with headaches, altered mental state, seizures or coma and represent a medical emergency. Treatment is warranted with intravenous hypertonic saline solution and can be lifesaving. Other risk factors include exercise duration over 4 hours, exercising in the heat or humid conditions, event inexperience, inadequate training, slow running pace, high or low body mass index (BMI) and free availability of fluids at races. Prevention can generally be achieved by adhering to appropriate hydration strategies, such as drinking to thirst. \nEducation of athletes, coaches and medical personnel about EAH is important and may help reducing the incidence of EAH and prevent further fatalities.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy can be accompanied by changes in cognition, personality, affect, and other elements of behavior. There is no single epileptic constitution or personality complex. A unifying theme to the behavior in epilepsy is diversity. As one looks at the behavioral traits reported in epilepsy, a specific and consistent pattern is lacking. Rather, extremes of behavior are accentuated: sometimes in one direction, often in both directions. Changes in emotional state are prominent among behavioral features in epilepsy. Some authors describe a prominent deepening or increase in emotionality, whereas others identify a global decrease in emotional life and content. Emotional lability is also reported. Sexuality and libido are typically decreased, but fetishism, transvestism, exhibitionism, and hypersexual episodes also occur. Concerns over morality may be lacking or exaggerated. Patients may be irritable and aggressive or timid and apathetic. The impressive list of people with epilepsy in politics, religion, arts, and sciences suggests a positive expression of this behavioral spectrum. Psychosis, depression, paranoia, and personality disorders may represent a negative pole of epilepsy-related behavioral changes. The most important aspect of behavioral changes in epilepsy for physicians is to recognize and treat dysfunctional behavior. Depression is a common problem that is often unrecognized and untreated. Other treatable problems include impotence, anxiety, panic attacks, and psychosis. Identifying risk factors will, it is hoped, assist in developing methods to prevent these disorders.",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction is prevalent among psychiatric patients and may be related to both the psychopathology and the pharmacotherapy. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia limit the capability for interpersonal and sexual relationships. The first-generation antipsychotics cause further deterioration in erectile and orgasmic function. Due to their weak antagonistic activity at D2 receptors, second-generation antipsychotics are associated with fewer sexual side effects, and thus may provide an option for schizophrenia patients with sexual dysfunction. Depression and anxiety are a cause for sexual dysfunction that may be aggravated by antidepressants, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction may be overcome by lowering doses, switching to an antidepressant with low propensity to cause sexual dysfunction (bupropion, mirtazapine, nefazodone, reboxetine), addition of 5HT2 antagonists (mirtazapine, mianserin) or coadministration of 5-phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Eating disorders and personality disorders, mainly borderline personality disorder, are also associated with sexual dysfunction. Sexual dysfunction in these cases stems from impaired interpersonal relationships and may respond to adequate psychosexual therapy. It is mandatory to identify the specific sexual dysfunction and to treat the patients according to his/her individual psychopathology, current pharmacotherapy and interpersonal relationships.",

The prevalence of depressive mood states in survivors varies by measure and follow-up time, but the median prevalence across &gt;30 studies was 28% (mostly measured within a year of critical illness). Severe depressive states (e.g. major depressive episodes) are less common than minor depressive states. Risk factors include female sex, lesser educational attainment, unemployment, and medical and psychiatric comorbidity. Potential critical illness/intensive care-related risk factors include severity of organ failure, high-dose benzodiazepine administration, longer ICU stays, stressful ICU experiences, and early post-intensive care distress. Depressive symptoms in survivors are associated with impaired physical function, other psychiatric morbidity, cognitive and work difficulties, and lower health-related quality of life. Research is needed to evaluate the preventive or therapeutic role of psychological interventions during intensive care and psychological recovery programmes.",

      "title": "Typical clinical manifestations of anxiety and depression in patients with medical illness and general notions about their treatment",
      "abstract": "Abstract Anxiety and depression are common psychiatric comorbidities in chronic medical illnesses, such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and neurological diseases. These conditions are associated with greater disease severity, poorer functional outcomes, and reduced quality of life for patients and their families. Despite their significant global burden, they are often underdiagnosed due to overlapping symptoms with primary medical conditions. Symptoms in medically ill patients may differ from classic psychiatric presentations, often involving heterogeneous (psycho)somatic phenomena like fatigue, autonomic irregularities, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairments. Anxiety typically manifests as hypervigilance, excessive worry, and irritability, while depression presents with persistent sadness, psychomotor slowing, and loss of motivation, pleasure, and interest. Subsyndromal symptoms, though often untreated, can exacerbate functional decline and disease progression. Effective management requires a multimodal approach, with modern psychopharmacotherapy as a cornerstone. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) are recommended first-line treatments due to their safety and efficacy. In case of insufficient response, add-on strategies may include second-generation antipsychotics, lithium, esketamine, or pregabalin for predominant anxiety. Emerging evidence supports the use of phytotherapeutics as Silexan and Rhodiola rosea for subsyndromal symptoms. Non-pharmacological interventions also play an important role. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy remains the first-line psychotherapeutic option, complemented by mindfulness techniques, psychoeducation, biofeedback, and relaxation strategies, particularly for anxiety. Chronobiological treatments like bright-light therapy and sleep deprivation have proven effective for depression, especially in seasonal patterns. Brain stimulation methods, including transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy, may also be considered based on individual needs. Importantly, successful physician-patient interactions, directly and promptly addressing emotional and psychological concerns during consultations and daily rounds, are crucial in fostering treatment adherence and improving outcomes. In conclusion, anxiety and depression in medically ill patients present unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Early recognition and individualized, multimodal treatment strategies can enhance adherence and outcomes. Integrating pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches within collaborative care models and recommended treatment algorithms is essential for effectively addressing individual clinical presentations.

Zolpidem is an imidazopyridine that is reported to have similar sedative properties to the benzodiazepines but minimal effects as an anxiolytic, muscle relaxant or anticonvulsant. It has a rapid onset, short duration of action and is metabolized in liver through CYP450 system. Zolpidem is extensively used as a hypnotic in short term management of insomnia. There have been reports of hepatic encephalopathy induced by this medication. Hepatic encephalopathy is characterized by confusion, altered level of consciousness and potentially coma and death. It results from liver failure and the accumulation of toxic substances in the blood stream such as nitrogenous waste products, of which ammonia is the most commonly measured. There is increased activity of the inhibitory gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) system and the energy supply to other brain cells is decreased. The diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy is a clinical one and serum ammonia levels are elevated in 90% of patients.",

However, clinical experience increasingly asserts that the phenothiazines influence many manifestations of schizophrenic patients other than anxiety and excitement, including symptoms such as incoherent thought and apathy.",

      "title": "1699 – Long lasting personality changes after the onset of dissociative amnesia",
      "abstract": "Across various cultures, dissociative amnesia is triggered by psychological stress or trauma. Its hallmark is a severe (usually retrograde) memory impairment, occurring without evidence of significant brain damage (as detected by conventional structural brain imaging). In a substantial number of cases, the memory impairment follows a chronic course. Sometimes dissociative amnesia occurs on a background of a personality disorder (narcissistic or borderline). Other times, amnesia itself triggers long lasting personality changes. This work's objectives are establishing greater recognition among health care providers of the spectrum of the personality changes that may accompany chronic forms of dissociative amnesia. We review data from own patients with chronic forms of dissociative amnesia. Patients were investigated medically, psychiatrically, neuropsychologically and and neuroradiologically. Changes in personality dimensions occur after the onset of amnesia. These may involve affectivity, perception (e.g. impaired self face or face-emotion processing), cognition (e.g. social cognition) and behaviour (e.g. changing in eating, smoking, drinking or working habits). The observed personality changes may represent a consequence of amnesia. Functional imaging studies show metabolic changes in dissociative amnesia in brain areas involved in conscious mnemonic processing. Several structures engaged in processing within episodic-autobiographical memory system were also implicated in self and reward-related processing. Alternatively, the personality changes may be viewed as being pivotal in the development and maintenance of dissociative amnesia; this personality shift may subsequently lead to enduring changes in ways of cognitive processing, self-processing, perception and affect.",

      "abstract": "The public health relevance of hangover is in its potential effects on occupational safety and performance. Apart from pharmacological effects of ethanol and congeners, psychosocial factors also contribute to morning-after feelings, particularly the emotions of shame and guilt. Tobacco smoking increases the hangover's incidence and severity, explained by pharmacological effects of nicotine and other smoke constituents. During a drinking binge, many people would smoke more than usual; some intermittent smokers or those who gave up would restart. The hangover \"curing\" with beer or vodka the next morning (hair of the dog) may contribute to negative affectivity in the long run, as it implies a cycle of alcohol consumption and shame. Some individuals experience a temporary symptomatic relief after a hair of the dog drink. According to our observations, if the \"curing\" is accompanied by smoking, the elevated mood in some people would more easily shift to dysphoria, irritation or depression. Psychological mechanisms thereof are discussed here. Besides, the problem of smoking in psychiatric hospitals is briefly discussed. In conclusion, smoking can exacerbate hangover symptoms through both toxicological and psychosocial mechanisms. The problem of smoking in the settings of alcoholism and mental health problems should be further investigated.",

The prevalence of delirium in elderly patients admitting to hospital is 5-55% [1]. Delirium is a common neuropsychiatric syndrome that may occur in several different settings and one of them is vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency causes many cerebral cortex abnormalities such as confusion, mood and memory changes, delirium with or without hallucinations, depression and acute psychotic states [2,3]. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) describes the spectrum of potentially reversible neuropsychiatric abnormalities seen in patients with liver dysfunction after exclusion of unrelated neurologic and/or metabolic abnormalities. The clinical manifestations of HE is characterized by cognitive and motor deficits of varying severity without specific lesions in the central nervous system. The symptoms range from minimal changes in personality to coma, including delirium [4]. Usually, in the elderly patients with cirrhosis, it is hard to differentiate two clinical situations. Here we report a case of an elderly patient with cirrhosis who experienced delirium due to vitamin B12 deficiency, but was treated as HE before.",

      "abstract": "Se trata de una observacion clinica durante un periodo de dos anos de un joven de 21 anos que se presentaba muchas veces en urgencias por una fuerte angustia con importantes trastornos del comportamiento caracterizados por agitaciones psicomotrices, automutilaciones repetidas, amenazas o intentos de homicidio hacia el padre, impulsos frecuentes y a veces conductas antisociales (fugas, estados de peligrosidad). En sus trastornos subyacian muchas veces ideas de persecucion y de referencia. Habia tambien frecuentes intentos de suicidio vinculados con breves periodos depresivos en los que verbalizaba un gran sufrimiento afectivo, que el explicaba esencialmente por dificultades relacionales familiares y por acontecimientos traumaticos (maltrato parental, accidentes). Dos anos despues, el cuadro clinico se agravo con la aparicion de sintomas esquizofrenicos constituidos por un delirio paranoide, alucinaciones con automatismo mental, retraccion social, desorganizacion afectiva y comportamental que se sustituyeron totalmente en sus pasos al acto autoagresivos. Luego se han vuelto mas complejos con la observacion psicoterapica que abre la problematica sexual e identitaria del paciente.La observacion consistio en una escucha atenta durante las entrevistas psicoterapicas regulares que han permitido recorrer la historia evolutiva de esta patologia, al mismo tiempo que su estabilizacion. Nuestro objetivo era despejar una perspectiva clinica y evolutiva que tomara en cuenta la progresion de los sintomas en funcion del tiempo hasta la constitucion de una psicosis propiamente dicha. Limitado por la exploracion neurobiologica (balances, EEG, IRM cerebral) sin resultado aparente, el analisis semiologico de los sintomas del paciente, de sus escritos y de sus simbolos nos ha permitido investigar diferentes fases precoces de la enfermedad, asi como el analisis psicopatologico de sus sintomas.Resultados: Esta experiencia personal nos ha permitido determinar el primer sintoma, conocer el periodo inicial de los trastornos y sus relaciones con los factores de vulnerabilidad (trauma parental y genetico), describir su evolucion segun la edad y reconstituir los sintomas de transicion psicotica. El fin de este articulo es subrayar el papel preventivo de la atencion precoz de los trastornos prepsicoticos. Sin embargo, sigue en pie el interrogante sobre el impacto de la angustia en el desarrollo neuropsiquico del paciente y sobre el origen genetico de la enfermedad. Conclusion: Insistimos en el enfoque preventivo que consiste en detectar los sujetos con riesgos de transicion psicotica y pensar en realizar una psicoterapia adaptada.",

At doses of 1.5–7.5 mg/kg body mass it induces stimulation, mood improvement, motor impairment, and used at doses higher than 7.5 mg/kg b.m., it exerts dissociative effects. Adverse reactions are especially clear when DXM was taken with alcohol or substances affecting metabolic activity of cytochrome P450 CYP2D6. Among DXM users, some cases of psychological dependence and withdrawal symptoms were observed. Long-term use of DXM may be associated with cognitive function deterioration. The abuse of Tantum Rosa (a popular gynecological anti-inflammatory drug containing benzydamine) was described mainly in Brazil, Poland and Romania. It causes hallucinations (mainly visual) and \"flashbacks\" (short-term hallucinations despite not being under the influence of the psychedelic compound). Pseudoephedrine, an amphetamine-like stimulant, produces mood improvement or even euphoria, hallucinations and psychosis. However, the real health threat is associated with the use of substances produced from pseudoephedrine: ephedrone and methamphetamine. Coraz częstszym zjawiskiem, szczególnie wśród młodzieży, jest \"rekreacyjne\" zażywanie leków. Dotyczy to m.in. przyjmowania substancji działających przeciwzapalnie lub przeciwkaszlowo, które w dużych dawkach wykazują działanie psychoaktywne. Łatwo dostępne leki w odręcznej sprzedaży mogą skutkować występowaniem całej gamy objawów, w tym omamów lub euforii. Szczególnie często zażywanym lekiem jest dekstrometorfan (DXM). W dawkach 1,5–7,5 mg/kg m.c. powoduje pobudzenie, poprawę nastroju, zaburzenia motoryczne, a w dawkach >7,5 mg/kg m.c. wykazuje działanie dysocjacyjne. Działania niepożądane są szczególnie wyraźne, gdy przyjmowany jest z alkoholem lub substancjami wpływającymi na aktywność metaboliczną izoenzymu CYP2D6 cytochromu P450. U osób stosujących DXM obserwowano przypadki uzależnienia psychicznego i występowania objawów abstynencyjnych. Długotrwałe zażywanie DXM może pogarszać funkcje kognitywne. Z kolei nadużywanie Tantum Rosa – popularnego w ginekologii preparatu benzydaminy o działaniu przeciwzapalnym, przeciwbólowym i miejscowo znieczulającym – jest opisywane głównie w Brazylii, Polsce i Rumunii. Lek ten wywołuje omamy, najczęściej wzrokowe oraz występowanie tzw. flashbacks (krótkotrwałych halucynacji pojawiających się mimo niepozostawania pod wpływem substancji psychoaktywnych). Pseudoefedryna, należąca do grupy amfetaminopodobnych stymulantów, powoduje poprawę nastroju, a nawet euforię, omamy i psychozy. Zagrożenie stanowią pozyskiwane z niej substancje o silniejszym działaniu psychoaktywnym: efedron i metamfetamina.",

      "abstract": "Advanced and delayed sleep phase disorders, and the hypersomnia that can accompany winter depression, have been treated successfully by appropriately timed artificial bright light exposure. Under entrainment to the 24-h day-night cycle, the sleep-wake pattern may assume various phase relationships to the circadian pacemaker, as indexed, for example, by abnormally long or short intervals between the onset of melatonin production or the core body temperature minimum and wake-up time. Advanced and delayed sleep phase syndromes and non-24-h sleep-wake syndrome have been variously ascribed to abnormal intrinsic circadian periodicity, deficiency of the entrainment mechanism, or—most simply—patterns of daily light exposure insufficient for adequate phase resetting. The timing of sleep is influenced by underlying circadian phase, but psychosocial constraints also play a major role. Exposure to light early or late in the subjective night has been used therapeutically to produce corrective phase delays or advances, respectively, in both the sleep pattern and circadian rhythms. Supplemental light exposure in fall and winter can reduce the hypersomnia of winter depression, although the therapeutic effect may be less dependent on timing.",

      "title": "Suffering and the Dying Patient",
      "abstract": "SUMMARYSuffering in the dying patient derives from immediate sources of physical distress, perceived threats to the integrity of the self, and the psychological make up (memory, beliefs, expectations) of the individual at the end of life. The most common causes of somatic distress in dying patients with cancer are: (1) pain, (2) shortness of breath, and (3) nausea and/or vomiting. Other noteworthy problems include confusion, restlessness, itch, disturbed bladder and bowel function, sleep disruption, low energy, sedation and cachexia. Specific physiological mechanisms foster suffering in dying persons. These include tissue trauma, visceral distention and cardiovascular events. Neurological signals generated by tissue trauma or sensitization during inflammation lead to sensations of pain and also produce emotional arousal in noradrenergically innervated limbic brain structures. In addition, such signals stimulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. This creates a stress response which, if prolonged, disturbs circadian and ultracadian biological rhythms. One can direct preventative and palliative interventions toward such mechanisms. Patients also suffer because of unmet psychological needs or psychosocial problems. Identifying such needs or problems and addressing them can often contribute substantially to patient comfort. Since we have the resources to prevent or largely alleviate pain and other distressing conditions in the majority of cases, and care providers can meet most patients' psychological needs once they identify them, unaddressed suffering need not accompany death from cancer or other prolonged disease.",

      "title": "Cognitive Effects and Sedation",
      "abstract": "Cognitive effects and sedation (CES) are prevalent in chronic nonmalignant pain populations receiving long-term opioid therapy and are among the most common reasons patients discontinue opioid use. In this narrative review, we describe the phenomenology, epidemiology, mechanisms, assessment, and management of opioid-related CES. We reviewed the empirical and theoretical literature on CES in opioid-treated populations with chronic pain. Data on long-term opioid therapy (≥3 months in duration) in chronic nonmalignant pain patients were sought. The phenomenology of CES includes: inattention, concentration difficulties, memory deficits, psychomotor dysfunction, perceptual distortions, and executive dysfunction and somnolence, sleep disorders, and lethargy. Deficits may be caused by unrelieved pain or opioid therapy alone, or from a combination of these and other factors. Mechanisms include central nervous system effects, for example, direct toxic effects on neurons resulting in decreased consciousness; direct effects on processing and reaction resulting in cognitive or psychomotor impairment, and inhibitory effects on cholinergic activity. Pharmacological management approaches may include opioid dose reduction and rotation or psychostimulant use. Nonpharmacological approaches may include cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, acupuncture, exercise, and yoga. The most prevalent CES include: memory deficits (73–81%), sleep disturbance (35–57%), and fatigue (10%). At its most severe, extreme cognitive dysfunction can result in frank delirium and decreased alertness can result in coma. Emotional distress, sleep disorders, and other comorbidities and treatments can worsen CES, particularly among the elderly. Conclusions about the neuropsychological domains affected by opioids are limited due to the heterogeneity of studies and methodological issues.",

The diagnosis of VP is mainly based on the patient history and requires: A) at least ten attacks of spontaneous spinning or non-spinning vertigo; B) duration less than 1 minute; C) stereotyped phenomenology in a particular patient; D) response to a treatment with carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine; and F) not better accounted for by another diagnosis. Probable VP is defined as follows: A) at least five attacks of spinning or non-spinning vertigo; B) duration less than 5 minutes; C) spontaneous occurrence or provoked by certain head-movements; D) stereotyped phenomenology in a particular patient; E) not better accounted for by another diagnosis.Ephaptic discharges in the proximal part of the 8th cranial nerve, which is covered by oligodendrocytes, are the assumed mechanism. Important differential diagnoses are Menière's disease, vestibular migraine, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, epileptic vestibular aura, paroxysmal brainstem attacks (in multiple sclerosis or after brainstem stroke), superior canal dehiscence syndrome, perilymph fistula, transient ischemic attacks and panic attacks. Current areas of uncertainty in the diagnosis of VP are: a) MRI findings of vascular compression which are not diagnostic of the disease or predictive for the affected side because they are also observed in about 30% of healthy asymptomatic subjects; and b) response to treatment with carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine supports the diagnosis but there are so far no randomized controlled trials for treatment of VP.",

      "abstract": "Kumbhakarna was brother of the evil Raavana in the mythological tale of Ramayana. According the legend, Kumbhakarna had an insatiable appetite and thirst and used to sleep for great lengths of time. He also had an uncontrollable temper, which was feared by many. It is our assessment that Kumbhakarna possibly suffered from hypothalamic obesity. Hypothalamic obesity can be defined as significant polyphagia and weight gain that occurs because of structural or function involvement of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus bilaterally. The characteristic features are obesity associated with polyphagia. Somnolence is present in 40% of cases. Sham rage is a characteristic behavioral abnormality seen in these patients. All these symptoms are described in the mythological text while describing Kumbhakarna. The episodic nature of Kumbhakarna's symptoms can also be explained by another hypothalamic syndrome called Klein-Levine syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by with periodic episodes of somnolence, hyperphagia and hypersexuality along with other behavioral and cognitive difficulties.",

A number of COVID-19 patients are found to present with complex neuropsychiatric syndromes, including the first onset of psychosis, that seem to be directly related to brain damage in the context of COVID-19. Most cases of psychotic disorder in COVID-19 patients are being found in individuals with no personal or family history of mental illness. Case Description: A 33-year-old man presented with acute restlessness, agitation, wandering, vandalizing things, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behaviour, decreased sleep for 3 days duration. There was no past history or family history of any psychiatric illness. There was a history of mild grade fever 7 days before the onset of the psychotic symptoms. The patient was uncooperative, irritable, and had hallucinatory behaviour. Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) was positive. The patient responded to injectable antipsychotic haloperidol which was later changed to Tab Olanzepine 5 mg. The patient developed no COVID symptoms and no psychotic symptoms were seen further. Conclusion: There is a possibility of a psychosis break as a COVID-19 clinical presentation, suggesting potential participation of inflammatory and autoimmunologic phenomena triggered as a response to the coronavirus infection.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric emergencies are conditions that mostly destabilize the already frenetic activity of the Emergency Department. Sometimes the emergency is clearly referable to primitive psychiatric illness. Other times, psychiatric and organic symptoms can independently coexist (comorbidity), or develop together in different conditions of substance abuse, including alcohol and prescription drugs. Differentiating between substance induced and pre-existing psychiatric disorder (dual diagnosis) may be difficult, other than controversial issue. Finally, an organic disease can hide behind a psychiatric disorder (pseudopsychiatric emergency). In this review (part I), psychiatric disorders that occur with organic symptoms are discussed. They include: (1) anxiety, conversion and psychosomatic disorders, and (2) simulated diseases. The physiologic mechanisms of the stress reaction, divided into a dual neuro-hormonal response, are reviewed in this section: (1) activation of the sympathetic nervous system and adrenal medulla with catecholamine production (rapid response), and (2) activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis with cortisol production (slow response). The concept of the fight-or-flight response, its adaptive significance and the potential evolution in paralyzing response, well showing by Yerkes-Dodson curve, is explained. Abnormal short- and long-term reactions to stress evolving toward well codified cluster of trauma and stressor-related disorders, including acute stress disorder, adjustment disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, are examined. A brief review of major psychiatric disorder and related behaviour abnormalities, vegetative symptoms and cognitive impairment, according to DMS IV-TR classification, are described. Finally, the reactive psychic symptoms and behavioral responses to acute or chronic organic disease, so called \"somatopsychic disorders\", commonly occurring in elderly and pediatric patients, are presented. The specific conditions of post-operative and intensive care unit patients, and cancer and HIV positive population are emphasized.",

      "abstract": "The occurrence of a single seizure does not always require initiation of antiepileptic drugs. Risk of recurrent seizures should guide their use. In adults, key risk factors for recurrence are two unprovoked seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart, epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalography, abnormal brain imaging, nocturnal seizures, or an epileptic syndrome associated with seizures. In children, key risk factors are abnormal electroencephalography results, an epileptic syndrome associated with seizures, severe head trauma, and cerebral palsy. The risk of adverse effects from antiepileptic drugs is considerable and includes potential cognitive and behavioral effects. In the absence of risk factors, and because many patients do not experience recurrence of a seizure, physicians should consider delaying use of antiepileptic drugs until a second seizure occurs. Delaying therapy until a second seizure does not affect one- to two-year remission rates. Treatment should begin with monotherapy. The appropriate choice of medication varies depending on seizure type. Routine monitoring of drug levels is not correlated with reduction in adverse effects or improvement in effectiveness and is not recommended. When patients have been seizure free for two to five years, discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs may be considered. For patients with seizures that are not controlled with these agents, alternative treatments include surgical resection of the seizure focus, ketogenic diets, vagus nerve stimulators, and implantable brain neurostimulators. Patients who have had a recent seizure within the past three months or whose seizures are poorly controlled should refrain from driving and certain high-risk physical activities. Patients planning for pregnancy should know that antiepileptic drugs are possibly teratogenic.",

      "title": "Treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea may be an Important Adjunct to Therapy of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder not to be Overlooked",
      "abstract": "THE ALMOST INEVITABLE EXPERIENCES OF LIFE-THREATENING TRAUMATA AND THE UBIQUITOUS CONFLICTS THAT PROMOTE THESE EVENTS HAVE left countless survivors with persisting cognitive, autonomic, and behavioral sequelae. Known in previous generations as battle fatigue, acute stress reaction, thousand-yard stare, soldiers heart syndrome, irritable heart, Da Costa Syndrome, shell shock, and many other designations, it was rediscovered and renamed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after its description by Friedman in 1980 as the Post-Vietnam Syndrome.1 It is estimated that as many as 15% to 30% of Vietnam combat veterans developed this disorder2 and that it affects 11% to 17% of recent Iraq and Afghanistan combat veterans.3 Current DSM IV diagnostic criteria include (A) exposure or witness to a seriously traumatic event with intense emotional response; (B) recurrent re-experiencing of the event in various ways; (C) persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma and numbing of general responsiveness; and (D) persistent autonomic, cognitive, and/or behavioral hyperarousal.4 Criterion B includes nightmares that have been designated the “hallmark symptom” of PTSD,5 and criterion D includes insomnia and other parasomnias. The nightmares typically include vivid trauma-related content. They are not exclusively REM-sleep related and emerge from all stages of sleep.\r\n\r\nPatients typically describe insomnia and parasomnias such as loud somniloquy, and arousals resembling sleep terrors or panic. Some describe motor activation during sleep like sleepwalking or even dream enactment suggestive of REM sleep behavior disorder. Polysomnographic studies have not demonstrated consistent findings to implicate a fundamental sleep disorder of PTSD, but studies of sleep microstructure and brain imaging may offer more insight.6–8 There have been reports of increased incidence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with PTSD, and comorbidity is not unexpected, given the already high prevalence of OSA.9\r\n\r\nIn the paper by El-Solh and colleagues10 in this issue of SLEEP, the authors report on adherence to therapy with various modalities of positive airway pressure (PAP) in a consecutive retrospective case series of OSA in veterans with and without PTSD. Using the Computerized Patient Record System at a Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, the authors abstracted cases from a continuous 4.5-year period to compare 142 veterans with OSA and PTSD with 147 having OSA without PTSD that were matched for age, race, gender, BMI, and OSA severity indices. These individuals were seen for initial follow-up at 30 days following prescription of PAP, reflecting a loss to follow-up of only 6 PTSD subjects and one control. Adherence to PAP was defined by > 4 hours use per night for 70% of nights. Using this definition, 82 of 142 patients (57.7%) with PTSD and 43 of 147 control cases (29.3%) were non-adherent.10\r\n\r\nIn the PTSD group, non-adherence to PAP was associated with post-treatment endorsement of nightmares (P = 0.002) and PAP adherence with pre-treatment Epworth Sleepiness Scale score (P = 0.01). Nightmares were endorsed at follow-up visit by 28% of adherent and 56% of non-adherent patients, as compared with 73% of all PTSD patients prior to treatment. Adherent patients endorsed pre-treatment ESS scores greater by 2 points, compared with non-adherent patients (14.4 ± 5.3 vs 12.3 ± 5.9). This small difference suggests a relationship between symptomatic sleepiness and motivation for therapy, but is not enough to indicate much clinical significance. Though depression and substance abuse were more frequently documented in the PTSD patients, they did not distinguish adherent from non-adherent cases; neither did age, BMI, marital status, employment, substance abuse, severity of OSA, pulmonary function (FEV1), PAP modality, mask type, or pressure. Opiate medication was prescribed for more non-adherent patients (26% vs 13%) but this did not reach statistical significance. There was no significant difference for any of the common complaints about PAP use such as mask discomfort, air hunger, high pressure, claustrophobia, leaks, nasal dryness, or epistaxis.\r\n\r\nEl-Solh et al. suggest that persistent nightmares could influence treatment adherence by frequent awakenings. Indeed, this could inhibit replacement of the mask in the setting of post-awakening anxiety. It may also indicate a bidirectional relationship, with nightmare-related anxiety leading to reduced mask use and PAP or OSA-related increases in nightmare propensity. Their retrospective study does not permit evaluation of post-treatment total sleep time, sleep efficiency, or patient interview data to clarify these possible relationships. Also, the absence of quantitative PTSD assessment does not allow for comparison of PTSD severity between adherent and non-adherent patients. The authors correctly note that their chart review does not permit evaluation of initial response to PAP titration, social support system, referral source, or understanding of risk.10\r\n\r\nThe high lack of adherence to PAP in these cases of OSA in patients with PTSD poses major challenges as well as opportunities in view of the cardiovascular, metabolic, and hypersomnia risks that endanger these non-adherent patients. Furthermore, the fragmentation of their sleep can predispose them to additional morbidity such as continuing nightmares and other parasomnias that can add risk of injury. Interestingly, it has been reported that dream recall is reduced in the presence of OSA.11 However, posttraumatic nightmares might be promoted by apnea-induced arousals. It is well documented that nightmares, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors can be precipitated by sleep fragmentation such as with OSA, and diminish with PAP therapy.12,13 This would be similar for “pseudo-REM-sleep behavior disorder,”14 in which OSA-induced arousals from REM and NREM sleep result in recurrent spells of aggressive and violent dream enactment behaviors that resolve with PAP therapy, as documented by spousal report and by repeat PSG monitoring (that again confirms normal presence of REM-atonia).\r\n\r\nThough polysomnographic studies of sleep in PTSD have shown little clinically significant sleep pathology, patients endorse many symptoms that tend not to appear in the safe, supervised environment of the sleep laboratory.6 The ubiquity of sleep symptoms, however, implicates some fundamental aberration of sleep in this disorder, and there are reports suggesting that sleep-focused treatment alleviates PTSD.15 It is reasonable, therefore, to anticipate that treatment of OSA in these individuals may improve both disorders. Hence, the finding of El-Solh et al.10 raises the question of how the fundamental PTSD symptom of the nightmare may be both facilitated by OSA and also interfere with its therapy. Any means of diminishing nightmares could possibly promote more effective treatment of OSA as well as improve PTSD. Clearly, the provocative findings of El-Solh et al. beg for prospective studies to further elucidate these important and complex issues. For instance, the possibility that imagery rehearsal therapy or pharmacotherapy with prazosin might reduce nightmares and enhance CPAP adherence must be tested.15 Might alternative therapy for OSA such as mandibular advancement appliances improve comorbid PTSD? What is the lower limit of sleep disordered breathing severity that would be additive or complicate symptoms of PTSD? What is the possibility that use of CPAP, known to cause REM rebound with increased REM density,16 might increase nightmare intensity and discourage use of CPAP? The finding of El-Solh et al.10 stimulates us to think about the fundamental relationship between PTSD and sleep as well as the practical issue of how to enhance nocturnal sleep and daytime wakefulness, as well as mitigate PTSD symptoms and cardiovascular and metabolic risks in these individuals.",

      "abstract": "Back to table of contents Previous article Next article Clinical & ResearchFull AccessMisuse of Steroids, Other Performance Enhancers Slips Under RadarNick ZagorskiNick ZagorskiSearch for more papers by this authorPublished Online:24 Feb 2022https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.pn.2022.03.10.42AbstractThe misuse of legal muscle builders and/or illicit steroids combines elements of eating and substance use disorders.iStock/Light Field StudiosDSM-5-TR recognizes 10 broad types of substance use disorders, ranging from disorders involving substances that can be purchased over the counter (alcohol and tobacco) to prescription medications (stimulants, hypnotics, and pain relievers) and illicit drugs (cocaine). However, some mental health professionals think one important class of substances remains missing from this list: anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs).Now, anabolic steroids are briefly mentioned in DSM-5-TR as an example that might fit in the “Other or Unknown Substance-Related Disorders” category. Harrison Pope, M.D., M.P.H., a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and leading researcher on anabolic steroids, is among those who think steroids and other PEDs deserve more clinical visibility. He noted that steroid users in particular show all the signs of biological and psychological dependence: they take larger quantities over time, experience withdrawal effects when not taking them, and continue to use them despite warnings to stop from loved ones or the emergence of adverse side effects.PED use is also prevalent enough to deserve its own category, Pope said. A study published in 2020 found that about 16% of young men aged 18 to 26 in the United States reported using legal performance enhancers, such as creatine supplements, while nearly 3% reported using anabolic steroids (which are illegal without a prescription). Among women, 1.2% reported using legal PEDs, while 0.8% reported using anabolic steroids. Some of Pope’s own research has indicated that there may be as many as 1 million adults in the United States who show the signs of steroid dependence.“PEDs are definitely misused by many people and pose serious health consequences,” said Wilson Compton, M.D., M.P.H., deputy director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse and a member of the Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Work Group for DSM-5. “The question is do they share the specific criteria outlined for other SUDs?”Compton told Psychiatric News that one of the key elements separating PEDs from other drugs in the SUD category is that steroids and other PEDs are not consumed for an immediate high but rather taken over weeks to gradually change body shape. Another issue is that some substances known to enhance performance, such as caffeine or amphetamines, are in existing categories.What Drives PED Use?With more data, PED misuse may one day fit into the chapter on eating disorders in the DSM.Similar to people with an eating disorder, most people who use PEDs struggle with issues related to a distorted body image, said Kyle Ganson, Ph.D., a clinical social worker and assistant professor at the Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work at the University of Toronto. (To the contrary of media narratives, PED misuse is not confined to bodybuilders, baseball players, or other high-performance athletes). PED misuse also often begins in adolescence, he continued; youth may see themselves as weak or flabby and undertake a range of behaviors including diets, increased exercise, and the use of substances to boost metabolism or muscle growth.“These aren’t stereotypical eating disorder behaviors,” said Jason Nagata, M.D., M.Sc., an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco. “Instead of vomiting, they work out intensely; instead of diet pills, they overuse steroids.”Because PEDs are more frequently used by males than females and the use of these products typically leads to a more toned body, PED misuse can be easily missed by parents, teachers, and even doctors.“Typically, the person will start with one legal supplement like whey protein, then advance to a polysubstance pattern,” Ganson said. “For many, the trajectory may lead to illicit substances like steroids.”A study of national survey data conducted by Nagata, Ganson, and colleagues found that male youth who use legal PEDs are about three times as likely to subsequently use anabolic steroids as those who do not use PEDs.Even users who don’t progress to illegal PEDs face risks, Nagata said. Recent longitudinal data have also suggested that youth who use legal PEDs are more likely to subsequently engage in drinking, risky sexual behaviors, and criminal offenses compared with those who do not. Over-the-counter performance enhancers are also not harmless; as with many nutritional supplements, they are poorly regulated and often contaminated with other substances. (Nagata noted that a handful of states, including Massachusetts, have proposed regulations to ban the sale of muscle-enhancing and/or weight loss supplements to minors due to concerns over health risks.)Screening for PED MisuseAs with Pope and others who have witnessed the detrimental effects of these drugs, Ganson and Nagata believe the misuse of steroids and other PEDs warrants its own section in the DSM. “It would help professionals better screen for this disorder in youth while also raising awareness about the male eating disorder experience,” Nagata said.Nagata acknowledged the difficulty in finding a diagnostic home for PED misuse given how trans-diagnostic it is; in addition to sharing traits with substance use disorders and eating disorders, PED misuse overlaps with body dysmorphic disorder. Many youth who use these substances can develop unhealthy obsessions and repetitive behaviors related to their appearance. Nagata noted that muscle dysphoria, a disorder in which people become preoccupied with large muscles, was added to DSM-5 as a subtype of body dysmorphic disorder; however, that disorder reflects only a small portion of people who misuse PEDs.Despite the lack of clear diagnostic criteria, there are clues psychiatrists and other health professionals can look for to identify potential cases of performance-enhancing drug misuse. As noted, this is primarily—but not entirely—an issue among young men, especially those who experience adverse life events or social stigma.“It makes sense that youth who are put in positions to feel defenseless would turn to behaviors aimed at getting stronger,” Ganson said. He was part of a study published last year that identified childhood sexual abuse as a significant risk factor for both legal and illicit performance-enhancing drug use. “What was unusual in that study was that while women are much less likely overall to use PEDs, the rates of use among men or women who were abused were roughly similar,” he said.Nagata added that PED use is also elevated among sexual minorities; a recent study he conducted found that around 44% of gay or bisexual men and 30% of gay or bisexual women had used PEDs in their lifetime; those that reported PED use were more likely to have symptoms of disordered eating or muscle dysphoria. Nagata said this elevated use is driven by both stigma and social media representations of ideal body types. Few studies have examined PED use in transgender individuals, but Nagata said that he believes some people transitioning from female to male would look for ways to become more muscular and masculine, so they might be another group likely to misuse PEDs.Physicians should be prepared to ask patients who report mood swings and/or aggression about use of PEDs and other muscle enhancing behaviors.“One of the issues complicating PED misuse is that we don’t know what crosses the line between the safe versus risky use of legal PEDs,” Nagata said. “Therefore, it is useful to focus on overall behaviors. Have the youth stopped engaging with friends or family to work out instead? Have they eliminated certain foods or made other major dietary changes? As with other substance use disorders, any use that has an adverse impact on their school, work, or social life is problematic.”Pope noted that while patients who misuse steroids may be less willing to admit their use than those who use over-the-counter products, a routine blood test can provide clues whether a patient is misusing these substances. “Significantly lower levels of the good cholesterol (HDL), coupled with elevated bad cholesterol (LDL), is one telltale clue of steroid misuse,” he said. “Elevated numbers of red blood cells is another possible sign.” Other common symptoms of steroid use that might be seen by a primary care doctor include high blood pressure, truncal acne (on the back, chest, neck, or arms), and the emergence of breast tissue in men. “It’s important that more health professionals begin asking questions about these substances,” Ganson said. While many youth may be driven to start taking PEDs to become stronger, misuse can pose physical and mental health risks. ■“Prevalence and Correlates of Muscle-Enhancing Behaviors Among Adolescents and Young Adults in the United States” is posted here.“Associations Between Adverse Childhood Experiences and Performance-Enhancing Substance Use Among Young Adults” is posted here.“Appearance and Performance-Enhancing Drugs and Supplements (Apeds): Lifetime Use and Associations With Eating Disorder and Muscle Dysmorphia Symptoms Among Cisgender Sexual Minority People” is posted here.“The Lifetime Prevalence of Anabolic-Androgenic Steroid Use and Dependence in Americans: Current Best Estimates” is posted here ISSUES NewArchived",

Objectives Evaluate the association between OCS and psychosis to document pathogenia of both entities. Methods A bibliographic search was performed about this topic.We present two cases of patients that have been referred to our unit: A34year old man, a usual consumer of cannabis,who shows checking and organizing compulsions that interfere significantly with their life.Consumptions grew progressively until they became daily,trying to decrease partly this behaviour. He comes to an addiction unit where he achieves abstinence,but immediately shows an important functional-impairment, adding to the previous compulsions new ones,and also thought blocking,social retraction and personality change. He starts taking antidepressant and benzodiazepines to reduceOCS, and weeks later begins a manic episode with delusions as a bipolar-disorder debut. A29year old man, with a history of familiar obsessive personality,that begins to worry about physical appearance and starts compulsive behaviour focused on exercise preventing him from daily activities.No response to antidepressants, he started antipsychotics and develop referential-symptoms. Results Both are atypical presentations of bipolar and schizophreniform disorders withOCS,where the beginning of treatment causes psychosis-symptoms not previously developed.

      "title": "Sedation with Antipsychotics: Manage, Don't Accept Adverse 'Calming' Effect",
      "abstract": "Sedation is a frequent side effect of antipsychotics, especially at relatively high doses. Antipsychotics' sedative effects can reduce agitation in acute psychosis and promote sleep in insomnia, but long-term sedation may: [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] * interfere with schizophrenia patients' efforts to go to work or school or engage in normal socialization * prevent improvement from psychosocial training, psychiatric rehabilitation, and other treatments. This article discusses how to manage acute psychosis without oversedation and ways to address persistent sedation and chronic insomnia with less-sedating antipsychotics or adjunctive medications. Neurobiology or psychopharmacology? Many patients experience only mild, transient somnolence at the beginning of antipsychotic treatment, and most develop some tolerance to the sedating effects with continued administration. Others may have persistent daytime sedation that interferes with normal functioning. Sedation is especially common in elderly patients receiving antipsychotics. Compared with younger patients, older patients receiving the same doses of the same medications become more heavily sedated for longer periods of time. The resulting sedation can impair arousal levels during the day and increase the risk of falls. Sedation can occur with first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), but it is seen more commonly and tends to be more severe with low-potency FGAs than with SGAs. Clinical challenges come with: * distinguishing between sedation and negative symptoms of schizophrenia such as avolition, amotivation, withdrawal, and anhedonia * determining whether an individual's cognitive impairment is related to the antipsychotic's sedative properties. Because the treatments are different, it is important to try to distinguish negative symptoms and/or cognitive impairment related to schizophrenia's neurobiology from sedation related to the antipsychotic. Ask patients if they nap during the day or just lie around, and if they want to do things but can't: * If they want to do things but feel too tired, this likely is sedation caused by the antipsychotic. Treatment might be a dose reduction. * If they are not interested in doing things, the likely cause is negative symptoms. Treatment might be a medication such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. * If they want to do things but cannot organize themselves to be able to do them, this likely is cognitive impairment. Treatment might be cognitive training or remediation. Efficacy and sedation Antipsychotics are thought to exert their effect by antagonism of postsynaptic dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT2A receptors and possibly other receptors in the brain. Four SGAs--risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and ziprasidone--act as dopamine D2 and 5HT2A antagonists. Aripiprazole is a dopamine D2 partial agonist, serotonin 5HT1A partial agonist, and serotonin 5HT2A antagonist. (1) Efficacy data comparing SGAs with each other and with FGAs vary, but all 5 of these SGAs have been shown to be effective antipsychotics. (2-4) They also generally cause less sedation than FGAs. Patients with acute exacerbation of psychosis often have insomnia and frequently report paranoia that something will happen to them while they sleep. When treating agitated patients, many clinicians consider calming effects and true antipsychotic effects to be one in the same, which is not correct. All available antipsychotics are, on average, equally effective in treating acute psychotic symptoms but vary considerably in the amount of sedation they produce. Studies of short-acting injectable SGAs, such as ziprasidone and aripiprazole, have shown that agitation and acute symptoms can be controlled without significant sedation. (5,6) Antipsychotic effects are not immediate and historically were thought to occur over several weeks. …",

      "abstract": "Quantitative and qualitative alterations of consciousness are frequently observed in stroke patients, rarely in the absence of major sensorimotor deficits (’inobvious stroke’; Dunne et al. 1986). Disorders of wakefulness and delirium (acute confusional state), often in combination, are the most common disorders of consciousness in patients with acute stroke. In prospective studies, decreased levels of wakefulness – ranging from somnolence (hypersomnia) to coma – can be observed in 15–25% of patients (Bassetti, 2000; Bogousslavsky et al., 1988b; Melo et al., 1992), and acute confusional states are seen in up to 48% of patients (Gustafson et al., 1991). Less often, stroke causes coma-like states (akinetic mutism, locked-in syndrome), vegetative state, or other sleep–wake disturbances.",

The differential diagnosis of OCD can be quite difficult since OCD symptomatology can occur as either primary or secondary phenomena. Comorbid depression or personality disorder is not uncommon in patients with primary OCD. Other comorbid conditions that occur with OCD can be divided into three major groups based on core features: (1) disorders of altered risk assessment; (2) incompleteness/habit-spectrum disorders; and (3) psychotic spectrum disorders. Such a categorization of core dimensions and comorbid conditions may prove useful in identifying distinct OCD subtypes that share underlying neurobiological or treatment response characteristics.",

      "abstract": "It has been a clinical case of a polimorphic psychotic disorder in a male of 26-year-old, affected by brain palsy, previously with adequate cognitive function, undergoing remarkable confusional fluctuations and a waking state apparently well-preserved. As possible comorbidities or triggers we could count on a tonsillitis and/or a depressive reaction a few days before. Serious consideration must be given to a differential diagnosis with an encephalitis but, despite the presence of an intermittent febricula, it was rejected by both units: internal medicine and neurology, after performing some complementary tests, albeit some more specific tests are still pending. His psychiatric background was also checked, which initially was orientated as a questionable bipolar disorder. At all events, symptoms stopped progressively until, almost complete remittance in the moment he was discharged from the hospital. He recovered his normal functionality. The treatment given was risperidon 2 mL/day, quetiapin 50 mg/8 h and baclofen 10 mg/12 h. This can be used as an example of how many difficulties we usually found to catalogue an acute disorder in first phases, even to encompass the clinical profile within the limits of psychiatry or neurology.

Distressing fatigue can be related to psychiatric or medical causes such as significant depression, frequent intense anxiety, or panic attacks, as well as sleep disturbances, pain, and electrolyte or hormonal abnormalities. It is often caused by a wide range of medications and substances. This chapter presents the various causes of fatigue to help non-prescribing clinicians distinguish fatigue from other look-alike diagnoses such as depression and make appropriate referrals to prescribers. Identifying opportunities to supplement nonpharmacologic therapies with an activating medication can improve a patient’s quality of life and joy in living. This chapter will help all clinicians become more aware of medications used to boost energy, such as energizing antidepressants, wakefulness agents, and psychostimulants, as well as the potential side effects of these medications.",

      "abstract": "Acute physical restraint represents a potent Stressor in several animal species and is accompanied by a complex pattern of hormonal responses and functional changes in the central nervous system. Repeated immobilization leads to partial blunting of the behavioral and hormonal responses, with transient modifications of neurotransmitter systems in the brain. Pain reactions, as investigated by different kinds of nociceptive tests, are usually attenuated both during and immediately following acute immobilization and the analgesic effect of opiate compounds potentiated; these behavioral alterations may be attributed at least in part to activation of an endogenous opioid system. In some species, restraint may induce a reflex immobility (animal hypnosis or tonic immobility) which is also characterized by suppression of pain reactions in rabbits, probably subserved by different mechanisms. Analysis of available data suggests that pain testing in unanesthetized, restrained animals may involve alterations of the animal's reactivity to noxious stimuli.",

Such massive defense has been created as a bulwark against various dangers, such as (1) psychotic anxieties (fear of mental or physical fragmentation; loss of identity-feeling; danger of uncontrollable, explosive action); (2) profound perturbation concerning the narcissistic self-image and its fluctuations, and (3) pathological formation of the ego-ideal structure concerning affective experience.

      "title": "How Long to Wait for an Antidepressant to 'Work'",
      "abstract": "Prevailing wisdom says it takes 3 to 4 weeks for an antidepressant to show effect. Historically, patients who improve in the first 2 weeks have been labeled (1) Several recent studies, however, demonstrate a real, drug-based in many patients as early as the first week of treatment, depending on the medication (Table). (2-5) In practical terms, these studies raise the question of how long you should wait for an antidepressant to work. Early indications. Here are some tips for gauging antidepressant response, depending on what you see in the first 2 to 4 weeks: * Obtain a pretreatment score on the Beck Depression Inventory or other depression rating scale, and repeat the assessment at least once between days 7 and 10 of treatment. If there is little or no improvement, consider a modest dosage increase. * Don't assume that a patient who responds to an antidepressant during the first 2 weeks is experiencing a placebo effect. It may be a drug-mediated response. Some patients will retain and build on this early response, whereas others' may wane over subsequent weeks. * No to an antidepressant during weeks 1 through 4 does not bode well for most patients, (5,6) although the data do not support giving up on an antidepressant after 1 to 2 weeks of nonresponse. Responses will accumulate during weeks 3 to 5 of treatment. (7) * Patients who show little during the first 2 weeks of treatment but experience some improvement during weeks 3 and 4 may be late responders. However, if the patient shows no improvement by week 3 or 4, consider switching to a different antidepressant, perhaps one from a different chemical class. (8) * Different neurovegetative signs and symptoms of depression may improve at different rates, with some requiring >8 weeks of treatment. Insight, for example, may not improve until the second month of treatment. (9) * Individualize treatment. Many treatment-refractory depressed patients--who failed to respond to 1 or more adequate drug trials--may require longer and more intensive treatment (>3 months) before showing a robust response. (10) * Onset of response does not equal clinical recovery, nor is an improved Hamilton Depression Scale score a proxy for high quality of life. Patients may need [greater than or equal to]2 months for clinically significant improvement in interpersonal, social, and vocational function. (11) References 1.

      "title": "Parkinson’s Disease, Religious Belief and Spirituality",
      "abstract": "Whether the experience, symptoms, treatment or neuropathology of Parkinson's disease (PD) could potentially play a role in shaping religious beliefs and practices can be viewed from several different angles. For example, a diagnosis of a serious illness could make one reassess and question previously held attitudes and beliefs; faith in a benign God may be challenged. Spirituality, broadly defined as a quest for meaning and truth, could also play a role in the process of integrating the experience of living with Parkinson's disease, as with any disease or major life experience. Less conscious mechanisms might also be in play, more intrinsic to the disease process, such as loss of motivational drive due to dopaminergic dysfunction. The resulting apathy, which is often seen in PD, might reduce efforts to pursue personal interests, including a religious faith. Cognitive deficits, for example altered social cognition such as changes in 'theory of mind', could also potentially contribute. At a more pragmatic level, problems with decreasing mobility, and energy levels as well as a host of other symptoms and drug side-effects could potentially make all aspects of daily life problematic, therefore impeding the pursuit of religious practices or a spiritual path. In this chapter we review and discuss the existing literature and research, in the hope that it might augment understanding of this little-studied aspect of PD as well as contribute to cognitive perspectives on religious belief and experience.",

It is a multidetermined biopsychosocial disorder in which physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental factors may contribute to the clinical expression of the disorder. These can include: (1) early life (e.g., genetic or environmental) factors; (2) physiological factors including increased motor reactivity, visceral hypersensitivity, which may be enabled by postinfectious events, and dysregulation of brain–gut communication (e.g., altered central pain control mechanisms). In addition, psychosocial factors including psychiatric co-morbidity, major trauma (e.g., abuse history), and maladaptive coping may amplify the clinical expression of the disorder and its outcome. Currently, clinical outcome has become understood in terms of global symptom relief and health-related quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Abuse of alcohol (ethanol) and abuse of an increasing number of drugs (e.g. analgesics and sedatives) are among the outstanding social and medical problems of many industrialized countries including Switzerland. Since alcohol consumption has profound effects on both the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic actions of a variety of drugs, the rational use of drugs in alcoholics is an increasingly difficult task and requires a thorough understanding of the physiologic, biochemical, pharmacologic and toxic actions of alcohol. Clinically the most important targets of alcohol action are the liver and the central nervous system (CNS), both of which are frequently involved in the mediation of potentially fatal interactions between drugs and alcohol. In practice the most important of these interactions include (a) inhibition of hepatic (cytochrome P450 dependent) drug oxidation by acute alcohol ingestion resulting in increased bioavailability of drugs that are predominantly excreted by hepatic metabolism, (b) inhibition of acetaldehydedehydrogenase by some drugs with production of an acute flushing reaction to alcohol, (c) increased sensitivity of the CNS to a variety of sedative drugs following acute alcohol ingestion leading to enhanced CNS toxicity of most psychoactive drugs, (d) stimulation of hepatic drug oxidation and decreased CNS sensitivity to sedatives after chronic alcohol abuse, thus explaining the \"metabolic\" and pharmacodynamic tolerance of these patients towards psychoactive agents, and (e) depressed drug metabolism and increased CNS sensitivity to sedative and hypnotic drugs in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. The mechanisms and practical consequences of the clinically most important influences of acute and chronic alcohol ingestion on the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamic actions of drugs are outlined.",

However, one of the hallmark features of hallucinogens or psychedelic agents is their ability to induce states of altered or distorted perception, thought, and mood. Many hallucinogens produce classic sympathomimetic effects; that is, hyperactivity, mydriasis (dilated pupils), hypertension, tachycardia, and hyperthermia. However, the effects vary considerably, depending upon the hallucinogen ingested. Qualitative confirmation by the laboratory that the patient is suffering from hallucinogen intoxication such as marijuana use can be helpful to the clinician. However, the common toxicologic drug screens used by most clinical laboratories do not detect many hallucinogenic agents (such as LSD [lysergic acid diethylamide]). Thus, diagnosis of hallucinogen ingestion and treatment is often based on history of use and physical examination.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterised by affective and cognitive symptoms that impair overall functioning and cause psychological discomfort. Due to the use of medical services, these entail high societal costs. Objective: Our goal was to provide a thorough overview of this topic while evaluating the effectiveness of pharmacological therapies in OCD and clinical recommendations. Methods: We looked for papers on the use of drugs to treat OCD in the pubmed database, with an emphasis on clinical guidelines, the use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, off-label drugs, and pharmacogenomics. Results: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) work best when taken for a lengthy period of time. A SSRI combination with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or the similarly orientated exposure and response prevention (ERP) can produce better outcomes. Treatment options for refractory OCD include switching to a different SSRI or clomipramine or supplementing with an atypical antipsychotic. Further research is necessary because there is conflicting information about the use of antidepressants intravenously or in addition to antipsychotics. Treatment customization and pharmacogenomics may lessen treatment resistance. Conclusions: When compared to each treatment separately or to other treatments, SSRI/clomipramine combined with CBT/ERP produces the best results. For refractory OCD, new approaches are required. In the upcoming years, pharmacogenomics may play a more significant role.",

      "abstract": "La menopausia es la interrupción definitiva de las menstruaciones resultado de la pérdida de la actividad folicular del ovario. El periodo inmediatamente antes de la menopausia y el primer año después de la misma se conoce como perimenopausia. La posmenopausia se define como el periodo que transcurre desde un año a partir de la fecha de última menstruación, sin importar si la menopausia fue inducida o espontánea. Debido al incremento de la esperanza de vida en la mujer mexicana, mayor número de ellas alcanzan la edad promedio de la menopausia (45-59 años) y pasan una parte significativa de su vida en la posmenopausia. Se ha observado que los trastornos psiquiátricos son más frecuentes en mujeres que en hombres, y que la perimenopausia es una etapa en la cual se incrementan los síntomas psicológicos, así como el riesgo de sufrir depresión mayor y trastornos de ansiedad. Se debe diferenciar cuando la ansiedad es un síntoma normal ante determinadas situaciones cotidianas de estrés y cuando comienza a tener una presentación irracional por un estímulo ausente, por una intensidad excesiva con relación al estímulo, o cuando la duración es prolongada y presenta recidivas sin motivo, ocasionando grave disfuncionalidad en el paciente. En esta revisión presentamos datos acerca de los síntomas de ansiedad durante la transición a la menopausia y hacemos alusión al trastorno de ansiedad generalizada y trastorno de pánico, ya que se ha observado una mayor prevalencia de estas patologías durante la transición a la menopausia, probablemente debido a los cambios hormonales que se viven durante esta etapa. Menopause is the cessation of menses as a result of loss of ovarian follicular activity. The period before menopause and the first year after menopause is known as peri-menopause. Post-menopause is defined as the years after menopause, regardless of whether it was induced or spontaneous. Due to increased life expectancy in Mexican women, as many reach the average age of menopause at 45-59 years, they spend a significant part of their lives in post-menopause. It has been observed that psychiatric disorders are more common in women than in men, and that peri-menopause is a stage when the risk of psychological symptoms increases, as well as the risk of major depression and anxiety disorders. It must be determined when anxiety arises as a normal state in response to specific daily stress provoking situations, or whether anxiety starts to present itself irrationally as part of a psychiatric disorder. In this review we present data on anxiety during menopausal transition. Reference is also made to general anxiety disorder and panic disorder, due to their high prevalence in women during menopausal transition, probably attributed to hormonal changes during this stage.",

      "abstract": "The syndrome of pituitary cachexia has been so completely described and the literature concerning it so thoroughly reviewed in the recent American literature by Silver (1) and Calder (2) that a detailed description of it is unnecessary here. The disease, briefly, is characterized by progessive weight loss and cachexia, loss of libido and potentia, falling of axillary and pubic hair, premature menopause, decrease in basal metabolism, trophic changes in the skin and mental torpor with frequent terminal coma accompanied by hyperpyrexia. Eosinophilia and gastrointestinal disturbances with achlorhydria are not uncommon. Women are affected more frequently than men (about 70 per cent of reported cases) and the symptoms often begin insidiously after a prolonged or difficult labor. The course is chronic, sometimes extending over many years. The primary lesion involves the anterior pituitary; it may be due to a nonspecific atrophy or fibrosis, the degenerative phase of an adenoma or other neoplasm, cysts, tuberculosis, syphilis, or trauma. In a few reported cases no definite structural change has been found in the anterior pituitary; in some instances extension of an adjacent mass lesion occurs, as in the case reported by A. Weinstein (3) in which invasion of an ependymal glioma produced the symptoms. On the other hand, extensive destruction of the anterior pituitary may occur without the syndrome of Simmonds disease. Kaminski (4) has recently described such destruction from extension of a chronic actinomycoticosteomyelitis of the malar bone, invading the basal meninges and pituitary fossa, without any evidence of glandular dysfunction except testicular atrophy. Kaminski attempts to differentiate between ‘exogenous’ and ‘endogenous’ types of pituitary dysfunction, believing that the ‘endogenou’ type is more apt to produce the Simmond’s syndrome.",

In such depressed patients, the tendency to express aggression against others has been seen as either denied, suppressed, or repressed, and hostile feelings toward the significant other not admitted into awareness where they would arouse painful guilt feelings. One more recent psychoanalytic position<sup>3</sup>is that depression is associated with denial, or repression of aggression, aimed at preserving the original love object",

      "title": "Etiology of Depression in Children.",
      "abstract": "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is experienced by a significant proportion of youth today, occurring at an earlier age than found in previous generations. Major Depressive Disorder can produce long-lasting detrimental effects on a child's life, which raises the question of etiology. Three areas were examined for evidence identifying specific determinants of Major Depressive Disorder in youth: biological factors, including studies on inherited characteristics; psychological factors, focusing on cognitive and affective activity; and environmental factors, such as stressful life events. The implications of the findings were then explored. ********** The term depression is often used to describe the temporary sadness, loneliness or blues that almost everyone feels from time to time. However, the DSM-IV TR (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, Text Revised) defines Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) as a mental illness in which a person consistently experiences deep, unshakable sadness and diminished interest in all activities for a period of at least 2 weeks. Major Depressive Disorder dramatically impairs an individual's ability to function in one or more areas of his or her life. Persons with MDD usually experience feelings of despair, hopelessness, worthlessness, difficulty thinking or concentrating, and sometimes thoughts of committing suicide. Depression is one of the most common mental illnesses. Although depression has long been a diagnosis made for adults, it has become increasingly prevalent in the youth of today. Mental health practitioners are seeing a marked increase in the number of youth who are experiencing depression at an earlier age than did previous generations (Cicchetti and Toth, 1998). Depressive symptoms and disorder are found in a significant proportion of young people, with long-lasting detrimental effects (Rice, Harold and Thapar, January, 2002). Major Depressive Disorder, having such a definitive impact on a child's life, raises the question of etiology. Three major areas will be explored as to the cause of depression in children, including biological factors, psychological factors and environmental factors. Some depressions seem to occur suddenly, even when life appears to be going very well. Others have an obvious external cause such as a relationship conflict, financial difficulty or some personal failure. Yet many individuals experiencing these problems do not become depressed. In an attempt to identify causal factors, it has been hypothesized that depression results from the interaction between a person's biological and psychological vulnerabilities and a stressful life event (Cicchetti and Toth, 1998). Biological Factors Depression has been found to run in families (Rice, Harold, Thapar, November, 2002). By studying twins, researchers have found evidence of a strong genetic influence in depression. Genetically identical twins raised in the same environment are three times more likely to both have major depressive disorder than are fraternal twins, who have only about half their genes in common. In addition, identical twins are five times more likely to have bipolar disorder in common. Bipolar disorder is characterized by alternating manic and depressive mood swings. These findings suggest that vulnerability to depression can be inherited. Adoption studies have found that children of depression are vulnerable to depression even when raised by adoptive parents, offering more evidence of a genetic role in depression. A consensus that Major Depressive Disorder is both familial and inheritable is evident in the findings from both twin and family studies (Rice et al., January 2002). Family studies of early onset Major Depressive Disorder can be differentiated by the research methodology utilized (Scourfield, Rice, Thapar, Harold, Martin and McGuffin, 2003). Bottom-up studies evaluate the inheritability of Major Depressive Disorder by examining the child and working back through the child's ancestry. …",

O diagnóstico é confirmado pela dosagem de chumbo no sangue (plumbemia) ou na urina (plumbúria), ou de algum dos parâmetros de efeito do chumbo na cadeia de formação da hemoglobina, tais como o ácido deltaminolevulínico no sangue ou na urina e protoporfirina eritrocitária no sangue. O tratamento da intoxicação é feito com quelantes. Por questão de custos e disponibilidade comercial, a experiência acumulada no Brasil restringe-se ao uso do dimercaprol (BAL), do versenato de cálcio (EDTACaNa2) e da D-penicilamina. Entretanto, os quelantes mais eficazes são o EDTACaNa2 por via parenteral e o ácido dimercapto succínico (DMSA) por via oral. O BAL pode ser utilizado juntamente com o EDTACaNa2 em casos de adultos com sintomatologia encefalopática, ou em crianças mesmo sem sintomas de SNC, pois diferentemente do EDTACaNa2 ele passa a barreira encefálica quelando chumbo presente no cérebro ou impedindo que chumbo mobilizado durante o uso do EDTA aja no cérebro da criança.",

In this paper, some of the biochemical and physiological effects of the amphetamines are examined with the hope of clarifying the nature of the biological changes in these two major functional psychoses. The actions of the amphetamines are shown to reveal the operation of specific homeostatic or adaptive nervous mechanisms. These appear likely also to operate in adaptation to psychological stress. Evidence is presented that these mechanisms are malfunctioning in manic-depressive and acute schizophrenic states and that this accounts for many of the clinical features of these conditions.",

In exposure therapy, the patient is persuaded to re-enter the phobia- or ritual-evoking situation and to stay there despite the ensuing panic until it starts to subside, which may take 1 h or more. The patient does this repeatedly and systematically, noting outcome in an exposure-homework diary which the clinician reviews. Controlled studies show that such self-exposure treatment (requiring little time from the clinician) has lasting value. Only a minority of cases need additional therapist-aided exposure. Antidepressants are useful adjuvants to exposure in dysphoric phobics and ritualisers. No antidepressant is clearly superior to any other. Relapse on stopping medication is a problem. Neither beta-blockers nor benzodiazepines are yet of proven lasting value for these syndromes. It is too easy to forget that drugs have unpleasant side-effects which are not seen with exposure therapy.",

In the absence of an exciting cause, such a predisposition may not be recognizable nor tangibly mar the individual's physical and mental well-being throughout a normal span of existence.

      "title": "Treatment options for residual insomnia in schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "It is well documented that patients with schizophrenia demonstrate disturbances in sleep continuity and sleep architecture as well as disrupted circadian rhythmicity. These sleep disturbances are associated with reduced quality of life and social functioning. Insomnia might be secondary to the hyperarousal caused by positive psychotic symptoms. However, in recent years, it has been acknowledged that insomnia often persists beyond adequately dosed antipsychotic treatment. Residual insomnia in schizophrenia, defined as insomnia persisting beyond otherwise adequate antipsychotic treatment, covers a range of insomnia symptoms that could be secondary to other potentially treatable conditions such as medical or psychiatric comorbidity, substance use, use of medication that might interfere with sleep or a primary sleep disorder. A thorough evaluation of the insomnia diagnosis is therefore warranted. This includes a careful patient history and examination that addresses sleep and wake function, as well as common medical, psychiatric and medication-/substance-related conditions. The complex problem of residual insomnia in schizophrenia is currently addressed by substituting or adding sedating drugs, but current treatment guidelines suffer from a lack of information on the best clinical practice. Substituting an otherwise efficient antipsychotic drug-therapy with a more sedating drug carries the risk of psychotic relapse during the switch, and adding another drug carries the disadvantages of polypharmacy including increased rate of side-effects, drug–drug interactions, patient non-compliance and medication errors. To investigate the evidence base for the different treatment options in residual insomnia in schizophrenia, we performed a systematic literature review. We searched the major bibliographic databases for randomized clinical trials (search terms: sleep and schizophren*) supplemented by review of reference lists of relevant articles. We found only five randomized clinical trials investigating pharmacological treatment options for residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Two trials examined the efficacy of switching antipsychotic drug to, respectively, risperidone 1 or its active metabolite, paliperidone 2. The data suggest that risperidone might be a good choice for this particular indication, but methodological limitations and the lack of comparison with other second-generation antipsychotics weaken the suggestion. Three studies evaluating the efficacy of melatonin showed improvement in certain sleep characteristics (e.g. sleep duration and sleep efficiency) 3-5, but two of the studies 3, 4 came from the same group of researchers presumably using the same sample of patients. We found no published randomized clinical trials investigating non-pharmacological treatment of residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Thus, our attempt to review this clinically important subject was limited by the few interventions tested experimentally and difficulties making a thorough comparison of the tested interventions due to methodological limitations. These included small sample size, selective reporting, lack of specification of primary outcome measure and a high level of variability regarding assessment tools and allowed comedication. The benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like drugs (Z-drugs) are frequently prescribed as hypnotics, but they have not been investigated for residual insomnia in schizophrenia. These drugs are generally only recommended for short-term therapy due to the development of tolerance and dependence. Because residual insomnia in schizophrenia is a chronic condition, these drugs are generally not recommendable. An additional reason to avoid prescription of benzodiazepines is their deteriorating effect on cognitive function and their impairment (rather than correction) of sleep architecture. Particular care should be taken in patients' comorbid for a sleep-related breathing disorder or a comorbid history of alcohol or drug abuse. Other possible treatment options mentioned in the literature, but not systematically investigated in schizophrenia, include add-on treatment with drugs with antihistamine properties including various antidepressants, antipsychotics and antihistamines. They are extensively prescribed (or sold over-the-counter for some antihistamines), but scarce evidence exists regarding efficacy, tolerability and safety when used off-label as hypnotics. The use of classic antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine) is limited by anticholinergic (including cognitive impairment) and cardiovascular adverse effects. Some evidence suggests the use of low-dose doxepin and trazodone (tricyclic antidepressants) as efficacious hypnotic drugs in primary insomnia and not associated with tolerance, weight gain or abuse potential. However, they have only been sparsely investigated in insomnia not associated with depression and are not available in all countries. The addition of a low-dose quetiapine as hypnotic agent has gained widespread acceptance without any evidence base of randomized controlled trials to support its use. Observational studies have found that even the low doses are associated with the development of adverse metabolic effects. In conclusion, the evidence base is currently too scarce to extract any valid clinical recommendations regarding the treatment of residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Future studies should focus on rigorous evaluation of the switching and augmenting strategies currently applied in clinical practice and also on evaluation of psychological behavioural treatment methods. The latter is especially important in this vulnerable population of patients already chronically medicated.

Various physiological and stressful stimuli can precipitate hypnic jerks and contribute to their frequency and amplitude, e.g., stress, fatigue, stimulants like caffeine, and certain medications. Hypnic jerks are usually benign, but they can be intensified in certain situations, interfering with sleep onset and causing insomnia. Here we reported the case of a patient who suffered from intensified hypnic jerks that led to the development of major depressive disorder. Although the depressive symptoms improved on escitalopram 20 mg, the hypnic jerks increased significantly.

      "abstract": "Disasters, whether resulting from terrorism or natural events, have a dramatic impact on the health and well-being of children. Studies after the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, in New York City and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and countless reports on the impact of natural disasters on children show that a child's mental health can suffer from direct and indirect exposure to these events. Children may react to a disaster or act of terrorism in a variety of ways. These reactions are influenced by age, developmental level, intellectual capacity, individual and family support systems, personality, and other factors. Common manifestations of psychological trauma in young children include regression, clinging behavior, inattentiveness, aggressiveness, bed-wetting, somatic complaints, irritability, social withdrawal, nightmares, and crying. Longer-lasting effects may include depression, anxiety, adjustment disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and interpersonal or academic difficulties. Some children are particularly vulnerable to postdisaster trauma because of preexisting psychosocial stressors (homelessness, foster care, exposure to violence, etc), low socioeconomic status, or special needs (including cognitive delays and prior mental illness). These postdisaster reactions may not manifest until well after the event and could persist for years.\n\nThe National Center for Disaster Preparedness (NCDP) at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health gathered key staff to discuss the appropriate response to the needs in the Gulf Coast region. Over the following few days, talks were held with federal, state, and local public officials to assess immediate needs and determine what resources could be offered to the affected areas. Necessary clearances to provide medical care were obtained from the Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas departments of health. Permission was also necessary (and obtained) for access to gasoline and necessary supplies including pharmaceuticals and to travel after curfew.\n\nThe Children's Health Fund and the NCDP launched Operation Assist, a collaborative effort to organize programs … \n\nAddress correspondence to Paula A.

At the same time, changes in sleep, known as sleep disorders, are closely related to various metabolic dysfunctions, which in turn are the result of the generation of reactive oxygen species, or otherwise known as oxidative stress. For this reason, cannabinoid derivatives are increasingly used for this purpose. Among the most used are delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). These agents interact with the endogenous endocannabinoid system, either by direct action on specific receptors, or by increasing the availability of endocannabinoids, modifying particular mental states (anxiety, depression). The results of the studies specified in this article provide promising evidence regarding the positive effects of CBD, which extend beyond the scope of sleep disorders, with possible applications also in the case of the accumulation of reactive oxygen species.",

Some symptoms of the disease, such as auditory hallucinations and delusions, can be ameliorated with drug treatment, whereas other symptoms, such as social withdrawal and cognitive decline, remain uncontrolled. It is possible that these latter symptoms that are often termed ''negative symptoms'' are the result of anatomical and neurochemical abnormalities, whereas those symptoms of the disease such as auditory hallucinations that are termed ''positive symptoms'' may be a result of only neurochemical disorders. The drugs used to treat schizophrenia are designated neuroleptics. The term neuroleptic was chosen to emphasize the similarity of pharmacological profiles of drugs with entirely different chemical structures. Especially prominent features of the effects of neuroleptics include the following: a state of affective indifference; a decrease in locomotor activity; a decrease in excitation, agitation, and aggressiveness; and an antipsychotic action in patients with acute as well as chronic psychoses.",

      "title": "Should We Use Psychostimulant Drugs to Boost the Emergence from General Anesthesia?",
      "abstract": "Recently, Chemali et al. 1showed that psychostimulants can accelerate the emergence from propofol anesthesia as evidenced by a faster recovery of the righting reflex and by signs of electroencephalogram activation after the injection of methylphenidate during propofol infusion. The authors believe that methylphenidate can be safely used in a clinical setting to facilitate the awakening from prolonged propofol anesthesia or in patients overly sedated by propofol. In our view, the use of psychostimulants such as methylphenidate as emergence drugs may lead to undesirable consequences, especially in the abovementioned subsets of patients.It has been recently suggested that sequential activation of consciousness, connectedness to the environment, and responsiveness may be prerequisites for the smooth and uneventful emergence from anesthesia.2Switching on the connectedness or responsiveness before the consciousness is fully recovered from the effect of GABAergic drugs may be a cause of cognitive dysfunction or even delirium on emergence.2,3Although connectedness to external stimuli is likely to rely on norepinephrinergic signaling,4responsiveness probably requires the engagement of the basal ganglia and is subject to dopaminergic modulation in the striatum.5Methylphenidate can increase extracellular levels of both norepinephrine and dopamine in cortical and subcortical areas.6–9We believe that administering methylphenidate during propofol infusion or immediately after its termination and before the anesthetic is eliminated and consciousness sufficiently restored would interrupt the natural sequential switching-on of consciousness–connectedness–responsiveness and may result in postoperative cognitive dysfunction.We also suspect that accelerated emergence in otherwise uncomplicated anesthesia cases may be unpleasant, similar to sudden and forced awakening from sleep.10The authors themselves noticed that the electroencephalogram pattern after methylphenidate injection during propofol infusion was not exactly a return to a normal awake state: rather, the electroencephalogram showed signs of overactivation.1Administration of methylphenidate at doses comparable to those used in this study causes an increase in locomotion in rats.11,12If the authors had examined the behavior of rats awakened from anesthesia by methylphenidate and compared it with that of animals allowed to naturally awaken from propofol, they would probably have found increased locomotor activity in the former group. The human equivalent of rat hyperlocomotion may be restlessness and agitation, both of which are undesirable and can complicate the postoperative period.Finally, many stimulant drugs with a dopaminergic mechanism of action, including methylphenidate, lead to the so-called rebound hypersomnolence, evidenced by a period of enhanced compensatory sleep after drug-induced waking.13,14For methylphenidate, rebound hypersomnolence occurs at about 3 h after its intraperitoneal administration in rats.14It is unclear whether this phenomenon could be potentiated by residual sedation after propofol anesthesia. However, such potentiation is likely to occur and may have detrimental effects in overly sedated patients and, therefore, should be examined before the drug is used in humans.In conclusion, the results of the study by Chemali et al . certainly enrich our knowledge about the mechanisms of anesthesia and prepare us for possible drug interactions in patients on methylphenidate scheduled for surgery. However, before proceeding to examine the ability of methylphenidate to accelerate the emergence from propofol anesthesia in patients, especially in those with increased drug-induced GABAergic tone, it seems prudent to investigate the effects of methylphenidate on postanesthetic cognitive function in animals. Meanwhile, we can still rely on the natural emergence from anesthesia caused by physiologic elimination of the anesthetic drug. Fortunately, with the ever-improving pharmacokinetic profiles of modern anesthetic drugs, we do not have to wait too long.*Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata, Japan. abpetr@med.niigata-u.ac.jp",

      "abstract": "Mr. R, age 75, is having difficulty sleeping. When he goes to bed, he lies there for what seems like forever, unable to fall asleep. He feels so tired and ends up taking naps during the day, but he cannot break this cycle. He has tried using over-the-counter products with little relief. Mr. R's primary care physician prescribes zaleplon, 10 mg/d, and asks him to call the clinic in 2 weeks to discuss his progress. He takes zaleplon as directed for several nights and begins to feel sluggish during the day, both mentally and physically, despite reporting an increase in the overall amount of sleep at night. Sedative-hypnotic drugs are among the most commonly used medications in the United States. Use of these drugs, as well as anxiolytics, has increased from 2.8% between 1988 and 1994 to 4.7% between 2007 and 2010, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. (1) In 2011, drugs categorized as sedative-hypnotics or antipsychotics were involved in 6.1% of all human exposures identified in the American Association of Poison Control Centers' National Poison Data System. (2) Therefore, an understanding of clinical and pharmacological variables related to safe and effective use is important for clinicians prescribing and monitoring therapy with these agents. Neuropsychiatric disorders are prevalent among geriatric patients and are associated with age-related physiologic changes in the CNS. (3) Such changes involve: * neuroanatomy (brain atrophy, decreased neuronal density, increased plaque formation) * neurotransmitters (reduced cholinergic transmission, decreased synthesis of dopamine and catecholamines), and * neurophysiology (reduced cerebral blood flow). These physiologic processes manifest as alterations in mental status, reflexes, sensation, gait, balance, and sleep. Examples of sleep changes among geriatric patients include decreased sleep efficiency, more frequent awakenings, and more variable sleep duration. (3), (4) Sleep disorders also may be related to mental disorders and other medical conditions. (5) For example, the prevalence of sleep-related respiratory disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea, increases with age. (6) Sleep disorders are common among geriatric patients. In a large epidemiologic study of sleep complaints in patients age [greater than or equal to]65, more than one-half of patients had at least 1 sleep complaint (ie, difficulty falling asleep, trouble waking up, early awakening, need for naps, and feeling ill-rested). (7) As many as 34% of patients reported symptoms of insomnia. In an analysis of National Ambulatory Medical Survey Data over 6 years, 24.8% to 27.9% of sleep-related medical office visits were attributed to patients age [greater than or equal to]65. (8) Pharmacology in aging Prescribing sedative-hypnotic drugs is not routinely recommended for older patients with a sleep disorder. Geriatric patients, compared with younger patients, are at higher risk of iatrogenic complications because of polypharmacy, comorbidities, relative renal and hepatic insufficiency, and other physiologic changes leading to alterations in drug exposure and metabolism (Table 1).(9-12) Aging is associated with changes in body composition, including an increase in total body fat and decrease in lean body mass and total body water. These changes, as well as a prolonged GI transit time, decrease in active gut transporters, decreased blood perfusion, and decrease in plasma proteins such as albumin (because of 'educed liver function or malnutrition), may lead to alteration in drug absorption patterns and may increase the volume of distribution for lipophilic drugs. Additionally, the elimination half-life of some drugs may increase with age because of larger volumes of distribution and reduction in hepatic or renal clearance. The clinical significance of these changes is not well established. …",

      "abstract": "Neurological involvement is a typical feature of several inherited metabolic diseases. The onset of signs and/or symptoms may appear as early as the first days of life or after an interval of normal or near-normal growth and development. Metabolic decomposition usually presents with a severe clinical phenotype, which include poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and loss of consciousness. This spectrum of manifestations is often fatal; however, severe neurological sequelae and/or regression of neurodevelopmental milestones can be the prominent signs in those who survive. Overall, treatable inborn errors of metabolism can be divided in three groups, namely: (Group 1) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism giving rise to acute or chronic intoxication; (Group 2) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism affect in genergetic processes; and (Group 3) inborn errors involving cellular organelles, including lysosomal, peroxisomal, glycosylation, and cholesterol synthesis defects. The spectrum of neurological manifestations includes developmental delay, seizures and epilepsy, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, movement disorders, vision and hearing impairment, peripheral neuropathy, and psychiatric abnormalities. The main anatomical/imaging patterns reflects selective vulnerability of nervous system substance and include atrophy, (predominantly) symmetrical abnormalities, and dysmyelination, As several patients with neurometabolic diseases responds favorably to therapeutic trials, early detection and early intervention is of utmost importance to prevent catabolic-related damage and to revert to normal or near-normal parameters neurodevelopmental milestones.",

      "abstract": "With age, there is a gradual decrease in motor activity in humans [1] and animals [2]. This is based on a whole list of natural causes: functional deterioration of blood circulation especially in the microcirculatory channel, decreased mobility of joints, decreased level of metabolic processes other age-related changes [3], hypodynamia and hypokinesia [4], senile loneliness [5] increase their influence. One of the most important factors of age-related suppression of motor activity is not only a decrease in the functional capabilities of muscles, but also in the plasticity and general functional capabilities of the central nervous system and its peripheral departments [6, 7]. Psychoemotional, cognitive age-related changes and disorders are essential [8]. It should be noted that age-related changes are characterised by a decrease in stress tolerance, an increase in anxiety and worry, and the development of prodepressive manifestations [3]. The dopaminergic system is of significant importance in all the above changes [9, 10]. Undeniable suppression of the activity of the dopaminergic system is shown in senile dementia, Parkinson’s disease [11] in a number of other diseases [10]. The question of involvement of the dopaminergic system in senile changes remains debatable and the role of monoamine oxidase and central dopamine [12, 13], including in the age-related increase in the anxiety level of a conditionally healthy person, is particularly ambiguous. In connection with the above-mentioned, the following objective was set in the present study: to determine the changes in motor activity and anxiety level in 7-month-old, 12-month-old and 24-month-old rats when MAO-B was blocked.",

      "title": "BIOCHEMISTRY OF THE PSYCHONEUROSES— A REVIEW",
      "abstract": "A survey of the biochemical work in this field reveals a confusion of results. The lack of agreement among investigators may result from any one or more of a variety of uncontrolled factors. Differences in psychiatric diagnosis, poor research technique, including inadequate sampling and the lack of adequate normal control groups, lack of refinement in the biochemical techniques as well as lack of precision in the biochemical technicians, inadequate standards to indicate where the normal leaves off and the pathological begins, and insufficient or inept statistical treatment of the obtained data have all been more or less influential in presenting distorted and unreliable biochemical pictures of the mental disorders. These factors are in some measure within the control of the experimenter. Another factor over which the experimenter has no control and which is not a negligible one in explaining the variety and abundance of conflicting results is the variability of the psychoneurotic. The variability is uncontrolled and may yield high normal results oné day and low normal results the next in the same individual. A vegetative and vasomotor instability is probably a more or less constant symptom of neurotic behavior. The variability of the results of chemical studies of the blood appears to reflect the instability of the intermediary metabolism of the psychoneurotic. Hence the degree or kind of emotional stability may be a function of the amount of variability in the blood constituents. In the final analysis the variability of the psychoneurotic probably implies fatigue and over or under correction or loss of adaptability, which ultimately results in irritability, dysfunction and irreversibility of certain organic mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Les exigences operationnelles du metier de pilote sont susceptibles d'engendrer de la somnolence et des niveaux de charge mentale inadequats (i.e., trop faible ou trop eleve) au cours des vols. Les dettes de sommeil et les perturbations circadiennes liees a divers facteurs (e.g., longues periodes de services, horaires de travail irregulier, etc.) demandent aux pilotes de repousser sans cesse leurs limites biologiques. Par ailleurs, la charge de travail mental des pilotes presente de fortes variations au cours d'un vol : elevee au cours des phases critiques (i.e., decollage et atterrissage), elle devient tres reduite pendant les phases de croisiere. Lorsque la charge mentale devient trop elevee ou, a l'inverse, trop faible, les performances se degradent et des erreurs de pilotage peuvent apparaitre. La mise en oeuvre de methodes de detection de l'etat de somnolence et du niveau de charge mentale en temps quasi reel est un defi majeur pour le suivi et le controle de l'activite de pilotage. L'objectif de la these est de determiner si la voix humaine peut permettre de detecter d'une part, l'etat de somnolence et d'autre part, le niveau de charge mentale d'un individu. Dans une premiere etude, la voix de participants a ete enregistree lors d'une tâche de lecture avant et apres une nuit de privation totale de sommeil (PTS). Les variations de l'etat de somnolence consecutives a la PTS ont ete evaluees au moyen de mesures auto-evaluatives et electrophysiologiques (ElectroEncephaloGraphie [EEG] et Potentiels Evoques [PEs]). Les resultats ont montre une variation significative apres la PTS de plusieurs parametres acoustiques lies : (a) a l'amplitude des impulsions glottiques (frequence de modulation d'amplitude), (b) a la forme du signal acoustique (longueur euclidienne du signal et ses caracteristiques associees) et (c) au spectre du signal des voyelles (rapport harmonique sur bruit, frequence du second formant, coefficient d'asymetrie, centre de gravite spectral, differences d'energie, pente spectrale et coefficients cepstraux a echelle Mel). La plupart des caracteristiques spectrales ont montre une sensibilite differente a la privation de sommeil en fonction du type de voyelles. Des correlations significatives ont ete mises en evidence entre plusieurs parametres acoustiques et plusieurs indicateurs objectifs (EEG et PEs) de l'etat de somnolence. Dans une seconde etude, le signal vocal a ete enregistre durant une tâche de rappel de listes de mots. La difficulte de la tâche etait manipulee en faisant varier le nombre de mots dans chaque liste (i.e., entre un et sept, correspondant a sept conditions de charge mentale). Le diametre pupillaire - qui est un indicateur objectif pertinent du niveau de charge mentale - a ete mesure simultanement avec l'enregistrement de la voix afin d'attester de la variation du niveau de charge mentale durant la tâche experimentale. Les resultats ont montre que des parametres acoustiques classiques (frequence fondamentale et son ecart type, shimmer, nombre de periodes et rapport harmonique sur bruit) et originaux (frequence de modulation d'amplitude et variations a court-terme de la longueur euclidienne du signal) ont ete particulierement sensibles aux variations de la charge mentale. Les variations de ces parametres acoustiques etaient correlees a celles du diametre pupillaire. L'ensemble des resultats suggere que les parametres acoustiques de la voix humaine identifies lors des experimentations pourraient representer des indicateurs pertinents pour la detection de l'etat de somnolence et du niveau de charge mentale d'un individu. Les resultats ouvrent de nombreuses perspectives de recherche et d'applications dans le domaine de la securite des transports, notamment dans le secteur aeronautique.",

The neuropsychiatric symptoms induced IFN therapy are the most frequent reason for discontinuing it. The incidence of neuropsychiatric symp- toms is as high as 30 to 40% when mild neuropsychiatric alterations are included. Among various neuropsychiatric symptoms, affective disorders such as depression are predominant, followed by cognitive disorders such as delirium. Others include insomnia, anxiety, irritability, mania, delusion, hallucination, and change to aggres- sive personality. Neuropsychiatric symptoms occur at a wide range of times during IFN therapy. Characteristics of patients at risk of experiencing neuropsychiatric symptoms during IFN therapy include high age, high dosage of IFN, severe comorbid physical disorders, a history of psychiatric illness, neurotic premorbid personality, organic brain disease, family history of psychiatric illness, severe depression/somatic anxiety/sleep disturbance before treatment, and low degree of informed consent to IFN therapy. In general, dosage reduction or discontinuation of IFN is recommended in cases of IFN neurotoxicity. If necessary, psychotropic agents are to be administered. We should make carefully and early intervention in any case where there is evidence of possible suicidal tendencies.",

Much excellent research * has more directly involved both the sympathetic and the parasympathetic components of the autonomic system. Claims are registered that the reactivity of the autonomic system is normal 5 as measured by known methods or that it is sluggish.† The decreased reactivity of the schizophrenic to cold is ascribed to the diminished secretion of epinephrine and the deficient or disordered output of adrenocortical factors, which similarly accounts for the diminished elevation of the blood sugar in response to stress. 3 There is a tendency to emphasize either the sympathetic nervous system 6 or the parasympathetic nervous system.‡ In the acute phases sympathetic predominance does appear to be present.§ Nevertheless, injections of blood from excited schizophrenics",

Attacks are typically precipitated by coffee, tea, or alcohol; they can also be triggered by excitement, stress, or fatigue, or can be spontaneous. Attacks involve dystonic posturing with choreic and ballistic movements, may be accompanied by a preceding aura, occur while the individual is awake, and are not associated with seizures. Attacks last minutes to hours and rarely occur more than once per day. Attack frequency, duration, severity, and combinations of symptoms vary within and among families. Age of onset is typically in childhood or early teens but can be as late as age 50 years. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of familial PNKD is suspected in a proband who presents with attacks of dystonia, chorea, and/or ballismus typically provoked by alcohol or caffeine. Identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in PNKD by molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis. Management Treatment of manifestations: Avoid triggers (e.g., caffeine, alcohol, excitement, stress, fatigue). Response to pharmacologic treatment is poor; clonazepam or diazepam can be effective in some individuals. Some individuals have responded to gabapentin, levetiracetam, or acetazolamide. Surveillance: Monitor medication requirements and dosage. Genetic counseling Familial PNKD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, all reported individuals with familial PNKD have inherited PNKD from an affected parent. Offspring of an affected individual have a 50% chance of inheriting the PNKD pathogenic variant. Once the PNKD pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.",

Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) V menghapus diagnosis untuk skizofrenia simpleks, namun dalam Pedoman Penggolongan Diagnostik Gangguan Jiwa (PPDGJ) III dan International and Classification Diseases (ICD)-10 masih disertakan. Studi kasus ini membahas pasien yang didiagnosis skizofrenia simpleks dengan diagnosis pembandingnya episode depresif berat dengan gejala psikotik. Seorang laki-laki bernama AY, berusia 28 tahun, dan tidak tamat sekolah dasar tidak memiliki figur ayah. Klien AY pernah bekerja secara wajar serta menyukai lawan jenis. Kemunduran fungsi psikologis kemudian terjadi. Simtom negatif dari skizofrenia pada AY sangat menonjol, yaitu sedikit berbicara, afek datar, menarik diri dari pergaulan sosial, minat dan ambisi kurang, dan dorongan vitalitas rendah. AY memiliki ide atau pikiran-pikiran bahwa dirinya bersalah, berdosa, dan memandang sesuatu tampak kotor sehingga terdapat perilaku mencuci yang berulang-ulang.

Kata kunci: skizofrenia simpleks, simtom negatif, diagnosis, ego ABSTRACT Simple Schizophrenia is an unusual type of schizophrenia characterized by slow, progressive development of negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as inability to meet community demands, and overall performance degradation. Unlike other types of schizophrenia (hebephrenic, paranoid, and catatonic), simple schizophrenia is difficult to determine the diagnosis. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) V cleared the diagnosis for simple schizophrenia, but in the Mental Disorder Diagnostic Classification Guidelines (MDDCG) III and International and Classification Diseases (ICD) -10 are included. This case study discusses patients diagnosed with simple schizophrenia with a comparative diagnosis of severe depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms. A man named AY, aged 28 years, and did not finish primary school has no father figure. He has worked fairly and liked the woman. The decline of psychological function then occurs. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia in AY are very prominent, ie, little speech, flat affects, withdrawal from social intercourse, lack of interest and ambition, and low vitality drive. AY has ideas or thoughts that he is guilty, sinful, and looks at something so dirty that there is repetitive washing behavior. The integration result of psychological tests shows pathological signs, such as depression, anxiety, and affective disorders. The psychological dynamics of AY shows some traumatic experiences in childhood that are repressed. Conflict that develops with the mother so as to produce a complex between alien ego with ego.

      "abstract": "Kratom, a non-federally regulated botanical herb, is widely growing in popularity as a naturopathic alternative for mood, anxiety, and attention deficit symptoms, along with legal recreational use as a psychoactive agent. It is predominantly sold without restriction and easily accessible over the counter at naturopathic, specialty \"vape\" or \"smoke shops\" and on the internet. Kratom's most abundant alkaloids, Mytragynine (MG) and 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-MG), have demonstrated multi-mechanistic properties via dopamine, serotonin, adrenergic, and mu-opioid-type receptors interaction in a dose-dependent manner. Given the reported association between Kratom consumption and its mood-altering and stimulant-like effects, we considered its role in the exacerbation of those predisposed to or with certain preexisting mental health disorders. In addition, Kratom's psychoactive compound derivatives are not detected in routine urine toxicology screens, which may pose a diagnostic obstacle when suspecting its use in critical settings such as acute mania or bipolar disorder with psychotic features. Considering its growing availability, potential for addiction, and withdrawal, the authors aim to highlight the need for further research on the potential effects of Kratom and its use as a crucial consideration during assessment, as well as the association between Kratom use and the exacerbation of those predisposed to or with certain preexisting mental health disorders. We concluded that, on balance, there was sufficient evidence to justify the plausibility of the association between Kratom ingestion in exceeding doses and the exacerbation of certain psychiatric manifestations such as psychosis.",

Improvement of performance was graded as modest in four, moderate in four, marked in 10 and dramatic in 10. This was usually sustained for periods up to two years. Evidence of toxicity was signaled by few of the variables monitored. Mental effects included enhanced interest, improved memory, transitory sleeplessness and nervousness. Nausea and vomiting were largely circumvented by slowing of the increases of the daily dose. A peripheral dopadecarboxylase inhibitor diminished the therapeutic dose of L-dopa required and eliminated anorexia and nausea in one case.

Most research within the last five years has focused on panic disorder; the findings include support for the usefulness of imipramine and clomipramine and probably other agents; evidence that the benzodiazepines alprazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, and clonazepam are approximately equally effective as antipanic agents; and high variability in relapse rates after discontinuation of drug treatment. Further work is required to determine whether buspirone and other forthcoming serotonin agonist drugs have a role in treating panic disorder and other anxiety disorders. For generalized anxiety disorder, scientific studies do not support the effectiveness of beta blocker; tricyclics may be potentially useful. Psychopharmacological treatments for social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder are also reviewed.",

      "abstract": "Burnout is a highly researched syndrome resulting from job stress. It is an ultimate response that occurs because of chronic exposure to stressors from the job characterised by the magnitudes/key dimensions which are feeling of cynicism, sense of ineffectiveness, detachment from the job, lack of accomplishment and overwhelming exhaustion.1 This implies that burnout characterised by a variety of factors can cause extreme suffering to an individual. Exhaustion is a central quality of burnout and the most obvious manifestation of this complex syndrome. It refers to feelings of being overextended and depleted on one’s emotional and physical resources. The individual feels drained due to perpetual lack of energy as a result of which, the quality of work responsibility is compromised. The major sources of this exhaustion are work overload and personal conflicts at the work place. The cynicism dimension represents the interpersonal context that refers to negative, callous, or excessively detached response to various aspects of the job which results in the loss if idealism and dehumanisation of others. The inefficacy dimension represents the self-evaluation component of burnout that refers to feeling of incompetence and lack of achievement and productivity in work. Burnout is a cumulative reaction on ongoing occupational stressors. Healthcare professionals, especially clinicians seem to be at particular risk for burnout. Additionally nurses, specifically psychiatric nurses are considered as a group at risk for excessive stress and burnout because they are in constant interaction and frequent interpersonal contact with psychiatric clients and their families.2 These reasons and risk factors can be same in between the professions, however, even within the discipline there are gender differences that calls for further discussions.

      "abstract": "Introduction Withdrawal states with delirium, having convulsive syndrome in their structure, are one of the most severe emergency conditions in psychiatry. Objectives A total of 160 patients were examined with delirium alcohol withdrawal. Prognostic factors of occurrence of convulsive syndrome in the withdrawal syndrome of alcohol were studied. Methods Clinical, psychopathological, electrophysiological. Results It was found that the most significant prognostic factors seizures were: severe bloating condition, the duration of hard drinking, the total dose of drinking alcohol before the breakdown of consumption alcohol. Convulsive syndrome not always correlated with marked vegetative disorders in the state of withdrawal of alcohol. Convulsive syndrome that appeared after the development of delirious syndrome often indicated a more serious conditionIt is suggested that the convulsive pattern of response to the severe condition of alcohol withdrawal is formed in some young patients under the influence of endogenous factors, but is realized under certain situational conditions - long binge drinking, massive consumption o alcohol before the break of the reception of alcohol, the use of psychoactive drugs with stimulating effect. In the electrophysiological examination, there were significant differences in the group of patients with convulsive syndrome in the current admission from the group of patients with convulsive syndrome in the past and the group without convulsive syndrome in the state of abolition of alcohol. Conclusions It is emphasized that when indicating the seizures in the state of abolition of alcohol in the past, the beginning of treatment is necessary to begin even in a state of binge drinking.",

      "abstract": "Despite precise definitions and exclusions for 19 syndromes of neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE), under some circumstances it appears to be difficult to differentiate whether neuropsychiatric symptoms are caused by SLE or by other reasons such as primary mental disorders or substance-induced mood disorders, especially induced by glucocorticoids or antimalarials. We report the case of a male patient with SLE who presented with an exacerbation of bipolar disorder triggered by chloroquine. Firstly, when the patient was diagnosed with SLE, he underwent six months of therapy with chloroquine without any psychiatric symptoms. Later, the SLE returned and the patient was prescribed chloroquine again, without any mental illness. When the third exacerbation of SLE occurred, it coincided with a severe depressive episode with psychotic features that became aggravated for the first time after the administration of chloroquine. The chloroquine was subsequently replaced with hydroxychloroquine for the next six months without any behavioral problems, following which, the SLE and mood disorder were in remission. Later, a bipolar disorder relapse occurred, manifested by a manic episode, and in the following three months, despite psychiatric treatment, a manic episode with psychotic features developed four days after chloroquine was prescribed for arthritis. It was the second time that the mood disorder was exacerbated by chloroquine. Since that time, chloroquine has been withdrawn. Currently the patient is undergoing treatment with hydroxychloroquine and psychiatric drugs with good response. Our case points out that although chloroquine-induced psychosis is rare, patients presenting with behavioral changes need physicians’ attention in order to diagnose early and efficiently treat encountered mood disorders.",

      "title": "Episodic Ataxia Type 1",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1) is a potassium channelopathy characterized by constant myokymia and dramatic episodes of spastic contractions of the skeletal muscles of the head, arms, and legs with loss of both motor coordination and balance. During attacks individuals may experience a number of variable symptoms including vertigo, blurred vision, diplopia, nausea, headache, diaphoresis, clumsiness, stiffening of the body, dysarthric speech, and difficulty in breathing, among others. EA1 may be associated with epilepsy. Other possible associations include delayed motor development, cognitive disability, choreoathetosis, and carpal spasm. Usually, onset is in childhood or early adolescence. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis is based on clinical findings, an electrophysiologic test of axonal superexcitability and threshold electrotonus, and/or the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in KCNA1 by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Acetazolamide, a carbonic-anhydrase inhibitor, may reduce the frequency and severity of attacks in some but not all affected individuals. Antiepileptic drugs may significantly reduce the frequency of attacks in some individuals. Supportive therapies, such as physical therapy, may reduce the risk of later-onset orthopedic complications. Routine treatment of seizure disorders, scoliosis, and developmental disabilities. Prevention of primary manifestations: In addition to pharmacologic treatments, behavioral measures including avoidance of stress, abrupt movements, loud noises, and caffeine may be used to reduce disease manifestations in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Prevention of secondary complications: Joint contractures can be prevented by appropriate physiotherapy. Surveillance: Annual neurologic examination. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Triggers of attacks, including physical exertion, emotional stress, and changes in environmental temperature; marked generalized myokymia has been reported during induction of anesthesia. Pregnancy management: Affected women should be made aware that pregnancy may trigger attacks; possible loss of balance and falls could endanger the fetus. Several stressors that trigger attacks may cause breathing difficulties; thus, delivery by C-section should be considered. Genetic counseling EA1 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with EA1 have an affected parent; however, de novo pathogenic variants have been reported. Each child of an individual with EA1 has a 50% chance of inheriting the KCNA1 pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member.",

      "abstract": "Depression has surpassed HIV/AIDS, malaria, diabetes and war as the leading cause of disability and economic burden worldwide. It is the most common psychiatric disorder in developed countries. Another major public health issue is chronic pain. In Europe, pain is the most common cause for people to use healthcare resources. Nevertheless, there are no universally accepted treatment guidelines for treating chronic pain. The well-known anaesthetic agent ketamine appears as an interesting and promising management drug for both conditions. A single dose of ketamine alleviates depressive symptoms within minutes in patients who have failed to respond to two or more conventional antidepressants and these effects are sustained for one week to months. Ketamine is also effective for bipolar depression, it decreases suicidal ideation and has shown positive results in the treatment of other mental conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Furthermore, ketamine has shown antidepressant effects in patients who do not respond to electroconvulsive therapy. Therefore, the off-label use of ketamine (i.e. using it for different purposes than anaesthesia) is increasingly common in the medical setting. In order to treat patients who are refractory to depression and chronic pain treatments, healthcare professionals are claiming compassionate reasons to obtain the authorisation to use ketamine as an antidepressant and/or analgesic. However, ketamine is a mood enhancer and its hedonistic use is widespread. Under medical surveillance and based in growing scientific evidence, the current psychedelic renaissance is bringing a new paradigm in the treatment of different types of disorders.",

      "abstract": "In a previous publication (Brown and Birley, 1968) we have presented some findings which suggest that life changes and crises frequently precipitate the acute onset, relapse or exacerbation of schizophrenic states. To summarize : consecutively admitted patients diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia were seen at mental hospitals serving a known catchment area. The first fifty whose onsets occurred within three months of admission and could be accurately dated within a week were included. Both the patient and at least one other informant were interviewed about the occurrence of certain previously defined and datable events occurring to the patient or to close relatives. These included such events as moving house, starting or leaving a job, admission to hospital, birth, marriage or death during the twelve weeks prior to onset. These were classified, according to their apparent independence of the patient's control, as ‘independent’ or ‘possibly independent’. The former were those which could be regarded as outside his control, e.g. discovering a burglary or hearing of a brother's serious illness. ‘Possibly independent’ events were those which were considered to have been within the patient's control but which had not been brought about by any unusual behaviour on the patient's part. They were chiefly changes of job, or of opposite sex friends. (Loss of job would, under certain circumstances, be rated as ‘independent’, e.g. when a whole firm closed down).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Withdrawal-emergent adverse effects of antipsychotics are an infrequently identified condition which can appear during antipsychotic dose reduction and medication change. In this paper, we present the case of severe extrapyramidal symptoms after a dose reduction of risperidone is presented. A patient, 23 years of age, was admitted to a health care facility due to an unexpected change in his behavior, with paranoid delusions, incoherent thinking, and significant anxiety. An initial risperidone treatment was soon changed to zuclopenhixol. Subsequently, severe extrapyramidal symptoms appeared, after which the medication was switched back to resperidone. Following this treatment, the patient left the health care facility and stopped the medication of his own volition. Psychotic symptoms and massive extrapyramidal symptoms again occurred. These symptoms subsided only slowly during a subsequent treatment with olanzapine. The development of adverse neurological effects together with a worsening of productive psychotic symptomatology may be explained by withdrawal of antipsychotic medication. These symptoms are often attributed to new medications, which are prematurely discontinued after the appearance of an adverse effect, but which are potentially beneficial to a patient, provided that enough time for a spontaneous subsidence of withdrawal-emergent effects is given. Any change in antipsychotic treatment should be carefully considered and thoroughly planned.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety symptoms and disorders are common in community settings, and in primary and secondary care. Symptoms can be mild and transient, but many people are troubled by severe symptoms that cause great personal distress, and which impair social and occupational function. The societal burden associated with anxiety disorders is considerable, but many who might benefit from treatment are not recognized or treated by healthcare professionals. By contrast, some patients receive unnecessary or inappropriate treatment. Recognition relies on keen awareness of the psychological and physical symptoms seen in all anxiety disorders, and accurate diagnosis rests on the identification of the specific features of particular disorders. The need for treatment is determined by the severity and persistence of symptoms, the level of associated disability and impact on everyday life, the presence of co-existing depressive symptoms, and other features such as a good response to or poor tolerability of previous treatment approaches. Choice of treatment is influenced by patient characteristics, patient and doctor preferences, and the local availability of potential interventions. There is much overlap between the different anxiety disorders for evidence-based and effective therapies (such as the prescription of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a course of individual cognitive–behavioural therapy) but there are also important differences, so it helps to become familiar with the characteristic features and evidence base for each disorder.",

A patient reacts to his disease, to his treatment, and to his physician with manifest psychological, cultural, and—for want of a better term—physiological regression. Where the regression is not manifest there are obvious pathological efforts of the patient to obscure it. 4. By means of iatrogenically induced regression it is possible to bring about new affects or mood states. 5. The bodily functions which are psycho-physiologically excited or inhibited by the regression or the defenses against it either increase or oppose the pathophysiology of the disease.",

      "title": "Treatment of Mental Health in Patients With Chronic Liver Disease",
      "abstract": "Answer questions and earn CME Content available: Author Interview and Audio Recording The term depression represents a constellation of symptoms that are largely nonspecific in respect to diagnosis. At one extreme is an \"everyday depression,\" a person's experience in the face of a specific challenge, such as paying one's taxes. At the opposite extreme is major depressive disorder (MDD) described by profound subjective hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness. Biological symptoms occur, including sleep continuity disorder with early-morning awakening, a diurnal variation of mood, and anhedonia. Because of their nonspecificity, other conditions may easily mimic depression, including symptoms of chronic liver disease (CLD), such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and delirium. The key therefore is to apply careful, psychiatric differential diagnoses, especially in CLD. Notably, this article focuses on depression and anxiety, while important coexisting or independent mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse, are not discussed. In any evaluation of a patient with depression and/or anxiety, the aforementioned mental health disorders should be evaluated for and managed appropriately. Patients with CLD can have profoundly altered pharmacokinetics resulting in higher systemic drug levels. Portosystemic shunting in cirrhosis reduces the first-pass metabolism of high-extraction medications.1 The volume of distribution (Vd) is further impacted by decreased transport proteins and ascites and peripheral edema. In addition, drugs eliminated by hepatic metabolism or biliary excretion can have dramatically reduced clearance. The stage of cirrhosis and location of pathology also affect drug metabolism, with glucuronidation often preserved in early cirrhosis compared with cytochrome P450 enzymatic activity, while entities affecting the centrilobular region, such as alcohol-related liver disease, where oxidative functions are focused, impact enzymatic activity to a different degree to a disease affecting the portal region.1 There are additional complexities to consider in CLD, including HE and benzodiazepine sensitivity. In patients with severe MDD (9-item patient health questionnaire [PHQ-9] ≥ 20), the preferred initial treatment is pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, which is more efficacious than either treatment modality alone (Fig. 1).2 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered for severe suicidality. For mild-to-moderate MDD (PHQ-9 < 20), initial monotherapy with either second-generation antidepressants (SGAs), such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (Table 1), or psychotherapy is reasonable.3 SGAs and psychotherapy have each shown efficacy as monotherapies and have comparable efficacy and tolerability.3 SGAs are the first-line pharmacological agents due to their efficacy and safety (remission rate of 43% versus 29% in placebo)4 and are comparable across and within respective categories.5 The seminal STAR*D study, which captured a broadly \"real-world\" representative patient sample with both medical and psychiatric comorbidities, reported a 37% remission rate with citalopram as first-line therapy.6 Given the comparable efficacy among SGAs, drug selection is based on symptoms, adverse effects, comorbidities, patient preference, affordability, and prior medication experiences. Importantly, SGAs are low-risk hepatotoxic medications with only rare asymptomatic mild elevation of serum aminotransferases (0.5-1%). A specific concern for SSRIs in CLD is their association with gastrointestinal bleeding partly attributed to serotonin transporter inhibition on platelets affecting platelet aggregation after vascular injury.1 Although the clinical evidence is mixed, caution should still be used with coprescribing of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antiplatelets.1 Concomitant proton pump inhibitors can be considered to mitigate the risk for bleeding in the more vulnerable patients who have thrombocytopenia or additional risk factors for bleeding. The atypical antidepressant, bupropion, is useful in mitigating sexual dysfunction given the lower rate versus SSRIs/SNRIs (6% versus 16%) or for treating comorbid tobacco dependence, whereas mirtazapine should be avoided in patients with features of metabolic syndrome (~3 kg weight gain after 8 weeks).7 Trazodone is useful for insomnia given its higher rate of somnolence versus SGAs, including mirtazapine (42% versus 25%), and can be considered as first-line therapy if insomnia is a large component of the somatic symptoms, with mirtazapine as an alternative.7 The adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors limit their routine use. Antidepressants should be initiated with low doses.1 In CLD, no change is required in the initial dose for SSRIs/SNRIs; however, a target maintenance dose of half of standard dosing is recommended.1 Subsequent titration is based on the balance of response and adverse effects. The dosing principles of SSRIs/SNRIs are the same for TCA use in CLD; however, the risk for HE precipitation needs consideration. It is also recommended to reduce the bupropion and mirtazapine dose by 50%.1 Time to improvement is around 2 weeks; however, most patients do not achieve remission after initial treatment,7 necessitating therapy switch or augmentation with additional interventions. Should patients display minimal improvement after 4 to 6 weeks, the next treatment step is titration to the maximum tolerated dose, an early switch to an alternative SGA,8 or augmentation with psychotherapy.9 The previously referenced STAR*D experience reported 31%, 14%, and 13% remission rates for second, third, and fourth acute pharmacotherapy treatment steps, respectively.6 No one psychotherapy is clearly superior in MDD; however, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal psychotherapy are first line because they have been more widely studied.10 CBT involves identifying and changing maladaptive beliefs, improving emotional regulation, and developing personal coping strategies. CBT is effective as monotherapy with higher remission rates achieved versus controls (waiting list or usual care) (41% versus 21%).10 Interpersonal psychotherapy is an attachment-focused psychotherapy that centers on resolving interpersonal problems and symptomatic recovery.10 An important consideration is a patient's willingness to engage fully in psychotherapy, which is crucial in optimizing behavioral intervention efficacy. There are additional behavioral therapies that can be considered, including family therapy, problem-solving therapy, and relaxation techniques. Exercise programs can also be considered depending on tolerability and illness extent.11 Anxiety symptoms are likewise nonspecific and require careful differential diagnosis. Treatment can be deferred with clinical follow-up in mild generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; GAD-7 < 10) if symptoms do not interfere significantly with functioning. For patients who warrant treatment, SSRIs/SNRIs and/or CBT are the established first-line interventions (Fig. 1).12 The benefit of medication and CBT are similar, and the choice of which to use, if not using both, is determined by patient preference, availability, affordability, and adverse effects. There are no differences in the efficacy between SSRIs/SNRIs, and their dosing in CLD is the same as for MDD.12 Patients who have a suboptimal response to a SSRI/SNRI after 4 to 6 weeks should be reassessed for co-occurring untreated conditions or ongoing stressors requiring greater problem-solving focus. If no co-occurring exacerbating factors are elicited, then a different SSRI/SNRI should be initiated. If no response occurs after two SSRI/SNRI trials, then augmentation with either a nonaddictive second-line medication (e.g., buspirone, pregabalin, or hydroxyzine) or CBT should be initiated. Hydroxyzine is useful for short-term control of anxiety symptoms, in lieu of benzodiazepines. If benzodiazepines are being considered in CLD, then short-acting benzodiazepines such as lorazepam (which has no active metabolites) should be prescribed to mitigate the risk for drug accumulation. However, the risk for benzodiazepine dependence, whereby patients develop various behavioral and physical symptoms, including tolerance (loss of efficacy over time) and a withdrawal syndrome with medication cessation, limits their utility. Moreover, patients with CLD treated with at least 3 days of benzodiazepines are at a high risk for developing first-time HE possibly related to increased cerebral benzodiazepine receptor availability in CLD, particularly among patients with alcohol use disorder. Notably, pregabalin (through its agonism of GABA) and hydroxyzine (via its anticholinergic effects) can also increase the risk for HE, and thus patients with CLD who are taking these medications should be monitored carefully. Aerobic exercise, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and yoga may also be worthwhile adjunctive treatments.13 In addition, web-based and telehealth interventions will continue to be incorporated into patient management in the near future.14 If effective, medication for GAD should be continued for at least 12 months given the lower relapse rate versus 6 months of therapy (8.8% versus 53.7%).15 If the patient relapses after cessation of an effective medication, the same medication can be restarted and the treatment course extended.",

Although the drugs often come with some side effects, the use of these drugs are becoming more popular. The drugs are used to cure mental problems like anxiety disorder and depression by controlling the neurotransmitters like GABA-A, serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in the synapses between neurons in our body. This paper will try to find the cause of this phenomenon by looking at different factors like the impact of COVID-19, gender, economic influence, and veteran PTSD. Different events cause different hormonal changes in the body such as, hormone releases from menstruals cycle during ovulation, stressful, lonely, and fearful situations, causing potential impact on one’s body and one’s vulnerability to anxiety and depression. This paper will also look at the negative side of both medical and illicit anxiolytics and antidepressants, including side effects, abuse and addiction, and look for potential solutions to these problems.",

Psychosis can be primary (functional/nonorganic) or secondary (organic), which may differ in their symptoms or presentation. The neurobiology of psychoses is complex, involving many neurotransmitters, particularly the dopaminergic system. Thorough cognitive and physical examinations, as well as laboratory testing, are necessary for the diagnosis and management of psychosis. Antipsychotic medications are the cornerstone in the management of primary psychosis (such as schizophrenia), in combination with various psychosocial strategies. Treatment of primary neurological or medical illness is more important in the management of secondary psychoses. Antipsychotic medications have different side‐effect profiles but similar efficacies, with clozapine being an exception in its superior efficacy in treatment‐resistant schizophrenia. The common adverse effects include metabolic side effects with atypical antipsychotics and neurologic (extrapyramidal) side effects with typical antipsychotics.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review To review the conceptual problems in distinguishing between undifferentiated somatoform disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome, for both may present with fatigue as the main symptom. Recent findings The differences and/or similarities between undifferentiated somatoform disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome have not been studied, conceptually or empirically. The literature fails to present discriminant validity of chronic fatigue syndrome in relation to undifferentiated somatoform disorder. A critical feature is implied in the definition of undifferentiated somatoform disorder but absent from the definitions of chronic fatigue syndrome: some patients experience their fatigue as being exclusively physical and not as mental, which is prima facie peculiar, for fatigue is necessarily a mental experience. One is not able to experience fatigue without a mind (or a brain). This experience is characterized as a ‘mindless’ fatigue, underpinned by pathological reductionist thinking. By not recognizing this critical feature, diagnostic endeavours may perpetuate the problem as a function of the patient's difficulty. Summary Proponents of chronic fatigue syndrome should distinguish chronic fatigue syndrome from undifferentiated somatoform disorder, if chronic fatigue syndrome is a distinct entity at all. Further, the ‘mindless’ quality is a critical feature that needs consideration in refining the concept of undifferentiated somatoform disorder.",

ADHD often persists into adulthood, with resultant impairments of social, academic and occupational functioning. ADHD is a very common disease during childhood and, the pooled overall prevalence of ADHD was found to be 5.29%. When screening for ADHD, clinicians should try to develop rapport with patients and their caregivers to increase the likelihood that they will follow the diagnostic process and treatment. The current drugs that have received Food and Drug Administration-approval for ADHD include stimulants (methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine) and non-stimulants (atomoxetine, guanfacine, and clonidine). Stimulants improve inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity in addition to decreasing disruptive behaviors and promoting academic achievement and the maintenance of appropriate friendships. In order to enhance drug compliance, the use of long-acting stimulants is increasing. Atomoxetine is a selective norepinephrine reuptake blocker, the effects of which may take 2 to 6 weeks to be noticeable. Furthermore, α2 agonists may help to improve behavioral side effects, tics, and sleep problems during stimulant or atomoxetine use. Common side effects of stimulants and atomoxetine include headache, stomachache, and loss of appetite. Routine electorcardiography before medication is not recommended unless there is a specific indication.

More commonly, mild asymptomatic elevations in liver function tests are seen and these are not predictive of progression to more severe liver injury. Laboratory monitoring of liver function before and during treatment is recommended with the use of valproic acid and carbamazepine, but not for other psychotropic drugs, although regular laboratory testing is not a reliable method for detecting or preventing severe liver injury. Clinical monitoring for signs and symptoms suggesting hepatotoxicity or hypersensitivity reactions that affect the liver is more important.

      "title": "Drug Addiction: Hyperkatifeia/Negative Reinforcement as a Framework for Medications Development",
      "abstract": "Compulsive drug seeking that is associated with addiction is hypothesized to follow a heuristic framework that involves three stages (binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect, and preoccupation/anticipation) and three domains of dysfunction (incentive salience/pathologic habits, negative emotional states, and executive function, respectively) via changes in the basal ganglia, extended amygdala/habenula, and frontal cortex, respectively. This review focuses on neurochemical/neurocircuitry dysregulations that contribute to hyperkatifeia, defined as a greater intensity of negative emotional/motivational signs and symptoms during withdrawal from drugs of abuse in the withdrawal/negative affect stage of the addiction cycle. Hyperkatifeia provides an additional source of motivation for compulsive drug seeking via negative reinforcement. Negative reinforcement reflects an increase in the probability of a response to remove an aversive stimulus or drug seeking to remove hyperkatifeia that is augmented by genetic/epigenetic vulnerability, environmental trauma, and psychiatric comorbidity. Neurobiological targets for hyperkatifeia in addiction involve neurocircuitry of the extended amygdala and its connections via within-system neuroadaptations in dopamine, enkephalin/endorphin opioid peptide, and γ-aminobutyric acid/glutamate systems and between-system neuroadaptations in prostress corticotropin-releasing factor, norepinephrine, glucocorticoid, dynorphin, hypocretin, and neuroimmune systems and antistress neuropeptide Y, nociceptin, endocannabinoid, and oxytocin systems. Such neurochemical/neurocircuitry dysregulations are hypothesized to mediate a negative hedonic set point that gradually gains allostatic load and shifts from a homeostatic hedonic state to an allostatic hedonic state. Based on preclinical studies and translational studies to date, medications and behavioral therapies that reset brain stress, antistress, and emotional pain systems and return them to homeostasis would be promising new targets for medication development. <h3>Significance Statement</h3> The focus of this review is on neurochemical/neurocircuitry dysregulations that contribute to hyperkatifeia, defined as a greater intensity of negative emotional/motivational signs and symptoms during withdrawal from drugs of abuse in the withdrawal/negative affect stage of the drug addiction cycle and a driving force for negative reinforcement in addiction. Medications and behavioral therapies that reverse hyperkatifeia by resetting brain stress, antistress, and emotional pain systems and returning them to homeostasis would be promising new targets for medication development.",

      "abstract": "Objective Routine delays in the diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) are well known and conceivably attributable to the absence of cues, other than anti-adrenal autoantibodies, to pursue subclinical PAI. Subclinical PAI is latent unless the afflicted patient encounters stress such as an acute illness, surgery, psychosocial burden, etc. It remains to be demonstrated whether a history of stress-related health changes is a useful cue to pursue a diagnosis of latent PAI. Methods The patients were selected for a history of recurrent symptoms, i.e., gastrointestinal symptoms, fatigue, or lassitude, aggravated by stress and alleviated by the removal of stress, and signs, i.e., weight loss, hypotension, and hyperpigmentation. As the early morning cortisol levels were low or low-normal and the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels were within the reference ranges, provocation tests, i.e., insulin-induced hypoglycemia tests and low-dose (1 μg) corticotropin tests (LDTs), were used to estimate the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis status. Patients with the HPA axis dysfunction on two provocation tests were supplemented with physiologic doses of glucocorticoids (GCs). The effects of GC supplementation on stress-related health changes were observed. Results The ACTH levels after insulin-induced hypoglycemia were higher and the cortisol levels were lower in the patients than in the control subjects. The cortisol levels in the patients were increased less significantly by LDT than those observed in the control subjects. Stress-related health changes ceased to recur and signs, i.e., a low body weight, hypotension, and hyperpigmentation, were ameliorated following GC supplementation. Conclusion A history of stress-related health changes is useful as a cue to pursue latent PAI in patients with low or low-normal early morning cortisol levels.",

She consulted to psychiatry, seven months after his father died of lung cancer, he frequently smoked tobacco and cannabis at home, had been diagnosed a year before his death. The patient described increased anxiety symptoms, with panic attacks, hypnopompic and hypnagogic hallucinations, and increased depersonalization and de-realization phenomena. She denies the use of psychoactive substances in addition to tobacco and alcohol, occasionally. Likewise, the depressive symptomatology was objectified in relation to the grief for the loss of his father. She received treatment with SSRIs and two months later, referred partial remission of symptoms, with persistence of dissociative symptoms. In addition, she presents emotional instability, feelings of emptiness, self-defeating ideas without structured suicide ideation. In recent months, he has presented avoidant behaviors and isolation with affectation in his habitual functioning. Now, in this case: are depersonalization and de-realization normal, part of the anxiety crisis, a sign of a high-risk mental state, or a prelude to a serious mental illness?

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSDs) are reported to be among the most prevalent and unfavourable mental disorders in the individuals who have gone through life-threatening situations. For the late decades, they have been standing out against the background of marginal mental disorders. PTSDs are caused by an individual’s direct involvement in the stress event, fraught with grave consequences and accompanied by mortal fear, horror and sensation of powerlessness. The problem is pressing for the today’sUkrainein view of theDonbaswarfare, mass resettlement, changes of job and forms of activity. The disease may be diagnosed as PTSD in the case the groups of symptoms persist more than a month since a traumatic event has occurred. For a long time, a good many of soldiers have been reported to reveal anxiety-phobic and behavioural disorders, as well as the signs of organic cerebral lesion. Some of them occur during combat operations, whereas the most of symptoms develop and aggravate 1-2 years after coming home. The PTSD patients mostly develop insomnia, anxiety, depression, and increased aggressiveness, which cause conflicts. An individual may become wicked, aggressive, discontented and cynical on a social basis. Depressive symptoms are hypothesized to mediate the relationship between PTSD and aggression. The ATO men with PTSD, who do not take alcohol, develop depression 1-1.5 year after coming back and, with alcohol added, the problem of aggression arises. Based on this, we suggest that a staff of personnel, trained in psychological aid to the combatants with PTSD, should be formed. Besides, our cases prove that, with friendly support and compassion as well as active stand in life and adequate social work, aggression and proneness to conflict are unlikely to develop. On the contrary, lack of support results in excessive alcohol consumption and, thereof, increased proneness to conflict. The system of treatment and rehabilitation measures for survives should involve combination of psychotherapy, psychological correction, and medicines.",

The causes are considered to be related to both the patient's symptoms and the clinician's attitude toward akathisia. The patient factors include mild severity of akathisia, lack of apparent motor restlessness, no voluntary expression of inner restlessness, no clear communication of inner restlessness, restlessness in body parts other than the legs, atypical expressions of inner restlessness, other prominent psychic symptoms, and absence of other extrapyramidal signs. The clinician factors include emphasis on objective restlessness, failure to consider akathisia during antipsychotic therapy, failure to fully implement antiakathisia treatments in ambiguous cases, and strict adherence to research diagnostic criteria. Akathisia is likely to be overlooked or underdiagnosed when both patient and clinician factors are present. Currently, there may be two major problems with underdiagnosis: (1) symptoms that fulfill the diagnostic criteria for akathisia are overlooked, and (2) conditions that do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria but can still benefit from antiakathisia measures are underdiagnosed.",

We performed DBS of the ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) of the thalamus for treatment of coarse action tremor in a patient with SCA2 (spinocerebellar ataxia type 2) in the wheelchair-bound stage. Although improvement of the tremor of the proximal part was incomplete, the patient regained substantial parts of daily functioning. The effect lasted for more than 6 years, and the suppression of tremor significantly contributed to maintaining the level of the patient’s expression into the bedridden stage. Vim DBS can be a treatment option for tremor in SCA patients, even in the advanced stage, as long as the tremor is depriving the patient of behavioral expression. As residual proximal tremor may hamper functional recovery, DBS of other targets or multi-targets should be further explored to attain a better outcome.",

      "abstract": "Many women in their reproductive years experience some mood, behavioral. or physical symptoms in the week prior to menses. Variability exists in the level of symptom burden in that some women experience mild symptoms, whereas a small minority experience severe and debilitating symptoms. For an estimated 5%–8% of premenopausal women, work or social functioning are affected by severe premenstrual syndrome. Many women in this group meet diagnostic criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Among women who suffer from PMDD, mood and behavioral symptoms such as irritability, depressed mood, tension, and labile mood dominate. Somatic complaints, including breast tenderness and bloating, also can prove disruptive to women's overall functioning and quality of life. Recent evidence suggests that individual sensitivity to cyclical variations in levels of gonadal hormones may predispose certain women to experience these mood, behavioral, and somatic symptoms. Treatments include: antidepressants of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor class, taken intermittently or throughout the menstrual cycle; medications that suppress ovarian cyclicity; and newer oral contraceptives with novel progestins.",

Common serotonergic agents used for pain management include opioids, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants.Case: A 24-year old woman diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome underwent multidrug therapy for pain management over approximately five years. During this period, changes in diaphoresis severity were noted following adjustments to pain medications. The concurrent use of multiple serotonergic agents, exacerbation of diaphoresis after the addition or dose escalation of opioids, and resolution of symptoms upon discontinuation of duloxetine (Cymbalta®, Lily S.A.) strongly suggest the development of serotonin syndrome.Conclusions: Diagnosing serotonin syndrome without neuromuscular symptoms can be challenging. Careful monitoring of changes in symptoms and signs following medication use is essential in such cases.",

      "title": "Psychological Inflexibility in Depression with Psychotic Features: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Introduction Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mood disorder that can last for weeks or even months, in which there is a depressed mood accompanied by anxiety, in addition to negative changes in cognitive functions, psychomotor movement and vegetative functions. Depression with psychotic features is a psychiatric syndrome that progresses with delusions as well as severe symptoms such as psychomotor retardation or agitation, depressive ruminations, deterioration in cognitive functions, and confusion. Compared to the subtypes without psychotic features, the symptoms are more severe, the age of onset is earlier, and the duration of the disease is longer. Feelings of guilt, worthlessness and suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide are more common. The risk of exacerbation is greater. Diagnosis of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia is more common in first-degree relatives of these patients. Objectives An 18-year-old female patient with somatic delusions and psychotic persistence that started after a sexual trauma and persisted for 1 month was consulted after organic exclusions were made. It is understood from the anamnesis that the patient had a manic episode about 6 months ago and that his mother was followed up with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The patient’s current clinical picture was evaluated as depression with psychotic features, and after hospitalization, the treatment was adjusted as fluoxetine 20 mg/g, olanzapine 5 mg/g, and lithium 900 mg/g. Self as context, cognitive defusion and acceptance interventions were applied to the patient. Methods When the Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire(CFQ), Self-as-Context Scale(SACS), Acceptance and Action Questionnaire(AAQ-II) completed by the patient during hospitalization and in remission periods were compared, it was observed that there was a significant regression in the patient’s psychological inflexibility during the period of remission. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient whose clinical picture was presented in order to contribute to the scientific literature. Results Depression with psychotic features is another clinical picture in which psychological inflexibility increases, and it has been observed that interviews to increase psychological flexibility during the treatment process contribute positively to the treatment process. For this reason, the contribution to the healing process can be better clarified in further studies on interventions to increase psychological flexibility applied in addition to pharmacological treatments. Image: Conclusions Psychological inflexibility is an effort to control a person’s emotion, thought, behavior or experience in a dysfunctional way in the face of an undesired experience. It has been seen in studies conducted in recent years that; There is a significant positive correlation between high psychological inflexibility and somatization, depression, anxiety and other psychological disorders.

      "title": "Enxaqueca",
      "abstract": "A enxaqueca ou migrânea é definida como uma cefaleia primária que surgi a partir de crises que são acompanhadas geralmente por náusea, fotofobia, hiperacusia, sensibilidade a odores e vômitos. Em algumas pessoas, a enxaqueca pode ser antecedida por sintomas como parestesia, afasia, vertigens e escotoma. Essa condição é denominada como aura, também podendo ser encontrada em outras patologias, como a epilepsia. Considera-se a enxaqueca como uma das vinte doenças mais debilitantes e pode-se relacionar o uso inadequado de medicamentos, absenteísmo, diminuição da produtividade e mudança de humor como fatores impactantes. Tendo na população, uma prevalência de 5-25% em mulheres e 2-10% em homens, sendo que no curso de medicina é de 8,5%. As crises podem ser desencadeadas por fatores ambientais, emocionais ou dietéticos, por exemplo, a mudança de temperatura, alterações hormonais, excesso de exercício físico, automedicação, poluição, uso de contraceptivos, alergias, depressão, queijos e vinho, dentre outros. A vida acadêmica, principalmente no curso de medicina, proporciona inúmeros fatores desencadeantes, como o alto nível de estresse e exigência, acarretando limitações no rendimento durante as crises. O tratamento das crises é feito de maneira emergencial na maioria dos casos, sendo que os pacientes com crises frequentes apresentam geralmente tolerância aos analgésicos comuns. Pacientes com aumento progressivo na frequência de crises, ocorrência de crise uma ou mais vezes por mês, incapacitação devido à dor ou abuso medicamentoso para tratar as crises são recomendados a fazerem tratamento profilático, tratamento que apresenta uma variedade de contraindicações e efeitos colaterais, não sendo eficazes em todos os casos. O objetivo deste trabalho é verificar a prevalência da enxaqueca nos estudantes do curso de medicina do UniFOA e constatar a necessidade da analgesia ao catalogar os principais fármacos utilizados e sua eficácia associada aos principais efeitos colaterais.",

      "title": "Maternal Depression, Mothering and Child Development",
      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder of affect characterized by persistent sadness or anhedonia (an inability to experience pleasure), typically accompanied by additional symptoms such as negative cognitions (self-perceptions of failure, feelings of guilt, and/or suicidal thoughts), somatic dysfunction (fatigue, loss of appetite, fatigue, disturbances in sleep), and impairment in daily functioning (e.g., indecisiveness) (Gelfand & Teti, 1990).When such a symptom pattern persists for at least two consecutive weeks and is not accompanied by period manic swings, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) identifies it as a major depressive episode (MDD).A formal DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of MDD can be given for a single major depressive episode, or for multiple, recurring episodes over time, which is common.Other depressive disorders identified in DSM-IV-TR include dysthymic disorder, and adjustment disorder with depressed mood.Depression is more likely to occur under adverse circumstances, such as poverty, single parenthood (Gallagher, Hobfoll, Ritter, Lavin, 1997;Grant, Jack, Fitzpatrick, & Ernst, 2011), and chronic illness (Davidson, Echeverry, Katon, Lin, & Von Korff, 2011), and it may also be co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders.It is common to find, for example, that depression co-occurs with anxiety (Balta, & Paparrigopoulos, 2010) and that chronic depression is a salient feature of some personality disorders (Brieger, Ehrt, Bloeink, & Marneros, 2002).Because of the ubiquity of depressed mood as a feature of psychiatric, medical, and psychosocial conditions, researchers frequently focus on the severity and chronicity of depressive symptoms as a predictor of behavior in different contexts, using well-established, validated questionnaires that tap directly into participants' level of sadness, anhedonia, negative dysfunctional cognitions, somatic complaints, and impairments in daily living.Such measures include the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Steer, & Garbin, 1988), the Center for Epidemiological Studies -Depression scale (Radloff, 1977), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Hamilton, 1960).These assessments tap the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms and provide overall scores and cut points that, when exceeded, identify individuals with clinical levels of symptom severity.www.intechopen.",

A differentiation is made between neuroglucopenic symptoms (e.g., confusion, somnolence) on the one hand, and those that arise as a result of the counterregulatory response of the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., tremor, sweating), on the other. The diagnosis of hypoglycemia can cause considerable problems, in particular when only isolated single symptoms present (e.g., confusion, psychosis, seizures, coma). For the elective clarification of recurrent hypoglycemia, further diagnostic examinations (e.g., fasting with determination of hormones, measurement of insulin) are employed in addition to the patient's history. For differential diagnostic considerations not only organic causes, but also adverse drug reactions and a factitious genesis must be excluded. In the event of an emergency (e.g., hypoglycemic coma) the usual form of treatment is the administration of glucoses or glucagon.",

      "title": "Gambling Disorder",
      "abstract": "Gambling disorder is characterized by a persistent and recurrent maladaptive pattern of gambling behavior, preoccupation with gambling activities, loss of control, and continued gambling despite problems in social or occupational functioning (Box 62- ). It is associated with significant financial losses, legal problems, and disrupted interpersonal and familial relationships. Individuals with gambling disorder are also at increased risk for suicide attempts (Phillips et al. 1997), new-onset comorbid psychiatric disorders (Kessler et al. 2008), and several medical conditions (Morasco et al. 2006). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Gambling Disorder 312.31 F63.0 Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more) of the following in a 12-month period: Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble). Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed). After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (\"chasing\" one's losses). Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic episode . Specify if: Episodic: Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months. Persistent: Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for multiple years. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months. In sustained remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of 12 months or longer. Specify current severity: Mild: 4–5 criteria met. Moderate: 6–7 criteria met. Severe: 8–9 criteria met. Despite its serious consequences (Kessler et al. 2008; Petry et al. 2005), gambling disorder is rarely diagnosed and even more rarely treated (Slutske 2006). Less than 10% of individuals with gambling disorder ever seek treatment (Slutske 2006), probably because of a combination of ambivalence about seeking treatment on the part of the patients and limited access for those who wish to seek it. Although some data suggest that many individuals with gambling disorder recover without formal treatment (Hodgins and el-Guebaly 2000; Slutske et al. 2003), there is no available information on the time to remission in natural recovery or the risk of recurrence. Fortunately, despite our limited knowledge about the epidemiology and etiology of gambling disorders, a growing body of literature has examined pharmacological and psychological treatments for gambling disorder.",

      "abstract": "Coffee, tea, chocolate and caffeinated drinks are the main sources of caffeine, which is consumed in almost all ages and socioeconomic levels. Caffeine acts as a non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist in the central nervous system. Its main effects are as psychostimulant, acting in addition on the respiratory, muscular and cardiovascular systems. Basically, caffeine is metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P-450 1A2 enzymes (CYP1A2). Several drugs can interact with its metabolism. The observed interindividual differences of its effects can be explained by variations in its metabolism. The main therapeutic use of caffeine is bronchodilator in respiratory diseases. Other possible uses are under investigation. Acute or chronic consumption of caffeine can induce several adverse effects, including intoxication that can be lethal. Finally, caffeine can be considered a drug of abuse. It has positive reinforcing actions, produces tolerance, and a withdrawal syndrome after stopping its consumption. Caffeine can cause different mental disorders such as dependence, which is not included in the DSM-IV-R, withdrawal syndrome and intoxication. Depending on its use, caffeine can be considered a nutrient, a drug or a drug of abuse.",

      "abstract": "El autismo (o espectro autista) es un desorden neuro-conductual –hereditario y heterogeneo- del desarrollo del cerebro, que comienza en ninos menores de tres anos de edad y que deteriora su comunicacion e interaccion social causando un comportamiento restringido y repetitivo. Pueden jugar un papel en estos sindromes, algunas anormalidades cromosomicas. Las soluciones ni son simples ni uniformes en los diferentes sindromes, que algunas veces se asocian con patologias conocidas como el sindrome de Down, rubeola congenita, sindromes de Rett o de la X fragil, embriopatia por valproato, etc. Para hacer un diagnostico de autismo, el DSM-IV –de la Asociacion Americana de Psiquiatria- indica que es necesario encontrar las siguientes caracteristicas: A. Un total de seis o mas manifestaciones de (1), (2) y (3), con l menos dos de (1), al menos una de (2), y al menos una de (3). 1. Trastorno cualitativo de la relacion, expresado como minimo en dos de las siguientes manifestaciones: a. Trastorno importante en muchas conductas de relacion no verbal, como la mirada a los ojos, la expresion facial, las posturas corporales y los gestos para regular la interaccion social. b. Incapacidad para desarrollar relaciones con iguales adecuadas al nivel de desarrollo. c. Ausencia de conductas espontaneas encaminadas a compartir placeres, intereses o logros con otras personas (por ejemplo, de conductas de senalar o mostrar objetos de interes). d. Falta de reciprocidad social o emocional.  2. Trastornos cualitativos de la comunicacion, expresados como minimo en una de las siguientes manifestaciones: a. Retraso o ausencia completa de desarrollo del lenguaje oral (que no se intenta compensar con medios alternativos de comunicacion, como los gestos o mimica). b. En personas con habla adecuada, trastorno importante en la capacidad de iniciar o mantener conversaciones. c. Empleo estereotipado o repetitivo del lenguaje, o uso de un lenguaje idiosincrasico. d. Falta de juego de ficcion espontaneo y variado, o de juego de imitacion social adecuado al nivel de desarrollo. 3. Patrones de conducta, interes o actividad restrictivos, repetitivos y estereotipados, expresados como minimo en una de las siguientes manifestaciones: a. Preocupacion excesiva por un foco de interes (o varios) restringido y estereotipado, anormal por  su intensidad o contenido. b. Adhesion aparentemente inflexible a rutinas o rituales especificos y no funcionales. c. Estereotipias motoras repetitivas (por ejemplo, sacudidas de manos, retorcer los dedos, movimientos complejos de todo el cuerpo, etc.). d. Preocupacion persistente por partes de objetos. B. Antes de los tres anos, deben producirse retrasos o alteraciones en una de estas tres areas: (1) Interaccion social, (2) Empleo comunicativo del lenguaje o (3) Juego simbolico.  C. El trastorno no se explica mejor por un Sindrome de Rett o trastorno desintegrativo de la ninez.

      "abstract": "Depressive symptoms, due either major depression or clinically significant, subsyndromal depression, occur commonly in the course of Alzheimer's disease. For a variety of clinical and methodological reasons, this remains an area that begs for new investigation. At the very least, these depressive symptoms should be viewed as a cause of significant and treatable \"excess disability\" (Kramer and Reifler, 1992). Demented patients with clinically significant depression (e.g., depressed mood, significant loss of appetite, insomnia, fatigue, irritability, and agitation) should be considered for a trial of antidepressant therapy, even when they fail to meet full diagnostic criteria for major depression. These symptoms will, in most instances, respond to antidepressant therapy. The \"rules\" for treatment of depression in dementia are slightly different than for cognitively intact patients: (a) start low, go slower, (b) pay attention to cognitive toxicity of all medication combinations, and (c) depressive symptoms do not persist as long as in cognitively intact patients. Current treatments, especially those SSRI's like fluoxetine and sertraline that have cognitive enhancing effects, should be considered the \"first line\" antidepressants. We need to emphasize early detection and treatment of depressive symptoms in dementia in all arenas.",

      "abstract": "The psychotropic drugs responsible for side effects on the gastrointestinal tract are essentially those that develop the most effective anticholinergic actions. But also to be taken into account are the depression of the central nervous system, the alpha adrenergic effects and the indirect results of the relief of the anxiety and depression symptoms. In spite of the anti-emetic properties of the antipsychotic drugs, nauseas and vomiting appear as frequently as with placebos. The antipsychotic and antidepressive drugs provoke dysphagia and achalasia, because of a loss of tonus. Some cases of hiatal hernia are attributed to tricyclic antidepressants. The latter drugs, as well as IMOA and aliphatic and piperidinated phenothiazines, induce constipation in psychiatric patients, who are already prone to it. Even ileus may occur, or dilatation of the bowel or the stomach. Diarrhea is rare. Patients treated with psychotropics often complain of a dry mouth (xerostomy). This unpleasant sensation is succesfully treated with betanechol (75 mg/d) which does not impair - as pilocarpine does - the therapeutic effects. Dental caries, moniliasis and parotidites have been attributed to neuroleptic drugs or tricyclic antidepressants, on account of the inhibition of the salivary flow. Vomiting, diarrhea and epigastric burning appear in 10% of the patients treated with lithium (even when the posology is correct).",

Vigorous treatment, aimed at achieving symptom control as promptly as possible while avoiding adverse effects, is therefore important. Strategies to accomplish this aim are possible, but differ for each of the three antimanic drugs principally employed. For lithium, uncomplicated manic patients can be started at 15 mg/kg of body weight, with dosage increase every 3 to 4 days until response, complicating adverse effects, or a serum level of 1.2 to 1.4 mEq/L occurs. Valproate, if administered as divalproex, can usually be initiated at a dosage of 20 mg/kg of body weight, which is associated with earlier improvement than that observed with lithium. Carbamazepine requires a relatively slow dosage escalation from an initial 200 mg once or twice daily, due to the possibility of neuromuscular and cognitive adverse effects. Adjunctive medications are frequently necessary and add to the importance of a thorough knowledge of the dosing strategies needed at different points in early therapy of bipolar disorder.",

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM5) provides diagnoses for these opioid-induced conditions. Substance-induced disorders, particularly for depression and anxiety, include intoxication and withdrawal, substance/medication-induced depressive disorder and substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder. Importantly, DSM-5 criteria indicate that diagnoses for major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder cannot be made if there is a substance, such as opioid medications, responsible for the condition. Often the way to distinguish between a substanceinduced disorder and an independent major depressive or anxiety disorder is to discontinue the opioid medications. Given that opioids are not efficacious for long-term prescribing, discontinuation of the medication is the treatment of choice.",

Patients in alcohol withdrawal have decreased or stopped their heavy, prolonged ingestion of alcohol and have subsequently begun to have at least two of the following symptoms: autonomic hyperactivity, tremor, nausea or vomiting, hallucinations, psychomotor agitation, anxiety, and grand mal seizures. Evaluation of the patient at risk for alcohol withdrawal should include a complete history and physical examination; laboratory tests are often indicated. The patient's progress should be assessed before, during, and after therapy, preferably with a validated instrument. After the initial evaluation and assessment but before the administration of dextrose-containing solutions, a 100-mg dose of thiamine hydrochloride should be given by i.m. or i.v. injection. Routine supplementation with calcium, magnesium, and phosphate is questionable. The need for fluid and electrolyte administration varies depending on losses. Most patients in alcohol withdrawal can be managed with supportive care alone, but for more severe or complicated withdrawal, pharmacologic therapy may be necessary. Benzodiazepines, especially diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, are the drugs of choice. Barbiturates, β-blockers, and antipsychotics are generally not recommended as first-line therapy. Several drugs in other classes, including carbamazepine and clonidine, have been shown to be about as effective as benzodiazepines in a few studies, but the studies were small, the patients were usually in mild withdrawal, and validated instruments for assessing withdrawal were often not used. Some agents, such as β-blockers, may play a role as adjuncts to, not replacements for, benzodiazepine therapy. For patients in alcohol withdrawal who do not respond to supportive care, benzodiazepines are the treatment of choice.",

      "abstract": "A review of the published case reports of adverse behavioral episodes or unexpected psychopathology in patients taking benzodiazepines was undertaken in an attempt to determine if these adverse or unexpected events are more likely to occur with alprazolam when compared with other currently marketed benzodiazepines. Adverse behavioral phenomena and unexpected psychopathology were divided into the following categories: (1) anger or violence, (2) impulsive, suicidal, or self-harming behavior, (3) depression, (4) mania, (5) schizophrenia, (6) withdrawal syndromes and (7) physical dependence and abuse liability. It is difficult to draw conclusions from this literature because of the limitations of spontaneously reported cases and the lack of epidemiologic studies. Despite these limitations, it appears that some differences between alprazolam and older benzodiazepines may exist. The older benzodiazepines are more commonly reported to have adverse events than alprazolam (with the exception of mania or hypomania). On the other hand, worsening in post-traumatic stress disorder and an increase in impulsive behavior in patients with borderline personality disorder have only been reported in patients receiving alprazolam. This is probably explained by the fact that only alprazolam has been used to any great extent in these conditions.",

      "title": "Tolerance and withdrawal symptoms may not be helpful to enhance understanding of behavioural addictions",
      "abstract": "The importance attached to tolerance and withdrawal symptoms in the conceptualization of addiction reflects the prominence of theories that posit neuroadaptation to the presence of a drug [1], and suggest that drug use persists because of negative reinforcement, i.e. as an effort to avoid the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms [2]. Given that tolerance and withdrawal symptoms do not always occur in addiction, they have not been included in the recent general definitions of addiction [3–5]. However, these phenomena are often incorporated into the conceptualization of behavioural addictions. For example, one model [6] postulates that tolerance and withdrawal symptoms are mandatory for any behaviour to be considered addictive. In behavioural addictions, tolerance is usually defined in a way that superficially resembles its counterpart in substance addictions, i.e. dose escalation to achieve the same initial effect. Thus, tolerance is portrayed as an increase in various aspects of the activity (frequency, intensity, duration, time spent, money spent) to achieve the desired effect, satisfaction or excitement. Occasionally, it is described as a need for the latest or more powerful equipment (e.g. mobile phones, computers, software) to produce the desired effect or excitement [7,8]. The diagnostic criteria for internet gaming disorder [9] do not state the purpose of an increase in activity engagement, implying that any such increase denotes tolerance. Nevertheless, increased activity engagement and a need for better equipment in behavioural addictions do not necessarily reflect tolerance [10,11], which underscores the importance of assessing the contextual aspects of these phenomena. Withdrawal symptoms in behavioural addictions have usually been described as emotional states (irritability, restlessness, anger, moodiness, sadness, guilt, anxiety, feeling tense) that occur when activity engagement is thwarted. In internet gaming disorder, withdrawal symptoms can be easily mistaken for reactions to an externally imposed gaming deprivation or for craving for gaming [12]. There have been no reports of severe physical withdrawal symptoms in behavioural addictions [13], and a few studies reporting physical withdrawal symptoms in pathological gambling [14,15] had significant methodological shortcomings. Withdrawal states occurring upon abrupt drug cessation comprise both physical and emotional symptoms, with the latter hypothesized to contribute more to the motivation to continue using drugs because of the short-lasting effects of the former [2]. In pathological gambling, however, emotional withdrawal symptoms, as well as tolerance, were not found to play an important role in maintaining this behavioural addiction [16]. ‘Borrowing’ tolerance and withdrawal from substance addictions might have been driven by a need to ‘legitimize’ behavioural addictions. This was unnecessary, because these phenomena and theories suggesting that they are important for addiction have not been able to account fully for either type of addiction [5]. The alternative is to conceptualize behavioural addictions via specific factors that explain more clearly attachment to the particular activity [17] and maintenance of addictive behaviour. In pathological gambling, these factors were identified as the negative feelings associated with gambling losses, shortage of money and the need to be secretive about gambling [16]. The task is to ascertain factors that provide an adequate account for each behavioural addiction. None.",

      "title": "The “new syndrome excuse syndrome”",
      "abstract": "I Introduction Behavioral science is on the march. Psychiatrists and psychologists are identifying an ever-proliferating and often bewildering array of new syndromes or disorders. Some have received the clinical and scientific imprimatur of actual inclusion the American Psychiatric Association's official diagnostic manual, referred to as DSM-IV.(2) Examples of the diagnostically respectable disorders include: Antisocial Personality Disorder,(3) Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,(4) Intermittent Explosive Disorder,(5) Kleptomania, and Pathological Gambling.(6) DSM-IV characterizes other categories as in need of further study because their existence as discrete psychopathological entities is not yet sufficiently validated to warrant inclusion the manual.(7) Examples Postconcussional Disorder,(8) Caffeine Withdrawal,(9) and Dysphoric Disorder(10) (which was formerly termed Premenstrual Syndrome or PMS and, later, Late Luteal Phase Dysphoric Disorder). Finally, and least respectably, some alleged syndromes have not received general provisional recognition as valid, but are advocated with varying degrees of success by clinicians and researchers who have supposedly identified them. Examples from the last group, which have been chosen from the mental health and legal literatures and from legal cases, where they often arise, include, Battered Woman Syndrome,(11) Vietnam Syndrome,(12) Sexual Abuse Syndrome,(13) Holocaust Survivor Syndrome,(14) Urban Survival Syndrome,(15) Rotten Social Background,(16) and Adopted Child Syndrome.(17) Diagnostic identification, research, and advocacy are unproblematic if they are confined within the mental health professionals' domain. Although the concepts of mental and behavioral abnormality are hotly contested, human suffering is potentially involved, and we will all probably benefit from activities aimed at acquiring valid knowledge of how our mental and behavioral nature is carved at the joints. But swept away by the torrent of science and, alas, pseudo-science concerning alleged new syndromes, many people now suffer from yet another new that I have identified, or at least given a name: the Syndrome Excuse Syndrome. The primary diagnostic criterion for this is an almost irresistible impulse to use the alleged discovery of syndromes of mental abnormality as good reason to alter the criminal law. Those suffering from the new include many members of the criminal defense bar, properly seeking any possible purchase to exonerate defendants, legal commentators, some mental health professionals, and some judges and legislatures. Courts and, less often, legislatures are increasingly inundated with claims that syndromes old and new, validated and unvalidated, should be the basis for two types of legal change. The first is the creation of new affirmative defenses. Examples are claims for the creation of a discrete battered victim or urban survivor syndrome defense. The second change proposal is the expansion of old defenses: for example, loosening objective standards for justifications such as self-defense. All too often, I fear, the new syndromes are not sufficiently validated and are the product of unacceptably soft science or clinical crockery. Nevertheless, this paper will not discuss the pseudo-science problem. Instead, it will accept the validity of some of the new syndromes or some yet to be discovered syndromes because the legal issues are theoretically and practically important only if claimed new syndromes do have reasonable validity. Consequently, this article win assume away the scientific and clinical problems and will focus on the conceptual difficulties and policy dilemmas the New Syndrome Excuse Syndrome presents. This article attempts to clear the theoretical terrain to determine how the criminal law should understand and respond to claims that new evidence warrants the expansion of existing defenses or the creation of new ones. …",

However, this syndrome may be under-recognized by both clinicians and patients (i.e., low insight, particularly among children and adolescents), and is characterized by an insidious onset, dose-dependent effects (i.e., higher selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor doses are more likely to result in symptoms), and complete resolution of symptoms with the discontinuation of the offending drug. Treatment strategies may include a dose reduction of the offending selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, augmentation with a second drug, and/or discontinuation of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and subsequent treatment with a nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant.",

The second half explores the story behind the diagnostic terminology used in clinical practice today, and describes the recent changes to the addiction section of the major classificatory systems. Addiction is conceptualised as a disorder involving a loss of the normal flexibility of human behaviour, leaving a dehumanised state of compulsive behaviour (‘overwhelming involvement’). It has acquired a variety of terminology over time, much of it inferring moral weakness. Addiction may be associated with psychoactive substances or other pleasurable behaviours and occurs on a spectrum of use and harms, which vary in severity. The term ‘dependence’ may refer to physiological aspects of addiction (tolerance or withdrawal), but is also used to define the severe end of the spectrum. Confusion around this terminology has led to it being removed from the latest version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5).",

      "abstract": "DRUGS, BIOCHEMISTRY, AND CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE: TOWARD A THEORY OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY PAUL WILLNER* Levels ofExplanation ofPsychotropic Drug Effects A few micrograms of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) can produce a major psychological experience, usually described as an \"altered state of consciousness,\" which can sometimes be the most powerful experience a person has ever had. \"Explanations\" ofthese phenomena usually involve a discussion of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxy-tryptamine (5-HT) [1, 2]. Clearly, however, a description of biochemical phenomena in no sense explains the LSD experience, since no account is offered of how the biochemical changes give rise to altered states of consciousness. A similar problem arises in relation to biochemical \"theories\" of mental disorder, such as the dopamine (DA) hypothesis of schizophrenia or the catecholamine hypothesis of depression. Paranoid delusions are not explained by demonstrating that DA systems are hyperactive; neither are ideas of suicide explained by a malfunction of noradrenergic (NA) systems . However successful these reductionist hypotheses may be in generating testable hypotheses, leading, for example, to the development of effective pharmacological agents, a hypothesis of brain function which omits any reference to the structure or operating principles ofthe brain is unlikely to be of more than heuristic value. An alternative approach attempts to bridge this conceptual gap by seeking explanations of psychotropic drug effects in four independent explanatory domains: biochemical, physiological, cognitive, and subjective (using die word \"cognitive\" in the information-processing sense in which it is now used in cognitive psychology, rather than as a synonym for \"conscious\"). In terms of a computer analogy, these four domains ?Psychology Department, City of London Polytechnic, Old Castle Street, London El 7NT, England.© 1984 by The University of Chicago. AU rights reserved. 003 1-5982/85/2801-0404$01 .00 Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, 28, 1 · Autumn 1984 \\ 49 include two levels of \"hardware\" and two of \"software,\" corresponding very roughly to components, wiring, programming, and editing. Each explanatory domain has its own language and logic, and each must be understood in its own terms. A recent theory of the action of anti-anxiety drugs [3] will serve as an illustration. In this account, which is embedded within the context of a comprehensive neuropsychological theory of anxiety, anxiolytic drugs act at the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex, or at other sites (level 1), to disrupt the flow of impulses in neural circuits in the hippocampus and subiculum (level 2). The information carried in these circuits is used to make a comparison between actual and expected events: a mismatch activates a \"behavioural inhibition system,\" which suppresses ongoing motor activity and increases arousal and attention to the environment (level 3); these effects are experienced as anxiety (level 4). Irrespective of its empirical merits [4], the hypothesis has a sound conceptual basis. The analysis spans all four levels ofexplanation, rather than the usual two: physiological (level 2) and cognitive (level 3) levels are interposed between biochemistry (level 1) and subjective experience (level 4). In addition to describing an empirical relationship between receptor interactions and an anti-anxiety effect, die account also specifies the neural pathways implicated, their role in normal cognitive functioning , and the relationship between changes in cognitive function and changes in experience. In describing the psychological effect of a drug or an endogenous biochemical change, it is important to consider not only the intervening levels of explanation but also the nature of the transitions between adjacent levels. The generation of changes in neural firing (level 2) from the biochemical effect of a drug (level 1) depends on the integration of that biochemical effect into a context of other ongoing biochemical processes , which include adaptive regulation resulting from the primary drug effect. The effect of tricyclic antidepressant drugs at noradrenergic synapses is a well-worked example: it is now established that, in addition to potentiating neurotransmission by blocking neurotransmitter reuptake, after chronic treatment, tricyclics also decrease neurotransmission by reducing the sensitivity of postsynaptic beta-receptors [5]. It is rather less frequendy recognized, however, that the important issue is the net outcome of these and other effects on the traffic of nerve impulses in postsynaptic structures [6, 7]. Similar considerations apply to die transition from physiology (level 2) to cognitive processes (level 3). A good...",

      "title": "JS01-04 - Rational optimization of bipolar disorders’ treatment",
      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder is difficult to treat. There are several options to treat acute mania, but combination of two or more drugs is the rule rather than the exception, indicating the limitations of currently available therapies. The evidence base for the treatment of bipolar depression is much weaker, and again combination is the rule. Although patients with bipolar disorder may experience resolution of symptoms with acute treatment, many will continue to experience impaired functioning due to the episodic, chronic, and progressive nature of the illness. Maintenance therapy is needed for a variety of reasons, including prevention of relapse, reduction of subthreshold symptoms, decreasing the risk of suicide, and reducing the frequency of rapid cycling and mood instability. Although long-term therapy is usually required to maintain or improve functioning and quality of life, it has been a significant challenge to identify clinically effective treatments for long-term management. There are few currently-available, well-tolerated treatment options that are effective in all phases of bipolar disorder and which prevent recurrence of manic and/or depressive episodes. Questions concerning when to discontinue one of the drugs when two or more are used, or how to switch from one mood stabilizer to another, have not been addressed in clinical trials. Electroconvulsive therapy may be effective in treatment resistant cases and can be used as maintenance when pharmacotherapy is not enough. Psychoeducation may help to enhance treatment adherence and healthy lifestyle. A rational combination of the above mentioned strategies may help to optimize the outcome of this challenging condition.",

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can develop following exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence, and includes symptoms across four clusters: intrusions (e.g., unwanted and intrusive memories or images), avoidance (e.g., avoidance of people, places, or things that serve as reminders of the trauma), alterations in cognitions or mood (e.g., anhedonia, numbness, exaggerated negative beliefs about oneself, others or the world), and arousal (e.g., hypervigilance, irritable/angry behavior). PTSD is associated with family and relational distress; social, educational, and occupational impairment; comorbid psychiatric and physical conditions; and high economic costs and medical utilization. Effective treatments include cognitive behavioral therapies (e.g., exposure-based therapies) and pharmacotherapy (e.g., paroxetine and sertraline).",

      "abstract": "> “Hope is a good breakfast but a bad supper” \n> \n> Francis Bacon (1561–1626)\n\nFunctional dyspepsia (FD) has been defined as persistent or recurrent symptoms of unknown cause thought to originate in the proximal gastrointestinal tract. Symptom patterns may vary but usually include epigastric pain or burning. Non-painful dyspeptic symptoms such as early satiation, nausea, postprandial fullness and vomiting suggest an underlying abnormality in gastroduodenal motility. The Rome III consensus committee suggests that FD is subdivided into an epigastric pain syndrome and a postprandial distress syndrome based on symptom patterns.1 These terms have replaced the previous categories of ‘ulcer-like’ and ‘dysmotility-like’ dyspepsia. Dyspeptic symptoms are very common in the general population with prevalence rates of 20–40%, and although FD is not associated with increased mortality or morbidity the symptoms have a major impact on health-related quality of life, utilisation of healthcare resources and work productivity.2\n\nFD is probably a multifactorial disorder. Acid, Helicobacter pylori infection, visceral hypersensitivity, disturbances in gastric motility or accommodation and various psychosocial factors have all been implicated. Empiric antisecretory therapy, H pylori eradication or prokinetics remain the mainstay of treatment for FD, even though meta-analyses have shown limited or no symptomatic effects,3 4 and to date, …",

Many of the same effects are reported in normals after harmine and Nalline (other workers). unlike mescaline and LSD at usual dosage levels, the present psychotomimetics regularly produce drowsiness and sleep along with the aberrant mental effects. The resultant state is partly that of \"hypnagogic\" visual hallucinations or imagery. The results with increased dosage suggest that the basic effect of these agents is to produce an acute toxic reaction type. The difference between them and mescaline or LSD with respect to clouding of consciousness and certain aspects of the hallucinogenic response may be quantitative rather than qualitative. The indole nucleus is not necessary in the structure of psychotomimetics since Win-2299 and Nalline are non-indoles. The tertiary nitrogen grouping may contribute to certain aspects of psychotomimetic action.",

      "title": "What is the Relationship of Traumatic Brain Injury to Dementia?",
      "abstract": "There is a long history linking traumatic brain injury (TBI) with the development of dementia. Despite significant reservations, such as recall bias or concluding causality for TBI, a summary of recent research points to several conclusions on the TBI-dementia relationship. 1) Increasing severity o f a single moderate-to-severe TBI increases the risk of subsequent Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia. 2) Repetitive, often subconcussive, mild TBIs increases the risk for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative neuropathology. 3) TBI may be a risk factor for other neurodegenerative disorders that can be associated with dementia. 4) TBI appears to lower the age of onset of TBI-related neurocognitive syndromes, potentially adding \"TBI cognitive-behavioral features\". The literature further indicates several specific risk factors for TBI-associated dementia: 5) any blast or blunt physical force to the head as long as there is violent head displacement; 6) decreased cognitive and/or neuronal reserve and the related variable of older age at TBI; and 7) the presence of apolipoprotein E ɛ4 alleles, a genetic risk factor for AD. Finally, there are neuropathological features relating TBI with neurocognitive syndromes: 8) acute TBI results in amyloid pathology and other neurodegenerative proteinopathies; 9) CTE shares features with neurodegenerative dementias; and 10) TBI results in white matter tract and neural network disruptions. Although further research is needed, these ten findings suggest that dose-dependent effects of violent head displacement in vulnerable brains predispose to dementia; among several potential mechanisms is the propagation of abnormal proteins along damaged white matter networks.",

A high percentage of patients with advanced cancer suffer debilitating fatigue that has a severe and profound impact on their lives. Fatigue may be caused or exacerbated by numerous factors, including the disease itself and its treatment, or multiple other interrelating symptoms such as dyspnoea, cachexia, anaemia and psychological distress. Continuous assessment of fatigue is a critical component of care for the patient with this debilitating symptom. Initial assessment should incorporate a detailed description of the patient’s fatigue history, its development, symptoms of the condition and any potential causes. Individualised management strategies that may include a combination of interventions can be administered to meet the specific needs of each patient.

      "title": "Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor-Induced Serotonin Syndrome",
      "abstract": "The selective pharmacology of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) results in a lower potential for pharmacodynamic drug interactions relative to other antidepressants such as the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).However, the SSRIs have been implicated in the development of the serotonin syndrome-a potentially life-threatening complication of treatment with psychotropic drugs. The syndrome is produced most often by the concurrent use of two or more drugs that enhance central nervous system serotonin activity and often goes unrecognized because of the varied and nonspecific nature of its clinical features. The serotonin syndrome is characterized by alterations in cognition (disorientation, confusion), behavior (agitation, restlessness), autonomic nervous system function (fever, shivering, diaphoresis, diarrhea), and neuromuscular (ataxia, hyperreflexia, myoclonus) activity. The difference between this syndrome and the occurrence of adverse effects caused by serotonin reuptake inhibitors alone is the clustering of the signs and symptoms, their severity, and their duration. There are important pharmacokinetic interactions between SSRIs and other serotonergic drugs due principally to their effects on the cytochrome P450(CYP) isoenzymes, the potential for which varies widely amongst the SSRI group, which may increase the likelihood of a pharmacodynamic interaction. The exceptionally long washout period required after fluoxetine discontinuation may cause additional problems and/or inconvenience. Patients with serotonin syndrome usually respond to discontinuation of drug therapy and supportive care alone, but they may also require treatment with an antiserotonergic agent such as cyproheptadine, methysergide, and/or propranolol. To reduce the occurrence, morbidity, and mortality of the serotonin syndrome, it must be both prevented by prudent pharmacotherapy and given prompt recognition when it is present.

Even though it has not been included in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition , “behavioral addictions” section, CBD is a hot topic in current clinical psychiatry, because of its relevant prevalence (at least 5% in adult populations) and severe effect on quality of life. The CBD shares some clinical features with substance-related and behavioral addictions, impulse control disorders, and obsessive compulsive disorder, and it is often comorbid with other psychiatric illnesses (especially depressive and anxiety disorders). The treatment of CBD is therefore difficult, and clear therapeutic guidelines are not yet available. Treating the comorbid disorders as the first-line approach, or combining drugs with different pharmacodynamic profiles, has been suggested to address this challenging condition. Case A 60-year-old woman affected by a severe form of CBD with comorbid major depressive disorder, resistant/intolerant to previous selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatments and only partially responder to mirtazapine, achieved a good clinical improvement adding bupropion. Conclusions Combining 2 agents with different pharmacological profiles and mechanisms of action, such as bupropion and mirtazapine, could be a useful strategy in the management of complex CBD cases.",

The acute illness phase generally lasts no more than 2-3 weeks. However, there is increasing evidence that a proportion of COVID-19 patients experience a prolonged convalescence and continue to have symptoms lasting several months after the initial infection. A variety of chronic symptoms have been reported including fatigue, dyspnea, myalgia, exercise intolerance, sleep disturbances, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, fever, headache, malaise, and vertigo. These symptoms are similar to those seen in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), a chronic multi-system illness characterized by profound fatigue, sleep disturbances, neurocognitive changes, orthostatic intolerance, and post-exertional malaise. ME/CFS symptoms are exacerbated by exercise or stress and occur in the absence of any significant clinical or laboratory findings. The pathology of ME/CFS is not known: it is thought to be multifactorial, resulting from the dysregulation of multiple systems in response to a particular trigger. Although not exclusively considered a post-infectious entity, ME/CFS has been associated with several infectious agents including Epstein-Barr Virus, Q fever, influenza, and other coronaviruses. There are important similarities between post-acute COVID-19 symptoms and ME/CFS. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to establish COVID-19 as an infectious trigger for ME/CFS.

Those prescribed primarily to treat psychiatric disorders. These include sleeping tablets, tranquillizers, antidepressants and antipsychotics. 2. Those used to treat neurological disorders that have psychological side-effects. Examples are anticonvulsants and anti-parkinsonian drugs. 3. Those used to treat non-nervous disorders that may have psychological side-effects. 4. Illicit drugs used in the non-medical context by drug addicts. Drug-induced states that can influence testimony are mainly sedation, disinhibition, paradoxical reactions and alterations in memory. A list of pointers was given in this paper with respect to practical considerations in assessing the possible effects of drugs on testimony.",

Cluster A reflects odd or eccentric character structure; Cluster B reflects dramatic, emotional, or erratic character structure; and Cluster C reflects anxious or fearful character structure. Further details on diagnosis, etiology, and treatment issues follow. Accurate identification and optimal treatment of PDs can help improve outcomes of other psychiatric and medical illness.",

      "abstract": "Chronic insomnia has been linked to a variety of contributing variables, including as psychological training, genetic predispositions, dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes, and cognitive and physiological arousal. The hyper-arousal theory of insomnia postulates that sleep disturbances are caused by an increase in physiological arousal based on the discovery of high physiological arousal, which may be connected to these people's active stress system. Sometimes, sleep issues including difficulties getting asleep, difficulty remaining asleep, or having poor-quality sleep are referred to as insomnia. Insomnia can be brought on by a variety of things, including the use of psychoactive drugs, caffeine, nicotine, amphetamines, and cocaine; hormonal changes, such as menstruation and menopause; stressful life events, like the birth of a child and bereavement; disruptions of the circadian rhythm, like shift work and jet lag; some neurological disorders; and medical conditions, such as hyperthyroidism and rheumatoid arthritis. Everything in the universe vibrates at a specific frequency, and when we are in a state of natural resonance, we are in perfect health. But if a bodily component begins to vibrate at the incorrect frequency, the energy becomes trapped, and illness appears. In order to release the repressed energy and return resonance to its natural level, chanting can therefore be employed to affect a therapy.",

      "title": "Secondary bruxism: A valid diagnosis or just a coincidental finding of additional masticatory muscle activity? A narrative review of literature",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Bruxism is defined as a repetitive masticatory muscle activity that can manifest it upon awakening (awake bruxism‐AB) or during sleep (sleep bruxism‐SB). Some forms of both, AB and SB can be associated to many other coexistent factors, considered of risk for the initiation and maintenance of the bruxism. Although controversial, the term ‘secondary bruxism’ has frequently been used to label these cases. The absence of an adequate definition of bruxism, the non‐distinction between the circadian manifestations and the report of many different measurement techniques, however, are important factors to be considered when judging the literature findings. The use (and abuse) of drugs, caffeine, nicotine, alcohol and psychoactive substances, the presence of respiratory disorders during sleep, gastroesophageal reflux disorders and movement, neurological and psychiatric disorders are among these factors. The scarcity of controlled studies and the complexity and interactions among all aforementioned factors, unfortunately, does not allow to establish any causality or temporal association with SB and AB. The supposition that variables are related depends on different parameters, not clearly demonstrated in the available studies. Objectives This narrative review aims at providing oral health care professionals with an update on the co‐risk factors and disorders possibly associated with bruxism. In addition, the authors discuss the appropriateness of the term ‘secondary bruxism’ as a valid diagnostic category based on the available evidence. Conclusion The absence of an adequate definition of bruxism, the non‐distinction between the circadian manifestations and the report of many different measurement techniques found in many studies preclude any solid and convincing conclusion on the existence of the ‘secondary’ bruxism.",

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Panic Disorder (PD)",
      "abstract": "Participants of expert group on CPG for Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Panic Disorder S.C Tiwari, Nilesh Shah, I.D. Gupta, B.N. Gangadhar, Devendra Vijay Vergiya, Pratap Sharan INTRODUCTION Short description of anxiety disorders Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Definition: One of the anxiety disorders, where the primary symptoms of anxiety are present at most days for at least several weeks at a time, and usually for several months. The symptoms should usually involve elements of: Apprehension (worries about future misfortunes, feeling \" on edge\", etc) Motor tension (restlessness, inability to relax, trembling) Autonomic over activity (light-headedness, sweating, tachycardia, tachypnea, dry mouth etc) The transient appearance of depressive symptoms, does not rule out the diagnosis of GAD as main diagnosis. The sufferer must not meet the full criteria for depressive episode, phobic disorder, panic disorder or OCD. Patients with generalised anxiety disorder have high anxiety and are worried about intrapsychic conflicts or external environmental events. They have multiple somatic symptoms of anxiety, restlessness, difficulty in concentration, irritability, fatigue, muscular tensions and difficulty in sleeping particularly early insomnia. They have vague apprehension about future events and fear of unknown. Common features observed in anxiety disorders include: Panic Disorder- Episodes of intense fear or discomfort accompanied by severe autonomic activity, palpitations, sweating, dyspnoea, chocking sensation or other somatic symptoms like chest pain, trembling, nausea, discomfort or fluttering sensation in abdomen and impending fear of death. Patient perceives it as a serious medical condition and invariably reaches to a medical emergency setup where after thorough physical evaluation he is declared normal. Phobias- Many patients with GAD suffer from irrational, unrealistic fears and acute autonomic reactions to certain specific situations or extreme fear to certan inanimate objects. They include agarophobia (fear of open spaces) fear of crowds, being out side home alone or traveling in a bus train or car. Some may have fear in closed spaces (claustrophobia) fear of heights (acrophobia) fear of opposite sex (hetero-phobia) fear of sight of blood (erythrophobia) or fear of facing certain social situations (social anxiety disorder) the common feature among all phobias being intense fear, increased autonomic activity and avoidance behavior (avoiding the fearful object or situation). Obsessive compulsive disorder- (OCD) has been seperately dealt with in details in these guidelines however the patients suffering from OCD have recurrent repetitive unwanted intrinsic thoughts (obsessions) or actions (compulsions) or both which lead to extreme distress, loss of time and impairment of functioning of the individual. The obsessious include douts, ideas of contamination, sexual thoughts or religious preoccupations or negative thoughts towards gods/goddess, the compulsions include activities like counting, checking, repeating, washing hoarding and touching objects, some have to and fro movements of body parts. Patient is aware of the irrationality of thoughts/actions but cannot control them, which produces intense anxiety and autonomic arousal with feelings of helplessness and guilt. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - Usually it occurs after a terrifying event that involving physical or psychological traumatic event. It may also occure because of witnessing or experiencing a serious harm to other significant persons in life. Patients have terrifying recollections of the event, or nightmares. Some patients have an experience of living the event in an illusionary or imaginary situation with hallucinations, or flashback episodes. The patients suffer from intense psychological or physical distress. Many patients develop loss of interest, estrangement from others, sleep disturbances, irritability, difficulty concentrating, hypervigilance, and exaggerated startle response. This phenomenon may persist for one month or more before it is diagnosed. Natural history and course The age of onset is difficult to specify, as most of the patients have been anxious for long but report late. Nearly 1/3rd of the patients who have GAD seek psychiatric treatment. Many go to GPs, physicians, cardiologist, chest specialist for the somatic component of the disorder. Because of the high incidence of co-morbid mental disorders, the course and prognosis is difficult to predict. The occurrence of several negative life events greatly increases the likelihood that the disorder will develop. In all, a chronic condition may be life long. COMMON INGREDIENTS OF MANAGEMENT PLAN (FLOW CHART-1 AND 2)FLOW CHART 1. Management of Generalized Anxiety DisorderFLOW CHART 2. Management of Panic DisorderThe aim of management is to provide relief in psychological and somatic symptoms and minimize the impairment. This can be addressed in following ways. 1. Pharmacotherapy The drug treatment of GAD is some times required as long as 6-12 month treatment, some evidence indicate that treatment should be long term. 2. Psychotherapy Cognitive behaviour therapy Behavioural techniques Supportive Psychotherapy Insight oriented Psychotherapy Goals Psycho-education Direct explanation of the symptoms and disorder to the patient and the family. Monitoring of anxiety Cognitive restructuring: Corrects the hypothesized cognitive distortions and helps to identify and counter fear of bodily sensations. Efficacy Cognitive Behavioural Therapy has proven efficy other psychotherapies do help in ameliorating symptoms of anxiety. It addresses cognitive distortions and somatic symptoms. More effective with chronically anxious patients, may need 8-10 sessions. It has been shown that yogic techniques produced greater motivation to practice than progressive relaxation Meditation was found to be as effective as pharmacotherapy in controlling symptoms of anxiety. The overall efficacy claims are backed by very few Indian studies, but are useful. It requires considerable time and discipline from the patients. Adverse effects These are relatively benign. Some patients may develop dependence on the therapist and that needs cautious vigil. 3. Combined pharmacological and psychotherapeutic intervention Long-term outcome is better when they are used in combination. ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION 1. Performing a diagnostic evaluation Psychiatric evaluation and physical examination is necessary. It includes history of present illness, current symptoms; past psychiatric history, general medical history and history of substance use, personal history (eg. psychological development, life events and response to those events), social, occupational and family history; review of the patient's medications; physical and mental status examination and adequate diagnostic tool and criteria. Diagnose GAD according to ICD-10 (W.H.0,1992). Anxiety should not be due to the other Axis I disorder (eg. mood disorder, psychotic disorder, social phobia, OCD, somatization disorder, hypochondriasis, PTSD) or a general medical condition (eg. hyperthyroidism) or substance use disorder (intoxication or withdrawal), (see appendix-1 for flow chart). 2. Evaluating particular symptoms Patients experience excessive anxiety but many of them experience panic attacks, which may worsen the clinical picture. The prolonged illness may cause depressive symptoms with emergence of suicidality and substance abuse. 3. Evaluating severity of functional impairment Many may continue to function in their social and occupational lives with some impairment, others may become severely incapacitated and give up their jobs and social duties. The impairment in different areas can be assessed self-administered visual analog scale. FORMULATING TREATMENTS AND CHOICE OF TREATMENT SETTINGS The aim of management is to provide relief in psychological and somatic symptoms and minimize the impairment. This can be addressed in following way. 1. Establishing and maintaining atherapeutic alliance The treatment of GAD may be long lasting hence the alliance is crucial. Understanding the life events, the extent and severity of symptoms requires confiding and lasting therapeutic relationship. Attention to the patient's worries and fears are essential for long term gains 2. Monitoringthe patient's psychiatric status The symptomatic improvement in psychological and autonomic symptoms leads to greater confidence in the treating doctor. The anxiety goes slowly with treatment and bursts of severe symptoms during the treatment need constant monitoring. 3. Pharmacotherapy The drug treatment of GAD is some times is seen as a 6-12 month treatment, some evidence indicate that treatment should be long term. a). Goals Reduce psychological and autonomic symptoms and other co morbid conditions. Improve occupational and social functioning. b). Efficacy Little Indian data to address the issue; mainly western data available. c). Adverse effects Different for different class of drugs. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and pregabalin are recommended as first line drugs due to their favorable risk-benefit ratio, with some differentiation regarding the various anxiety disorders. The common category of pharmacological agents used in management of generialised anxiety disorders include SSRIs, SNRIs, Pregabalin, TCAs, Benzodiazepines, Antihistamines, Atypical antipsychotics, and Antioxidants. Role of vitamin A, C and E has been evaluated and recommended in adequate doses for patients suffering from GAD. Dosing Majority of patients respond to the low dose of antidepressants (with the exception of OCD). In the elderly, treatment should be started with half the recommended dose or less in order to minimize initial adverse drug events. The antidepressant dose should be increased to the highest recommended therapeutic level if the initial treatment with a low or medium dose fails. For patients who do not improve with standard treatments, a number of alternative options should be tried including augmentation with small dose of antipsychotics or adding another anxiolytic agent or addition of non-pharmacological therapy like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or Yoga, Meditation and increased physical activity as described below. 4. Non-pharmacological treatment Non pharmacological treatment found useful in treatment of anxiety disorders include supportive therapy, Exposure therapy (e.g. gradual exposure in vivo, \"flooding\") and response prevention. Psychoeducational advice, and suggesions to not to avoid feared situations are helpful in management. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy: Adequate strength of evidence is available for Individual CBT, Group CBT and Self-directed CBT. Choosing between medications and CBT is determined by a number of factors, particularly the patient's preference, treatment options at hand, adverse drug effects, onset of efficacy, comorbidity (e.g. with depression), financial considerations, time availability, accessibility of psychiatric and psychological treatment resources, and experience of the clinician. Steps of CBT shall include: Psychoeducation Self-monitoring Systemic exposure to panic inducing cues Countering anxious beliefs Exposure to fear cues Modify [mal-adaptive behaviors Relapse prevention Dealing with transference issues Resolving interpersonal and other emotional issues. Initial expectations and anticipation favoring CBT Accept that the worrying is out of control Perhaps, worrying offers some protective value. CBT will facilitate future adversities, despite the worrying. During the course of the treatment, revised understanding: The reasons for worrying and fears cannot be controlled Subjectively learn to control response to the fears and worries Learn to obviate the behaviour of worrying Worrying does not have a protective value Actually, worrying reinforces negative thinking Excesive worrying increases likely hood or more anxieties in the future CBT does not alter the method of managing source of the worries CBT helps to be better equipped to handle the future stress. Indian modules of psychotherapy Several therapists have talked about Search of Indian module of psychotherapy and it is a felt need to have such a module, which is socially and culturally relevant. Ancient Indian thought has provided very rich knowledge regarding mind and its functioning. From the Vedic period issues relating to mind, consciousness, understanding of human life, its existence and the concept of Atman have been widely studied and several explanations to improve the quality of human life are available in Vedic and Post Vedic literature. The Bhagvad Gita contains in condensed form all the philosophical and psycholoical wisdom of the Upanishads. Bhagwad Gita describes all aspects of yoga, psychology and is unique among the psychlogical and philosophical teachings for a student of psychotherapy, various aspects of psychotherapeutic techniques are described in it. In this excellent module of Psychotherapy through 18 chapters way of self knowledge, the Yoga of action (karma) knowledge of renunciation and action, the path of meditation, knowledge of the absolute and eternal, yogic vision, yoga of devotion, profound knowledge of three Gunas and the wisdom of renunciation and liberation have been described at length, which leads to personality transformation of Arjuna. In the modern psychotherapy, cognitive restructuring is the goal of psychotherapy, which has been accomplished a great deal through Bhagwad Gita. Prekshadhayan A Jain Meditational technique propounded by Acharya Mahapragya, which includes relaxation, meditation, yoga, asanas and pranayam, a comprehensive capsule of behavioural management has been tried in management of GAD. On mental level, it proves to be an applied method to train the mind to concentrate. It offers a way to treat serious anxiety disorders with or without drugs. Large trials of this technique are still awaited. At present, few scientific studies are available. 5. Providing Education To The Patient And Family This seemingly unimportant aspect is most relevant to Indian settings where awareness of psychiatric illness and its realization and need for treatment with compliance is little. Many feel dejected, angry, isolated and may have suicidal ideas. Family and the patient need to be told that this is like any other illness that needs treatment and success depends on compliance. 6. Addressing early signs of relapse The education that the illness is a chronic relapsing illness is essential and emergence of anxiety with or without treatment should be promptly treated. Sudden discontinuation may lead to emergence of withdrawal symptoms thus early recognition by the patient and the family helps in prompt treatment. MANAGEMENT AS PER THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE ILLNESS The treatment recommendations for the different anxiety disorders are summarized in Table I. Some antianxiety drugs are effective in all anxiety disorders, whereas some drugs have only been studied in specific anxiety disorders and thus should be reserved for use in these particular disorders. Panic disorder and agoraphobia. In acute panic attacks, mouth desolving short-acting benzodiazepines and reassurance to the patient may be sufficient. SSRIs SNRIs are first-line treatments for longterm management. Patients should be treated for atleast six to eight months or longer to prevent relapses. A combination of CBT and anxiolytic medication has been shown to have the best treatment outcomes. In GAD and Social anxiety disorder (SAD): Choice of Drugs for Management are SSRIs, SNRIs and pregabalin. Buspirone and hydroxyzine are second line treatment. Benzodiazepines should only be used for long-term treatment when other drugs or CBT have not shown results. Specific phobia: Specific phobia should be treated with behaviour therapy including systematic desensatisation. SSRIs or short acting benzodiazepines should be tried in cases not responding to behaviour therapy. OCD: Choice of treatments is the SSRIs and the TCA clomipramine. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and exposure and response prevention are other proven techniques of management. PTSD: Choice of treatments includes the SSRIs and venlafaxine. Therapeutic conversation, psychoeducation and regrief therapy are non-pharmacological treatment techniques advocated. TREATMENT UNDER SPECIAL CONDITIONS (FLOW CHART-3)FLOW CHART 3. Management of Anxiety Disorders in Special PopulationPregnancy. The use of SSRIs and TCAs in pregnancy does not have increased risk for malformations. It is recommended to avoid paroxetine alprazolam use among pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant. Breast-feeding. SSRIs and TCAs are excreted into breast milk, they do not cause any harm to the new born because the concentration in breast milk is very small however infants of mothers on benzodiazepines, should be observed for signs of sedation, lethargy, poor suckling, and weight loss, and if high doses have to be used and long-term administration is required, breast feeding should probably be discontinued. Treating children and adolescents. Choice of treatment should be SSRIs concerns about increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior have ben reported therefore careful monitoring is advisable, presence of comorbid depression should be looked fore. Treating the elderly. Elderly have increased sensitivity for anticholinergic properties, an increased risk for orthostatic hypotension, and ECG changes during treatment with TCAs, and possible paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines, which include depression, with or without suicidal tendencies, phobias, aggressiveness, or violent behavior. Thus, treatment with TCAs or benzodiazepines is less favorable, while SSRIs appear to be safe. Treatment of patients with severe Physical disease. Patients with cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and endocrine disease, irritable bowel syndrome, malignency, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) hyperthyroidism may have associated anxiety reactions with their somatic disease state. Such anxiety disorders may compound the management and the prognosis of these primary conditions. Advocated pharmacological agents in such conditions include SSRIs and Venlafaxine. WHEN TO STOP TREATMENT Decesion to stop treatment will depend on clinical response of the patients. Usualy the treatment is stopped in a tapering manner after atleast 6 months stability of clinical improvement and asymptomatic status of the patient. Before stopping the treatment, the nature of illness possibilities of recurrence, response to triggers and his/her ability to cope with the situation should be discussed at length. Patient's personal view should be included in decesion making of stopping the treatment. Patient should be encouraged to adapt alternative methods of anxiety reduction like yoga, pranayam, relaxation techniques including progressive muscular relaxation (PMR)/Shavasan etc. which can be mastered by him before weaning off the smallest dose of antianxiety medication. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Behavior Therapy (MBCBT) for reducing cognitive and somatic anxiety and modifying dysfunctional cognitions in patients with anxiety disorders has been tried where in different versions of mindfulness meditation, cognitive restructuring, and strategies to handle worry, such as, worry postponement, worry exposure, and problem solving have been employed. However, these studies are on small number of patients and need carefull review for further application. MANAGEMENT OF SIDE EFFECTS OF MEDICATION Diffrent side effects will emerge with different category of antianxiety medication. They should be carefully observed and addressed to. Side effects of medication can be drug related or dose related. If it is drug, related, alternative class of drug should be tried for adequate length of time. If it is dose related then the dose of the drug has to be reduced. Things to remember for GAD: Anticholinergic and cardiovascular side effects to be kept in mind when using tricyclic and Tetra cyclic for side effects. Precaution in suicidal patients. Long-term treatment may be required. Psychopharmacological therapy combined with psychotherapy works better.",

      "abstract": "Several clinical studies have reported (Starkstein et al. 1990; Castillo et al. 1993; Astrom 1996), findings which must be explained by any hypothesis about the mechanism of poststroke anxiety. The major clinical finding is the frequent co-occurrence of anxiety disorder with depression. Approximately half of the patients with poststroke anxiety disorder were found to have major depression and about one-third minor depression. The second clinical finding is that the clinical and pathological correlates of anxiety disorder and depressive disorder are different. For example, the duration of anxiety disorder and depression are different. Anxiety but not depression is associated with prior alcohol abuse, acute onset anxiety but not acute onset depression is associated with right hemisphere lesion location, and anxiety and depression have independent or sometimes additive effects on recovery of activities of daily living (ADL), cognitive functioning, and social functioning.",

Orgasmic and ejaculation difficulties are prominent with these medications, although alterations in libido, arousal, and erectile function are also common.

      "title": "A practical approach to benzodiazepine discontinuation",
      "abstract": "Non-medical use of benzodiazepines is rare among patients with anxiety disorders. Numerous studies have found that non-medical use, or abuse, of benzodiazepines occurs usually among patients with histories of alcohol and drug abuse--those who use those drugs to get \"high\". This article distinguishes between medical and non-medical use of benzodiazepines in clinical practice, and offers practical approaches to discontinuation of benzodiazepine treatment for both medical and non-medical users of those medicines. The major barrier to clear thinking about the abuse of benzodiazepines is the confusion of \"addiction\" and \"withdrawal\". Addiction means high, unstable dosing outside medical and social boundaries for \"recreational\" purposes, loss of control over use, and continued use despite clear evidence of harm. Alcoholism and heroin addiction are typical examples of addiction (Kalant, 1989). In contrast, withdrawal is a pharmacological consequence of discontinuation of a substance on which a person has become dependent. Many drug-addicted people have only minor withdrawal symptoms when they stop drug use. Many medical patients, with no evidence of addiction, have withdrawal symptoms when they stop treatment, especially when they stop abruptly (e.g. surgical patients using narcotic analgesics and epileptics using benzodiazepines or barbiturates in their treatment). Addiction to benzodiazepines, in the sense of loss of control over use and continued despite harm, is virtually limited to people with pre-existing drug or alcohol abuse, while withdrawal symptoms after prolonged daily use are common among medical users of benzodiazepines. The serious nature of both drug abuse and anxiety disorders is not emphasized sufficiently during medical school or in the professional literature. The distress and disability from which both groups of patients and their families suffer is profound. Fortunately, both drug abuse and anxiety patients receive tremendous benefit from successful treatments, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological (DuPont, 1986a; DuPont, 1984). This article discusses the use of benzodiazepines in two distinct populations--drug abusers and patients with anxiety disorders--and helps clinicians distinguish between the use of benzodiazepines in the two groups. The central distinction made in this article is reflected in the common use of the words \"drugs\" and \"medicines\". The former term often denotes non-medical substance use, while the latter term refers to traditional pharmacotherapy.",

      "title": "Persistent Psychosis After a Single Ingestion of “Ecstasy” (MDMA)",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: The street drug “ecstasy” (3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA; also “X” or “E”]) is a synthetic amphetamine that has both stimulant and hallucinogenic properties.1 It is increasingly used as a recreational drug and has a strong association with the “rave” culture. Subjective effects of MDMA include elevated mood, increased self-confidence and sensory sensitivity, and a peaceful feeling coupled with insight, empathy, and closeness to persons.2 It has gained a deceptive reputation as a “safe” drug among its users. MDMA use has been associated with various medical complications such as renal and liver failure, rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hepatitis, cerebral infarction, seizures, delirium, fulminant hyperthermia, intracranial bleed, cerebral edema, and coma.3–6 Adverse psychiatric symptomatology associated with MDMA includes panic attack, depression, suicidal ideation, flashbacks, rage reactions, psychosis, and severe paranoia.3 Persistent psychosis after even a single use has been reported.1,4,7 This case report describes persistent psychosis in a previously healthy adolescent girl after a single ingestion of MDMA\r\n\r\nCase report. In October 2010, Ms A, a 17-year-old African American girl without previous psychiatric or medical history, obtained MDMA from her friend and ingested the pill. She began experiencing auditory hallucinations and displaying disorganized speech and behavior shortly thereafter. She was taken to the University of South Alabama, Mobile, emergency department for evaluation and treatment of her behavior. In the emergency department, the consultation-liaison psychiatrist noticed that the patient was awake and alert, but could not engage in meaningful communication. Results of routine laboratory testing showed no alcohol or illicit drugs present. Physical examination findings were unremarkable. She was seen by the neurology service, where physicians believed that the patient had no obvious etiology for her current symptomatology. There was no family history of mood disorders or psychosis among first- or second-degree relatives. The patient was cleared medically in the emergency department and was then transferred to an acute care inpatient psychiatric unit affiliated with the University of South Alabama.\r\n\r\nIn the psychiatric unit, she continued to demonstrate odd, bizarre behavior. She exhibited frequent episodes of crying and using profanity. She displayed sexually inappropriate behavior, eg, touching others sexually, dancing seductively, and assuming unusual postures by putting her hands underneath her pelvis while pushing the pelvis upwards. In addition, she attempted to eat food from another person's plate and multiple trash cans. Her speech was mostly nonsensical, and at times she claimed that she was pregnant and had an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) infection. She appeared to be responding strongly to internal stimuli. She gave the appearance of being paranoid, feeling scared, and being socially withdrawn.\r\n\r\nAfter a literature review, we decided to institute olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets 10 mg every 12 hours. Haloperidol 5 mg and lorazepam 1 mg were also employed on an as-needed basis and were administered frequently over several days. After 14 days of this medication regimen, normal behavior was noticed, but there were intervals during which she became agitated and confused. After that point, her family had decided to take her home against medical advice. She was sent to school for a day by family to resume a normal life (she is an honor roll student and had been accepted to college on a scholarship). According to the family, the school personnel advised her to go back home immediately because “she is not normal.” She was promptly rehospitalized in our care due to frequent agitation, confusion, leaving the house at night, and walking in traffic.\r\n\r\nIn the unit, her assessment demonstrated her to be staring off blankly into space and making repetitive hand, eye, and head movements while screaming. She was placed on 1:1 observation due to her unpredictable behavior. Olanzapine was increased to 15 mg every 12 hours. Gradually, her behavior improved, such that she was no longer displaying stereotypic behavior. She was capable of having meaningful conversations. Furthermore, her reality testing improved. Upon discharge, she showed improvement of symptoms and organized thoughts. However, she continued to describe dysphoric mood. She recounted use of MDMA in October. Instantaneously she noticed she was not herself nor did she recall what happened immediately after taking MDMA.\r\n\r\nMDMA-induced psychotic disorder can be distinguished from schizophrenia by several characteristics associated with the former, including complete lack of prodromal symptoms (social withdrawal, anxiety, or lack of motivation), absence of sustained mood disturbance, and good premorbid functioning.1 The cause of MDMA-induced psychotic symptoms is not well understood.1 Evidence from animal and human studies suggests that MDMA reduces levels of brain serotonergic activity and depletes serotonin stores.8 MDMA acts by binding to presynaptic monoamine transporters, most strongly to the serotonin receptor transporter, causing rapid release and subsequent depletion of serotonin and dopamine from presynaptic terminals.6,9–11 Further damage is caused by the generation of free radicals that are taken by the serotonin nerve terminal, exhausting the antioxidant capacity of brain tissues.12 In laboratory animals, MDMA causes persistent damage to serotonergic neurons.6,9,12 It is thought that it causes similar damage to neurons in the human brain. MDMA does not have a potent direct agonist effect on dopamine receptors.1,2 MDMA may induce psychosis through dopaminergic or serotonergic pathways.13 Our patient did not have medical complications, as compared to a published case report.14 In our case, there was no laboratory toxicology evidence of MDMA exposure; however, routine toxicology screens do not screen for MDMA. Furthermore, presumptive diagnosis of MDMA use is often made without toxicologic evidence. In our patient, we were able to support MDMA use through patient interview and collateral from friends and family. The use of high-dose antipsychotic medication (haloperidol and olanzapine) and anticonvulsants (diazepam and carbamazepine) has been documented for the treatment of psychosis after MDMA use.1,5,6,15\r\n\r\nThe widespread use of MDMA and the potential adverse effects associated with it underlines the need for clinicians to inquire carefully about MDMA use and to include MDMA in toxicology screenings. MDMA use as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with paranoid psychosis, affective disorders, or anxiety has become increasingly important. When MDMA exposure is suspected, there should be close collaboration between the psychiatrist and medical personnel, since MDMA use is associated with serious medical complications. Whether these complications are due to MDMA use directly or caused by unrelated adulterants added during manufacturing is an area of ongoing research. Further studies are required to clarify the etiology of persistent psychosis after MDMA use and to describe the treatment options.",

      "title": "Managing the side effects associated with commonly used treatments for bipolar depression",
      "abstract": "The most commonly used pharmacologic therapies for bipolar depression are mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics, and antidepressants. This paper reviews common side effects associated with these medications and provides recommendations for managing adverse medication effects in clinical practice. Narrative review based on literature searches of Medline and evidence-based treatment guidelines for agents that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and/or are commonly used to treat bipolar depression. Side effects of bipolar depression pharmacotherapies are common and vary by medication, with weight gain, metabolic dysregulation, sedation/somnolence, and akathisia among those observed most frequently. These adverse events (weight gain and sedation/somnolence, in particular) negatively affect treatment adherence in patients with bipolar disorder. Furthermore, endocrine and metabolic comorbidities, weight gain, and obesity may reduce the likelihood of positive clinical responses to pharmacologic therapies. Clinicians may consider switching patients to bipolar depression medication(s) with a lower propensity for sedation or adverse metabolic effects. Lifestyle modification (e.g., dietary changes, exercise) is an important component in the treatment of weight gain/obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and hyperglycemia; in addition, a wide range of medications are available as therapeutic options for patients in whom non-pharmacologic management strategies are insufficient. The use of adjunctive medication may also reduce treatment-related sedation and somnolence. The selection of relevant studies from the literature search relied primarily on the author's expertise in the area of bipolar depression and knowledge of the issues addressed. Successful treatment of bipolar depression extends beyond managing mood symptoms to also monitoring adverse medication events and managing associated medical disorders.",

Under-reporting of depressed mood and other psychological symptoms is common by older adults and contributes to under-diagnosis of depression.

However, each of these treatments helps less than half of depressed older adults, necessitating a treatment strategy in which failure or intolerance of each treatment step informs the next.

      "title": "Erythromycin-Induced Psychotic Decompensation in a Patient Affected by Paranoid Schizophrenic Psychosis",
      "abstract": "The aim of this report is to present a case of acute psychotic decompensation in a patient suffering from paranoid schizophrenic psychosis with residual symptoms, treated with erythromycin for acute bronchitis.A 64-year-old patient had been suffering from paranoid schizophrenic psychosis, in remission with pharmacotherapy for the last eight months and compliant. Upon the occurrence of acute bronchitis, the patient received erythromycin. Seventy-two hours after the introduction of erythromycin, the patient suffered psychotic decompensation (auditory hallucinations, bizarre unsystematic delusional ideas, megalomaniac, pseudo-religious psychomotor agitation). The introduced antibiotic was identified as a possible cause of the described clinical picture and immediately stopped upon the occurrence of the symptoms described. Psychotic decompensation ceased within 48 hours upon discontinuation of erythromycin.It is very important to know interactions and side effects of antibiotics and other drugs. Side effects of this group of antibiotics (macrolides) can manifest in the form of psychotic clinical symptoms. Applied in patients with a mental illness, they can cause signs and symptoms similar to those of the deterioration of the mental illness, hence caution is required when using macrolide antibiotics in patients with a psychiatric or neurological disease and after an injury or infection of the brain.",

      "title": "Where do we go in occupational neuroepidemiology?",
      "abstract": "Early knowledge about the neurotoxic effects of occupational exposures appeared through clinical observations. The observed effects were more or less acute and concerned exposure to metals such as lead and mercury or solvents like carbon disulfide and trichloroethylene. With time, however, also more chronic and clinically less obvious effects of neurotoxic agents have been assessed through modern examination methods and systematic studies of larger groups. Still, the interpretation of the findings has been controversial and debated, such as the chronic effects of solvent exposure (1). The difficulties met in interpreting chronic neurotoxic effects depend on both the diversity and vagueness of symptoms and signs and the associated problem of defining a proper disease entity for conclusive epidemiologic studies. For example, in solvent exposure, the chronic effects might include memory and concentration problems, tiredness, lack of initiative, affect lability, irritability, and sometimes dizziness, headache, alcohol intolerance, and reduced libido. Neurophysiological methods have also revealed various functional disturbances, again difficult to condense into any single disease entity. Similarly, a variety of neurobehavioral effects also seems to occur due to other occupational exposures, such as moderate lead exposure or welding with some exposure to aluminum, lead, and manganese or exposure to pesticides. Again there are also neurophysiological or neurological signs, among others, polyneuropathy, tremor, and disturbance of equilibrium, in individuals exposed to organochlorine, organophosphorus and other insecticides. In view of the epidemiologic problems involved in defining a disease entity out of the many types of neurobehavioral effects referred to, it has also become natural to consider some clinically, more or less well-defined neuropsychiatric disorders in relation to occupational exposures. Since the 1970s, several studies have especially focused on solvent exposure and the psychoorganic syndrome, when of disabling severity. More recently also Alzheimer's dementia, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and related conditions have attracted interest in occupational epidemiology. Regarding solvent exposure and the psychoorganic syndrome (or toxic chronic encephalopathy in clinical occupational medicine, when exposure is taken into diagnostic account), the problem of defining a proper disease entity was apparent and it first led to considering en bloc the diagnoses of encephalopathia, dementia, and cerebral atrophy, but also neurosis, neurasthenia, and nervositas were included as not necessarily distinct from each other in medical practice (2). Recently, more specific disease entities, such as organic dementia and cerebral atrophy, have also been associated with solvent exposure (3). The findings have not been totally consistent, however, as no excess of \"presenile dementia\" appeared in a large-scale case-referent study in the United States with as many as 3565 cases of various neuropsychiatric disorders and 83 245 hospital referents (4). However, in comparison with bricklayers, there was about a 45% excess of disabling neuropsychiatric disorders among white male painters, except spray painters. Occupational exposures also seem to play a role for disorders more specific than the psychoorganic syndrome. Hence, in 1982, an association between multiple sclerosis and solvent exposure from glues was first indicated in the Italian shoe industry (5). This relationship has been considerably strengthened by further studies in Scandinavia (6--8) and elsewhere, so that 13 studies with some information on solvent exposure could be considered in a review (9). Ten of these studies provided enough data for inclusion in a meta-analysis, showing about a twofold risk for multiple sclerosis among individuals with solvent exposure. Some studies also associate multiple sclerosis with radiological work, welding, and work with phenoxy herbicides (6--7). Parkinson's disease seems to be more common in rural areas (10), especially at younger ages (11). More interestingly, a study from Calgary, Canada, showed a threefold risk for herbicide exposure (12). All the case persons who recalled specific exposures reported exposure to phenoxy herbicides or thiocarbamates. One of them recalled exposure to paraquat, which is chemically similar to MPTP (N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), an inducer of a Parkinson-like syndrome. Paraquat workers have not yet been found to suffer from such a syndrome, however (13). Case-referent studies from Canada, China, Spain, and Sweden have indicated a relation with exposure to unspecified industrial chemicals, pesticides, and metals, especially manganese, iron and aluminum (14). In a study from the United States, an increased risk of motor neuron disease (encompassing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive bulbar palsy and progressive muscular atrophy) appeared in connection with welding and soldering (15). Welding also appeared as a risk factor, as did electricity work, and also work with impregnating agents in a Swedish study (16). Hereditability for neurodegenerative and thyroid disease, combined with solvent exposure and male gender, showed a risk as high as 15.6. Other studies also indicate that exposure to lead and solvents could be of importance (17--20). For Alzheimer's disease, no clear indication of any occupational risk appeared in a meta-analysis of 11 case-referent studies (21), but more recently an increased risk was connected with blue-collar work (22). Another new study, which included also the oldest ages, indicated that solvent exposure could be a rather strong risk factor (33). The recent suggestion that Alzheimer's disease might be related to exposure to electromagnetic fields was perhaps even more surprising (44). Both these studies are likely to stimulate interest in several new investigations along the indicated lines. Hence, in view of the current perspectives in occupational neuroepidemiology, as briefly outlined, there seems to be a reason for conducting additional work-related studies of different, hitherto more or less neglected, neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. It is not unlikely that there are some contributing effects from various occupational exposures, in the same manner as we have seen for many cancer types. In addition, as in etiologic cancer research, new clues suggesting ultimate causes or triggering mechanisms behind some of the serious neurological disorders may be obtained from occupational epidemiology.",

      "abstract": "Patients frequently use medications simultaneously for different complaints, without being aware of the interactions these products may have. An example of this is the simultaneous use of corticosteroids and medications for depression, defiant or aggressive behaviour. Research has also indicated that corticosteroids lower serotonin levels. However, lowered serotonin levels may result in depression, aggression and other psychological conditions. These secondary complaints, caused by the corticosteroids and other products that lower serotonin levels, may then be treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or psycho-stimulants (that are known to indirectly increase serotonin levels). The current research takes a look at lowered serotonin levels when using corticosteroids, as well as the interactions with SSRIs and psycho-stimulants. Furthermore, evidence is presented to prove the hypothesis that some individuals with asthma (e.g. children using systemic corticosteroids that lower serotonin levels) might present with symptoms of depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder and even conduct disorder; and that treating these secondary complaints with SSRIs and psycho-stimulants will result in the upregulating of serotonin levels, and that, in turn, will trigger asthma.",

Less commonly, autonomic hyperactivity also involves the parasympathetic system and manifests primarily with bradyarrhythmia or even syncope. Common causes of autonomic hyperactivity are head trauma, hypoxic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, autonomic dysreflexia in spinal cord injury, Guillain-Barré syndrome,and iatrogenic disorders such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome.Autonomic hyperactivity in the setting of cognitive, psychiatric or sleep disturbances suggests alcohol (or other depressant drug) withdrawal, fatal insomnia, or limbic encephalitis. Patients with autonomic hyperactivity should be managed in an intensive care unit as they require continuous monitoring of cardiac rhythm, blood pressure, respiration, and fluid balance.",

      "abstract": "Stress and anxiety are necessary in life to a small extent and sometimes improve people’s performance, but sometimes and in situations such as today, when the disease is prevalent all over the world, this stress is higher than usual and it causes man problems that must be controlled. When this stress, worry, fear, and anxiety intensifies and persists, it becomes abnormal and morbid and causes a variety of reactions, including physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral reactions. Physical reactions to stress include increased heart rate, sweating, dry mouth, tremors, dizziness, shortness of breath, headache and muscle aches, irritability, fatigue, upset stomach, frequent urination, decreased energy, tiredness, sleep problems, It is a change in appetite and so on.1,2 The cognitive component includes thoughts and beliefs about the person being injured or losing control of the situation. Thus, stress leads to a decrease in the ability to think, a decrease in the ability to pay attention and focus, problems related to memory and recall, magnification and catastrophizing problems, and so on. Emotional reactions include fear, worry, sadness, loss of interest in normal pleasurable activities, feelings of frustration, irritability, anger, feelings of helplessness, and so on. Behavioral reactions include avoid\u0002ing certain situations, asking frequently asked questions about how things are going, constantly looking for common sense, blaming others, spreading rumors, dependence on alcohol and drugs, and so on.2,3 In the current situation, the corona virus is a concern and needs attention and care, especially when we feel threatened and do not have the necessary ability to deal with it, it is natural to experience anxiety, worry, anxiety and fear. There are several reasons for this stress, including the speed with which the disease spreads from epidemic to pandemic; Unawareness and complete lack of knowledge of this virus in terms of its signs and symptoms; Methods of transmission, methods of prevention and primary care, duration of the disease, methods of treatment and its consequences, the existence of contradictory information, infodemias or statistics and unreliable information and its magnification through social networks, etc. have caused stress, Fear and worry about this disease becomes much more than the disease itself.3-5",

      "abstract": "Abstract Fatigue is a symptom whose causes are protean and whose phenotype includes physical, mood, and behavioral components. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an illness that has strong biological underpinnings and no definite etiology. Diagnostic criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have helped classify CFS as an overlap of mood, behavioral, and biological components. These include the presence of fatigue for more than 6 months associated with a diminution of functional activity and somatic symptoms, and pain not attributable to a specific diagnosis or disease. Four of the following criteria need to be present: sore throat, impaired memory or cognition, unrefreshing sleep, postexertional fatigue, tender glands, aching stiff muscles, joint pain, and headaches. Many researchers have observed that CFS shares features in common with other somatic syndromes, including irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, and temporomandibular joint dysfunction. Correlations between inflammation and infection, augmented sensory processing, abnormalities of neurotransmitters, nerve growth factors, low levels of serotonin and norepinephrine, abnormalities of homeostasis of the stress system, and autonomic dysfunction may be hallmarks of CFS. The relative contributions of each of these abnormalities to the profound fatigue associated with CFS need to be explored further to better evaluate and treat the syndrome.",

      "title": "Anxiety and increased aggression as pacemakers of depression",
      "abstract": "The concept of a serotonin (5-HT)-related, anxiety and/or aggression-driven, stressor-precipitated depression is formulated and discussed. The serotonergic disturbances found in some depressed individuals, particularly those with lowered CSF 5-HIAA, are linked to the anxiety and aggression components of the depressive syndrome. In this type of depression, called 5-HT-related depression, dysregulation of anxiety and/or aggression is hypothesized to be primordial and mood-lowering is a derivative phenomenon. In other words, this is a group of anxiety/aggression-driven depressions. The author submits that the serotonergic impairment in certain types of depression is a trait phenomenon, i.e. it persists during remission. This disturbance makes the individual susceptible to perturbation of anxiety and aggression regulation. Anxiety and (overt or suppressed) anger are core constituents of the stress syndrome. Thus the serotonergic disturbance will induce a heightend sensitivity to stressful events, i.e. the latter will induce stress phenomena, including anxiety and anger, more readily than normal. The latter psychological features induce lowering of mood, and thus 'drive' the patient into a full-blown depression. Furthermore, it is predicted that anxiolytics and serenics (i.e. anti-aggressive drugs) that act via normalization of serotonergic circuits will exert an antidepressant effect in 5-HT related depression, in addition to their therapeutic actions in anxiety disorders and states of increased aggressiveness, respectively. The exact nature of the serotonergic impairment in 5-HT-related depression has yet to be elucidated.",

Consequences of CFS found include social isolation and stigmatization, physical inactivity, psychological disturb ances and a reduced quality of life. Plausible mechanism for the development of CFS is based on loss of immunological tolerance to the vasoactive neuropeptides following infection, significant physical exercise or de novo. Considerable evidence points towards a prominent role for central nervous system (CNS) mechanisms in the pathogenesis of CFS. Patients with CFS are described as perfectionist, conscientious, hardworking, somewhat neurotic and introverted individuals with high personal standards, a great desire to be socially accepted and with a history of continuously pushing themselves past their limits. Fewer than 20% of persons with CFS have been diagnosed and treated.

Patients have alternate increased mood and activities (mania, hypomania, or “ups” period) and declining mood and activities (depressive or “downs” period) in their life. Symptoms of the manic episodes of bipolar disorder include sensitive feelings, lack of rest, and shot up self-esteem, while the depressive episodes bring loss of interest, more or less sleep than usual, anxiety, a feeling of worthlessness, and lack of concentration. Bipolar disorder is a severe mental disorder with a fairly high prevalence of 1%- 2% and is the 5th cause of disability in the world. Many factors have been considered to contribute to this disorder. While there is strong evidence that some genetic and environmental factors are associated with bipolar disorder, only a few can provide sufficient evidence to establish causality. This report discusses the case of a new manic episode of bipolar disorder that occurs in a woman aged 25 years old who works as a public figure, announcer, and entertainer. The patient has been hospitalized several times and received various pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy but still having difficulties in managing the ups and downs of her emotion.

      "title": "New Clinical Implications of Opiate Maintenance Treatments",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor\r\n\r\nOpiate addiction is a chronic mental illness with severe repercussion in personal and public health. Various medicaments have been subjected to research in order to find a proper treatment, methadone is the most and wide used drug, buprenorphine/naloxone is the most recent ones, but other choices have been proposed such as prescribing heroin (1). The mentioned treatments, are considered as maintenance ones, because, the chronic illnesses need a longtime approach. Other possibilities have been studied, for example the detoxification (conventional or ultra-rapid) as well as the use of opiate antagonist as naltrexone. On the other hand, a long period of dis habituation or relapse prevention is required after detoxification of all sorts of addictions, including opiate dependency.\r\n\r\nOn this second phase, psychological therapies are very important, as well as social and family support. Most patients need during dis habituation (of heroin addiction) a preliminary period of opiate maintenance with methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone (2).\r\n\r\nSide effects, as well as notwell-known effects, of drug and treatments are a very interesting goal of research. The hypogonadotrophic effect of opioids can be observed even after the administration of a single opioid dose, both in laboratory animals and in humans (3). Other studies have reported that methadone and buprenorphine are opioids with effects on spermatogenesis (4) and secondary sex organs. It seems probable that these drugs could affect testes volume.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, those effects have quantitative differences depending on the opiate as showed in the paper titled “A quantitative and qualitative study of rat testis following administration of methadone and buprenorphine” (5).\r\n\r\nHeidari et al. observed Buprenorphine treatment is more appropriate for treating opiate addiction in male rats since it does not affect normal testicular structure and function (5). Those results should be considered by all the professionals involved in addictions and their co-morbidities (dual pathology) research projects and treatment, not only because of the consequences of this side effect on sexuality or reproduction, but also how the testosterone deficiency is related to the not well-known effects of opioid maintenance treatments, as its antipsychotic properties or its influence on personality dimensions as reward dependence on opiate dependents type II or antisocial (6).",

      "title": "Li+ in Bipolar Disorder – Possible Mechanisms of Its Pharmacological Mode of Action",
      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder is a severe psychiatric illness characterized by cyclic episodes of mania and depression that affects approximately 1 % of the world population, and has a great economic and social impact. Lithium (Li+), in the form of lithium salts, has been used for more than five decades and is still the drug of choice in the treatment of this pathology. The anticonvulsants carbamazepine and valproate, originally used to treat epileptic seizures, are alternative or adjunctive therapies to lithium, representing the first-line therapy for lithium-resistant or lithium intolerant patients. Bipolar disorder is associated with structural, functional and physiological alterations in the brain of bipolar patients, which reflect chemical, neurochemical and metabolic changes, specifically at the levels of brain metabolites and neurotransmitters, as already detected by different techniques (Silverstone et al., 2005). Abnormalities in signal transduction pathways, in particular G proteins, adenylate cyclase (AC) and phosphatidylinositol (PI) signalling cascade, as well as protein kinase C (PKC) were related with the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (Berns & Nemeroff, 2003, Brunello & Tascedda, 2003; Manji et al., 2001; Manji & Lenox, 2000a, 2000b).",

      "title": "BEHAVIORAL STUDIES OF SLEEP PATTERNS IN ALCOHOLICS DURING INTOXICATION AND WITHDRAWAL",
      "abstract": "Twenty-four-hour sleep patterns of 50 male alcohol addicts were assessed behaviorally during a 5-day base-line period, a 7- to 62-day period of spontaneous drinking and a subsequent alcohol withdrawal phase. Alcohol ingestion produced an increase in total hours of sleep which was associated with two distinctive changes in sleep patterns:1) fragmentation , a tendency to sleep in several short episodes (3-4 hours) instead of a sustained night9s sleep; and 2) somnolence , the distribution of consecutive hours of sleep was shifted beyond the base-line mode and long sleep episodes were combined with occasional naps. Fragmentation of sleep patterns was the most reliable correlate of alcohol ingestion and a frequent accompaniment of alcohol withdrawal. However, there were no common sleep distribution patterns during alcohol withdrawal either as a function of symptom severity or type of medication used. Contrary to the prevailing clinical impression, abrupt cessation of drinking did not invariably produce an initial insomnia. Moreover, hallucinosis occurred as a concomitant of the alcohol abstinence syndrome and independent of an antecedent or concurrent state of insomnia. These data are discussed in the context of current models of physical dependence.",

      "title": "Fatigue in Healthy and Diseased Individuals",
      "abstract": "Objectives: Although fatigue is experienced by everyone, its definition and classification remains under debate. Methods: A review of the previously published data on fatigue. Results: Fatigue is influenced by age, gender, physical condition, type of food, latency to last meal, mental status, psychological conditions, personality type, life experience, and the health status of an individual. Fatigue may not only be a symptom but also a measurable and quantifiable dimension, also known as fatigability. Additionally, it may be classified as a condition occurring at rest or under exercise or stress, as physiologic reaction or pathologic condition, as spontaneous phenomenon or triggerable state, as resistant or irresistant to preconditioning, training, or attitude, as prominent or collateral experience, and as accessible or inaccessible to any type of treatment or intervention. Fatigue may be the sole symptom of a disease or one among others. It may be also classified as acute or chronic. Quantification of fatigability is achievable by fatigue scores, force measurement, electromyography, or other means. Fatigue and fatigability need to be delineated from conditions such as sleepiness, apathy, exhaustion, exercise intolerance, lack of vigor, weakness, inertia, or tiredness. Among neurological disorders, the prevalence of fatigue is particularly increased in multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson disease, traumatic brain injury, stroke, and bleeding and also in neuromuscular disorders. Fatigue may be influenced by training, mental preconditioning, or drugs. Conclusions: Fatigue needs to be recognized as an important condition that is not only a symptom but may also be quantified and can be modified by various measures depending on the underlying cause.",

As the incident builds, the person experiences racing thoughts, tremendous agitation, delusions, hallucinations, and fear. Well-developed mania is a psychotic syndrome associated with hallucinations and depression. Antimanic drugs (mood stabilizers) stabilize mood by managing symptoms of mania such as irregular psychological state of excitement. Mood stabilizers are the drugs commonly employed to reversing the mood disorders such as intense and sustained mood shifts, typically bipolar disorder type I or type II or schizophrenia. Mood-stabilizing agents are useful for suppression of symptoms of bipolar disorders such as mania and depression, average individual character disturbances, and affective syndromes such as schizophrenia. There are several diverse kinds of antimanic drugs ranging from anticonvulsants to lithium. The most effective antimanic medications, which are recommended for the treatment of bipolar disorder includes simple salts, lithium chloride, or lithium carbonate. This chapter mainly deals with the pharmacological based mechanistic approach for the treatment of manic disorders.",

It refers to the consequence of the failure of an organism human or animal to respond appropriately to emotional or physical threats, whether actual or imagined.Signs of stress may be cognitive, emotional, physical or behavioral. Signs include poor judgment, a general negative outlook, excessive worrying, moodiness, irritability, agitation, inability to relax, feeling lonely, isolated or depressed, aches and pains, diarrhea or constipation, nausea, dizziness, chest pain, rapid heartbeat, eating too much or not enough, sleeping too much or not enough, social withdrawal, procrastination or neglect of responsibilities, increased alcohal, nicotine or drug consumption, and nervous habits such as pacing about, nail-biting and neck pains.Occupational stress stress involving work. According to the current World Health Organization's (WHO) definition, occupational or work-related stress is the response people may have when presented with work demands and pressures that are not matched to their knowledge and abilities and which challenge their ability to cope.Job satisfactionThe job satisfaction the end feeling of a person after performing a task. To the extent that a person's job fulfill his expectations and values, the job will be satisfying. The feeling will be positive or negative depending upon whether need satisfied or not.The job satisfaction of professional women as important as the organizational climate of any organization. Organization climate a leading indicator of organizational performance. Organizational climate may be thought of as the summary perception, which people have about an organization. It a global expression of what an organization is. Organization climate manifestation of attitudes of organizational members towards the organizational itself. Motivation and behaviour of organizational members are significantly influenced by organizational climate.

      "abstract": "Introduction Most pleasures have been condemned at some time and many laws have attempted to prohibit supposedly harmful behavior. Evolution has not collaborated perhaps because addictive behaviors, associated with reward and pleasure circuits/centers in the brain, are important for survival. Withdrawal symptoms are treatable with nicotine replacement therapy. Pleasure, is a harder problem to tackle and is associated with rituals, the senses and affect regulation and may be a major culprit in relapse. Dopamine dysregulation may favor addiction and addiction may lead to dopamine dysregulation. Many psychiatric patients may have dopaminergic dysregulation and altered pleasure circuit function and are more prone to addiction, especially to nicotine, and probably harder to help. Objectives/aims A reflection on desire and pleasure in smokers in general and psychiatric patients and on possible strategies to overcome these difficulties. Methods 1) A review of philosophical, sociopolitical, biological and neuropsychiatric views of pleasure 2) Rating of smoking as a pleasure on a visual analog scale on first assessment of a smoking cessation program in a psychiatric hospital 3) Reflections on difficulties encountered in a smoking cessation program and possible strategies to overcome these Results and conclusions Treating addictions poses tremendous challenges since the very mechanisms nature disposed for survival, are those gone awry. Pleasure is identified as a major driving force behind addiction in tobaco smoking therefore should be specifically addressed in smoking cessation programs. Psychiatric patients who smoke tobaco are an especially difficult patient population and one of the contributing factors may be dopamine dysregulation/pleasure dysregulation.",

      "abstract": "Disease with Lewy bodies or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), particularly at the prodromal stage, is a complex disease to diagnose because of different clinical beginnings and variable paths in terms of clinical expression. Thus DLB can be entcountered in different input modes: mild cognitive impairment, depression, acute behavioral disorders, confusion and delirium, or sleep disorders. In the aim to better diagnose the disease, should be sought obviously to search for the key symptoms: fluctuations, hallucinations, extra-pyramidal syndrome, and REM sleep behavior disorder. These symptoms are more subtle at the prodromal stage (mild neurocognitive disorder) than at the major stage. Thus fluctuations can be cognitive, simply as attentionnal fluctuations, or of alertness, such as sleepiness or more frequent nap; the visual phenomena can begin by sensation of passage, sensation of presence, or illusions; the extra-pyramidal syndrome can be really subtle such as isolated amimia or rigidity detected only with Froment's manœuvre. The frequent accompagnying symptoms are autonomic symptoms such as rhinorrhea or constipation, or sensorial symptoms such as olfactory impairment. The clinician has to be aware of the frequent presence of geriatric syndroms, also at the prodromal stage and including: falls, orthostatic hypotension, syncopa, urinary troubles, depression, delirium (after surgery, during infection...). On neuropsychological tests, sub-cortical frontal syndrome is frequent, visual memory impairment, visuospatial impairment and visuo-constructive difficulties are also characteristics. On brain MRI, isolated diminished insula is to look for. CSF analysis is usually normal but sometimes with low Abeta-42. Dat-Scan and MIBG scintigraphy were not enough explored in this context. Thus, with every patient presenting a compatible input mode, the search for symptoms of DLB has to be systematic, in the aim to have an etiological diagnosis of prodromal DLB, to avoid adverse drug events (neuroleptics) and to optimize care for patients.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Depression is undoubtedly a particularly important disease in terms of personal suffering and death as well as social, family, and economic costs. Pharmacological treatment is a reasonably effective therapeutic approach;however, a delayed therapeutic response and the persistence of depressive symptoms represent serious drawbacks to clinical recovery.Although the pharmacological action of anti depressants begins a few hours after the start of treatment, an antidepressant response usually takes between 2 and 6 weeks.The persistence of depressive symptoms after the first weeks of treatment is indicative of a poor prognosis in terms of chronicity and a return to normal social function.The combination of mirtazapine with other antidepressants may significantly lessen these drawbacks.Its antagonist effect on the presynaptic receptors reduces the latency of the antidepressant response. Moreover, its robust noradrenergic effect enhances the serotoninergic effects of the most common antidepressants. In addition, the side effects of mirtazapine can be partially neutralized by the pharmacodynamic activity of other antidepressants, while mirtazapine can ameliorate the serious adverse effects, such as sexual dysfunction, of other medications.",

      "title": "Protection of disease/conditions induced memory impairment by novel pharmaceutical agents",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Memory impairment or dementia can be devastating and can lead to several complications. It can be precipitated as a result of various diseases or conditions including Alzheimer???s disease, hypothyroidism, post-traumatic stress disorder, vascular dementia, chronic stress, obesity, aging, sleep deprivation and consumption of high-fat high-carbohydrates diet, whereas it can possibly be treated, various agents.\r\n\r\nObjectives: The long-term goal of my studies is to explore novel pharmaceutical agents and interventions that prevent or restores memory impairment induced by various diseases or conditions. In this presentation, I will be discussing my latest results in a group of drugs including nicotine, L-thyroxin, pentoxifylline (PTX), caffeine, vitamin E and C, tempol, etazolate, etc. These agents showed protective properties against memory impairment induced by chronic stress, hypothyroidism, sleep deprivation, Alzheimer???s disease, post-traumatic stress disorder and obesity-induced by consumption high-fat high-carbohydrates diet.\r\n\r\nResults: Results presented are based on pre-clinical studies using standard or innovative animal models of the above diseases or conditions superimposed with chronic drug treatment. Thereafter, behavioral studies were conducted to test the spatial learning and memory using the Radial Arm Water Maze. Additionally, brain regions were usually dissected; and levels/activities of important signaling molecules or biomarkers related to oxidative stress and inflammation will be presented as possible molecular targets for the tested medications\r\n\r\nConclusions: Collectively, presented results will show the possibility of treating or preventing cognitive impairment in various diseases and conditions via the chronic use of novel pharmaceutical agents, which is probably achieved through normalizing the levels or activities of important signaling and biological biomarkers within the hippocampus.",

      "title": "Malignant Catatonia in the Setting of Acute Methamphetamine and Cocaine Intoxication",
      "abstract": "Background Malignant catatonia is a potentially lethal neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by psychomotor abnormalities and autonomic instability. Patients with this syndrome require immediate treatment. Various psychiatric conditions and nonpsychiatric medical problems can trigger malignant catatonia. Use of psychostimulant drugs, including methamphetamine and cocaine, has not been previously reported to precipitate malignant catatonia. Case Summary This case concerns a 35-year-old man hospitalized for psychosis due to methamphetamine and cocaine intoxication. He developed malignant catatonia the day after admission. He was treated with lorazepam for malignant catatonia, and his blood pressure was controlled with clonidine. Over 7 days, his condition resolved, and his mental status and vital signs returned to baseline. He was discharged to the community in stable condition and has returned to his baseline functional status. He remains free of catatonia and has maintained abstinence from methamphetamine and cocaine. Conclusions Acute intoxication with psychostimulant drugs is a possible trigger for malignant catatonia, and administration of high potency first-generation antipsychotics in this setting may increase the risk. Patients hospitalized for stimulant intoxication should be monitored for signs and symptoms of catatonia, and D 2 receptor antagonist medications should be used with caution in this population. Our case supports the potential role of altered dopamine and norepinephrine signaling in the pathogenesis of malignant catatonia. The patient provided written and verbal consent to publish the information in this case report.",

      "title": "Delusions Following Hypnosis",
      "abstract": "Abstract Delusions occurring after a hypnotic state in the non-psychotic patient are usually a result of the interplay of three factors: (a) the heightening of transference fantasies due mainly to the regression of the hypnotic state; (b) the presence of major ego defects, projective defenses, or other predisposing factors in the patient's character structure; and (c) the occurrence of countertransference reactions on the part of the hypnotist which touch on a specific area of conflict within the patient. The presence of third parties or the use of tape recorders are not satisfactory for the prevention of delusion formation. Rather, the physician using hypnosis should focus upon: (a) preliminary psychological evaluation and selection of patients free from disposition to delusion formation; (b) awareness of his own emotional responses to the patient. Attention to these factors will minimize the chance of delusion formation after the use of hypnosis.",

      "title": "Guidelines for treating depressive illness with antidepressants: A statement from the British Association for Psychopharmacology",
      "abstract": "Depression is a common illness which affects some 3% of the population per year. At least 25% of those with marked depression do not consult their general practitioner and in half of those who do the illness is not detected. Depression is easy to recognize when four or five of the core symptoms have been present for 2 weeks which often coincides with some occupational and social impairment. The core symptoms are depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, loss of energy or fatigue, concentration difficulties, appetite disturbance, sleep disturbance, agitation or retardation, worthlessness or self blame and suicidal thoughts. A diagnosis of depression is made when five of these core symptoms, one of which should be depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure, have been present for 2 weeks. Four core symptoms are probably sufficient. Response to antidepressants is good in those with more than mild symptoms. When there are only few or very mild depressive symptoms evidence of response to antidepressants is more uncertain. Antidepressants are effective, they are not addictive and do not lose efficacy with prolonged use. The newer antidepressants have fewer side effects than the older tricyclics, they are better tolerated and lead to less withdrawals from treatment. They are less cardiotoxic and are safer in overdose. Antidepressants should be used at full therapeutic doses. Treatment failure is often due to too low a dose being used in general practice. It may be difficult to reach the right dose with the older tricyclics because of side effects. To consolidate response, treatment should be continued for at least 4 months after the patient is apparently well. Stopping the treatment before this is ill-advised as the partially treated depression frequently returns. Most depression is recurrent. Long-term antidepressant treatment is effective in reducing the risk of new episodes of depression and should be continued to keep the patient well.",

      "title": "Fibromyalgia syndrome: Basic knowledge, diagnosis and treatment.",
      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is characterized by chronic widespread pain, unrefreshing sleep and mental/physical fatigue. Most patients report additional somatic and psychological symptoms. Fibromyalgia is a heterogeneous condition. The definite aetiology of this syndrome remains unknown. A model of interacting biological and psychosocial variables in the predisposition, triggering, and development of the chronicity of fibromyalgia symptoms has been suggested. Depression, genetics, obesity combined with physical inactivity, physical and sexual abuse in childhood, sleep problems, and smoking predict future development of fibromyalgia. Psychosocial stress (working place and family conflicts) and physical stress (infections, surgery, accidents) might trigger the onset of chronic widespread pain and fatigue. Mental disorders have a negative impact on the clinical outcome. Several factors are associated with the pathophysiology such as alteration of sensory processing in the brain, reduced reactivity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis to stress, increased pro-inflammatory and reduced anti-inflammatory cytokine profiles, disturbances in neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin, and small fiber pathology. Prolonged exposure to stress, as outlined above, may contribute to these functional changes in predisposed individuals. The prevalence in the general German population is about 2 %. The clinical diagnosis is established by the history of the key symptoms and the exclusion of somatic diseases sufficiently explaining chronic widespread pain. For management, the German evidence and consensus based guideline recommends a stepwise approach according to the severity of FMS. All patients should receive adequate education about the disorder and its management. Non-pharmacological therapies such as low intensity aerobic exercise and meditative movement therapies such as Qi-Gong and Yoga are highly recommended for long-term self-management. Drug therapy is not mandatory. Recommended drugs are the antidepressants amitriptyline and duloxetine and the anticonvulsant pregabalin which act as pain modulators.",

      "title": "Cocaine Abuse and Its Treatment",
      "abstract": "Widespread use and abuse of cocaine have increased the frequency with which health professionals must manage acute and chronic intoxication and the complications stemming from drug ingestion. Acute intoxication from catecholamine excess progresses through three stages, affecting the cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous systems. Management is to support or return these systems to normal with sedation, beta blockade, and antiarrhythmics. Casual cocaine use is no longer considered benign, and numerous related medical complications are now recognized. Dopaminergic systems are the principal sites of reward and participate in abstinence symptomatology, putatively through depletion of dopamine and changes in receptor sensitivity and responsiveness. Long-term treatment approaches have focused on psychologic strategies of behavior modification and supportive psychotherapy. Pharmacotherapy with desipramine, amantadine, and bromocriptine was shown in preliminary studies to minimize the symptoms of cocaine withdrawal when used adjunctively with psychotherapy. The response to treatment may depend on the patient's premorbid psychiatric status.",

      "title": "ABC of psychological medicine: Fatigue",
      "abstract": "Fatigue can refer to a subjective symptom of malaise and aversion to activity or to objectively impaired performance. It has both physical and mental aspects. The symptom of fatigue is a poorly defined feeling, and careful inquiry is needed to clarify complaints of “fatigue,” “tiredness,” or “exhaustion” and to distinguish lack of energy from loss of motivation or sleepiness, which may be pointers to specific diagnoses (see below). \r\n\r\nPrevalence—Like blood pressure, subjective fatigue is normally distributed in the population. The prevalence of clinically significant fatigue depends on the threshold chosen for severity (usually defined in terms of associated disability) and persistence. Surveys report that 5-20% of the general population suffer from such persistent and troublesome fatigue. Fatigue is twice as common in women as in men but is not strongly associated with age or occupation. It is one of the commonest presenting symptoms in primary care, being the main complaint of 5-10% of patients and an important subsidiary symptom in a further 5-10%.\r\n\r\nFatigue as a symptom—Patients generally regard fatigue as important (because it is disabling), whereas doctors do not (because it is diagnostically non-specific). This discrepancy is a potent source of potential difficulty in the doctor-patient relationship. Fatigue may present in association with established medical and psychiatric conditions or be idiopathic. Irrespective of cause, it has a major impact on day to day functioning and quality of life. Without treatment, the prognosis of patients with idiopathic fatigue is surprisingly poor; half those seen in general practice with fatigue are still fatigued six months later.",
