      "abstract": "Learning disabilities is a generic term that refers to a heterogeneous group of disorders manifested by significant difficulties in the acquisition and use of listening, speaking, reading, writing, reasoning or mathematical abilities. These disorders are intrinsic to the individual and presumed to be due to central nervous system dysfunction. Even though a learning disability may occur concomitantly with other handicapping conditions (e.g., sensory impairment, mental retardation, social and emotional disturbance) or environmental influences (e.g., cultural differences, insufficient/inappropriate instruction, psychogenic factors), it is not the direct result of those conditions or influences.",

Nevertheless, articulatory disorders, hearing impairments, emotional disturbances and/or feeblemindedness may accompany the picture, but they are not the cause for it. Language examination in dysphasic schoolchildren must be made in several steps: 1) Spontaneous speech examination (narrating, describing, talking together); 2) Examination of repeated syllabes, words or sentences; 3) Oral and mental repetition of series of words and sentences (with or without change of posture); 4) Hearing perception and comprehension tests (sensibilized audiometric tests); 5) Drawing interpretation or reading; 6) Drawing representation or writing (copy, composition, dictation); 7) Examination of other linguistic systems (singing, kinestetic reading, mathematical calculation, etc.). ...",

      "abstract": "Learning disabilities are neurologically based impairments in learning and/or processing that specifically interfere with higher-level cognitive skills. Learning disabilities can significantly impact academic progress and achievement at any or all ages. Learning disability is a general category composed of many types of disabilities in seven areas. These areas include: receptive language, expressive language, basic reading skills, reading comprehension, written expression, mathematics calculation and mathematical reasoning. The terms \"specific reading disability\" and \"specific language impairment\" have been used to identify impairments in the specific areas of reading and spoken language, respectively. Processing speed is a cognitive ability defined as the time it takes to do a mental task. Deficits in processing speed have been associated with language and learning disorders. Working memory is considered to be one of the core deficits of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.",

      "title": "Non-verbal Cognitive Dysfunction in Children with Specific Language Impairment",
      "abstract": "Background: Language deficits occur in a series of developmental disorders and are widely recognized as characteristic symptoms of a range of developmental clinical conditions. In fact, Specific Language Impairment (hereafter SLI) is currently defined as a significant impairment of the child's linguistic abilities on several levels (phonology, morphology, lexical, syntax, narrative) by the presence of non-verbal IQ scores in the normal range; the diagnosis is based on a set of inclusionary and exclusionary criteria including performance at least one standard deviation below age expectations on a generic language assessment but 'normal' non-verbal intelligence. Of course, the term 'normal' non-verbal intelligence raises issues about what constitutes a 'normal' non-verbal IQ in a-/typical development and must be handled with care. However, according to the classical definition (ICD-10-GM version 2009; F80.- 'Umschriebene Entwicklungsstorungen des Sprechens und der Sprache') a child with SLI performs below age expectations on language measures despite having adequate cognitive and sensory skills for typical development with no obvious identifiable cause such as hearing loss, brain injuries or other neurological disorders.\r\nMorphology studies of individuals with developmental language disorders claim reversed asymmetry or symmetry of the planum temporale and the pars triangularis (Wernicke's and Broca's area), yet so far there is no clear evidence that children with SLI have marked anatomical differences from other children in either brain hemisphere. Moreover, some indication suggest a possible genetic link because SLI can be passed down from parents to children - although such a SLI-gene of course hasn't been identified thus far. Hence, the investigations of etiological factors are at a premature and inconclusive stage of inquiry and so far nothing but speculative causes can be mentioned.\r\nTo sum up, current literature on SLI hardly defines a language profile as 'typical' for SLI given that the spectrum of the disorder is very broad and yet unclear since in both, academic and clinical practice, the 'specific' characteristics of this developmental impairment have been questioned. After all, the fluidity of the diagnosis, making it difficult to border SLI, should actually be considered an important descriptive aspect, portraying the interactive nature of 'specific' cognitive systems. In fact, this study is motivated by the interest in the extensive issue whether there is a relationship between language impairments and impairments on general levels of nonverbal cognitive skills, as part of the broader question of the nature of language and cognition. \r\nThus, the aim of this study is to profile a child's performance across linguistic and cognitive domains, to determine if the domains are similar or discrepant in levels of performance.\r\nMethods: 30 typically developing children and 12 children with SLI between 5;0-9;0 years were tested on both their verbal and non-verbal abilities with respectively two standardized tests each. The children with SLI were all currently in therapy and classified as 'SLI' by their speech and language pathologists. All participants were from South Tyrol or Vienna and therefore German native speakers with dialectical colouring; some had a bilingual background, this fact was of course taken into consideration while analyzing the results. To 'measure' the child's non-verbal performances level the Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (parallel form) and the 'Zahlensymboltest' of the HAWIK-R was used. The Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices were used to give an indication about the child's (4;9-12;00) non-verbal performance; in each test item, a candidate is asked to identify the missing segment required to complete a larger pattern. \r\nThe verbal abilities were assessed with the German version of the standardized TROG-D (original edition by D.V.M. Bishop,1989; German by Annette V. Fox, 2006) which is used to test a child's (3;0-10;11) general linguistic and grammatical comprehension. However, some items (Set 'R') were discarded since the linguistic construction is not common in the children's dialect and therefore not recognizable by them. As a second test, the first part (forward digit span) of the 'Zahlennachsprechen' of the HAWIK-R assessed the phonological loop of the short term memory, while the second part (backward digit span) not only demands phonological memorizing but also the ability to act upon the shortly memorized item. \r\nThe test battery was reduced to these four items in order to successfully conduct the experiment without losing the child's attentiveness and interest. Each test session lasted for 20-35 minutes circa, depending on the child's accomplishment. In case the child was unable to concentrate or to carry out the given tasks, the experiment was stopped up and the results gained so far were used.\r\nResults: The preliminary results show a slight tendency towards underage-expected performance of the children diagnosed with 'SLI' in non-verbal tests compared to the control group. So far, this research alludes to a range of non-verbal cognitive mechanisms interacting with language and having its implications in delineating the profile of SLI. \r\nConclusions: Many of the studies of children with language impairments who do or do not display cognitive impairments are motivated by the interest in the broader issue of the relationship between language and cognition. The extent to which the two domains of language and general cognitive abilities are inherently singular or modular remains unresolved and controversial. However, this work has shown that to a small but noticeable extent the domains of cognition and language can operate as orthogonal dimensions. According to these findings, the definition of SLI as specifically and exclusively linked to language must be revised, since the characteristics of this developmental disorder seem to be wider than first documented.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Specific Language Impairment, Cognition, Non-verbal IQ, Developmental Disorder;\r\n\r\nReferences: \r\n[1]\tLeonard L.

      "title": "Specific Learning Disorders: Neurobiological Foundations, Differential Diagnosis, and Educational Implications",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Specific learning disorders (SLD) involve persistent difficulties in reading, writing, and/or mathematics, with a neurobiological basis and not attributable to intellectual, sensory deficits, or inadequate instruction. Their prevalence in school populations ranges from 5–15%, with significant impact on academic performance, self-esteem, and social participation. Objective: To synthesize evidence on the neurobiological foundations, differential diagnosis, and educational implications of SLD, guiding clinical and pedagogical practice. Development: Dyslexia shows alterations in left temporo-parietal phonological networks and, in some cases, in the dorsal magnocellular-visual pathway, suggesting a multisystem disorder. Dyscalculia is associated with intraparietal sulcus dysfunction and altered numeric-mnemonic connectivity. Dysgraphia may be linguistic (phonological-orthographic deficit) or motor (dyspraxia/DCD), linked to working memory and executive function impairments. Comorbidities (e.g., ADHD) further complicate cognitive profiles and interventions. Strategies such as the Response to Intervention model support early detection, while Universal Design for Learning and assistive technologies promote educational inclusion. Continuous teacher training and socio-emotional learning programs are essential to mitigate negative effects and foster resilience. Conclusions: SLD require comprehensive diagnosis, evidence-based interventions, and inclusive adaptations. Combining early screening, targeted support, accessible environments, and teacher training enhances academic and psychosocial outcomes. Further research is needed to optimize identification and intervention protocols, particularly regarding dyscalculia and emerging technologies.",

      "abstract": "Assistive technology involving voice communication is used primarily by people who are deaf, hard of hearing, or who have speech and/or language disabilities. It is also used to a lesser extent by people with visual or motor disabilities. A very wide range of devices has been developed for people with hearing loss. These devices can be categorized not only by the modality of stimulation [i.e., auditory, visual, tactile, or direct electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve (auditory-neural)] but also in terms of the degree of speech processing that is used. At least four such categories can be distinguished: assistive devices (a) that are not designed specifically for speech, (b) that take the average characteristics of speech into account, (c) that process articulatory or phonetic characteristics of speech, and (d) that embody some degree of automatic speech recognition. Assistive devices for people with speech and/or language disabilities typically involve some form of speech synthesis or symbol generation for severe forms of language disability. Speech synthesis is also used in text-to-speech systems for sightless persons. Other applications of assistive technology involving voice communication include voice control of wheelchairs and other devices for people with mobility disabilities.",

      "title": "Feeding and swallowing dysfunction in genetic syndromes",
      "abstract": "Abstract Children with genetic syndromes frequently have feeding problems and swallowing dysfunction as a result of the complex interactions between anatomical, medical, physiological, and behavioral factors. Feeding problems associated with genetic disorders may also cause feeding to be unpleasant, negative, or even painful because of choking, coughing, gagging, fatigue, or emesis, resulting in the child to stop eating and to develop behaviors that make it difficult, if not impossible, for a parent to feed their child. In addition, limited experiences with oral intake related to the medical or physical conditions, or other variables such as prematurity, often result in a failure of the child's oral motor skills to develop normally. For example, a child with Pierre Robin sequence may be unable to successfully feed orally, initially, due to micrognathia and glossoptosis. Oral‐motor dysfunction may develop as a result of both anatomical problems, (e.g., cleft lip/palate), lack of experience (e.g., s/p. surgery), or oral motor abnormalities (e.g., brain malformation). Neuromotor coordination impairments such as those associated with Down syndrome (e.g., hypotonia, poor tongue control, and open mouth posture) frequently interfere with the acquisition of effective oral‐motor skills and lead to feeding difficulties. Management of these phenomena is frequently possible, if an appropriate feeding plan exist that allows for three primary factors: (1) feeding program must be safe, (2) feeding program must support optimal growth, and (3) feeding program must be realistic. Researchers have demonstrated the utility of behavioral approaches in the treatment of feeding disorders, such as manipulations in the presentation of foods and drink and consequences for food refusal and acceptance (e.g., praise, extinction, contingent access to preferred foods). However, because a child's failure to eat is not frequently the result of a single cause, evaluation and treatment are typically conducted by an interdisciplinary team usually consisting of a behavioral psychologist, pediatric gastroenterologist, speech pathologist, nutrition, and sometimes other disciplines. This chapter provides an overview of some of the feeding difficulties experience by some of the more common genetic disorders including identification, interventions, and management. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

      "abstract": "Alalia is a speech disorder that develops due to organic brain damage in children with normal hearing and intelligence during the first three year of life. Systemic speech underdevelopment in alalia is characterized by violations in the phonetic, phonemic, lexical, and grammatical structure. Patients with alalia can also have non-speech related impairments, including motor (impaired movement and coordination), sensory (impaired sensitivity and perception), and psychopathological disorders. There are three types of alalia: motor, sensory, and mixed. Children with motor alalia have expressive language disorders, speech praxis, poor speech fluency, impaired articulation, and other focal neurological symptoms; however, they understand speech directed to them. Patients with motor alalia are often left-handed. Regional slowing and epileptiform activity are often detected on their electroencephalogram. Children with sensory alalia are characterized by poor speech understanding (despite normal hearing) resulting in secondary underdevelopment of their own speech. These patients have problems with the analysis of sounds, including speech sounds (impaired speech gnosis), which prevents the development of association between the sound image and the object. Therefore, the child hears, but does not understand the speech directed at him/her (auditory agnosia). Differential diagnosis of alalia is challenging and may require several months of observation. It also implies the exclusion of hearing loss and mental disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Dyslexia is a disorder characterised by difficulty in learning to read that cannot be attributed to secondary organic, mechanical or social circumstances. In other words, a child fails to learn to read at an age‐appropriate rate, irrespective of intelligence level, education or other neurological deficits. Notably, developmental dyslexia – which is the focus of this article – is distinct from acquired dyslexia, which occurs due to brain trauma. Numerous sensory and cognitive deficits contribute to dyslexia, including difficulties with auditory processing of speech sounds, visual processing and working memory. Current research is aimed at understanding the neurobiological cause of these cognitive deficits. Key Concepts Dyslexia is a universal and persistent form of low literacy in which a child fails to learn to read at an age‐appropriate rate. It is found across languages and is not associated with intelligence, age, education or other neurological deficits. Symptoms of dyslexia and their severity can vary significantly from one individual to the next. People with dyslexia have been found to have Impaired phonological processing – that is, a decreased perceptual sensitivity to sound‐segments in language. Difficulties with short‐term memory. Impaired visual processing. Spelling difficulties. Phonological dyslexia refers to difficulties in sounding words out and making phonological manipulations. Surface dyslexia refers to difficulties in developing and accessing a lexicon, that is a mental representation of words. Dyslexia is often confused with visual stress – the symptoms of which include words moving when attempting to read, shimmering or disappearing, words looking like they were carved into the page, lines or rivers through the text, and preferring to read under very low light levels. The exact aetiology of dyslexia is unknown; however, evidence indicates deficits in magnocellular‐dorsal stream processing in the visual domain and impaired brainwave function in the auditory domain. Several genetic mutations have also been identified in dyslexia. Current remedial interventions for dyslexia are educational and are aimed at improving cognitive deficits. Current research is aimed at identifying the neurobiological basis of dyslexia to aid the development of a treatment that targets the underlying neurobiological cause of dyslexia.",

Additional findings in FOXP2-related speech and language disorders can include oral motor dyspraxia (difficulty planning or programming oral movements on command); dysarthria (a neuromuscular-based speech disorder that may affect nasal resonance, voice quality, prosody, and breath support for speech); moderate to severe receptive and expressive language disorder; and reading and spelling impairments. The underlying genetic cause of FOXP2-related speech and language disorders is either disruption of FOXP2 only (referred to in this GeneReview as FOXP2-only-related speech and language disorder) or large copy number variants (i.e., contiguous gene deletions), structural variants (i.e., chromosome translocation or inversion), or maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (UPD7) involving FOXP2 (here referred to as FOXP2-plus speech and language disorders). The genetic alteration determines if only speech and language problems are present (FOXP2-only-related speech and language disorder) or if more global developmental and behavioral issues are likely to be present as well (FOXP2-plus speech and language disorder). In FOXP2-only-related disorders, nonverbal (performance) IQ is typically more preserved compared to verbal IQ. Fine motor skills may be impaired (e.g., buttoning clothes, tying shoelaces), yet gross motor skills are normal. Autistic features and dysmorphic findings have been reported in a few affected individuals. In FOXP2-plus-related disorders oral motor deficits, global developmental delay, and autism spectrum disorder are common.Diagnosis/testingThe diagnosis of a FOXP2-related speech and language disorder is established in a proband by detection of one of the following: A large non-recurrent contiguous gene deletion that includes FOXP2 (52% of affected individuals). A sequence variant within FOXP2 (~29%). Maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (UPD7) that reduces FOXP2 expression (~11%). A structural variant (e.g., chromosome translocation, inversion) that disrupts FOXP2 (~8%).ManagementTreatment of manifestations: Optimally management of the speech and/or language disorder is determined by a speech pathologist based on the individual's findings (typically: presence and severity of CAS, dysarthria, language deficits, and literacy impairments). A clinical psychologist or neuropsychologist may provide strategies to help manage deficits in specific cognitive domains and an occupational therapist and physiotherapist can provide strategies to help with fine and gross motor deficits, respectively. Surveillance: Follow-up evaluations with standardized tests by a speech and language pathologist. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Clarification of the genetic status of pre-symptomatic relatives at risk identifies as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt evaluation for speech and language disorders and initiation of treatment.Genetic counselingRecurrence risk for sibs of proband with a FOXP2-related speech and language disorder depends on the genetic alteration: Non-recurrent contiguous gene deletions (80% are de novo and the remainder are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner) FOXP2 sequence variants (~70% are de novo and the remainder are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner) Maternal UPD7 (no increased risk to sibs) A structural variant (e.g., chromosome translocation, inversion. If one parent has a structural variant, the risk to sibs is increased and depends on the specific structural variant.) Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible if the causative genetic alteration has been identified in an affected family member.",

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is a common comorbidity. Low academic performance must not be attributable to a more general condition such as intellectual disability, lack of educational opportunity, or low language proficiency. The learning difficulties are present from the early school years. The diagnostic assessment includes standardized academic achievement testing, review of academic records, and cognitive testing to rule out intellectual disability. Treatment includes specialized multimodal educational interventions in conjunction with academic accommodations.

Some children have specific difficulties in learning to read without any other abnormalities of intellect, though it is debatable whether dyslexia (a ‘specific syndrome wherein particular difficulty exists in learning the conventional meaning of verbal symbols, and of associating the sound with symbol in appropriate fashion’ 1 ) should be separated from other reading difficulties that may present similarly. 2 Unless treated it may persist throughout childhood and is often familial. 3 It is more common in boys than girls. It is occasionally associated with general clumsiness, but quite often with confusion in right-left differentiation in copying shapes and in spelling.

The term “anterograde amnesia” refers to the inability to form new long-term memories, going forward in time. The term “speech” refers to the physical generation of sound, while the term “language” refers to the meaningful, linguistic material. Signed language is nonoral language that, neurologically speaking, is the equivalent of spoken language. Numerous, specific disturbances of speech and/or language function signal the likely presence of a physical disorder in adults. Speech and language functioning are extremely complex and involve the coordinated activity of many interconnected neurological systems. Disease states or injuries that affect the shaping of sound into words produce disturbances in articulation that are called “dysarthrias”.",

Amnesias are common following a traumatic brain injury. Paramnesias are false or distorted recall – seen in acute confusional states or in dementia. Hallucinations are perceptual experiences without an external sensory stimulus – in other words, people see objects that are not there, hear voices, or believe there is a smell. Breakdown in speech production occurs in many dementias, such as motor neurone disease with dementia. Many find the classification of speech disorders difficult. Language competency depends on a discrete set of abilities: sensory decoding of the spoken message, appreciation of meaning, the capacity for repetition, and production of correctly articulated and correct speech.",

      "abstract": "Specific language impairment (SLI) (englanti) 2/2007 (111) Specific language impairment (SLI) Specific language impairment (SLI) is a language disorder typically characterised by delayed speech development and deficiencies in a childs language ability as a result of the abnormal functioning and development of neural networks in the brain. Current knowledge indicates that SLI is present in at least seven per cent of children. Difficulties in acquiring and mastering a language cannot be explained in terms of differences in intellectual capacity or the circumstances in which the child is raised. Nonetheless, there are SLI children who are brought up in an environment that is not fully conducive to their wellbeing or development. If the nature of language impairment and the factors underlying it are not adequately taken into account when planning and implementing supportive measures for the child, the learning difficulty or socio-emotional development disorder may persist despite efforts to support the child through, for instance, child psychiatric treatment. The writer notes that our knowledge of SLI is still incomplete and that SLI is regarded too emphatically as a problem of speech development and everyday communication or, at best, mainly one of language acquisition. However, deficiencies in a childs language ability and the factors underlying this (probably deficiences in word/speech discrimination and in short and long-term memory) could well affect the childs overall development and general learning ability. Despite having greatly improved their speech and acquired essential language skills long ago, even children (and adults) with only mild SLI can experience problems in comprehending and remembering what they have heard or read, in clearly distinguishing speech, in expressing their own thoughts, observations and feelings, and in demonstrating their own competence verbally or in writing. In conversations it may be difficult to remember the meanings of words quickly enough to keep up with the flow of speech, or difficult to find the appropriate words for a given situation promptly enough. With greater awareness of SLI it should be possible to prevent or at least to reduce many of the adverse consequences. Marja Asikainen",

A number of clinical syndromes are described and their differential diagnosis considered. The clinical picture will usually change as the child grows older.

At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal.

Chronic/ recurrent disorders seems to have they causes in the particular personality traits and deficits. Some of them are revealed, described and could be measured by means of Neurotic Personality Questionnaire KON 2006. In this approach, functional disorder is understood as structured systems of the particular nonverbal language (“parole”) in which symptoms play a role of words while syndromes the role of sentences, expressing the current state of mind – mainly the need of bond with other people and its frustration. They are messages of looking attention, attachment. The use of such language seems to be the result of personality deficits making difficult or even impossible to fulfil the need of bond in the psychosocial field using common for done culture verbal and nonverbal language, “normal” means of communication. While in the acute and conditioned reactions on stress different forms of helping people (e.g. CBT) seems to be adequate, in the chronic and recurrent functional disorders therapy is postulated to aiming rather at transformations of the communication, leading to the exchange of the messages’ language having the quality of disorder for common, mainly verbal one.",

      "title": "Speech Development and Therapy Using the Kinect",
      "abstract": "IntroductionIn the United Kingdom (UK), 2.5 million people, and in the United States 7.5 million people, have a speech or language difficulty (1, 2). Speech and language therapists assess and treat speech, language and communication problems in people of all ages to help them communicate better. Speech and language therapy is an extremely diverse field, treating problems in adults and children that may have been caused by a wide range of developmental conditions, diseases or disabilities such as stroke, learning disabilities, neurological disorders, head injury, deafness or dementia (3). Individuals with developmental issues may require the assistance of trained therapists to promote correct development of speech, whilst sufferers of conditions such as stroke, and other brain traumas or diseases may require speech therapy in order to return their ability to speak properly.As the field is diverse, methods of categorising different types of speech problems have been developed across medical practices which include for example (4):Aphasia which covers problems related to understanding or expressing speech and language correctly, and which is subdivided into component groups including Broca's (expressive) aphasia, Wernicke's (receptive) aphasia and global aphasia. Receptive aphasia is the inability of a person to understand language, or to make sense of the words that one is hearing and their meaning. Expressive aphasia is the inability to speak words, or determine the correct word to use when speaking, for example, jumbling sentences or mixing up similar words.Dysarthria which covers problems forming particular sounds with the mouth during speech, due to weak muscles or the inability to properly control the muscles in one's mouth. This can often lead to others having difficulty understand a person as their speech may be slurred, imprecise or quiet. It may be developmental as a result of brain changes before or during birth or acquired as the result of a head injury or medical condition such as stroke or Parkinson's disease. Dysarthria is often present in patients who also suffer from expressive aphasia.Dyspraxia/apraxia which refers to the inability to move the muscles required for speech in the correct sequence to form words and sounds properly. This is often shown by a patient's inability to correctly order mouth sounds in long, compound words especially when component sounds are similar, by making inconsistent mistakes when speaking, or by incorrectly varying the rhythms, stresses, and inflections of speech that are used to help express meaning.Each of these different types of speech disorder has differing common methods of treatment and associated activities and exercises that patients perform to help combat their condition (5). These can range from flash cards, reading exercises or vocalisation tasks which are often performed at home, and then repeated regularly with therapists to determine how a patient is progressing. Since these activities are often formulaic and well defined, they provide an appropriate target for simulation within computer-based applications and/or support for speech and language therapists. However, to correctly develop and apply software that is useful to therapists and beneficial to patients the appropriate methods, reference models and tools must be understood so that the software produced can be most effectively developed and exercises selected to match individual patients' therapy needs (6, 7).Speech therapy through technologyThe last decade has seen a growth in the number of computer-based systems and specialized speech recognition software to supplement treatment of patients who have speech disorders stemming from developmental problems, or conditions such as post traumatic brain injury or stroke. AUDIX, for example, is a knowledge-based multimedia system that provides auditory discrimination exercises via a mix of visual stimuli (words, pictures) and audio (voice) clips to adult aphasic patients to help them discriminate between minimal pair sets of words (8). …",

      "title": "Psychological aspects of learning disabilities",
      "abstract": "Learning disabilities are a heterogeneous diagnostic category. As a specific disorder learning disabilities include reading disorders, disorders of written expression and mathematics disorders. As a general concept, learning disabilities may be categorised into four symptom complexes, which are not mutually exclusive: 1. dyslexia, 2. motor-perceptual; 3. language delay; 4. hyperactivity. In clinical settings these neurodevelopmental disorders are diagnosed in school-aged children. The most common referral reasons are significant difficulties in school achievement or difficulties in child adjustment and functioning that are manifested through behavioural and emotional difficulties caused by learning disabilities. Since academic achievement is an important aspect of self-esteem in childhood, school failure may result in many short-term and long-term consequences for the child’s functioning in narrow and broader social contexts, development of maladaptive behaviour and also cause the development of psychopathology. The most common short-term consequences include low academic and general self-esteem, lack of motivation for schooling and related obligations, behavioural disorders, a sense of overload in the child, peer relationship problems and a heightened level of family conflicts. The usual long-term outcomes are psychosomatic problems, affective disorders (depression, anxiety) and severe behavioural problems. Furthermore, longitudinal studies show the persistence of certain problems in adulthood.In summary, impairments should be adequately assessed to evaluate the cognitive deficits and strengths, and a precise diagnosis should be established. Once problem areas have been identified, special teaching strategies can be devised in collaboration with the school to circumvent handicaps. Also, an important part of intervention includes counselling of parents and children.",

Children who understand nothing are nonverbal, in others speech is sparse, nonfluent, poorly intelligible, and agrammatic; (2) expressive disorders with adequate comprehension affect phonologic production‐predominantly. Children with verbal dyspraxia, the most severe variant, may also be nonverbal but comprehend well; (3) higher order processing disorders affect semantics, pragmatics, and discourse. Semantics and pragmatics are invariably affected in preschool autistic children in whom isolated expressive deficits do not occur. Etiology of developmental language disorders is predominantly genetic. Structural brain lesions detectable by neuroimaging are exceptional. Severe receptive deficits require a sleep EEG to detect subclinical epilepsy. Early educational intervention is both critical and efficacious.",

      "title": "[Emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology].",
      "abstract": "Trauma comes as a result of the subject's exposure to extremely negative and stressful events, such as natural or human-provoked catastrophes, wars, serious injuries, violent deaths, tortures, terrorist attacks, rapes and other sexual crimes. A child's exposure to traumatic circumstances of this level during the crucial period of self-structuring creates rather difficult conditions for its development. Moreover, if the child does not have the opportunity to elaborate and analyze all these stressful conditions and put them into words, serious consequences, both psychological and somatic, may occur in adult life. Specific factors and child characteristics, namely, the age, the developmental stage within which the trauma occurs, its type (physical or sexual abuse, neglect or traumatic social events), frequency, duration and intensity, have been proved to seriously affect the trauma's consequences. The immediate emotional impact of trauma may include isolation, fear, feeling of weakness or loss of the sense of confidence. Moreover, mood disorders such as depression and withdrawal, negative effects on cognitive ability, language development and academic performance, difficulties in creating a secure link and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also observed. The long-term consequences for the individual's mental health can be expressed through the following: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combined or not with depression and anxiety disorder, mood disorders, personality disorders, poor control of impulsions, dissociation disorder, psychotic disorder. Finally, apart from the dramatic impact of trauma on the person itself, there is also a high social cost to be paid as a result of the individual's poor adjustment and dysfunction in the community. Early support and intervention in the child's environment may significantly minimize the negative effects of trauma. Beyond the expression of genes, good maternal care as well as psychological support, lead to normal DNA methylation and brain development. Supporting the family and break the silence that frequently covers the traumatic events and feelings, will give the opportunity for the elaboration of all these aspects which could capture and imprison the subject in a dramatic circle of psychopathology. Moreover, the effectiveness of early interventions and child psychotherapy is now a common ground, so we have to use all our clinical instruments (dialogue, symbolic play, drawing, storytelling) in order to help the child and have the best possible result. Finally, concerning clinical practice, the emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology is so frequent that mental health experts should take it into serious account while developing an appropriate clinical treatment for such patients.",

Se caracteriza por una capacidad reducida para razonar y comprender informacion abstracta o compleja, que tiene un fuerte impacto en el aprendizaje escolar y limita la capacidad de adaptacion en la vida diaria, incluso en la edad adulta. La discapacidad intelectual, o discapacidad mental, es el resultado de una interaccion de la vulnerabilidad individual de una persona que tiene DI con su ecosistema, es decir, el entorno familiar, cultural o institucional que puede ser un obstaculo o un facilitador. La deteccion de un nino con una trayectoria de desarrollo inusual requiere un buen conocimiento del desarrollo psicomotor por parte de los profesionales. La DI puede estar aislada, pero tambien es muy frecuente que aparezca asociada a otros trastornos del neurodesarrollo, como autismo, trastornos motores o sensoriales (audicion, vision), trastornos graves del sueno, de la alimentacion, o patologias medicas como la epilepsia, o una amplia variedad de trastornos psicopatologicos como ansiedad, depresion y trastornos de la regulacion emocional. Las causas de la DI son multiples, y mas de una de cada dos veces son de origen genetico, existiendo varios centenares de enfermedades raras que pueden estar detras de su origen, pero es frecuente aun que sus causas sean desconocidas. La difusion de las nuevas tecnicas geneticas (secuenciacion de alto rendimiento) deberia reducir el numero de personas sin diagnosticar y devolver su lugar a un enfoque diagnostico razonado basado en la clinica.

The three cardinal signs and symptoms of delirium are: clouding of consciousness, impaired attention, and altered states of arousal (hyperarousal or hypo-arousal). Secondary features of delirium include: global impairment of cognition; disturbances of speech articulation (not of language); hallucinations and illusions; fluctuating affect; psychotic symptoms, such as delusions, illusions, hallucinations, and paranoid ideation; and disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia may be described as a disease where speech, bodily language and social responsiveness are obvious expressions of a deteriorated ability to interact with the surroundings in a precise and relevant way. The lack of precision and relevance pertains to perception and recall as well as communication and action. The deficient potential for activation of the prefrontal cerebral cortex is a neurobiological correlate to the lesion of precise and relevant planning and expression. Impairment of formal thought and language in schizophrenia are suggested to result from a developmental disorder pertaining to language and concept formation (apperception). In reactive psychoses with dissociative disturbances of consciousness there is an inefficient capacity for adapting to external reality; thus relevant conscious planning and interaction with the outside world are impaired. Clinically a distractibility of a tematic nature ensues. Except for catastrophic events, psychotic reactions cannot be predicted from analysis of the actual experience--neither concerning the external nor the internal aspects of conscious awareness. Sometimes, however, previous events relating to the formation of the self may add explanatory value to the analysis of reactive psychosis. In some cases biological predisposition is the decisive determinant. The normal discrimination between sense-perception and imagination has a counterpart in the dichotomy of awareness of the outside world versus awareness of the self. The following are examples of psychotic experience where the normal ability for dichotomic discrimination may be damaged: Illusions of affect, hallucinations, Schneider's first rank symptoms, \"Anwesenheit\" and consciousness of time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Each area is differentiated within current diagnostic approaches. However, difficulties within the language system often co-occur. The assessment of communication difficulties requires professionals to profile linguistic skills rather than rely on single diagnostic measures. Social communication disorders raise particular challenges in their assessment and their differentiation with other neurodevelopmental disorders. Communication disorders also co-occur, with problems in literacy and behavior highlighting the importance of multiprofessional approaches to assessment and intervention. There is an increasing evidence base for effective interventions that professionals can access to support children’s communication difficulties.",

      "title": "Early identification and intervention for infants at high risk of neurodevelopmental disorders",
      "abstract": "Developmental disability is a broad term encompassing many different diagnoses. These conditions, predominantly associated with the functioning of the neurological system and brain, manifest during infancy or childhood and usually last throughout a person’s lifetime. These are marked by delayed development or functional limitations in cognition, language, communication, behavior socialization or motor function, and are defined as ‘neurodevelopmental disorders’. \r\nMost neurodevelopmental disorders are caused by a complex mix of factors, that may affect neurological function. This might be due to genetics, due to conditions occurring during pregnancy, such as malnutrition, infection or parental behavior (i.e. smoking, drugs and/or drinking alcohol during pregnancy,…) or due to perinatal and neonatal complications. \r\nNeurodevelopmental problems due to injury that has occurred during the perinatal period can mainly be subdivided in 3 groups:\r\n-\tInfants with congenital malformations, including syndromes, chromosomal and genetic defects and inborn errors of metabolism\r\n-\tInfants that are born preterm and/or with low birthweight\r\n-\tInfants with a hypoxic-ischemic insult and/or perinatal stroke \r\n\r\nThis doctoral thesis focused on preterm birth and perinatal stroke, two main perinatal causes of neurodevelopmental disorders and improved our insight about the neurodevelopmental outcome, early diagnosis and early intervention of those high-risk infants. \r\n\r\nPART I of this dissertation focused on very preterm (VPT)/very-low-birthweight (VLBW) infants. The care for preterm infants has improved considerably in the last decades, however, they continue to face complex medical and neurodevelopmental problems. In the last few decades preterm births increased and the survival of VPT/VLBW have improved, however this is not accompanied by increased morbidity. Although most preterm born infants do not develop major impairments, they are at higher risk to develop cerebral palsy (CP), motor and/or cognitive impairments and the risk increases with decreasing gestational age (GA) and birthweight (BW). Recent actual mortality, morbidity and neurodevelopmental outcome rates among VPT/VLBW infants is essential for family counseling and evaluation of innovative approaches to enhance outcomes.\r\nThe first part of this dissertation comprises two chapters, providing an overview of the current prevalences of neurodevelopmental impairment, globally as well as for our local population. In chapter 1, existing literature regarding the overall neurodevelopmental outcome at two years corrected age in VLB/VLBW infants born over the last decade was reviewed and reported in a meta-analytic review. In chapter 2, the neonatal mortality and neurodevelopmental outcome in a national population-based cohort was investigated. \r\n\r\nPART II of this dissertation focused on infants with perinatal stroke. Perinatal stroke might not be as common as preterm birth, it is still an important group of infants because it is know that more than quart of the children with perinatal results in neurological deficits, however the exact number varies considerably between studies. Early detection and referral of infants at risk for intervention, rather than referral children with known CP has been called for. Nonetheless, this requires careful monitoring in the first months of development and appropriate early diagnostic tools. The literature on established and experimental approaches for the treatment of upper limb function unilateral spastic CP (USCP) in older children is comprehensive, however, in young infants this remain practically unexplored, despite evidence of a critical time limit for activity-dependent plasticity to influence the corticospinal tract development during the first years of life. Given the shortage of early intervention studies, very little is known about the feasibility of such intervention programs in very young infants. \r\nPart II is composed of two chapters, describing two original research articles. In chapter 3, the neurological outcome was for each specific type of stroke lesion reported in infants with perinatal stroke as well as the predictability of two motor evaluation tools (‘General movement assessment [GMA]’ and the ‘Hand assessment for infants [HAI]’) for early detection of USCP. Lastly, in chapter 4, a study was undertaken in infants with perinatal stroke at high risk of USCP to investigate the feasibility of a parent-delivered home-based early intervention program, comparing two therapy approaches, namely ‘Constraint-induced movement therapy (baby-CIMT)’ and ‘hand–arm bimanual training (baby-HABIT)’ and to address potential obstacles for further implementation. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this dissertation provided some useful insight on the outcome of those high-risk infants as well as some newfound knowledge about early predictions tools and early intervention for infants with perinatal stroke. However, more research is needed in order to fully understand the impact of very preterm birth and perinatal stroke on the longer term and how early diagnosis and early intervention can be improved in high-risk infants.",

Over the course of development, above-average facility in single-word reading and spelling and below-average skills in mechanical arithmetic are evident. Extreme difficulties in dealing with novel and otherwise complex material are especially apparent. Automatic, rote language skills become increasingly well developed and socio-emotional disturbances of the internalized variety become increasingly more apparent with advancing years. These and other developmental manisfestations of the NLD syndrome are examined within the context of several types of neurological disease/developmental disabilities, including cranio-cerebral trauma, hydrocephalus, and autism, and are related to a developmental model (Rourke, 1987) designed to encompass these manifestations.",

Presentación del caso: paciente con cuadro clínico que inicia a los 65 años, con disminución en la interacción social. Un par de meses después, la esposa nota que el lenguaje del paciente se torna poco fluido, habla con palabras o frases cortas, no logra decir oraciones completas, además de presentar cambios en la entonación de las palabras y alteraciones del lenguaje escrito. El paciente manifiesta que su principal limitación en el momento es el no poder expresar lo que quiere decir, y por este motivo consulta. Discusión: en el caso de este paciente, se describe inicialmente un cambio en su personalidad que no compromete su funcionalidad, sin embargo, al poco tiempo se presenta compromiso del lenguaje como síntoma prominente y que genera mayor compromiso en su calidad de vida, con pruebas neuropsicológicas y hallazgos de neuroimagen que apoyan el diagnóstico de afasia primaria progresiva (APP) variante no fluente o agramatical, con síntomas comportamentales y motores asociados. Conclusión: las APP son un grupo de trastornos neurocognitivos cuya característica primordial es el compromiso en el lenguaje, cada variante de APP tiene unas características clínicas y criterios diagnósticos específicos que se deben conocer para lograr sospechar el diagnóstico y hacer un abordaje apropiado en el paciente.",

      "abstract": "Definitions Developmental dyslexia, also known as specific reading disability, is an unexpected difficulty in learning to read that occurs in the otherwise normal child. Rudel1 suggests it be defined by both exclusionary and inclusionary criteria. Her strict definition requires that five criteria be met: 1) The child must have no major neurologic abnormalities, such as overt cerebral palsy. Affected children may and often do have \"soft\" signs on neurologic examination, however. 2) The major sensory functions must be normal; the child cannot be blind or deaf. Practically speaking, children who are blind or deaf or who have cerebral palsy may be dyslexic if they have reading difficulties disproportionate to their other academic and intellectual abilities. 3) The child should have no major psychiatric problems. Problems with self-esteem are often, however, a reactive secondary issue in the child who has a learning disability. 4) Normal intelligence is required, using either a verbal or nonverbal measure. Children who have dyslexia often also have language problems. Hence, verbal intelligence scores may not reflect overall intellectual abilities accurately. 5) Finally, the dyslexic child must have been in a social and educational environment conducive to learning to read. Several studies of inner-city school children have demonstrated that enrichment programs help some nonreaders become readers, demonstrating the importance of teaching techniques.",

      "abstract": "Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is an heterogeneous disorder characterized by an inadequate development that cannot be explained by an auditory sensory defect, a motor-neurological defect, a general cognitive impairment nor an unwillingness to communicate. There are many subtypes of SLI, both in severity and type that may be associated with a different outcome. Although many of these children recover clinically, the majority will maintain minor language impairments leading to a poor school achievement and learning difficulties. A proportion of cases remain severely impaired causing social isolation and an occupations/professional handicap. The origin of these syndromes is probably genetic. Although the are assumed to reflect a dysfunctional of the neuronal networks subserving the comprehension,, elaboration and production of language, they are not due to evident focal brain lesions, but are associated with atypical patterns of cerebral dominance and specialization for language. A variety of language processing impairments have been described in these children, namely a difficulty in analyzing rapidly changing speech sounds, acquiring language morphology and grammar and a poor phonological memory. Therapeutic intervention in these children must be individualized and interdisciplinary (speech therapy, alternative forms of communication, psychological support and special education). This is essential to prevent social isolation, low self-esteem, emotional and behavioral symptoms and educational problems.Â DOI:Â http://dx.doi.org/10.17575/rpsicol.v16i1.467",

      "title": "Developmental Dyslexia: An Update",
      "abstract": "Definitions Developmental dyslexia, also known as specific reading disability, is an unexpected difficulty in learning to read that occurs in the otherwise normal child. Rudel1 suggests it be defined by both exclusionary and inclusionary criteria. Her strict definition requires that five criteria be met: 1) The child must have no major neurologic abnormalities, such as overt cerebral palsy. Affected children may and often do have soft signs on neurologic examination, however. 2) The major sensory functions must be normal; the child cannot be blind or deaf. Practically speaking, children who are blind or deaf or who have cerebral palsy may be dyslexic if they have reading difficulties disproportionate to their other academic and intellectual abilities. 3) The child should have no major psychiatric problems. Problems with self-esteem are often, however, a reactive secondary issue in the child who has a learning disability. 4) Normal intelligence is required, using either a verbal or nonverbal measure. Children who have dyslexia often also have language problems. Hence, verbal intelligence scores may not reflect overall intellectual abilities accurately. 5) Finally, the dyslexic child must have been in a social and educational environment conducive to learning to read. Several studies of inner-city school children have demonstrated that enrichment programs help some nonreaders become readers, demonstrating the importance of teaching techniques.",

The diagnosis in made when language development is out of keeping with other aspects of development, and possible explanatory causes have been excluded.During the last years neurosciences have approached to the study of SLI. The ability to process two or more rapidly presented, successive, auditory stimuli is believed to underlie successful language acquisition. It has been proposed that SLI is the consequence of low-level abnormalities in auditory perception. Too, children with SLI show a specific deficit in automatic discrimination of syllables. Electrophysiological methods may reveal underlying immaturity or other abnormality of auditory processing even when behavioural thresholds look normal.There is much controversy about the role of such deficits in causing their language problems, and it has been difficult to establish solid, replicable findings in this area because of the heterogeneity in the population and because insufficient attention has been paid to maturational aspects of auditory processing.",

Phoneme, grapheme, word, reading, writing, understanding and expressions and gestures are part of our language ...\r\nA person can only speak one language (the first or mother toung), or one can speak several languages. Other language can be learned in childhood or later on in adulthood. The degree of knowledge of two languages varies from person to person and can be improved with learning and proper use. Mother tongue and second language can be improved over time, but can also recede if it not used. Various diseases can also have an affect on use of already known languages.\r\nAmong the most common is considered aphasia. This is a problem caused by the failure of certain areas in the brain or due to defect of the central nervous system. For the most part aphasia occures as a result of stroke and tumors, or brain damage, such as a blow to the head. Aphasia is constrained to the already developed spoken language. In aphasias are characterized in particular the problem of the flow of speech. Problems with words are common in aphasias … Severity and scope of the aphasia depends on the location and severity of brain injury, transitional language skills and personality of the individual. No two people with aphasia are identical, aphasia is different for everyone. In the theoretical part I focused on four main areas, namely: Neurology, Neurolinguistics, Aphasia and Slovenian-Italian and Italian-Slovenian bilingualism. Relating to the chosen theme I used empirical test for aphasia in bilingual persons (Bilingual Aphasia Test - BAT). I wanted to determine the suitability of the test according to gender, age and education, and to check whether the Broca's aphasia is determined linguistic areas to better respond in first language or in second language. I tested 10 bilingual persons aged 55 to 80 with damage in Broca's area living in a bilingual area of the Slovenian coast, who have had neurological impairment. Although The results we got confirmed that gender, first language and language of the environment does not affect the results of BAT test, we discovored that age and language of the education do have an influence on the results of BAT test.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objective Developmental Discoordination Disorder (DCD) is an often overlooked and seldom diagnosed neurodevelopmental condition marked by impairments in motor skills. Lacking identifiable medical or neurological etiology, children with DCD often have preserved intellectual abilities. Comorbidity is common, including ADHD and specific learning disability. Despite extensive evidence of significant impact on daily activities and academics due to differences in motor behaviors, DCD difficulties are regularly treated as behavioral problems. Method Neuropsychological evaluation of an 8-year-old boy with a possible reading delay and inability to perform some age-appropriate academic and self-care tasks. Results Average overall ability with very strong verbal performances; intact visual perceptual processing, memory, and non-written language. Academics are within expected range, although graphomotor weakness impacted academic performances on tasks with written demands. Patient appeared clumsy and awkward with low muscle tone, poor balance, and difficulty learning new motor skills. Impaired fine motor control, handwriting, gait, gross motor skills, motor planning, coordination, and oromotor weakness as well as inferior verbal language abilities were evident. Impulsivity, inattention, poor planning, and poor self-monitoring were also evident. Conclusions DCD is evidenced by impairment in fine and gross motor skills, oromotor skills, motor planning, energy, and coordination with clear discrepancy between motor abilities and abilities in other areas, specifically language. In our case, DCD features were overlooked despite wide ranging impact. ADHD and SLD with impairment in written expression were concurrent. This case highlights the need for greater appreciation of DCD so that children can benefit from early detection and intervention considering the life-long implications of the disorder.",

There are impairments in the stage at which somewhat abstract entities, phonemes, are assembled, ordered, and stored prior to production. Then, there are impairments that affect the timing and coordination of those actions necessary for speech. Within one of these two broad classes, it has been possible to distinguish two further subtypes of deficit implicating different types of phonological processing or transcoding. It seems almost certain that dissociations will also be documented in the case of kinetic deficits and phonemic ones. The two major patterns of deficit affecting the phonemic and kinetic levels of speech production are differentiated from the dysarthric disorders. In dysarthria, the muscles involved in speech production are affected by paralysis, weakness, or involuntary movements. The dysarthrias are not specific speech-production deficits but are primary motor impairments affecting musculature. They can be considered as being similar in some respects to the effects of a hemiparesis or hemisensory loss on the patient's ability to use a limb. Therefore, dysarthric patients have difficulties with all tasks for which the affected set of muscles are required.",

The disorder is characterized by gradual or rapid loss of language in a previously normal child. Acquired epileptic aphasia (AEA) typically develops in healthy children who acutely or progressively lose receptive and expressive language ability coincident with the appearance of paroxysmal electroencephalographs (EEG) changes. In most cases described in detail, a clearly normal period of motor and language development occurs before acquired epileptic aphasia symptoms appear. Because this syndrome appears during such a critical period of language acquisition in a child’s life, speech production may be affected just as severely as language comprehension. The onset of LKS is typically between 18 months and 13 years. The prevalence of clinical seizures in acquired epileptic aphasia (LKS) is 70-85%. The syndrome can be difficult to diagnose and may be misdiagnosed as autism, pervasive developmental disorder, hearing impairment, learning disability, auditory/ verbal processing disorder, attention deficit disorder, intellectual disability, childhood schizophrenia, or emotional/behavioural problems.

A textbook knowledge of the physiology and pathology of hearing does not prepare the clinician to cope with a hearing-impaired family member, friend, or colleague, with whom we feel embarrassed, lest our raised voices attract too much attention. We are even less prepared to evaluate or treat hearing-impaired persons in the course of our professional activities. Yet hearing impairment is common, and the profoundly deaf probably suffer mental disorders at a rate in excess of that of their hearing peers. Profound deafness, the absence of functional or remediable hearing, is extremely disabling. Profound deafness that occurs prior to complete acquisition of verbal language is socially and psychiatrically devastating. , · Such deafness, also known as prelingual deafness, is believed to result in uneven, incomplete, or arrested personality developmentl· 4 and behavioral disturbances, S the understanding of which is complicated by the natural language barrier.

      "abstract": "There has been recently an increase in the number of children diagnosed with delayed speech development. There is delay compensation with age, but mild deficiency often remains for life. Delayed speech development is more common in boys than in girls. Its etiology is unknown in most cases, so a child should be followed up to make an accurate diagnosis. Genetic predisposition or environmental factors frequently influence speech development. The course of its delays is various. In the history of a number of disorders (childhood disintegrative disorder, Landau–Kleffner syndrome), there is evidence for the normal development of speech to a certain period and then stops or even regresses. By way of comparison, there are generally speech developmental changes in autism even during the preverbal stage (a complex of revival fails to form; babbling is poor, low emotional, gibberish; at the same time, the baby recipes whole phrases without using them to communicate). These speech disorders are considered not only as a delay, but also as a developmental abnormality. Speech disorders in children should be diagnosed as early as possible in order to initiative corrective measures in time. In this case, a physician makes a diagnosis and a special education teacher does corrective work. The successful collaboration and mutual understanding of the specialists in these areas will determine quality of life for a child in the future. This paper focusses on the terminology and classification of delays, which are necessary for physicians and teachers to speak the same language.",

Dysarthria is a disorder that occurs as a result of a brain condition that often makes it very difficult to articulate sounds and pronounce words, leading to impairments in the intelligibility, audibility, naturalness and efficiency of vocal communication. There are many potential causes of dysarthria. These include toxic, metabolic, degenerative diseases, traumatic brain injury, or thrombotic or embolic stroke. Central or peripheral neurological lesions can lead to paralysis or a lack of coordination of the verbo-motor system, producing severe speech disorders, which in turn prevent control over the tongue, throat, lips or lungs; for example, swallowing (dysphagia) and mastication problems. Dysarthria is different from verbal apraxia, it does not include speech disorders generated by structural anomalies (malformations). The symptomatology is very diverse, depending on the intensity of the neuronal damage, which is correlated with the etiology, which includes toxic, metabolic, degenerative diseases, traumatic brain injuries or thrombotic or embolic stroke.

      "abstract": "Auditory perception or hearing can be defined as the interpretation of sensory evidence, produced by the ears in response to sound, in terms of the events that caused the sound. We do not hear a window but we may hear a window closing. We do not hear a dog but we may hear a dog barking. And we do not hear a person but we may hear a person talking. Hearing impairment can result in anxiety or stress in everyday life. Pure-tone hearing loss (or threshold shift) is a measure of hearing impairment. Aging and excessive noise are the main causes of hearing impairment. Speech perception is another concept. The difference with the former is best illustrated by the disabled individual declaring \"I can hear that someone is talking to me, but I don't understand what she says\". Being unable to understand easily and clearly significant others, especially in understanding speech in a noisy environment, can give rise to considerable psychosocial and professional consequences (disability). Presbycusis is the decline in hearing sensitivity caused by the aging process at different levels of the auditory system. However, it is difficult to isolate age effects from other contributors to age-related hearing loss such as noise damage, genetic susceptibility, inflammatory otologic disorders, and ototoxic agents. Therefore, presbycusis and age-related hearing loss are often used synonymously. In this report pathophysiology is mostly described with regard to presbycusis, and the main peripheral types of presbycusis (sensory or Corti organ-related, strial, and neural) are summarized. An original experimental model of strial presbycusis, based on chronic application of furosemide at the round window, is further described. Central presbycusis is mainly determined by degeneration secondary to peripheral impairment (concept of deafferentation). Central auditory changes typically affect speed of processing and result in poorer speech understanding in noise or with rapid or degraded speech. Last, age-related cognitive factors can be associated to peripheral hearing impairment and increase disability in speech understanding in noise.",

      "abstract": "The human voice undergoes changes over the life span associated with normal development and aging and/or pathological changes in subsystems responsible for voice and speech production (respiration, phonation and articulation). Each change does not immediately indicate presence of the voice disorder. Vocal aging generally begins after the age of approximately 65 years as part of a normal physiological aging. Voice disorders in elderly can be result of the aging process itself or may be caused by some kind of illness or pathological process. Presbyphonia is a term used to describe changes in vocal quality associated with aging process, and presbylarynx is a condition in which age-related changes of the larynx results in presbyphonia. These diagnoses can be made only after careful multidisciplinary examination and exclusion of other pathological changes and possible causes of voice disorder. Some of the symptoms of presbyphonia are changes in vocal pitch, reduced loudness, increased breathiness and hoarsness, weakness of the voice, vocal tremor, inability to sustain phonation and reduced vocal quality. The impact of voice disorders in elderly has been shown to cut across a number of quality-of-life domains such as social interaction, general and emotional health, and psychological well-being. The number of people above the age of 65 is increasing rapidly worldwide and the issue of recognizing and treating voice disorders in this population is becoming increasingly important. Therapy of presbyphonia must be multidisciplinary. Vocal therapy is considered as first method of choice and its efficiency is proven by current researches. Surgical approaches are used if vocal therapy is not showing expected results.\r\nGoal of this review is to present basic information about aging and normal biological changes in the human body caused by the aging process and to show how this changes affect voice quality in the elderly. Furthermore, prevalence and incidence, definition and causes of voice disorders in elderly are shown by presenting results of the recent researches. This paper also describes diagnostic procedures and current treatments for voice disorders in elderly and addresses its efficiency.",

      "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by delays in communication skills, impairments in social interaction, and repetitive or restrictive behavior patterns and interests. This chapter describes the progression of ASD across the lifespan and how it differs from other neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability and communication disorders. Children with ASD demonstrate early deviations from standard social development that persist across their lifespan. Nonverbal communicative behaviors such as eye gaze, imitation, and joint attention are regarded as foundational skills for the later development of more complex social behavior. The DSM-5 provides five additional specifiers that allow for the clustering of homogeneous subgroups. These five specifiers include: with or without accompanying intellectual impairment; with or without accompanying language impairment; associated with a known medical or genetic condition or environmental factor; associated with another neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral disorder; and with catatonia.",

Since early and intensive behavioral intervention is essential in the successful treatment of these disorders, early diagnosis is particularly crucial. The diagnosis of ASD is a multistep process, beginning with screening and followed by more comprehensive assessments (2). This full evaluation is necessary in order to rule out other disorders (such as verbal and nonverbal learning disabilities or organic brain disorder), and to guide treatment and educational planning. Full evaluations include, in addition to diagnosis, cognitive assessment, adaptive functioning assessment, and neuropsychological testing (e.g., memory, problem solving, planning, language, and visual-spatial reasoning).",

      "abstract": "The acquired aphasia in children is a rarely seen speech and language disorders. Disturbances develop after the child has already achieved the capacity for language comprehension and verbal expression. Brain trauma is most often the cause. The clinical picture of the disorder varies over different age groups and, in contrast to adults, shows no consistent typology. In most of the cases there exists a disturbance of speech production; problems with writing and comprehension are seen less often (although comprehension of language is primarily affected in the Landau-Kleffner syndrome). Only once and a while logorrhoea and jargon can be diagnosed. Besides the speech and language disorders cognitive, motor und emotional problems may appear. Therefore, several diagnostic levels have to be considered (e.g. clinical neurology, neuropsychology, psychophysiology, psychopathology). Course and prognosis of the acquired aphasia in childhood (30 % longterm difficulties) depend on several factors like etiology and extension of the lesion, the development of the functional hemispheric dominance for language and the initial recovery velocity after the symptoms appeared. The plasticity of the child's brain is a source for compensating mechanisms which might be triggered by three aspects of therapeutic activities which should be used synchronously: (a) speech and language training, (b) principles of psychotherapy and social medicine and (c) treatment of additional disorders.",

      "title": "Does Your Patient Have a Psychiatric Illness or Nonverbal Learning Disorder? Clinical Clues Help Differentiate Overlapping Symptoms and Syndromes",
      "abstract": "Patients who present with impairment in academic, cognitive, social, and vocational functioning might be struggling with an unrecognized learning disorder. Ten percent of the US population has some form of learning disability, and up to 40% of those with learning disorders may meet diagnostic criteria for a psychiatric disorder. (1), (2) Some learning disorders affect a person's ability to read, write, or do math, whereas less - recognized nonverbal learning disorder (NLD) impacts the social and emotional functioning of children, adolescents, and adults. Common features of NLD include: * deficits in nonlinguistic information processing * speech prosody deficits * difficulty reading facial expressions * associated impairment in interpersonal functioning. The severity of these deficits varies among individuals with NLD. Patients may experience chronic low self-esteem, anxiety, and mood symptoms because of their limited ability to express their feelings within an appropriate social context. NLD may be first misdiagnosed as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder (BD), or Asperger's disorder. In this article we review the underlying neurophysiology of NLD and present a clinical approach to these patients, including the differential diagnosis and factors that will allow clinicians to distinguish NLD from psychiatric conditions with symptomatic and syndromic overlap. We also describe treatment for patients with NLD. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Table 1 Clinical manifestation of nonverbal learning disorder Tactile - perceptual deficits and psychomotor coordination deficiencies, usually more marked on the left side Visual - spatial organization deficits Deficiencies in nonverbal problem solving, such as hypothesis testing and understanding cause - effect relationships Difficulty adapting to novel situations and reliance on rote behaviors Relative deficiencies in mechanical arithmetic with proficiencies in reading, word recognition, and spelling Well developed rote verbal - memory skills Verbosity characterized by poor pragmatics Deficits in social perception, judgment, and interaction source: reference 7 The learning process Learning is a cognitive process of acquiring and processing information and experiences from the environment that allows us to acquire knowledge, skills, and social abilities. When we learn how to relate to others, we undergo neurophysiology changes that subsequently influence behavior and the way we understand our environment. Deficits in learning processes or the ability to acquire relational skills result in impaired affect regulation in regard to others and may lead to low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, interpersonal conflict, and anger toward others. Learning influences a person's ability to navigate social relationships and perform academically and occupationally. The impact of learning deficits may be magnified in adulthood after an individual has suffered years of insecurities and poor self-esteem. Adults with learning disabilities often seek psychiatric treatment as a result of their disappointment about difficulties in relationships and work. NLD may coexist with or mimic other neuropsychiatric disorders. For example, problematic behavior within a family or at the workplace I is a common reason for referral to a psychiatrist. These behaviors may be influenced by a patient's NLD symptoms, which can complicate diagnosis and treatment. Persons with NLD are at increased risk for depression because of failures in coping, loss of self-esteem, internalized psychopathology, and other social and emotional strains. In addition, individuals with NLD may experience multiple psychosocial impairments, including difficulty maintaining employment, achieving goals, and maintaining relationships. …",

Their specifics in communication and interaction often make it difficult to interact with them, learn, work, and other activities.\r\n Autism spectrum disorder involves different forms of autism as well as differences in providing the level of support they need to function. Despite the large differences within the spectrum, there are some characteristics that connect them. Difficulties in communication (verbal and nonverbal), socialization (reduced desire to contact people, inappropriate relationships with others, lack of understanding of the way people cooperate with each other, communicate), and the existence of some repetitive actions or narrowed and specific interests or fixations are specific symptoms present. These symptoms are more or less present in all children and adults with autism spectrum disorder.

Aphasia is the most prominent language disorder which is acquired in adulthood. Typically, it is caused by damage to the language centres in the left hemisphere of the brain following a cerebrovascular accident or stroke. Less common causes of aphasia are traumatic brain injury, brain tumours and cerebral infections. In rare cases, aphasia may result from damage to the right hemisphere of the brain. Aphasias are classified as fluent and non-fluent types. In fluent aphasia, there is effortless spoken output which exhibits the normal suprasegmental features of speech. However, this output often contains copious amounts of jargon (hence, the term ‘jargon aphasia’) in which neologisms are present. The client with fluent aphasia also has a severe auditory comprehension deficit and displays limited awareness of their communication problems. In non-fluent aphasia, there is reduced, effortful spoken output. The client is aware of, and is often distressed by, their problems with spoken language. Grammatical structure is markedly reduced with content words (e.g. nouns) retained, while function words (e.g. articles) are omitted. This gives speech the appearance of a telegram (hence, the use of the term ‘agrammatic aphasia’ to describe this type of aphasia).",

It is present congenitally in about 1 per cent of all persons. It is characterized by a disproportion between the intellectual development of the child and its reading ability, which is affected in varying degree. There may appear a total lack of comprehension of the reading matter. The subject frequently reverses the order of letters or words or may fail to understand certain words. These difficulties may be more pronounced when the child is trying to read fast. Such children are often misunderstood by their teachers, being looked on as obstinate or inattentive. Acquired dyslexia (alexia, verbal visual agnosia) is also made manifest by the inability of the patient to understand written or printed language, even though the",

Conditions such as schizophrenia have adverse implications for language and communication. Specific linguistic features include a reduction in the amount of spoken output (poverty of speech) and a reduction in the amount of content expressed through speech (poverty of content of speech). Clients with schizophrenia may also make bizarre and irrelevant contributions to a conversational exchange, interpret non-literal and figurative language in a literal way, and fail to observe linguistic politeness in their interactions with others. Alongside marked deficits in pragmatics and discourse, impairments in syntax and semantics are also commonly observed. For example, clients with schizophrenia produce syntactic gaps, e.g. ‘he was blamed for and I didn't think that was fair’ (Chaika and Alexander, 1986). Clients with bipolar disorder exhibit some of these same linguistic features (e.g. tangentiality). However, they can also display linguistic behaviours which are rarely seen in clients with schizophrenia (e.g. pressured speech).",

      "title": "Comparison of cognitive failures in addicts and non addicts",
      "abstract": "Cognition is one of the interesting areas of research in addiction field. There are many studies that attempt to explore the relationship between cognitive abilities and addiction. The relationship between cognitive failures and clinical and social outcomes in patients and addicts has been mentioned in many studies. It seems that cognitive impairment is one of the strong predictor of social dysfunction in addicted people. Cognitive failures are defined as inabilities to successfully perform tasks that one might typically be able to do on a daily basis. Some examples include forgetting appointments, leaving mail unanswered for days, failure to notice street signs, and having to reread passages of text. Such failures in everyday activities are due to underlying problems in general cognitive functions related to distractibility and memory. In general, cognitive failures include failures in perception, memory, and motor functioning, in which the action does not match the intention. Thus, cognitive failures include numerous types of execution lapses: lapses in attention (i.e., failure in perception), memory (i.e., failures related to information retrieval), and motor function (i.e., the performance of unintended actions, or action slips). While cognitive failures occur frequently and many do not produce any serious consequences, some - under specific circumstances - will result in unpleasant consequences, for example, accident. The goal of this study was to compare the cognitive component failure in addicted and non-addicted people. This study was causal-comparative. 45 addicted people (70%male), who have at least five years addiction history, selected from different counseling centers in Kerman, and were matched in terms of age, sex, and education level with 45 non-addicted people. After obtaining participants' consent, the cognitive failures questionnaire (CFQ) was completed by all two groups. MANOVA was used for the data analysis. The results showed that cognitive failures components, including distraction, failure of memory, oversight and forgetfulness of addicted people are significantly higher than non-addicted people. This study was conducted to compare cognitive failures in addicted and non-addicted people. The components of the cognitive failures in addicts and normal individuals were significantly different, which is probably a result of drug abuse. Not only these cognitive failures might be effective in drug abuse, but it seems they prevent from leaving addiction. Thus, correcting these failures may be helpful in treatment and prevention of recurrent addiction. Further research is needed to investigate the effect of this correcting on addiction.",

Second, a review of some neurological aspects was done about aphasia, minimal brain damage, infantile autism, psychomotor epilepsy, stuttering and mental retardation. These terms were summarized as follows.Apasia indicates neurological conditions that significantly interfere with the learning of speech. Readig disability means the difficulty attaching sound and meaning to written words. Minimal brain damage shows the deficit of attension and perception as to language. The characteristic of infantile autism is minimal use of meaningful speech in spite of good intelligence. Psychomotor epilepsy shows frequent alternation of language function during the seizure. Stuttering means speech dysfluency. Mental retardation is chracterized by delayed and incomplete development of language function.The brain of young child is a rapidly changing system. So the patterns of brain injury observed in children are often different from those observed in adults. That is why the evaluation of certain brain lesions in children must be considered from the point of“learning process”not“already organized function”.",

El diagnostico se establece cuando el desarrollo del lenguaje no sigue la pauta de los demas aspectos del desarrollo, y han quedado excluidas otras posibles causas. Desarrollo. Durante los ultimos anos, las neurociencias se han aproximado al estudio del TEL. Se cree que la clave para una adquisicion correcta del lenguaje es la capacidad de procesar dos o mas estimulos auditivos que se presentan en una sucesion rapida. Una hipotesis que se ha planteado es que el TEL es una consecuencia de unas anomalias de bajo nivel en la percepcion auditiva. Ademas, los ninos con TEL manifiestan un deficit especifico en la discriminacion automatica de las silabas. Es posible que los metodos electrofisiologicos revelen una inmadurez u otra anomalia subyacente del procesamiento auditivo, incluso cuando los umbrales conductuales parecen normales. Conclusiones. Hay mucha polemica sobre el papel de dichos deficit en la etiologia de las dificultades linguisticas, y ha sido dificil establecer unos resultados consistentes y repetibles en esta area debido a la heterogeneidad de la poblacion y tambien porque no se ha prestado suficiente atencion a los aspectos relacionados con la maduracion del procesamiento auditivo.",

      "abstract": "The article provides an overview of modern literature on the risk factors for the development of speech and language, which can be taken into account by pediatricians when forming a high-risk group of the corresponding contingent of preschool children. The leading risk factor for the development of speech/language disorders in children is childhood developmental brain disorders that arose in the prenatal, intrapartum and postnatal period of a child's life, which is often found in children with cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and after head injuries. The occurrence of disorders is greatly influenced by anatomical defects in the speech apparatus, requiring timely surgical correction, and hearing loss. Impairment or absence of speech/language in children is common causes for visiting a psychiatrist, which is observed in autistic spectrum disorders (including autism), elective mutism, mental retardation, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Many genetic factors which are often found in patients with other hereditary diseases (chromosome disorders, monogenic hereditary diseases, inherited metabolic diseases, genetic speech disorders) play a special role in the development of speech/language and are associated with developmental disorders, intellectual disability and behavioral deviations. Finally, social factors such as socioeconomic status and social structure of the family, family conflict, pedagogical neglect, child abuse and prolonged use of modern digital devices throughout the day contribute to speech/language development disorders in preschool children. Analysis of the causes of speech/language pathology is of great practical importance for improving the management strategy aimed at preventing the manifestation of the disorders in children.",

Unmada is classified into five (vataja, pittaja, kaphaja, sannipataja and agantuja) types, and \"Vataja Unmada\" (VU) is one among them. The description of VU is available in all major Ayurvedic classical texts, and it comes under \"Doshaja\" (psychiatric disorder which occurs due to the aggravation of doshas) category. Studies or scientific literature on VU has been lacking, and the present work is focused on to explore this condition. The etiopathology of VU denotes deficiency of various nutritional factors such as vitamins, minerals, omega-3-fatty acids, amino acids, and antioxidants. Lacking or deficiency of these nutritional factors leads to structural and/or functional damage and degeneration of the brain (neurodegenerative or demyelinating pathology) which ultimately leads to the manifestation of different degenerative psychiatric disorders. The clinical picture of VU resembles various psychiatric or neuropsychiatric conditions such as \"disorganized schizophrenia\" or \"hebephrenia\" or \"catatonia\" or \"dementia\" or \"bipolar disorder with psychotic features\" or \"mania with psychotic features,\" or \"organic or secondary psychoses.\" VU is a treatable condition, and it can be managed successfully by \"Panchakarma\" procedures along with internal medicines.",

In essence, aspects of psychobiological functioning that should be associated, coordinated, and/or linked are not… Dissociative symptoms are characterized by (a) unbidden and unpleasant intrusions into awareness and behavior, with accompanying losses of continuity in subjective experience: (i.e., ‘positive’ dissociative symptoms); and/or (b) an inability to access information or to control mental functions that normally are readily amenable to access or control: (i.e., ‘negative’ dissociative symptoms’)”.",

Developmental issues1) History of injury at birth may contribute to development of schizophrenia2) Season of birth: more schizophrenics are born in early spring or winter10. Neurochemical considerations a. Dopamine hypothesis: excess of dopamine linked topsychotic symptoms 1) Dopamine-blocking drugs seemed to lessen psychoticsymptoms (antipsychotics) 2) Drugs stimulating dopamine release caused psychoticsymptoms (amphetamine, cocaine) 3) Five types of dopamine receptors: D1, D2, D3, D4,D5 a) D1: located in cerebral cortex and basal ganglia b) D2: located in striatum c) D3 and D4: high concentration in the limbicsystem d) D5: located in thalamus, hippocampus, andhypothalamus 4) Hyperactivity of dopamine system (especially D2receptor): thought important to positive symptoms of schizophreniab. Postmortem findings in schizophrenics 1) Increased dopamine or homovanillic acid in limbicareas and left amygdala (may be consequence of treatment with antipsychotics)c.

      "abstract": "The four main requirements for oral-motor development are stability and mobility of the ingestive system, rhythmicity, sensation, oral-motor efficiency and economy. Ingestion can be divided into oral, pharyngeal and esophageal stages. The main categories of pathology encountered in our swallowing and dysphagia clinic are encephalopathies (including cerebral palsy), genetic disorders (including chromosomal aberrations), syndromes associated with swallowing difficulty (e.g. Rett, Dandy-Walker, DiGeorge), head injuries, brain tumors, developmental delay and the oral deprivation syndrome (e.g. due to prolonged tube feeding on a preterm infant). The behavioral expression of the many different pathologies falls into three categories: (1) resistance to accepting food orally; (2) lack of energy and endurance to do the 'work' of eating; and (3) oral-motor disabilities resulting in an inability to produce the necessary motor skills for ingestion. Expect expression and exacerbation of feeding problems during periods of most active growth, i.e. from birth to 2 years and during the adolescent growth spurt. Identify the source of the feeding problem. Establish its pathology and note the clinical manifestations. Determine if the problem has a strictly physiologic origin or whether it may be exacerbated by the feeding interaction between child and feeder. Determine what diagnostic tests are needed and refer child for testing Formulate the treatment approach based on clinical observations and results of diagnostic tests. Teach and monitor treatment which can be given by caregivers. Set time limits for treatment and clearly state expected results. Evaluate progress by comparing outcome to stated treatment objectives. Refer children with more severe problems to a multidisciplinary treatment team.",

      "abstract": "Swallowing is a sensorimotor activity by which food, liquids, and saliva pass from the oral cavity to the stomach. It is considered one of the most complex sensorimotor functions because of the high level of coordination needed to accomplish the swallowing task over a very short period of 1-2s and the multiple subsystems it involves. Dysphagia (i.e., swallowing difficulties) refers to any swallowing disorder and is commonly caused by a variety of neurological conditions (e.g., stroke, cerebral palsy, Parkinson disease), head and neck cancer and its treatment, genetic syndromes, and iatrogenic conditions or trauma. The signs and symptoms of dysphagia range from anterior loss of food while eating, difficulty chewing, and subjective difficulty swallowing food or liquids to choking or coughing before, during, or after eating because of impaired clearance of swallowed material from the throat into the digestive system. When not effectively treated, dysphagia can cause malnutrition, dehydration, immune system failure, psychosocial degradation, and generally decreased quality of life.",

Aphasia, which is usually caused by a focal lesion, can affect spoken and written language, auditory comprehension, and reading ability but by itself does not affect intellectual and cognitive abilities. A cognitive-communicative impairment is related to underlying cognitive deficits in memory, attention, or visual perception and is seen with traumatic brain injury and nontreatable dementia. Voice and speech impairments such as dysarthria and apraxia of speech may lead to self-imposed social isolation and depression. Dysphagia may accompany a communication disorder or exist independently.

      "abstract": "Abstract Stammering (or stuttering) may be defined as an impairment of continuous utterance. Developmental stammering, regardless of country or language, affects one per cent of adult populations. Exacerbation by the stress of adult conversation or public speaking contrasts sharply with normal flow during singing, acting or conversation with children. Alterations in regional cerebral blood flow suggest that there are underlying differences in sensorimotor function in developmental stammerers whose symptoms commonly appear during the period of intensive language acquisition around the third and fourth year. Emotional tensions may exacerbate the disturbance, but equally psychological growth is adversely affected by the handicap. Abnormal motor control is confirmed by the exaggerated activity in the right hemisphere. The normal sequence of articulatory programming and motor preparation for single word reading is reversed. Absence of activation over the left auditory cortex supports the notion of impaired or diminished auditory feedback in the self-monitoring of speech seen in normal brains. Subcortical abnormalities are a feature of both developmental and acquired stammering.",

The four children described here presented with a developmental behavioral triad: 1) atypically speedy motor development, 2) impaired expressive speech, and 3) tongue carriage dysfunction resulting in related misarticulations. Those characteristics might be phenotypically or genetically clustered. These children didn’t have impaired cognition, neurological or mental disease, defective sense organs, craniofacial dysmorphology or susceptibility to upper respiratory infections, particularly recurrent otitis media. Attention should be paid on discordant and unbalanced achievement of developmental milestones. Present children are termed SPEEDY babies, where SPEEDY refers to rapid independent walking, SPEE and DY to dyspractic or dysfunctional speech development and lingual dysfunction resulting in linguoalveolar misarticulations. SPEEDY babies require health care that recognizes and respects their motor skills and supports their needs for motor activities and on the other hand include treatment for impaired speech. The parents may need advice and support with these children. Keywords: speedy walking, speech disorder, misarticulations",

Disorders of speech movements may be manifest as the only problem in communication or they may occur with impairments in language function. For this reason, and as a matter of scientific and clinical convenience, speech and language typically are considered to be products of distinct nervous system operations. On the one hand, speech can be viewed as the process whereby controlled movements are transformed into sound, thus providing the medium through which semantically significant messages are transmitted.

In both conditions, complex mental and physical health problems, as well as social issues, are common and are associated with communication difficulties that can result in maladaptive behavioural patterns (often referred to as ‘behaviour that challenges’). Ideally, all people presenting with behaviour that challenges should be assessed by a specialist multidisciplinary team (comprising psychiatrists, psychologists, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists) to develop an understanding of the behaviour and an appropriate support plan with tailored treatment strategies and specialist follow-up.2 Non-pharmacological interventions for challenging behaviour, such as positive behavioural support or cognitive–behavioural therapy and manipulation of environmental triggers, are preferred to psychotropic medication. However, antipsychotic medication is often prescribed to adults with ID and/or autism to manage behaviour that challenges in the absence of severe mental illness, despite there being little research evidence that antipsychotics are effective in this context.3 \n\nThere …",

To review the research to date on NLD, and to discuss whether the term 'procedural learning disorder' (PLD) would be more suitable to refer to NLD.A considerable amount of research suggests a neurological correlate of PLD with dysfunctions in the 'posterior' attention system, or the right hemisphere, or the cerebellum. Even if it is said to be difficult the delimitation between NLD and other disorders or syndromes like Asperger syndrome, certain characteristics contribute to differential diagnosis. Intervention strategies for the PLD must lead to the development of motor automatisms and problem solving strategies, including social skills.The basic dysfunction in NLD affects to implicit learning of routines, automating of motor skills and cognitive strategies that spare conscious resources in daily behaviours. These limitations are partly due to a dysfunction in non-declarative procedural memory. Various dimensions of language are also involved: context comprehension, processing of the spatial and emotional indicators of verbal language, language inferences, prosody, organization of the inner speech, use of language and non-verbal communication; this is why the diagnostic label 'PLD' would be more appropriate, avoiding the euphemistic adjective 'non-verbal'.",

      "title": "Down syndrome: Cognitive and behavioral functioning across the lifespan",
      "abstract": "Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) commonly possess unique neurocognitive and neurobehavioral profiles that emerge within specific developmental periods. These profiles are distinct relative to others with similar intellectual disability (ID) and reflect underlying neuroanatomic findings, providing support for a distinctive phenotypic profile. This review updates what is known about the cognitive and behavioral phenotypes associated with DS across the lifespan. In early childhood, mild deviations from neurotypically developing trajectories emerge. By school‐age, delays become pronounced. Nonverbal skills remain on trajectory for mental age, whereas verbal deficits emerge and persist. Nonverbal learning and memory are strengths relative to verbal skills. Expressive language is delayed relative to comprehension. Aspects of language skills continue to develop throughout adolescence, although language skills remain compromised in adulthood. Deficits in attention/executive functions are present in childhood and become more pronounced with age. Characteristic features associated with DS (cheerful, social nature) are personality assets. Children are at a lower risk for psychopathology compared to other children with ID; families report lower levels of stress and a more positive outlook. In youth, externalizing behaviors may be problematic, whereas a shift toward internalizing behaviors emerges with maturity. Changes in emotional/behavioral functioning in adulthood are typically associated with neurodegeneration and individuals with DS are higher risk for dementia of the Alzheimer's type. Individuals with DS possess many unique strengths and weaknesses that should be appreciated as they develop across the lifespan. Awareness of this profile by professionals and caregivers can promote early detection and support cognitive and behavioral development. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

A significant proportion is related to hypoxic–ischemic brain injury, either diffuse or focal (e.g., stroke). Neonatal brain injury is recognized clinically by a characteristic encephalopathy that evolves over days in the newborn period. This clinical syndrome includes a lack of alertness, poor tone, abnormal reflex function, poor feeding, compromised respiratory status, and seizures. Neonatal encephalopathy occurs in 1–6/1000 live term births, and is a major cause of neurodevelopmental disability. Up to 20% of affected infants die during the newborn period, and another 25% sustain permanent deficits of motor and also cognitive function. Functional motor deficits are often described as cerebral palsy, a non-progressive disorder of motor function or posture originating in early life. Cognitive deficits include mental retardation or learning disabilities, and impaired executive functions, language skills, or social ability. Other forms of neonatal brain injury, particularly in the term newborn, such as stroke, have an incidence as high as 1/4000 live births. More than 95% of infants with neonatal stroke survive to adulthood, and many have some form of motor or cognitive disability.",

Errors made and difficulties endured when trying to learn a second language parallel, to some degree, the problems an aphasic patient encounters in rehabilitation of language use. During the past few decades formal language rehabilitation programs have be come widely available. Most individuals with speech and language difficulties, including those with aphasia, receive formal diagnostic evaluations and many at tend remedial therapy programs. The widespread availability of aphasia therapy is a consequence of several factors: (1) language therapy has attained a respectable professional status with a growing scientific basis and the potential for much creativity; (2) the neurophysiological mechanisms of recovery after nervous-system injury are better understood; (3) enhanced understanding of the brain organization for language has facilitated the development of new remedial procedures; (4) home computers and other technical devices that are now widely available have been programmed for language rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation training for adults diagnosed with schizophrenia: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this review is to systematically search, appraise and synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) in the human responses of adults with schizophrenia and no positive symptoms of disease, in any setting, regarding anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, sadness, conversation, and well-being. More specifically, the review will focus on the following question: What is the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation training on anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being in adults with schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is often characterized by a long prodromal phase and a gradual change in psychosocial functioning, with symptoms that could include changes in affect (such as anxiety, irritability and depression), cognition (such as difficulty in concentration or memory), thought content (such as preoccupation with new ideas), physical changes (such as sleep disturbance and loss of energy), social withdrawal and impairment of role functioning.1,2 Anxiety is a prominent symptom, early in the course of schizophrenia, and is viewed both as a co-morbidity and a clinical expression of schizophrenia.3 Anxiety can be a stress factor that worsens existing prodromes or symptoms, leading to a vicious circle of growing stress and increased symptoms.4 Overall, the consequences alone or in combination of these components of anxiety generate a reduced efficiency of behaviour. The anxious individual, in addition to avoiding or escaping from situations, also shows inhibition in many other activities such as establishing contact and performing professional activities outside his/her routine.5,6 The physiological and cognitive aspects can create a vicious circle with negative thoughts leading to sympathetic changes, which are themselves interpreted in a negative way. The result can be a spiraling of anxiety.6 “Stress is an everyday fact of life, and we can't avoid it”.8(p.1) “Nervous tension is a more frequent ailment than the common cold. It is a greater danger because tension can reduce your efficiency, destroy your health and shorten your life”.7(p.1) We consider that day-to-day living confronts the person with a continuous stream of potentially stressful situations. If stress is acknowledged as reasonable, it becomes propulsive, constituting an impulse that causes the individual to make decisions, solve problems, and improve his/her functioning and abilities. In this sense, stress will help motivate the individual to achieve desirable goals, giving some flavor to life and providing an incentive for personal and professional achievement.8,9 We can experience stress from four basic sources: the Environment (the environment besieges you with demands to adjust); Social Stressors (the demands of the different social roles we play); Physiological Sources (transitions affecting our body); and Thoughts (our brain interprets and perceives complex changes in our environment and body, and determines whether they are a problem for us and when to turn to “emergency responses”).8 The anxiety experienced in day-to-day life situations is, therefore, interpreted as a complex set of emotions, and a personality trait or a state of the individual which combines three components: cognitive, vegetative, and motor. The cognitive component relates to all thoughts and feelings developed by someone who is anxious, and relates to what the person states that he/she feels. The vegetative component translates the physiological arousal of the individual when he/she is anxious. This activation is specific to each person so it may present great variability of responses such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, changes in gastric motility, urinary emergency, sweating, and increased muscle tension. The motor component refers to the previously addressed avoidance and escape responses determined by anxiety, limiting the individual's purview expressed through tense postures and different types of unrelaxed activities.5 One way of breaking the anxiety circle would be to reinterpret bodily changes in a positive thoughts form (cognitive approach). Another way would be to use relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation (physiological theory). A third way would be to introduce graded exposure to the feared situation (behavioural approach).6 Relaxation is conceptualized as a complex response class involving motor, visceral, observational responses and verbal behaviour. Motor behaviour involves action of the skeletal muscles. Visceral responding is concerned with homeostatic functions including breathing, temperature, and muscle tension. Observational responses seek out stimuli in the environment (e.g. a quiet park setting) or generate discriminative stimuli (e.g. “seeing” a quiet park setting). Verbal behaviour is concerned with overt or covert vocal behaviour (e.g. “I am tense”) in relation to relaxed behaviour.10 Many relaxation techniques aim to increase awareness of areas of chronic unconscious muscle tension. They often involve a conscious attempt to release and relax during exhalation. Frequently, habituation occurs with repeated exposure, but some people continue to react as if they were seeing this particular stressor for the first time. Mental escape techniques, such as imagery or relaxation therapy, can help decrease arousal, but learning is essential to adaptation. Most relaxation techniques are enjoyable, and many healthy individuals practice them without having particular health problems.11,12 There are two general purposes of tension control: prophylactic and therapeutic. By learning to relax differentially 24 hours a day, a person can increase the likelihood of preventing a stress or tension disorder. For a person already thus victimized, clinical PMR can often ease or eliminate the condition.11 Most relaxation techniques need to be practiced daily. Typically, patients learn a relaxation technique over the course of eight weekly classes, each lasting an hour or so. Between classes, they practice by themselves for 15 to 30 minutes a day. After the course is over, patients are encouraged to continue on their own, though they may take further classes to learn advanced techniques or to maintain group support.12 PMR was originally developed by Edmund Jacobson, and his original method required dozens of sessions where the participant was taught to relax 30 different muscle groups. Training consisted of successive tensing and relaxing of muscle groups, beginning with the upper body and proceeding to the lower parts.13 Based on different sources, we can state that recently there has been a growing interest in relaxation techniques in the multidisciplinary treatment of patient's response to schizophrenia symptomatology. The only existing revision, within this topic, “Progressive muscle relaxation in persons with schizophrenia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials”, aims to assess the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) on psychological distress and anxiety symptoms and on response/remission for people with schizophrenia. The three selected randomized controlled trials (RCT) involved 146 patients, and authors concluded that PMR can acutely reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being. No studies investigated the evidence for PMR as an add-on treatment for psychopathology, or for positive or negative symptoms, or for relapse prevention. This review demonstrates that PMR might be a useful add-on treatment to reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being in persons with schizophrenia. It further demonstrates that PMR may be offered in both acute and chronic inpatient treatment settings.6 The recent research “Acute effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety and subjective well-being in chronic Bulgarian patients with schizophrenia” aimed to provide evidence on the effectiveness of PMR as means of alleviating the state anxiety and psychological distress and a way to increase subjective well-being in chronic patients with schizophrenia. Sixty-four schizophrenia patients underwent two PMR sessions which were offered once a week and lasted approximately 25 minutes13 Results revealed significant decreased state anxiety and psychological stress, and increased subjective well-being within the experimental group, and it is noteworthy that both groups differed significantly in all post-measures. Therefore, this study provides scientific evidence for the use of PMR in patients with schizophrenia in chronic psychiatric settings, offering an easy method to learn healthy alternatives to cope with subjective stress and state anxiety. A recent RCT on effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety aimed to examine the efficacy of a single progressive muscle relaxation session compared with a control condition on state anxiety, psychological stress, fatigue and subjective well-being in patients with acute inpatient schizophrenia. Sixty-four patients were randomly assigned to either a single progressive muscle relaxation session of 25 minutes or a resting control condition with the opportunity to read for an equal amount of time.14 The results show that the 27 PMR group participants showed decreased state anxiety, psychological stress and fatigue and increased subjective well-being. Between-group differences in post scores were found for state anxiety, subjective well-being and psychological stress, but not for fatigue. The authors state that PMR is highly effective in reducing acute feelings of stress and anxiety in patients with schizophrenia. A reduction in stress and state anxiety is associated with an increase in subjective well-being.14 Another recent RCT on efficacy of progressive muscle relaxation training in reducing anxiety assigned 18 randomized patients to experimental and control groups. The experimental group received PMR training and the control group received a placebo intervention. Results show that the anxiety level improvement was significantly higher in the PMR training group after intervention and at follow-up, and the mean Beck Anxiety Inventory score fell from moderate anxiety on the pre-test to normal anxiety on the post-test.15 Therefore, the authors state that PMR training is a potentially effective nursing intervention to reduce anxiety in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, depending on the quality of their mental status at the time of intervention.15 The recent research about development of self-control strategies and stress management aimed to verify the impact of self-control skills and a stress management programme. During nine months, 14 participants with schizophrenia took part in a psycho-educative programme based on the relaxation principles of Jacobson, Shultz, and Desoille.16 Significant differences were found between pre- and post-test evaluations, revealing a decrease in stress levels and an increase in coping strategies, especially related with “self-control”, “assuming responsibility”, and “positive re-evaluation”. Furthermore, it is relevant to comprise all possible limitations of this therapy. Despite the fact that PMR sessions were experienced with satisfaction and wellness, a certain degree of motivation is necessary to embrace the regular use of this technique on a daily or weekly basis. Most publications indicate that adverse events resulting from relaxation techniques seem to be extremely uncommon; however, patients with heart and cardiovascular diseases, as well as patients with psychiatric disorders who present positive symptoms and risk of disorientation or confusion should be treated carefully. Although there already exists a systematic review on this topic, it only includes RCT design studies, and the outcomes of psychological distress and anxiety. In this JBI protocol for Systematic Review, we intend to go beyond that, as defined in the inclusion criteria, and consider any quantitative study design, setting, and outcome that will include all scientific/standardized assessments (questionnaires or scales) of anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being. Thus, this systematic literature review is considered to be timely and relevant.",

Likewise, Temporo-Mandibular Jaw and Joint disorder(s) – or simply TMD – is a multifactorial etiological condition, regularly encountered in the dental office. Whether due to malocclusion, bruxism, stress and/or trauma, TMD destabilizes the whole cranio-mandibular system structurally and functionally, via affecting mastication, teeth, supporting structures, comfort and aesthetics, and thus, QoL, again. While several treatment regimens do exist for such conditions, some of which have been standardized for use over the years, most continue to lack proper evidence-based literature support. Hence, (1) caution is to be exercised; and (2) the need for alternative therapeutic strategies is amplified, subsequently, the door for innovation is wide open. Indeed, neuromuscular electrical stimulation or “NMES”, is perhaps a fine example. Herein, we present the interested oro-dental health care provider with an up-dated revision of this therapeutic modality, its potential benefits, risks and concerns, to best handle the dysphagic patient: an intra-disciplinary approach or strategy bridging contemporary dentistry with speech and language therapy; a rather obscure and un-discovered yet critical allied health profession . A pre-clinical and clinical prospectus on employing inventive NMES-based regimens and devices to manage TMD is also highlighted.",

      "title": "Cognitive functions and social cognition in multiple sclerosis: An overview.",
      "abstract": "Cognitive decline has been widely reported in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) despite its clinical heterogeneity, at all stages and in all subtypes of the disease. Deficits are most commonly present in attention, processing speed, working memory, verbal fluency and executive function. However, MS patients also show decreased performance in tasks related to social cognition, i.e. mental operations thatdrive interpersonal skills such as social perception, empathy and theory of mind. Social cognitive deficits are an underestimated but important aspect of impairment in MS, reflecting how people process, store, and apply information in social interactions. Deficits in these domains have been associated with reduced social and psychological quality of life, even after controlling for severity and duration of the disease, age, and neurocognitive performance. Social cognition impairment is not entirely dependent on and parallel to general cognitive dysfunction, given that some patients experience disorganization of their social life before a significant or detectable cognitive impairment. The decrease in performance of social cognition tasks may reflect changes in brain activity and brain structure, either general or regional. Both subtle diffuse pathology and acute local lesions have at least partially independent effects on aspects of social cognition. The observed white matter damage contributes to a mechanism of disruption in the network of brain connections involved in social cognition. Undoubtedly, there is a wide variability in the relationship of social cognitionand neuroanatomical findings, not only due to the brain's complex connectivity, but also to the lack of a unique operative definition of these cognitive domains. Furthermore, it is difficult to compare study results, given the variability of clinical presentations in all stages of the disease.More research would contribute in understanding social cognition deficits better and in determining whether and what kind of training could be beneficial.",

The conditions now prevailing in the educational institutions (mass schooling without any individual orientation before the end of college) oblige the teenager to submit to teaching methods and to the school system. School can reveal the subject's personal problems (anxiety, phobia or depression), but may equally create pathology by not recognising the heterogeneity of individual development and differences in cognitive functioning. In adolescence, the ego is particularly vulnerable. Anything that may induce its instability can create behavioural problems (instability, aggressiveness, inhibition) or problems of thought (anxiety links, difficulties in abstraction). In order to cope with such a haemorrhage of the ego, the adolescent may have recourse to certain behaviours (e.g. use of drugs leading to dependence). So it is important the know well the links between school failure and behavioural problems or drug consumption because, in one way or another, by their sanction or by lack of motivation, these situations will lead very quickly to school disengagement, which in turn leads to the breakdown of the ego.",

      "title": "PROTOCOL: Personal assistance for children and adolescents (0‐18) with both physical and intellectual impairments",
      "abstract": "The International Classification of Impairments, Activities, and Participation (ICIDH-2) refers to impairment as loss or abnormalities at the level of body, body part or organ. People may have difficulty performing particular activities as a result of impairments, and a person's participation in education, social life, work, and other areas may be limited as a result of interactions among impairments, activities, and environment (WHO 2003). Though the ICIDH-2 refers to adults, except with reference to studies using specific definitions of other terms, this review follows the classification in ICIDH-2, which does not include the terms disability or handicap. This review will include children and adolescents with both physical impairments and intellectual impairments, which include learning impairments (e.g., Down's syndrome, global developmental delay, or pervasive developmental disorder), learning disability (also called ‘intellectual disability’ or ‘mental retardation’) and acquired brain injuries. Intellectual impairments and physical impairments affect activities and participation differently. Therefore, young people with intellectual impairments only or physical impairments only will be considered in other Cochrane and Campbell reviews, as will working-age adults and older adults. Around the world, about six hundred million people have impairments (UN 1990), most of whom live in the developing world. Previous reviews have identified inconsistencies in the measurement of impairments and activity limitations (UN 1990) and cross-national estimates of impairments and activity limitations in childhood and adolescence are even more variable than national estimates. The prevalence of intellectual impairments is difficult to quantify due to problems in diagnosis and classification. Most children and adolescents with intellectual impairments have mild to moderate impairments. Relatively few have ‘profound’ impairments (DSM-IV R). Over five million (10.6%) American children and adolescents experience a limitation in learning ability; respectively, about 4.0% and 3.2% have moderate and severe limitations (Hogan 1997). Gross rates of impairments in the United States (U.S.) have increased substantially in recent decades as a result of an aging population that is living longer and, more recently, as a result of higher reported levels of impairments among children and young adults (Kaye 1996). Recent increases in the prevalence of impairments among children and adolescents may be a result of changes in medical care. For example, very low birthweight babies are more likely than ever to survive (Alberman 1991; Allen 1993; Doyle 1995). These children are at high risk of both physical impairments and intellectual impairments (Middle 1996; Williamson 1983; Wilson-Costello 2005). Over six million (12.3%) American children and adolescents experience some type of functional limitation (as defined by (Hogan 1997)). Of the four million American children and adolescents who experience one serious functional limitation, about half experience one or more other functional limitations. About one million American children and adolescents experience serious limitations in two or more areas (Hogan 1997). Impairments are more prevalent in boys than in girls (Newacheck 2004) and more prevalent in low-income families than in high-income families (Newacheck 2004; UN 1990). Of non-institutionalised children and adolescents aged 5-17, 1.3% experience limitations in mobility and about .2% experience a moderate or severe limitation in mobility. Respectively, .9% and .5% experience limitations in self care; 5.5% and 1.2% experience limitations in communication (Hogan 1997). About 3.2% of American children attend special schools or classes (Wenger 1995). As far as possible, this review uses internationally accepted definitions of impairments and refers to impacts that are likely to occur across cultures. However, many epidemiological studies have been conducted in the United States and Western Europe. Readers should consider the applicability of epidemiological data to other settings. A discourse of disability ethics has evolved to discuss concepts of independence, defined not as people with disabilities “doing everything” for themselves, but as having maximum control over how help is provided (Morris 2001). Proponents of the social model of disability regard activity restrictions as caused by societal and structural barriers and stress the need for their removal (Abberley 1987; Oliver 1990). In addition to structural and environmental changes (e.g., making buildings accessible), the social model emphasises changes in public attitudes towards impairments to encourage increased participation and improved self-esteem. Participation in age-appropriate activities may be limited for children and adolescents with impairments when physical, social and attitudinal environments restrict their involvement (Hammal 2004; Mihaylov 2004). Impairments in children are related to societal limitation, and different types of impairments contribute uniquely to societal limitations (Hogan et al., 1997). Impairments may affect the quality of life, health, development, and family functioning of children and adolescents (Lavigne 1993; Neely-Barnes 2004; Pit-Ten 2002; Varni 2005). Limited participation in activities may have negative impacts on the mental and physical functioning of children and adolescents and may lead to emotional and behavioural problems. Children and adolescents with intellectual and physical impairments are at increased risk for mental health problems; however, most children and adolescents who might benefit from psychological services do not receive them (Witt 2001). Comorbid problems can also impact carers. For example, challenging behaviour often occurs in the context of learning impairments and mental health problems (Moss 2000). Parents and siblings of children with impairments are at risk for psychological problems (Rossiter 2001; Sharpe 2002; Thyen 1998). Total healthcare costs for children and adolescents with impairments may be four times greater than for those without impairments (Newacheck 2004). However, children and adolescents with impairments require varying degrees of support. For example, in one large study, ‘those in the upper decile of the expenditure distribution accounted for 65% of all charges’. Costs born by families of children and adolescents with the most severe impairments were similarly high; out-of-pocket healthcare expenses (i.e. those not reimbursed by insurance or a health service) for the top 10% of the distribution accounted for 85% of all out of pocket expenses (Newacheck 2004). All children and adolescents require some level of care. However, children and adolescents with extensive impairments may require many hours of assistance every day in addition to the normal assistance required by their peers. Consequently, family members (notably mothers) may withdraw from work and social life. Caring for a child with severe physical impairments can put great financial and emotional stress on parents and families (Neely-Barnes 2004; Witt 2001). In the U.S., parents of children with impairments are less likely to have attended college and more likely to be single and poor (Hogan 1997). The stress of caring for children with impairments may have negative impacts on parents, but some problems associated with impairments may increase the risk of impairment. For example, poor children are less likely than their peers to receive preventive healthcare (Newacheck 1988) and depressed mothers are less likely than other mothers to use injury prevention strategies like car seats and electrical plug covers (McLennan 2000). Furthermore, some evidence suggests that the development of intellectual impairments is affected by sociodemographic factors (Resnick 1998). Low birthweight black babies are more likely than white babies to survive (Morse 2006), which might affect the relative prevalence of impairments in different racial groups; however, ‘controlling for socioeconomic differences and family structure, black children are no more at risk of functional limitation than whites’ (Hogan 1997). Since the causes and consequences of impairments are often difficult to disentangle, retrospective studies are difficult to interpret. Increased participation (inclusion in activities of daily life) may have positive effects on the social functioning, development, mental and physical health of children and adolescents. There are many ways to increase participation by children and adolescents with impairments. For example, school schedules may be designed such that children and adolescents with impairments can engage in age-appropriate activities with their peers. Clinicians and policymakers can work together to influence policy, discourse, and planning and to apply the social model in support of children and their families (Colver 2005). However, broad interventions may not be sufficient to meet all needs. People with severe impairments require interventions tailored to their unique impairments, lifestyles, living arrangements, etc. Assistive devices, skills training, physical therapy, education, and human support help young people control their lives appropriately and engage in normal activities. Personal assistance is support given to children and adolescents with impairments living in normal housing (e.g., family homes or school accommodation) to enable them to participate in mainstream activities in various settings. Personal assistance is directed by users and their representatives and is designed to promote independence and to reduce strain on families. Assistants might help with bathing, dressing, moving around during the day, shopping, etc. Personal assistance is provided by non-professionals; it may aim to improve mental and physical health, but it differs from services by professional healthcare providers (e.g., nurses) with whom users have very different relationships. Personal assistance may be purchased by governments, insurance providers, or individuals. It may be provided directly or indirectly through payments or vouchers. Personal assistance differs from voluntary or charitable services over which users do not have the same control. It also differs from respite care, which is temporary and aims to help carers rather than children and adolescents with impairments. Personal assistance is designed for people whose participation in many normal activities would be impossible without help. While user needs should be assessed periodically, personal assistance is designed for people with permanent impairments. For example, the needs of a person with a recently acquired impairment might be different from the needs of a person who has had an impairment from birth and the needs of both might change; personal assistance would be designed to meet their unique needs and would develop with them. In this way, it differs from rehabilitative services and from services provided for fixed periods of time. Receipt of personal assistance is dependent on the amount of help required by an individual. For example, personal assistance in Nordic countries is generally provided to people requiring at least 20 hours of help per week, though most users have severe impairments and both require and receive substantially more assistance. Some form of personal assistance is now available (often by statutory right) in all Nordic countries, most Western European countries, Australia, parts of Asia, Canada, and the U.S. Services in different countries for different users are called by different names, which often relate to legislative categories rather than types of interventions. Eligibility varies around the world. For example, countries that see services for adults as a ‘right’ may not be able or willing to provide comprehensive services for children and older adults. Services for people of different ages may be provided through different mechanisms. Rules about who may be a personal assistant also vary. For example, some countries allow users to employ family members (e.g., parents) while others do not. Differences in eligibility affect the number and types of people who receive support and these differences affect the amount and types of support individuals and their families receive. That is, the relative number of people receiving personal assistance and their characteristics vary across countries, insurance schemes, etc. Advocates of personal assistance argue that personal assistants should be chosen, trained and managed by users or their representatives. However, the organisation of services and the degree of user control varies around the world and may be affected by the administration of payments, employment laws, etc. Compared to other interventions, personal assistance may have unique benefits and potential drawbacks. Assistants may help children achieve more, but having a personal assistant could be stigmatising. Parents of children with impairments might be relieved to have assistants help care for their children, but assistants might interfere with family life and with users’ need for privacy, or with parents’ own needs to see themselves as adequate carers for their children. Compared to other ways of compensating for particular activity limitations, personal assistance may create unnecessary dependencies for some people. Even if personal assistance is clearly preferred over other services by working adults with physical impairments, groups that are underrepresented in the public discourse about the rights of people with impairments (e.g., children, people with intellectual impairments, and people in rural areas) may prefer other services, particularly since these groups may be more susceptible to abuse and less able to manage employees. Direct payments for personal assistance may not be ideal for children and families who have difficulty finding an assistant, administering services, negotiating or giving instructions (Pijl 2000). While many personal assistants are managed by users or their representatives, the nature of personal assistance can make it difficult to separate the roles that individuals play in supporting people with impairments. For example, Askheim identified one mother of a child with intellectual impairments in Norway who acted both as the manager of her child's payments and as a full-time personal assistant (Askheim 2003). Policies that permit different care arrangements may have substantially different impacts. As the personal assistance movement gained strength, Ratzka noted that ‘there has been surprisingly little in the way of policy evaluation. The work that has been done in this area is restricted to gathering descriptive statistics on number of hours provided by one type of service, number of consumers, staff, and expenditures’ (Ratzka 1986). Some research now suggests that personal assistance may meet otherwise unmet needs of people with impairments. Shortly after its introduction, a survey of direct payment recipients in the UK found that 40% had a need for additional hours of personal service while 80% of people receiving other services had a similar need (Zarb 1994). However, traditional reviews have failed to locate many evaluation studies and have not offered a definitive account of international research on personal assistance. A recent report by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen) highlighted the need for a sensitive and exhaustive search for trials and a systematic synthesis of existing studies (Socialstyrelsen 2005). To assess the effectiveness of personal assistance for children and adolescents (0-18) with both physical and intellectual impairments, and the impacts of personal assistance on families and carers, compared to other interventions. Randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised controlled trials and nonrandomised controlled studies of personal assistance compared to other forms of support or to ‘no-intervention’ (which may include unpaid care) in which participants were prospectively assigned to study groups and in which control group outcomes were measured concurrently with intervention group outcomes. Children and adolescents (0-18) living in the community who require assistance to perform tasks of daily living (bathing, eating, getting around, etc.) and participate in normal activities due to permanent physical and intellectual impairments. With the exception of young people living in student accommodation (e.g. residential schools), young people living outside their own homes (e.g., in private or public institutions for people with impairments) will be excluded. Children and adolescents with physical impairments only and intellectual impairments only will be excluded because these impairments affect activities and participation differently. Personal assistance is paid individualised human support that is designed to promote participation of people with permanent impairments. In consultation with experts and the reference group, the reviewers sought to determine what minimal amount of assistance would could be offered and still follow the personal assistance model for this population. For inclusion in this review, personal assistance must have been delivered for at least 20 hours per week. Comparisons might include, either singly or in combination, family care, institutionalisation, on-demand services, escort services, and other alternatives to personal assistance. ‘No-treatment’ and ‘waiting list’ groups will be included even if other services received are no described. These will be treated as separate comparisons. Studies examining different forms of personal assistance (e.g., assistance organised by users compared to assistance organised by others) will be included in the review, though these comparisons will be discussed separately as the outcomes from such studies would not indicate the effectiveness of personal assistance relative to other interventions. Primary outcomes will include: 1) Global quality of life, both (a) generic measures (e.g., the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory; Varni 2005) and (b) specific measures designed for people with particular impairments. Though well-validated measures for the general population will be considered, a review of global health measures found that ‘very few measures have been validated specifically for cognitively impaired respondents’ (Riemsma 2001) or for people with both physical and intellectual impairments. 2) User satisfaction. Direct reports will be preferred, though proxies might be used if users are unable to communicate. 3) Participation, including social activities, ability to participate in spontaneous activities, time outside the home, and mobility. Secondary outcomes will include: 1) Unmet needs, particularly the inability to perform activities of daily living. 2) Developmental outcomes, including cognitive milestones, acquisition of skills, and school attendance. 3) Health outcomes, including direct measures of muscle strength, disease, injuries, abuse or pain and indirect measures such as nutrition, emergency room visits or need for hospitalisation or institutionalisation. 4) Psychiatric outcomes, including self-harm, pica (eating non-food substances), and outwardly directed challenging behaviour. Measures might include items from the externalising scale of the Behavior Problem Inventory (Sturmey 1993). 5) Impact on others, including parental (maternal) employment, satisfaction, and quality of family life. For example, measures might include the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36; (Ware 1992) or General Health Questionnaire (GHQ; (Counsell 1994). 6) Direct and indirect costs, both immediate and long-term. To account for normal development and the changing impacts of impairments, outcomes will be grouped by length of follow-up (e.g., 1-3 years, 4-6 years, 6+ years). The organisation of services is often a complicated task and new users or their representatives must train personal assistants. Outcomes measured during the first year of receiving personal assistance will be considered apart from outcomes measured after one or more years to account for this adjustment period, which may not be representative of personal assistance as a whole. As we anticipate many relevant documents will be unpublished, a three-part search strategy will be undertaken in order to maximise chances of capturing all relevant literature. Databases will be searched for published and unpublished studies. All electronic searches will be limited to research reported since 1980 because scoping for this project, including a review of relevant laws and policy documents and contacts with international experts, found that widespread personal assistance programmes began in the mid 1990s. Experts have noted that personal assistance was available in some form before the introduction of programmes in the 1990s, but they and the reviewers believe it is extremely unlikely that any relevant trials were conducted before 1980. No language restrictions will be imposed on any results from any search attempts, although most databases will be searched in English. Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACs) will be searched using Spanish and Portuguese terms and Scandinavian databases will be searched in appropriate languages. No filters based on methodology will be applied because test searches indicated that such filters might eliminate relevant studies. The authors worked with a reference group of users, clinicians, policymakers, and analysts (Jackson 2005) to develop this protocol and search strategy. The group recommended a highly sensitive search (one that will likely to capture all relevant reports) rather than a more specific one (a search that would identify fewer irrelevant papers). The following databases will be searched electronically: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) MEDLINE CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) EMBASE LILACs (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature) ASSIA (Applied Social Science Index & Abstracts) BIDS (International Bibliography of the Social Sciences [IBSS] on Bath Information and Data Services [BIDS]) C2-SPECTR (The Campbell Collaboration's Social, Psychological, Educational and Criminological Trials Register) Dissertations Abstracts A (Dissertation Abstracts International A: The Humanities and Social Sciences) EconLit ERIC (Educational Resources Information Center) PsycINFO Sociological Abstracts SIGLE search (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) Artikelsök DIVA Handicat Hicat LIBRIS LIBRIS Uppsök SveMed+ Danbib Medline will be searched using the following terms: 1 Home Care Services/ 2 Activities of Daily Living/ 3 Personal Health Services/ 4 (personal adj2 assist$).mp.

These approaches and any replies will be documented by the authors. Additionally, impairment-oriented email lists (list-servs) will be sent a letter requesting assistance in locating studies. The reviewers will contact authors of all included and excluded studies to request details of ongoing and unpublished studies. Reference lists from previous reviews and from all included and excluded studies will be searched. Relevant websites, including those maintained by users, governments, other agencies, and academics will be searched. From the resultant list of articles, outcome evaluations about people with impairments will be identified through electronic and hand searches. Two authors (EMW and PM) will check titles for relevance. When a title appears potentially relevant, both authors will examine the abstract. If one author feels an abstract might be relevant, the full article will be obtained. Two authors will examine the remaining papers to determine eligibility. Study authors will be contacted if further information could resolve initial disagreements about inclusion. Remaining disagreements will be discussed with the third reviewer (JD). If a consensus cannot be reached, the Coordinating Editor of the CDPLPG will be consulted. A flowchart of the process of trial selection will be made in accordance with the QUORUM statement (Moher 1999). Data extraction will be conducted independently by two authors (EMW and PM) using a specially developed data extraction form. When more than two treatment arms are included in the same trial, all arms will be described. The following data will be collected for all trial arms: 1) Descriptive data, including participant demographics (age, gender, types and extent of impairments, social and economic status); 2) Intervention characteristics (including delivery, duration, and within-intervention variability); 3) Other interventions received; 4) Outcome measures listed above. The following data will be collected for all studies: 1) Programme differentiation (Dane 1998; MRC 2000), including crossover between groups and the differences between the interventions received; and 2) Context. Two reviewers (EMW and PM) will independently assign each included study to a quality category described in the Cochrane Handbook (Higgins 2005) where: (A) indicates adequate concealment of the allocation (for example, by telephone randomisation, or use of consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes); (B) indicates uncertainty about whether the allocation was adequately concealed (for example, where the method of concealment is not known); (C) indicates that the allocation was definitely not adequately concealed (for example, open random number lists or quasi-randomisation such as alternate days, odd/even date of birth, or hospital number) (D) random allocation not used. Studies in all quality categories will be considered for inclusion in the review and meta-analyses. Though well-designed nonrandomised studies sometimes come to the same conclusions as randomised trials, nonrandomised studies are most likely to arrive at different conclusions about an intervention's effects when groups are different at the outset (Deeks 2003). Therefore, the pre-treatment assessment and the allocation of participants will be described in the description of studies to identify differences between intervention and control groups that may have existed at baseline. Existing scales for measuring the quality of controlled trials have not been properly developed, are not well-validated and are known to give differing (even opposing) ratings of trial quality in systematic reviews (Moher 1995). At present, evidence indicates that ‘scales should generally not be used to identify trials of apparent low quality or high quality in a given systematic review. Rather, the relevant methodological aspects should be identified a priori and assessed individually’ (Juni 2001). The following components will be considered in the description of studies: 1) Allocation bias (Was group assignment determined randomly or might it have been related to outcomes or the interventions received?); 2) Performance bias (Could the services provided have been influenced by something other than the interventions being compared?); 3) Detection bias (Were outcomes influenced by anything other than the constructs of interest, including biased assessment or the influence of exposure on detection?); 4) Report bias (Were the outcomes, measures and analyses selected a priori and reported completely? Were participants biased in their recall or response?); 5) Attrition bias (Could deviations from protocol, including missing data and dropout, have influenced the results?) (Delgado 2004; Juni 2001); and 6) Outcome validity (Were the outcome measures objective, validated for the population, reported directly by the user or obtained through official records, etc.?). All eligible outcome measures for all trial arms will be reported in the review. If two or more eligible intervention groups are compared to an eligible control, thus requiring that the reviewers choose a single intervention group for comparison",

      "abstract": "El trastorno lector o dislexia se considera un transtorno del aprendizaje debido a una dificultad para aprender a leer a pesar de una instruccion convencional y no siendo el resultado directo de una desventaja intelectual o influencia ambiental desfavorable. No es tampoco un fenomeno unitario ya que engloba diferentes manifestaciones de dificultades lectoras asociadas a distintas disfunciones neuropsicologicas. Entre las hipotesis que se barajan en la literatura cientifica, las mas populares hacen referencia a la existencia de un deficit en el procesamiento fonologico o conciencia fonologica que consiste en una incapacidad para segmentar el flujo del habla en sus constituyentes sonoros. Todavia no se conoce con exactitud el origen de este problema aunque se han planteado dos hipotesis:\nA,- El deficit es producido por una disfuncion en un sistema especifico para el habla.\nB,- El deficit es producido por una deficiencia auditiva mas general caracterizada por una dificultad para discriminar estimulos que cambian rapidamente de frecuencias.\nEsta ultima hipotesis ha sido denominada hipotesis del procesamiento temporal.\nOtro tipo de teorias hacen referencia a la existencia de dificultades en el procesamiento visual tanto a un nivel de procesos basicos, que se encuentran relacionados con la via magnocelular encargada de procesar las imagenes en movimiento durante la lectura, como de procesos superiores asociados al procesamiento ortografico o visuoespecial. En este sentido, el modelo de deficit de Symour (1997) se constituye como un modelo valido y parsimonioso que permite integrar las diferentes hipotesis mencionadas dentro de un modelo cognitivo de la lectura.\nUna de las tecnicas utilizadas en el estudio de la dislexia es la tecnica de potenciales cerebrales relacionados con eventos que consiste en el registro de la actividad cerebral debida a un proceso cognitivos inducidos por la realizacion de una d",

Feeding disorder may present as a child refusing to eat a certain group of foods or a specific food element class. The child can manifest with crying, vomiting, choking, or spitting up during feeds. It requires a comprehensive assessment of medical, psychosocial, feeding skill-based systems and associated nutritional based complications. Gastrointestinal disturbance in children with neurodisability (e.g., cerebral palsy) reflects the interplay between the central nervous system (CNS) and the enteric nervous system (ENS), resulting in a mandatory comprehensive review of child pathology. Feeding disability is acute when the duration is less than three months and chronic when greater than three months have elapsed.",

      "title": "Autizam kod djece i mladih",
      "abstract": "Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that affects all aspects of the child's personality (communication, motor skills, behavior and learning). It was first described by American child psychiatrist Leo Kanner in 1943, stating the basic characteristics of autism that have not been substantially changed (the inability of the child to establish normal contacts with parents, children and other people in general, delayed speech development and use speech to uncommunicative manner; repetitive and stereotyped games and obsessive insistence on the respect of a certain order, lack of imagination, good mechanical memory and normal physical appearance). Autistic people, except for the above characteristics, also have some special abilities, i.e. talents (talents related to music, memory, math, art, etc.). Autism belongs to the category of pervasive developmental disorders. In this category are also included: autism in childhood, atypical autism, Rett's disorder, the other disintegrative disorders of childhood, hyperactivity disorder associated with mental retardation and stereotyped movements, Asperger's Syndrome, other developmental disorders in childhood and pervasive developmental disorder, unspecified. Although the diagnosis of autism is not easy, there are several ways that can help in the diagnosis, for example history, clinical presentation, observing the child in different situations, psychological testing and various psychometric instruments. It is still not entirely clear what causes autism. As possible causes some authors suggest damage of the central nervous system, genetics, brain damage and disruption mirror neurons. Boys usually suffers of autism than girls. The most common is Kannerov syndrome, and disintegrative psychosis appears rarely. There are various therapeutic procedures and methods for people with autism, some of them are: behavioral therapy, music therapy, art therapy, play therapy, kinetic therapy, holding therapy, daily life therapy, sensory integration, different institutions, drugs, etc. As well as children with autism, their parents also need professional help. Education of children with autism should be based on respect for individual needs and differences of students. The prognosis for people with autism depends on the intellectual functioning, the development of speech and on the severity of characteristic symptoms of autism. The charter for the rights of people with autism was released at the Congress of autism in The Hague in 1992 in which was especially emphasized their right to free and full lives to the limit of their potential. The aim of this diploma thesis is to introduce some basic features and characteristics of autism.",

Examples of neurodevelopmental disorders in children include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, learning disabilities, intellectual disability (also known as mental retardation), conduct disorders, cerebral palsy, and impairments in vision and hearing. Children with neurodevelopmental disorders can experience difficulties with language and speech, motor skills, behavior, memory, learning, or other neurological functions. While the symptoms and behaviors of neurodevelopmental disabilities often change or evolve as a child grows older, some disabilities are permanent. Diagnosis and treatment of these disorders can be difficult; treatment often involves a combination of professional therapy, pharmaceuticals, and home-and school-based programs.",

      "abstract": "Di era moderenisasi terdapat berbagai kasus tentang kelainan atau gangguan bicara. Gangguan-gangguan bicara banyak dialami oleh sebagian anak kecil yang usia nya masih relative balita. Gangguan tersebut sering dianggap wajar dan normal. Akan tetapi orang tua sedikit yang menyadari bahwa anak tersebut mengalami gangguan bicara, dan baru menyadari setelah beranjak dewasa. Berbagai gangguan yang nampak biasa nya terjadi pada umur kurang dari 5 tahun diamana saat teman-teman sebanyanya sudah bisa mengucapkan kata tertentu dia masih menggumam seperti suara nafas. Meskipun perkembangan bicara tiap individu berbeda-beda, namun kita harus waspada, apabila anak tersebut mengalami hambatan. Seperti contoh anak sudah bisa mengucap beberapa kata, namun diumur tertentu menghilang juga termasuk mengoceh dari yang sebelumnya aktif menjadi pasif dan pendiam. Bahasa adalah alat komunikasi antara anggota masyarakat berupa simbol bunyi yang dihasilkan oleh alat ucap manusia. Berbahasa merupakan proses mengomunikasikan bahasa tersebut. Proses berbahasa sendiri memerlukan pikiran dan perasaan yang dilakukan oleh otak manusia untuk menghasilkan kata-kata atau kalimat. Alat bicara yang baik akan mempermudah berbahasa dengan baik. Namun, mereka yang memiliki kelainan fungsi otak dan bicaranya, tentu mempunyai kesulitan dalam berbahasa, baik produktif maupun reseptif. Inilah yang di sebut sebagai gangguan berbahasa. Gangguan-gangguan berbahasa tersebut sebenarnya akan sangat mempengaruhi proses berkomunikasi dan berbahasa. Banyak faktor yang mempengaruhi dan menyebabkan adanya gangguan berbahasa, kemudian faktor-faktor tersebut akan menimbulkan gangguan berbahasa. Maka dari itu, dalam makalah ini akan dijabarkan macam gangguan berbahasa yang sering dialami manusia berserta faktor-faktor yang menyebakannya.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Acomplicated interface exists between psychiatric and sleep disorders—psychiatric symptoms are amplified and aggravated by sleep disruption, and the pathology of psychiatric disorders may contribute to worsening sleep quality. In addition, persons with insomnia are at higher risk of developing a new psychiatric disorder, particularly major depression, within a year of the onset of insomnia. Psychiatric disorders can give rise to insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or parasomnias (eg, nightmares or sleep terrors) (Boxes 11–1 and 11–2).. It has been estimated that a third to a half of cases of chronic insomnia are associated with a psychiatric condition. Changes in sleep architecture include a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency that is seen with depressive episodes, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Schizophrenia (psychosis) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by both “positive symptoms” (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and “negative symptoms” (eg, affective flattening, avolition [limited goal-directed behavior], and alogia [restricted thought and speech production]). This disabling condition has a median age of onset between 15 and 25 years of age. Course is chronic with significant impairments in self-care, interpersonal interactions, and work performance.",

      "title": "Binocular rivalry and visuospatial ability in individuals with schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Visual abnormalities, both at the sensory input and the higher interpretive levels, have been associated with many of the symptoms of schizophrenia. Individuals with schizophrenia typically experience distortions of sensory perception, resulting in perceptual hallucinations and delusions that are related to the observed visual deficits. Disorganised speech, thinking and behaviour are commonly experienced by sufferers of the disorder, and have also been attributed to perceptual disturbances associated with anomalies in visual processing. Compounding these issues are marked deficits in cognitive functioning that are observed in approximately 80% of those with schizophrenia. Cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia include: difficulty with concentration and memory (i.e. working, visual and verbal), an impaired ability to process complex information, response inhibition and deficits in speed of processing, visual and verbal learning. Deficits in sustained attention or vigilance, poor executive functioning such as poor reasoning, problem solving, and social cognition, are all influenced by impaired visual processing. These symptoms impact on the internal perceptual world of those with schizophrenia, and hamper their ability to navigate their external environment. Visual processing abnormalities in schizophrenia are likely to worsen personal, social and occupational functioning.\r\n\r\nBinocular rivalry provides a unique opportunity to investigate the processes involved in visual awareness and visual perception. Binocular rivalry is the alternation of perceptual images that occurs when conflicting visual stimuli are presented to each eye in the same retinal location. The observer perceives the opposing images in an alternating fashion, despite the sensory input to each eye remaining constant. Binocular rivalry tasks have been developed to investigate specific parts of the visual system. The research presented in this Thesis provides an explorative investigation into binocular rivalry in schizophrenia, using the method of Pettigrew and Miller (1998) and comparing individuals with schizophrenia to healthy controls. This method allows manipulations to the spatial and temporal frequency, luminance contrast and chromaticity of the visual stimuli. Manipulations to the rival stimuli affect the rate of binocular rivalry alternations and the time spent perceiving each image (dominance duration). Binocular rivalry rate and dominance durations provide useful measures to investigate aspects of visual neural processing that lead to the perceptual disturbances and cognitive dysfunction attributed to schizophrenia. However, despite this promise the binocular rivalry phenomenon has not been extensively explored in schizophrenia to date.\r\n\r\nFollowing a review of the literature, the research in this Thesis examined individual variation in binocular rivalry. The initial study (Chapter 2) explored the effect of systematically altering the properties of the stimuli (i.e. spatial and temporal frequency, luminance contrast and chromaticity) on binocular rivalry rate and dominance durations in healthy individuals (n=20). The findings showed that altering the stimuli with respect to temporal frequency and luminance contrast significantly affected rate. This is significant as processing of temporal frequency and luminance contrast have consistently been demonstrated to be abnormal in schizophrenia.\r\n\r\nThe current research then explored binocular rivalry in schizophrenia. The primary research question was, Are binocular rivalry rates and dominance durations recorded in participants with schizophrenia different to those of the controls? In this second study binocular rivalry data that were collected using low- and highstrength binocular rivalry were compared to alternations recorded during a monocular rivalry task, the Necker Cube task to replicate and advance the work of Miller et al., (2003). Participants with schizophrenia (n=20) recorded fewer alternations (i.e. slower alternation rates) than control participants (n=20) on both binocular rivalry tasks, however no difference was observed between the groups on the Necker cube task.\r\n\r\nMagnocellular and parvocellular visual pathways, thought to be abnormal in schizophrenia, were also investigated in binocular rivalry. The binocular rivalry stimuli used in this third study (Chapter 4) were altered to bias the task for one of these two pathways. Participants with schizophrenia recorded slower binocular rivalry rates than controls in both binocular rivalry tasks. Using a ‘within subject design’, binocular rivalry data were compared to data collected from a backwardmasking task widely accepted to bias both these pathways. Based on these data, a model of binocular rivalry, based on the magnocellular and parvocellular pathways that contribute to the dorsal and ventral visual streams, was developed.\r\n\r\nBinocular rivalry rates were compared with performance on the Benton’s Judgment of Line Orientation task, in individuals with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls (Chapter 5). The Benton’s Judgment of Line Orientation task is widely accepted to be processed within the right cerebral hemisphere, making it an appropriate task to investigate the role of the cerebral hemispheres in binocular rivalry, and to investigate the inter-hemispheric switching hypothesis of binocular rivalry proposed by Pettigrew and Miller (1998, 2003). The data were suggestive of intra-hemispheric rather than an inter-hemispheric visual processing in binocular rivalry.\r\n\r\nNeurotransmitter involvement in binocular rivalry, backward masking and Judgment of Line Orientation in schizophrenia were investigated using a genetic indicator of dopamine receptor distribution and functioning; the presence of the Taq1 allele of the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) receptor gene. This final study (Chapter 6) explored whether the presence of the Taq1 allele of the DRD2 receptor gene, and thus, by inference the distribution of dopamine receptors and dopamine function, accounted for the large individual variation in binocular rivalry. The presence of the Taq1 allele was associated with slower binocular rivalry rates or poorer performance in the backward masking and Judgment of Line Orientation tasks seen in the group with schizophrenia.\r\n\r\nThis Thesis has contributed to what is known about binocular rivalry in schizophrenia. Consistently slower binocular rivalry rates were observed in participants with schizophrenia, indicating abnormally-slow visual processing in this group. These data support previous studies reporting visual processing abnormalities in schizophrenia and suggest that a slow binocular rivalry rate is not a feature specific to bipolar disorder, but may be a feature of disorders with psychotic features generally.\r\n\r\nThe contributions of the magnocellular or dorsal pathways and parvocellular or ventral pathways to binocular rivalry, and therefore to perceptual awareness, were investigated. The data presented supported the view that the magnocellular system initiates perceptual awareness of an image and the parvocellular system maintains the perception of the image, making it available to higher level processing occurring within the cortical hemispheres. Abnormal magnocellular and parvocellular processing may both contribute to perceptual disturbances that ultimately contribute to the cognitive dysfunction associated with schizophrenia. An alternative model of binocular rivalry based on these observations was proposed.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Oral-facial-digital syndrome type I (OFD1) is usually male lethal during gestation and predominantly affects females. OFD1 is characterized by the following features: Oral (lobulated tongue, tongue nodules, cleft of the hard or soft palate, accessory gingival frenulae, hypodontia, and other dental abnormalities) Facial (widely spaced eyes or telecanthus, hypoplasia of the alae nasi, median cleft or pseudocleft upper lip, micrognathia) Digital (brachydactyly, syndactyly, clinodactyly of the fifth finger; duplicated hallux [great toe]) Kidney (polycystic kidney disease) Brain (e.g., intracerebral cysts, agenesis of the corpus callosum, cerebellar agenesis with or without Dandy-Walker malformation) Intellectual disability (in ~50% of individuals) Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of OFD1 is established in a proband by identification of an OFD1 pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Surgery for cleft lip/palate, tongue nodules, accessory frenulae, and syndactyly; removal of accessory teeth and orthodontia for malocclusion; routine treatment for renal disease and seizures. Speech therapy and special education may be warranted. Surveillance: Annual audiology evaluation and assessment of speech development in children if cleft lip and/or cleft palate is present. Individuals age ten years and older: annual blood pressure examination, serum creatinine, annual ultrasound examination for renal, hepatic, pancreatic, and ovarian cystic disease. Genetic counseling OFD1 is inherited in an X-linked manner. Approximately 75% of affected individuals represent simplex cases (i.e., with no family history of OFD1). A female proband with OFD1 may have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant; the proportion of cases caused by de novo pathogenic variants is unknown. The risk that the unaffected mother of an affected female who is a simplex case will give birth to another female with OFD1 is less than 1%. At conception, the risk to the offspring of females with OFD1 of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%; however, most male conceptuses with the pathogenic variant miscarry. Thus, at delivery the expected sex ratio of offspring is: 33% unaffected females; 33% affected females; 33% unaffected males. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known. Prenatal ultrasound examination may detect structural brain malformations and/or duplication of the hallux.",

Both everyday observations and results of experimental studies indicate often disordered cognitive  function in children (neurodevelopmental deficits), as well as in elderly (neurodegenerative deficits) resulting from biological aging. Thus, neuropsychological rehabilitation constitutes a central topic in neuroscience. Experimental studies focussed on this issue have been conducted in our Laboratory for approx. twenty years. Our main achievement is the indication that temporal information processing constitutes a working platform for mental activity. Specific deficits of the cerebral clock controlling time perception are evidenced in various cognitive deficits, like language learning impairment, post stroke aphasia, infantile autism, central auditory processing disorders, stuttering as well as in the other neurological or psychiatric diseases. Our crucial result was the indication that the deficits in temporal processing may be reduced by the specific training. Its application results in a transfer of improvement from the trained time domain to the cognitive domain which remains untrained during the intervention. These results were applied in elaboration in our Laboratory in cooperation which the Harpo company the innovative therapy program Dr Neuronowski® (www.neuronowski.com) focussed on amelioration of neural mechanisms underlying cognitive function in children and adults.",

      "abstract": "Velopharyngeal dysfunction (VPD) refers to any situation in which an individual is unable to completely close the nasal airway during speech.The velopharyngeal mechanism is comprised of a complex group of structures that act in unison to control airflow through the nose and mouth by elevation of the soft palate and constriction of both the lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls (►Fig. 1).Any disruption in this mechanism may result in abnormal, poorly intelligible speech.VPD can manifest as hypernasality, nasal emission, decreased vocal intensity, and/or facial grimacing. 1Moreover, patients who suffer from VPD will frequently develop maladaptive articulations to compensate for their speech difficulties. 2umerous etiologies can be responsible for this failure of normal speech production.Myoneurogenic problems can impair muscle control or affect muscle programming.Anatomic irregularities can present as a tissue deficit, structural problems that affect function, or even mechanical interference preventing normal closure.Mislearning comprises a host of etiologies whereby the patient has developed abnormal usage of the velopharyngeal mechanism despite the absence of other pathology. 3elopharyngeal dysfunction is a carefully chosen term that simply denotes the presence of incomplete velopharyngeal closure without making suggestions as to its cause.Use of this nomenclature has gained increasing favor by experts, replacing the previous designation, velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI).This helps to avoid confusion, as VPI has been differentially interpreted as denoting insufficiency, incompetence, and inadequacy-terms that may be similar, but are not synonymous and potentially implicate the cause of the dysfunction rather than describe the clinical finding.VPD is seen in roughly 20 to 30% of individuals who have undergone cleft palate repair, 4,5 and 5 to 10% of patients with a submucous cleft palate (SMCP). 6",

      "abstract": "When a child is brought to a pediatrician because language is not developing normally, there are several investigations that are typically carried out. The child's hearing is tested, and cognitive and social development are assessed. The medical history is scrutinized to see if there is any evidence of neurological disease or trauma early in life, and the child is examined for neurological signs and abnormalities of the speech apparatus. The parents are interviewed about the family circumstances. Although in many cases one might find some explanation for the child's language disorder in the course of these investigations, all too often this is not the case. The child appears to be physically normal with adequate hearing, good nonverbal ability and normal social relationships, and the medical history and home background are unremarkable. Traditionally the terms \"developmental aphasia\" or \"developmental dysphasia\" have been used to describe cases of abnormal language development of unknown origin. However, this terminology is not entirely satisfactory. Use of a neurological label implies similarities with adult acquired dysphasia, but this is usually misleading since, as we shall see, there is seldom any indication of brain damage in these children. Furthermore, the label suggests a clear-cut syndrome, whereas in fact a wide range of problems is included in this definition. For these reasons, more neutral terms such as \"specific developmental language disorder\" or \"specific language impairment\" are frequently preferred (Bishop and Rosenbloom, 1987).",

The profile of communication skills in dementia differ from the profiles of developmental aging and focal organic disorders. Normal elders may have some episodic memory losses and slower reaction times as aging progresses. Focal language disorders (aphasia and right hemisphere disorders) will affect specific language functions without affecting intellect and memory. Communication in the presence of dementia progresses through three stages. The first stage deficits are primarily in the content area of lexical access and subtle conversational skills. The second stage reveals increased difficulty in content areas including concept formation, lexical access diminished graphic abilities, reliance on syntactic abilities and reduced memory function. The third stage of dementia may involve all of the above to a more severe degree, with severe memory and intellectual deficits. Assessment batteries have been developed to evaluate the deficit areas frequently associated with communication in dementia. Clinical evaluation and standardized assessment can differentiate the language profile of dementia from other neurological disorders. Therapeutic intervention in communication focuses on maintaining the patient's communication and providing educational information for caregivers for more effective communication strategies.",

      "abstract": "Many adults with right hemisphere brain damage exhibit difficulties in the comprehension and expression of emotional language and humor. Affective comprehension deficits range in severity and can be modulated by task and response demands as well as by the strength of emotional content. Expressive emotional language deficits, as characterized by reduced emotional intensity, are more pervasive than comprehension deficits. Deficits in humor appreciation generally affect the ability to integrate an incongruous element (e.g., a punch line) with the preceding context. Several co-occurring disorders (e.g., depression, cognitive and visuoperceptual deficits, and reduced auditory comprehension) may exacerbate problems with affective language and humor. Although some formal measures evaluate humor appreciation, none specifically addresses emotional language. While no hard data exist regarding efficacy of treatment for deficits in affective language or humor processing, several suggestions for such treatment are provided.",

      "title": "The effects of preterm birth on visual development",
      "abstract": "Children born very preterm are at a greater risk of abnormal visual and neurological development when compared to children born at full term. Preterm birth is associated with retinopathy of prematurity (a proliferative retinal vascular disease) and can also affect the development of brain structures associated with post‐retinal processing of visual information. Visual deficits common in children born preterm, such as reduced visual acuity, strabismus, abnormal stereopsis and refractive error, are likely to be detected through childhood vision screening programs, ophthalmological follow‐up or optometric care. However, routine screening may not detect other vision problems, such as reduced visual fields, impaired contrast sensitivity and deficits in cortical visual processing, that may occur in children born preterm. For example, visual functions associated with the dorsal visual processing stream, such as global motion perception and visuomotor integration, may be impaired by preterm birth. These impairments can continue into adolescence and adulthood and may contribute to the difficulties in learning (particularly reading and mathematics), attention, behaviour and cognition that some children born preterm experience. Improvements in understanding the mechanisms by which preterm birth affects vision will inform future screening and interventions for children born preterm.",

Las afectaciones de la neurona motora inferior en la infancia, de etiologia congenita o adquirida, provocan dificultades en la respuesta motriz del habla en un periodo especialmente critico para el desarrollo del lenguaje. El interes por esta patologia radica en su baja incidencia, en su comorbilidad con otras afectaciones cerebrales y en su pronostico incierto. Objetivo. Hacer una revision de las alteraciones motoras del habla, de la valoracion funcional y de la intervencion logopedica en la disartria flacida. Desarrollo. Se plantea la caracterizacion clinica de las alteraciones en la produccion verbal de origen periferico, concretamente de la disartria flacida y sus manifestaciones respiratorias, fonatorias, de resonancia, de articulacion y de prosodia. Seguidamente, se esboza la valoracion funcional y se plantean las lineas de intervencion para su tratamiento. Conclusiones. Las manifestaciones clinicas de la disartria flacida son muy heterogeneas y van desde leves dificultades articulatorias a graves trastornos que limitan gravemente la capacidad para la expresion verbal. En la mayoria de los casos, la exploracion funcional proporciona hallazgos valiosos para su identificacion y tipificacion, para determinar la necesidad de valoraciones complementarias y para establecer el programa idoneo de intervencion logopedica. La participacion guiada de la familia y el abordaje interdisciplinar son factores que contribuyen decisivamente a mejorar estos procesos.",

      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that involves impairment in three broad areas as identified by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition [1]: socialization, communication, and repetitive or restricted behaviors and interests. With regard to socialization, individuals with autism may show limited use of nonverbal behaviors, such as eye contact or facial expressions directed to others. They may demonstrate limited social and emotional reciprocity, may not seek to share their enjoyment of activities and interests with others, and often fail to develop appropriate peer relationships. In the area of communication, individuals with autism may have a significant language delay and have difficulties with symbolic play. Those individuals with strong verbal skills still tend to have communication impairments, including difficulty with reciprocal conversation, and use of unusual or repetitive language. Finally, in the area of restricted and repetitive behaviors, individuals with autism may show a preoccupation with parts of objects (e.g. repeatedly spinning the wheel of a toy car), or an intense preoccupation with an unusual topic of interest (e.g. radiators, train schedules). In some individuals, these areas of interest become almost all-consuming, such that it is difficult for them to relate to others without bringing up their preoccupation. Individuals with autism often show a need for routine and predictability, and may exhibit ritualistic behavior or become upset by disruptions in their usual routine. Finally, some individuals with autism exhibit repetitive movements, such as hand-flapping or body-rocking.",

The two main surgical procedures that affect speech are laryngectomy and glossectomy. Neurogenic disorders are those acquired through damage caused to the brain, for example through a cerebrovascular accident, brain tumors, or traumatic brain injury. Dysarthria is the term applied to speech impairments resulting from \"disturbances in muscular control over the speech mechanisms due to damage of the central or peripheral nervous system\". One of the diagnostic factors distinguishing an articulation disorder from a phonological disorder is whether the client is stimulable for a sound or group of sounds; if they cannot, then it is likely a problem of articulation.",

      "abstract": "The term craniofacial anomalies (CFAs) refers to a diverse group of congenital disorders including complex syndromes marked by multiple sutural fusions (e.g., Crouzan's, Treacher Collins, and Aperts syndromes), simple craniosynostoses involving single fusions (e.g., sagittal synostosis), hemifacial microsomia, clefts of the lip and/or palate, and isolated birth marks on the face and neck, such as benign vascular nevi (i.e., port-wine stains). Most children with these disorders experience one or more associated complications including feeding and growth difficulties, oral-dental problems, chronic ear infections, speech and language impairments, and multiple structural and cosmetic surgeries for both visible disfigurement and invisible dysmorphologies (e.g., cleft palate). Any or all of these factors may produce significant stress and conflict for the child and family. Various psychological risk factors have been identified that may compromise the child's psychological adjustment, such as parental guilt or overprotectiveness, stigmatizing social responses to speech impairment or facial disfigurement, and certain neuropsychological limitations (see Barden, 1990; Richman & Eliason, 1993, for reviews of this literature).

      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition that is typically diagnosed in childhood or later. However, its high heritability and patterns of expression of implicated genes may contribute to an onset in fetal or early infant brain development. Prospective studies of infants with a family history of autism or a genetic syndrome associated with higher prevalence are providing insights into the earliest manifestations of the condition. Contrary to earlier expectations, the earliest signs of autism in the first year of life appear to be in sensory and motor development. Prospective studies have identified overgrowth of sensorimotor brain cortices, reduced habituation to repeated auditory or tactile stimuli, and exaggerated pupillary responses to changes in luminance in the first year of life. These are followed by a gradual decline in visual attention to faces and eyes, and the emergence of early social signs such as reduced pointing and sharing, or reduced communication. Altered patterns of behavior (including focused interests and unusual play) also emerge in the second year. These changes are associated with alterations in brain oscillatory power and connectivity. Autism is often associated with other co-occurring conditions; differences in broader aspects of development such as sleep or fearfulness also emerge early in development, and relate to later cognitive and adaptive outcomes. Parental interventions that focus on supporting and following a child’s interests can support social communication development for some infants.",

Disorders commonly associated with RHD include impairments in attention, including visuospatial neglect; cognitive deficits apparent primarily in executive function and awareness; reduced use and production of prosody; and difficulties with effective and efficient communication. This chapter focuses on disorders of communication, including theoretical underpinnings of those disorders, and suggestions for intervention. Several themes have surfaced in the understanding of communication disorders associated with RHD. Assessment of communication disorders associated with RHD typically involves observation, informal testing, and formal measures. While adults with RHD can have inefficiencies in semantic processing, behaviorally the deficits appear as difficulties with comprehension of discourse, inefficient or disorganized discourse production, misinterpretation of intended meaning, and difficulty producing or interpreting prosody, facial expression and other nonverbal cues.",

The aim of this paper is to highlight the issues in SLI associated with memory disorders, motoric deficits, and dyslexia. This is a literature review. Short-term memory and working memory are commonly affected in children with SLI. In addition, those children exhibit deficits in fine and gross motor skills both simple and complex.

      "title": "Augmentative And Alternative Communication Systems For Post-Stroke Patients With Severe Communication And Motor Impairment",
      "abstract": "Background and aims: Adults with acquired neurological disorders (stroke, Traumatic Brain Injury ...) develop their verbal communication and literacy capabilities as typical speakers and writers. They use these skills to participate academically, vocationally, recreationally, and socially. Depending upon their neurological condition, they gradually or suddenly lose their speech or language capabilities and are required to rely on Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) systems to meet their communication needs. In addition to the loss of their spoken communication, the impact of their neurological condition on their participation patterns is potentially profound with reduced ability to care for themselves, a reduction or loss of employment, and usually a sudden or gradual restriction of their social networks. AAC is an umbrella term that encompasses the communication methods used to supplement or replace speech or writing for those with impairments in the production or comprehension of spoken or written language. During the past five decades, AAC technologies have been developed to compensate for these natural communication losses. Stroke is one of the main causes of disability in the world. About 20% of stroke patients experience aphasia, with 20-30% of these individuals exhibiting severe communication deficits for at least a portion of their recovery period. Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) encompasses the communication methods used to supplement or replace speech or writing for those with impairments in the production of spoken or written language. Specifically designed Human Computer Interfaces (HCI), as an assistive technology, provides new channels of communication for patients with aphasia, dysarthria, and dyspraxia, when accompanied by movement impairments. In this workshop after stating a science review of the following types of issues: AAC acceptance (individually, culturally); AAC availability; AAC use patterns; AAC limitations are main issues, an AAC technology for post-stroke patients will be presented which developed by a knowledgebase company in Iran. The system allows patients with communication and motor impairment to state their intentions and feelings by a minimum movement in their body, or just by moving their eyes. Different sensors and switches are available to adopt based on the limited ability of the patients. For detecting eye movements, a novel wearable miniaturized system has been developed that is worn as a headband and detects eye movements based on processing electro-oculogram. A high performance graphical user interface has been developed to type letters and numbers in Persian language. The system also provides words prediction, text to speech conversion with natural voice, and sending/receiving messages in the mobile networks for a convenient communication experience. The developed system has been tested successfully by more than 20 patients with different disabilities, and is now commercially available.The proposed system can also help the severely disabled people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, quadriplegia, muscular dystrophy or cerebral palsy to communicate with others and mention their intentions, needs and feelings. This low-cost wearable device assures high level of comfort for the user without fatigue and do not need long time training. The system can also be adapted for the patients who can speak, but could not move their hands, to work with the computer and enjoy using the internet.",

      "abstract": "Speech motor disorders are one of the most common forms of movement disorder and are typical symptoms of numerous neurological diseases. They can be broadly categorized as apraxia of speech and dysarthria. Dysarthria has been defined as “a collective name for a group of speech disorders resulting from disturbances in muscular control over the speech mechanism due to damage of the central or peripheral nervous system. It designates problems in oral communication due to paralysis, weakness, or poor coordination of the speech musculature” (Darley et al., 1969a; 1969b; 1975). The disorder is due to abnormal neuromuscular execution and may affect the strength, speed, range, timing, and accuracy of speech movements. It can involve respiration, phonation, articulation, and prosody, either singly or in combination.",

      "title": "Enhancing Functional Capacity for Clients with Physical Limitations Associated with Multiple Sclerosis",
      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive neurological disease of the central nervous system, and it is most prevalent in the adult population. The central nervous system is made up of the brain and the spinal cord (Figure 1). When a person has a diagnosis of MS, their immune system attacks the protective coating of nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. The protective coating is known as myelin. If myelin is missing on nerve fibers, a plaque will develop in its place, and communication along the nerves will be interrupted. The disruption of communication between the brain or spinal cord and the body can result in movement, sensory, and/or mental impairments. For example, when the brain is trying to communicate to the arm to move, the communication will be slowed or blocked (Lundy-Ekman, 2018), and as a result, the arm's movement will be limited or absent.Signs and symptoms that result from MS may include weakness, limited motor movement and coordination, impaired vision, double vision, limited sensory abilities, and impaired or slurred speech. In addition, one may have difficulty with memory, concentration, and attention (Lundy-Ekman, 2018). The signs and symptoms of MS may fluctuate, yet as the disease progresses, symptoms often become permanent. The visual, sensory, movement, and cognitive problems that may develop with MS can greatly impact functional abilities for adults in the areas of self-care, productivity, and leisure activities. This article will focus on strategies for improving function for individuals with visual and physical deficits that are associated with MS.The plaques that develop with MS can cause inflammation to the optic nerve, anywhere along the optic nerve's pathway, and/or in the visual cortex, which is found in the occipital lobe (Figure 2). Symptoms of visual impairment may include blurry vision, double vision, or visual field loss. Visual deficits may include a partial or complete loss of vision, depending upon the disease process. As with all symptoms from MS, vision impairment fluctuates, depending on whether or not the individual is in an exacerbation. An exacerbation is a period of time when the symptoms of MS flare, and therefore, vision can worsen.The plaques that develop with MS can also cause inflammation to the motor cortex, sensory cortex, or cerebellum in the brain or anywhere along the spinal cord (Figure 1 and Figure 2). As a result, a person may have weakness in the trunk, arms, or legs, an abnormal or loss of sensation, poor balance, and limited endurance for daily activities. Again, sensory, motor, balance, strength, and endurance will worsen when one is having an exacerbation. In addition, another symptom that is associated with MS is systemic fatigue, which can be commonly reported in periods of exacerbation. Fatigue may negatively impact one's ability to engage in important activities of daily living, such as self-care, productivity, and leisure. Furthermore, the persistent fatigue that is associated with MS can have psychosocial implications, such as depression and social isolation, and consequently, it can further affect a person's level of participation and involvement in various aspects of life.While symptoms associated with MS vary from client to client, there are strategies to support an individual's ability to continue to complete meaningful activities to some degree. These strategies include the incorporation of energy conservation techniques, including activity modification, environmental modification, ergonomic principles, adaptive equipment, and assistive technology.Energy conservation techniques (ECTs) involve the planned management of the client's energy levels by balancing activity with rest, particularly during episodes of fatigue or exacerbation. ECTs help maintain valued activities and can be integrated throughout a daily routine. Some examples of ECTs include activity modifications, environmental modifications, principles of ergonomics, and the use of adaptive equipment or assistive technology. Sensory limitations brought on by MS can be taxing for an individual, especially when weakness, a lack of sensation, and visual deficits coexist. The successful adoption of ECTs requires client education on ways to incorporate scheduled rest, simplification of activities, and planning of energy expenditure and may include training on the use of adaptive equipment.Activity modification is an example of an ECT that can help to minimize labor, increase efficiency, and prevent fatigue in activities or tasks. Examples of activity modification include sitting instead of standing while chopping vegetables in a meal preparation activity or planning a task ahead of time to avoid unwanted energy expenditure. An example of planning a task ahead of time is organizing transportation before going to a scheduled appointment. It can also include prioritizing specific tasks, such as doing laundry at a time of the day when energy levels are higher or eliminating tasks by delegating them to others in an effort to save energy.Environmental modifications create a safe and more efficient environment for the client in order to maximize function. Examples of environmental modifications may include proper lighting throughout the home, the provision of accessibility to equipment and tools in the bathroom or kitchen, the removal of hazards such as throw rugs, and the incorporation of contrast on appliances or to mark doorways or stairs. Proper lighting includes the placement, such as overhead lighting or task lighting, the direction of the light with blinds or lamp shades, and the use of an appropriate type of bulb, such as a dimmable or anti-glare LED. Simple environmental solutions can be easily implemented and can optimize a client's function and independence.Incorporating ergonomic principles to avoid improper posture or positioning may be another way to conserve energy. Techniques such as using pillows to help maintain an upright posture in a sitting task or positioning reading materials within the field of vision are examples of ergonomic principles.The use of adaptive devices may assist in energy conservation for daily tasks. Examples of adaptive devices include a reacher or long-handle shoehorn to facilitate putting shoes on without having to bend over, an electric can opener, or the use of a rolling cart to transport objects instead of carrying them. Lightweight plates and built-up utensils for eating may also facilitate feeding for an individual with weakness. Adaptive equipment can be tailored to each individual's unique needs and can serve to reduce energy expenditure in daily activities.Assistive technology (AT) consists of low-tech and high-tech devices that can be useful for clients who are suffering from visual deficits and physical limitations, such as grasping, manipulating, or reaching. Electronic aids to daily living (EADLs) are technologies that can make a home operable with the touch of a remote control, such as the remote control of lights and appliances. Other kinds of AT may include electronic alarms and timers, features for smart phone technology that allow for messages to be read or magnified for low vision, and low vison magnifiers for use in the community.While the symptoms associated with MS are progressive in nature, there are strategies that one can implement to curtail the physical, sensory, and psychosocial limitations associated with this illness. The strategies discussed above are ones that can easily be adopted to aid in maintaining function in everyday activities. In addition, the maintenance of functional abilities contributes to psychosocial factors. Psychosocial well-being is maintained by the client's engagement in meaningful activity. For example, a loss of function can greatly impact a client's ability to socialize and participate in the community. Optimizing function for MS clients by incorporating energy conservation techniques and other strategies contributes to overall wellness and quality of life.",

      "title": "Stress and cognition",
      "abstract": "Stress can affect cognition in many ways, with the outcome (i.e., facilitating or impairing) depending on a combination of factors related to both stress and the cognitive function under study. Among the factors identified as particularly relevant to define the cognitive effects of stress are the intensity or magnitude of stress, its origin (i.e., whether triggered by the task or externally), and its duration (i.e., whether acute or chronically delivered). At the cognitive end, the specific cognitive operation (e.g., implicit or explicit memory, long-term or working memory, goal-directed or habit learning) and information processing phases (e.g., learning, consolidation, and retrieval) are essential as well to define stress effects. The emerging view is that mild stress tends to facilitate cognitive function, particularly in implicit memory or simple declarative tasks or when the cognitive load is not excessive. Exposure to high or very high stress acutely (whether elicited by the cognitive task or experienced before being trained or tested in the task) or chronically impairs the formation of explicit memories and, more generally, of those that require complex, flexible reasoning (as typically observed for hippocampus- and prefrontal cortex-related functions) while improving performance of implicit memory and well-rehearsed tasks (as reported for amygdala-dependent conditioning tasks and for striatum-related processes). In addition to these general principles, there are important individual differences in the cognitive impact of stress, with gender and age being particularly influencing factors.

      "abstract": "Swallowing is a dynamic process that requires more than 30 muscles in the recruitment/coordination of the lips, tongue, palate, pharynx, larynx and esophagus. The eating and swallowing procedure is learned in sensitive or critical periods: when a certain degree of maturation has been achieved, the appropriate stimulus permits a certain milestone of development to occur. The swallowing procedure occurs in three main stages oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal. Therefore, swallowing disorders may present in any, some, or all of these stages in addition to feeding problems. Adult dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, has long been reported in the literature. Infants and children also experience feeding disorders and swallowing problems, either because of developmental disorders, syndromes, behavioral or neurological conditions, respiratory problems, and/or gastroesophageal reflux, eosinophilic esophagitis or anatomical deficits. Feeding problems or dysphagia are seen in up to 25% of all children; approximately 40% of prematurely born infants have swallowing disorders, up to 64-78% with developmental disorders and up to 99% with cerebral palsy. Diagnostic options include health status, broad social environment, parent-child interactions, and parental concerns. Evaluation of dysphagia and feeding disorders involves a multifactorial approach. Imaging studies may include videofluoroscopy and/or fiberoptic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). Successful oral feeding must be measured in quality of meal time experiences with best possible oral sensorimotor skills and safe swallowing while not jeopardizing a child's functional health status or the parent-child relationship. An interdisciplinary team approach enables coordinated global assessment and therapy planning.",

      "title": "Mowat-Wilson Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is characterized by distinctive facial features (widely spaced eyes, broad eyebrows with a medial flare, low-hanging columella, prominent or pointed chin, open-mouth expression, and uplifted earlobes with a central depression), congenital heart defects with predilection for abnormalities of the pulmonary arteries and/or valves, Hirschsprung disease or chronic constipation, genitourinary anomalies (particularly hypospadias in males), and hypogenesis or agenesis of the corpus callosum. Most affected individuals have moderate-to-severe intellectual disability. Speech is typically limited to a few words or is absent, with relative preservation of receptive language skills. Growth restriction with microcephaly and seizure disorder are also common. Most affected people have a happy demeanor and a wide-based gait that can sometimes be confused with Angelman syndrome. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of MWS is established in a proband with classic dysmorphic facial features and developmental delay / intellectual disability and/or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ZEB2 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Care by the appropriate specialist for dental anomalies, seizures, ocular abnormalities, congenital heart defects, chronic constipation, Hirschsprung disease, genitourinary abnormalities, and pectus anomalies of the chest and/or foot/ankle anomalies; educational intervention and speech therapy beginning in infancy. Surveillance: Annual eye examination in childhood to monitor for strabismus and refractive errors; monitoring for otitis media; regular developmental assessments to plan/refine educational interventions; periodic reevaluation by a clinical geneticist. Genetic counseling MWS is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a pathogenic variant in ZEB2, a heterozygous deletion of 2q22.3 involving ZEB2, or (rarely) a chromosome rearrangement that disrupts ZEB2. Almost all individuals reported to date have been simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) resulting from a de novo genetic alteration; rarely, recurrence in a family has been reported when a parent has a low level of somatic or presumed germline mosaicism for a MWS-causing pathogenic variant. Individuals with MWS are not known to reproduce. Once the causative genetic alteration has been identified in the proband, prenatal testing may be offered to parents of a child with MWS because of the recurrence risk associated with the possibility of parental mosaicism or a balanced chromosome rearrangement.",

      "title": "PROTOCOL: Personal assistance for children and adolescents (0‐18) with intellectual impairments",
      "abstract": "The International Classification of Impairments, Activities, and Participation (ICIDH-2) refers to impairment as loss or abnormalities at the level of body, body part or organ. People may have difficulty performing particular activities as a result of impairments, and a person's participation in education, social life, work, and other areas may be limited as a result of interactions among impairments, activities, and environment (WHO 2003). Though the ICIDH-2 refers to adults, except with reference to studies using specific definitions of other terms, this review follows the classification in ICIDH-2, which does not include the terms disability or handicap. This review will include children and adolescents with intellectual impairments, which include learning impairments (e.g., Down's syndrome, global developmental delay, or pervasive developmental disorder), learning disability (also called ‘intellectual disability’ or ‘mental retardation’) and acquired brain injuries. Intellectual impairments and physical impairments affect activities and participation differently; interventions would aim to achieve different outcomes. Therefore, young people with physical impairments or both physical impairments and intellectual impairments will be considered in other Cochrane and Campbell reviews, as will working-age adults and older adults. Around the world, about six hundred million people have impairments (UN 1990), most of whom live in the developing world. Previous reviews have identified inconsistencies in the measurement of impairments and activity limitations (UN 1990) and cross-national estimates of impairments and activity limitations in childhood and adolescence are even more variable than national estimates. The prevalence of intellectual impairments is difficult to quantify due to problems in diagnosis and classification. Most children and adolescents with intellectual impairments have mild to moderate impairments. Relatively few have ‘profound’ impairments (DSM-IV R). Over five million (10.6%) American children and adolescents experience a limitation in learning ability; respectively, about 4.0% and 3.2% have moderate and severe limitations (Hogan 1997). Gross rates of impairments in the United States (U.S.) have increased substantially in recent decades as a result of an aging population that is living longer and, more recently, as a result of higher reported levels of impairments among children and young adults (Kaye 1996). Recent increases in the prevalence of impairments among children and adolescents may be a result of changes in medical care. For example, very low birthweight babies are more likely than ever to survive (Alberman 1991; Allen 1993; Doyle 1995). These children are at high risk of both physical impairments and intellectual impairments (Middle 1996; Williamson 1983; Wilson-Costello 2005). Over six million (12.3%) American children and adolescents experience some type of functional limitation (as defined by (Hogan 1997)). Of the four million American children and adolescents who experience one serious functional limitation, about half experience one or more other functional limitations. About one million American children and adolescents experience serious limitations in two or more areas (Hogan 1997). Impairments are more prevalent in boys than in girls (Newacheck 2004) and more prevalent in low-income families than in high-income families (Newacheck 2004; UN 1990). Of non-institutionalised children and adolescents aged 5-17, 1.3% experience limitations in mobility and about .2% experience a moderate or severe limitation in mobility. Respectively, .9% and .5% experience limitations in self care; 5.5% and 1.2% experience limitations in communication (Hogan 1997). About 3.2% of American children attend special schools or classes (Wenger 1995). As far as possible, this review uses internationally accepted definitions of impairments and refers to impacts that are likely to occur across cultures. However, many epidemiological studies have been conducted in the United States and Western Europe. Readers should consider the applicability of epidemiological data to other settings. A discourse of disability ethics has evolved to discuss concepts of independence, defined not as people with disabilities “doing everything” for themselves, but as having maximum control over how help is provided (Morris 2001). Proponents of the social model of disability regard activity restrictions as caused by societal and structural barriers and stress the need for their removal (Abberley 1987; Oliver 1990). In addition to structural and environmental changes (e.g., allowing sufficient time between activities for children with impairments to toilet), the social model emphasises changes in public attitudes towards impairments to encourage increased participation and improved self-esteem. Participation in age-appropriate activities may be limited for children and adolescents with impairments when social and attitudinal environments restrict their involvement (Hammal 2004; Mihaylov 2004). Impairments in children are related to societal limitation, and different types of impairments contribute uniquely to societal limitations (Hogan 1997). Impairments may affect the quality of life, health, development, and family functioning of children and adolescents (Neely-Barnes 2004; Pit-Ten 2002; Varni 2005). Limited participation in activities may have negative impacts on the mental and physical functioning of children and adolescents and may lead to emotional and behavioural problems. Children and adolescents with intellectual impairments are at increased risk for mental health problems; however, most children and adolescents who might benefit from psychological services do not receive them (Witt 2001). Comorbid problems can also impact carers. For example, challenging behaviour often occurs in the context of learning impairments and mental health problems (Moss 2000). Parents and siblings of children with impairments are at risk for psychological problems (Rossiter 2001; Sharpe 2002; Thyen 1998). Total healthcare costs for children and adolescents with impairments may be four times greater than for those without impairments (Newacheck 2004). However, children and adolescents with impairments require varying degrees of support. For example, in one large study, ‘those in the upper decile of the expenditure distribution accounted for 65% of all charges’. Costs born by families of children and adolescents with the most severe impairments were similarly high; out-of-pocket healthcare expenses (i.e. those not reimbursed by insurance or a health service) for the top 10% of the distribution accounted for 85% of all out of pocket expenses (Newacheck 2004). All children and adolescents require some level of care. However, children and adolescents with severe impairments may require many hours of assistance every day in addition to the normal assistance required by their peers. Consequently, family members (notably mothers) may withdraw from work and social life. Caring for a child with severe impairments can put great financial and emotional stress on parents and families (Neely-Barnes 2004; Witt 2001). In the U.S., parents of children with impairments are less likely to have attended college and more likely to be single and poor (Hogan 1997). The stress of caring for children with impairments may have negative impacts on parents, but some problems associated with impairments may increase the risk of impairment. For example, poor children are less likely than their peers to receive preventive healthcare (Newacheck 1988) and depressed mothers are less likely than other mothers to use injury prevention strategies like car seats and electrical plug covers (McLennan 2000). Furthermore, some evidence suggests that the development of intellectual impairments is affected by sociodemographic factors (Resnick 1998). Low birthweight black babies are more likely than white babies to survive (Morse 2006), which might affect the relative prevalence of impairments in different racial groups; however, ‘controlling for socioeconomic differences and family structure, black children are no more at risk of functional limitation than whites’ (Hogan 1997). Since the causes and consequences of impairments are often difficult to disentangle, retrospective studies are difficult to interpret. Increased participation (inclusion in activities of daily life) may have positive effects on the social functioning, development, and health of children and adolescents. There are many ways to increase participation by children and adolescents with intellectual impairments. For example, social activities may be designed such that children and adolescents with intellectual impairments can engage in age-appropriate activities with their peers. Clinicians and policymakers can work together to influence policy, discourse, and planning and to apply the social model in support of children and their families (Colver 2005). However, broad interventions may not be sufficient to meet all needs. People with severe impairments require interventions tailored to their unique impairments, lifestyles, living arrangements, etc. Skills training, education, and human support help young people control their lives appropriately and engage in normal activities. Personal assistance is support given to children and adolescents with impairments living in normal housing (e.g. family homes or school accommodation) to enable them to participate in mainstream activities in various settings. Personal assistance is directed by users and their representatives and is designed to promote independence and to reduce strain on families. Assistants might help with bathing, dressing, moving around during the day, shopping, etc. Personal assistance is provided by non-professionals; it may aim to improve health, but it differs from services by professional healthcare providers (e.g., nurses) with whom users have very different relationships. Personal assistance may be purchased by governments, insurance providers, or individuals. It may be provided directly or indirectly through payments or vouchers. Personal assistance differs from voluntary or charitable services over which users do not have the same control. It also differs from respite care, which is temporary and aims to help carers rather than individuals with impairments. Personal assistance is designed for people whose participation in many normal activities would be impossible without help. While user needs should be assessed periodically, personal assistance is designed for people with permanent impairments. For example, the needs of a person with a recently acquired impairment might be different from the needs of a person who has had an impairment from birth and the needs of both might change; personal assistance would be designed to meet their unique needs and would develop with them. In this way, it differs from rehabilitative services and from services provided for fixed periods of time. Receipt of personal assistance is dependent on the amount of help required by an individual. For example, personal assistance in Nordic countries is generally provided to people requiring at least 20 hours of help per week, though most users have severe impairments and both require and receive substantially more assistance. Some form of personal assistance is now available (often by statutory right) in all Nordic countries, most Western European countries, Australia, parts of Asia, Canada, and the U.S. Services in different countries for different users are called by different names, which often relate to legislative categories rather than types of interventions. Eligibility varies around the world. For example, countries that see services for adults as a ‘right’ may not be able or willing to provide comprehensive services for children and older adults. Services for people of different ages may be provided through different mechanisms. Rules about who may be a personal assistant also vary. For example, some countries allow users to employ family members (e.g., parents) while others do not. Differences in eligibility affect the number and types of people who receive support and these differences affect the amount and types of support individuals and their families receive. That is, the relative number of people receiving personal assistance and their characteristics vary across countries, insurance schemes, etc. Advocates of personal assistance argue that personal assistants should be chosen, trained and managed by users or their representatives. However, the organisation of services and the degree of user control varies around the world and may be affected by the administration of payments, employment laws, etc. Compared to other interventions, personal assistance may have unique benefits and potential drawbacks. Assistants may increase social participation for many people, but having a personal assistant could be stigmatising. Parents of children with impairments might be relieved to have assistants help care for their children, but assistants might interfere with family life and with users’ need for privacy, or with parents’ own needs to see themselves as adequate carers for their children. Even if personal assistance is clearly preferred over other services by working adults with physical impairments, groups that are underrepresented in the public discourse about the rights of people with impairments (e.g., children, older adults, people with intellectual impairments, and people in rural areas) may prefer other services, particularly since these groups may be more susceptible to abuse and less able to manage employees. Direct payments for personal assistance may not be ideal for children and families who have difficulty finding an assistant, administering services, negotiating or giving instructions (Pijl 2000). While many personal assistants are managed by users or their representatives, the nature of personal assistance can make it difficult to separate the roles that individuals play in supporting people with impairments. For example, Askheim identified one mother of a child with intellectual impairments in Norway who acted both as the manager of her child's payments and as a full-time personal assistant (Askheim 2003). Policies that permit different care arrangements may have substantially different impacts. As the personal assistance movement gained strength, Ratzka noted that ‘there has been surprisingly little in the way of policy evaluation. The work that has been done in this area is restricted to gathering descriptive statistics on number of hours provided by one type of service, number of consumers, staff, and expenditures’ (Ratzka 1986). Some research now suggests that personal assistance may meet otherwise unmet needs of people with impairments. Shortly after its introduction, a survey of direct payment recipients in the UK found that 40% had a need for additional hours of personal service while 80% of people receiving other services had a similar need (Zarb 1994). However, traditional reviews have failed to locate many evaluation studies and have not offered a definitive account of international research on personal assistance. A recent report by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen) highlighted the need for a sensitive and exhaustive search for trials and a systematic synthesis of existing studies (Socialstyrelsen 2005). To assess the effectiveness of personal assistance for children and adolescents (0-18) with intellectual impairments, and the impacts of personal assistance on families and carers, compared to other interventions. Randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised controlled trials and nonrandomised controlled studies of personal assistance compared to other forms of support or to ‘no-intervention’ (which may include unpaid care) in which participants were prospectively assigned to study groups and in which control group outcomes were measured concurrently with intervention group outcomes. Children and adolescents (0-18) living in the community who require assistance to perform tasks of daily living (bathing, eating, getting around, etc.) and participate in normal activities due to permanent intellectual impairments. Young people living outside their own homes (e.g., in private or public institutions for people with impairments) will be excluded. Children and adolescents with physical impairments will be excluded because these impairments affect activities and participation differently. Personal assistance is paid individualised human support that is designed to promote participation of people with permanent impairments. In consultation with experts and the reference group, the reviewers sought to determine what minimal amount of assistance would could be offered and still follow the personal assistance model for this population. For inclusion in this review, personal assistance must have been delivered for at least 20 hours per week. Comparisons might include, either singly or in combination, family care, institutionalisation, on-demand services, escort services and other alternatives to personal assistance. ‘No-treatment’ and ‘waiting list’ groups will be included even if other services received are no described. These will be treated as separate comparisons. Studies examining different forms of personal assistance (e.g., assistance organised by users compared to assistance organised by others) will be included in the review, though these comparisons will be discussed separately as the outcomes from such studies would not indicate the effectiveness of personal assistance relative to other interventions. Primary outcomes will include: 1) Global quality of life, both (a) generic measures (e.g., the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory; [Varni 2005]) and (b) specific measures designed for children with particular impairments. Though well-validated measures for the general population will be considered, a review of global health measures found that ‘very few measures have been validated specifically for cognitively impaired respondents’ (Riemsma 2001). 2) User satisfaction. Direct reports will be preferred, though proxies might be used if users are unable to communicate. 3) Participation, including social activities, ability to participate in spontaneous activities, time outside the home, and mobility. Secondary outcomes will include: 1) Unmet needs, particularly the inability to perform activities of daily living. 2) Developmental outcomes, including cognitive milestones and acquisition of skills. 3) Health outcomes, including direct measures of muscle strength, disease, injuries, abuse or pain and indirect measures such as nutrition, emergency room visits or need for hospitalisation or institutionalisation. 4) Psychiatric outcomes, including self-harm, pica (eating non-food substances), and outwardly directed challenging behaviour. Measures might include items from the externalising scale of the Behavior Problem Inventory (Sturmey 1993). 5) Impact on others, including parental (maternal) employment, satisfaction, and quality of family life. For example, measures might include the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36; (Ware 1992) or General Health Questionnaire (GHQ; (Counsell 1994). 6) Direct and indirect costs, both immediate and long-term. To account for normal development and the changing impacts of impairments, outcomes will be grouped by length of follow-up (e.g., 1-3 years, 4-6 years, 6+ years). The organisation of services is often a complicated task and new users or their representatives must train personal assistants. Outcomes measured during the first year of receiving personal assistance will be considered apart from outcomes measured after one or more years to account for this adjustment period, which may not be representative of personal assistance as a whole. As we anticipate many relevant documents will be unpublished, a three-part search strategy will be undertaken in order to maximise chances of capturing all relevant literature. Databases will be searched for published and unpublished studies. All electronic searches will be limited to research reported since 1980 because scoping for this project, including a review of relevant laws and policy documents and contacts with international experts, found that widespread personal assistance programmes began in the mid 1990s. Experts have noted that personal assistance was available in some form before the introduction of programmes in the 1990s, but they and the reviewers believe it is extremely unlikely that any relevant trials were conducted before 1980. No language restrictions will be imposed on any results from any search attempts, although most databases will be searched in English. Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACs) will be searched using Spanish and Portuguese terms and Scandinavian databases will be searched in appropriate languages. No filters based on methodology will be applied because test searches indicated that such filters might eliminate relevant studies. The authors worked with a reference group of users, clinicians, policymakers, and analysts (Jackson 2005) to develop this protocol and search strategy. The group recommended a highly sensitive search (one that will likely to capture all relevant reports) rather than a more specific one (a search that would identify fewer irrelevant papers). The following databases will be searched electronically: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) MEDLINE CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) EMBASE LILACs (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature) ASSIA (Applied Social Science Index & Abstracts) BIDS (International Bibliography of the Social Sciences [IBSS] on Bath Information and Data Services [BIDS]) C2-SPECTR (The Campbell Collaboration's Social, Psychological, Educational and Criminological Trials Register) Dissertations Abstracts A (Dissertation Abstracts International A: The Humanities and Social Sciences) EconLit ERIC (Educational Resources Information Center) PsycINFO Sociological Abstracts SIGLE search (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) Artikelsök DIVA Handicat Hicat LIBRIS LIBRIS Uppsök SveMed+ Danbib Medline will be searched using the following terms: 1 Home Care Services/ 2 Activities of Daily Living/ 3 Personal Health Services/ 4 (personal adj2 assist$).mp.

These approaches and any replies will be documented by the authors. Additionally, impairment-oriented email lists (list-servs) will be sent a letter requesting assistance in locating studies. The reviewers will contact authors of all included and excluded studies to request details of ongoing and unpublished studies. Reference lists from previous reviews and from all included and excluded studies will be searched. Relevant websites, including those maintained by users, governments, other agencies, and academics will be searched. From the resultant list of articles, outcome evaluations about people with impairments will be identified through electronic and hand searches. Two authors (EMW and PM) will check titles for relevance. When a title appears potentially relevant, both authors will examine the abstract. If one author feels an abstract might be relevant, the full article will be obtained. Two authors will examine the remaining papers to determine eligibility. Study authors will be contacted if further information could resolve initial disagreements about inclusion. Remaining disagreements will be discussed with the third reviewer (JD). If a consensus cannot be reached, the Coordinating Editor of the CDPLPG will be consulted. A flowchart of the process of trial selection will be made in accordance with the QUORUM statement (Moher 1999). Data extraction will be conducted independently by two authors (EMW and PM) using a specially developed data extraction form. When more than two treatment arms are included in the same trial, all arms will be described. The following data will be collected for all trial arms: 1) Descriptive data, including participant demographics (age, gender, types and extent of impairments, social and economic status); 2) Intervention characteristics (including delivery, duration, and within-intervention variability); 3) Other interventions received; 4) Outcome measures listed above. The following data will be collected for all studies: 1) Programme differentiation (Dane 1998; MRC 2000), including crossover between groups and the differences between the interventions received; and 2) Context. Two reviewers (EMW and PM) will independently assign each included study to a quality category described in the Cochrane Handbook (Higgins 2005) where: (A) indicates adequate concealment of the allocation (for example, by telephone randomisation, or use of consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes); (B) indicates uncertainty about whether the allocation was adequately concealed (for example, where the method of concealment is not known); (C) indicates that the allocation was definitely not adequately concealed (for example, open random number lists or quasi-randomisation such as alternate days, odd/even date of birth, or hospital number) (D) random allocation not used. Studies in all quality categories will be considered for inclusion in the review and meta-analyses. Though well-designed nonrandomised studies sometimes come to the same conclusions as randomised trials, nonrandomised studies are most likely to arrive at different conclusions about an intervention's effects when groups are different at the outset (Deeks 2003). Therefore, the pre-treatment assessment and the allocation of participants will be described in the description of studies to identify differences between intervention and control groups that may have existed at baseline. Existing scales for measuring the quality of controlled trials have not been properly developed, are not well-validated and are known to give differing (even opposing) ratings of trial quality in systematic reviews (Moher 1995). At present, evidence indicates that ‘scales should generally not be used to identify trials of apparent low quality or high quality in a given systematic review. Rather, the relevant methodological aspects should be identified a priori and assessed individually’ (Juni 2001). The following components will be considered in the description of studies: 1) Allocation bias (Was group assignment determined randomly or might it have been related to outcomes or the interventions received?); 2) Performance bias (Could the services provided have been influenced by something other than the interventions being compared?); 3) Detection bias (Were outcomes influenced by anything other than the constructs of interest, including biased assessment or the influence of exposure on detection?); 4) Report bias (Were the outcomes, measures and analyses selected a priori and reported completely? Were participants biased in their recall or response?); 5) Attrition bias (Could deviations from protocol, including missing data and dropout, have influenced the results?) (Delgado 2004; Juni 2001); and 6) Outcome validity (Were the outcome measures objective, validated for the population, reported directly by the user or obtained through official records, etc.?). All eligible outcome measures for all trial arms will be reported in the review. If two or more eligible intervention groups are compared to an eligible control, thus requiring that the reviewers choose a single intervention group for comparison or inclusion in a meta-analysis, the most intense service or the service that best follows the goals of personal assistance (e.g., services that give users more control) will be included in the meta-analysis. If a single eligible intervention group is compared to multiple eligible control groups, ‘no-treatment’ controls will be chosen over other groups for comparison and inclusion in meta-analyses. For studies that do not have no-treatment condition, the most common intervention in clinical practice will be chosen to maximise the external validity of the results. When a single study provides multiple measures of the same outcome, we will report all measures. For example, if a study includes two measures of quality of life (either measures completed by the same respondent or measures completed by different respondents), we will report both of them. If measures of an outcome are combined for meta-analysis, we will conduct multiple meta-analyses if multiple studies report multiple measures that can be combined in this way. If we conduct meta-analyses in which only one effect estimate can be used from each study, we will select one measure if it is more valid or reliable than the others. For example, if a single respondent completes both a validated scale assessing multiple domains of quality of life and an unvalidated visual analogue scale, we will select the validated scale. If a study includes several equally valid measures and only one effect estimate can be used for meta-analysis, we will calculate the average effect for this purpose (e.g. the average SMD or RR weighted by variance). When necessary, the corresponding author will be contacted to supply any unreported data (e.g., group means and standard deviations (SDs), details of dropouts, and details of interventions received by the control group). Other authors will be contacted if necessary. If a study reports outcomes only for participants completing the trial or only for participants who followed the protocol, authors will be contacted and asked to provide additional information to permit an intention-to-treat analyses. RevMan 4.2 will be used to perform the following calculations. Within studies, relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be calculated for comparisons of dichotomous outcome measures. Mean differences, standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% CIs will be calculated for comparisons of continuous outcome measures. Meta-analyses may be conducted to combine comparable outcome measures across studies. All overall effects will be calculated using inverse variance methods. Random-effects models will be used because studies may include somewhat different treatments or populations. Dichotomous outcome measures may be combined by calculating an overall RR and 95% CI. Continuous outcome measures may be combined when means and standard deviations or complete significance testing statistics are available, unless statistical tests assuming normality would be inappropriate. For example, for scales beginning with a finite number (such as 0), effect estimates will not be combined unless a mean is greater than its standard deviation (otherwise the mean would be very unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution). If continuous outcomes are measured identically across studies, an overall weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% CI may be calculated. If the same continuous outcome is measured differently across studies, an overall standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI may be calculated (Higgins 2005). SMDs will be calculated using Hedges g. Studies in which participants are analysed as members of the groups to which they were originally assigned (intention-to-treat analysis), studies that include only those participants who were willing or able to provide data (available-case analysis), and studies that analyse participants who adhered to the study's design (per-protocol analysis; (Higgins 2005) will be analysed separately. Studies in which the reasons for excluding participants from analyses can not be determined from relevant reports or through contact with the authors will be considered with per-protocol analyses. The consistency of results will be assessed using the I2 statistic (Higgins 2002; Higgins 2003). If there is evidence of heterogeneity (Q-statistic p less than or equal to 0.1 coupled with an I2 value of 25% or greater), the authors will consider sources according to pre-specified subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses (below) but will not report an overall estimate of effect size. If heterogeneity remains within these subgroups, the review will report the results on a trial-by-trial basis, in a narrative summary. Large numbers of subgroups may lead to misleading conclusions and are best kept to a minimum (Counsell 1994; Oxman 1992; Yusuf 1991). If possible, this review will include separate effect estimates for the following subgroups: 1) Organisation of services Personal assistance organised by user representatives (e.g., through direct payment schemes) will be considered apart from personal assistance organised and managed by others (e.g., social workers or government agencies). 2) Acquisition of impairment Separate effects will be reported for children and adolescents who had impairments from birth, who have long-standing impairments, and who recently acquired impairments. 3) Amount of assistance The number of hours of assistance received per week is related to user needs, which are determined by social context, the availability of other services, severity of impairments, etc. Separate effect estimates will be reported for users receiving different levels of assistance (e.g., 20-50 hours, 51-80 hours, more than 80 hours). Sensitivity analyses will investigate the influence of lower quality studies (i.e., those rated C and D on allocation concealment) on the results of the review. To investigate the possibility of bias, including publication bias, funnel plots will be drawn (Deeks 2005; Egger 1997; Sterne 2001). In the event of asymmetry, the reviewers will seek input from methodologists, including the Cochrane and Campbell Collaboration Methods Groups, on appropriate analyses. When meta-analyses are performed, data will be entered into RevMan in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicates a favourable outcome for personal assistance.

The disturbance of purposive movements cannot be termed apraxia, however, if the patient suffers from any elementary motor or sensory deficit (i.e., paresis, dystonia, ataxia), which could fully explain the abnormal motor behavior, or if it results from a language comprehension disorder or from dementia (1,2). Nevertheless, praxic errors are well defined clinically and kinematically and can be superimposed on elementary motor disorders (3,4). Praxic disturbances may affect specific parts of the body (i.e., limb apraxia, buccofacial apraxia, gait apraxia) and may involve both sides of the body (i.e., ideational and ideomotor apraxias), preferentially one side (i.e., limb-kinetic apraxia) or, alternatively, interlimb coordination, as in the case of gait apraxia.",

It refers to a change in cognitive function that is severe enough to compromise an individual's daily function. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) defines dementia as an acquired impairment of cognitive function that includes a decline in memory beyond what would be expected for age and at least one other cognitive function, such as attention, visuospatial skills or language, or a decline in executive functioning such as planning, organization, sequencing, or abstracting. The decline cannot only affect emotional abilities, but must also interfere with work or social activities. The deficits should not be accompanied by an impairment of arousal (delirium) or be accounted for by another psychiatric condition, such as depression or schizophrenia. Dementia can further be defined by a possible, probable, or definite etiologic diagnosis. A degenerative dementia implies disease progression over time.",

      "abstract": "La depresion se caracteriza por la presencia de tristeza, perdida de interes o placer, sentimientos de culpa o falta de autoestima, trastornos del sueno o del apetito, sensacion de cansancio y falta de concentracion, es el resultado de interacciones complejas entre factores sociales, psicologicos y biologicos. Quienes han pasado por circunstancias vitales adversas (desempleo, luto, traumatismos psicologicos) tienen mas probabilidades de sufrir depresion. A su vez puede generar mas estres y disfuncion, empeorar la situacion vital de la persona afectada. (OMS, 2017). La depresion puede llegar a hacerse cronica o recurrente y dificultar sensiblemente el desempeno en el trabajo o la escuela y la capacidad para afrontar la vida diaria. La posibilidad diagnostica de un trastorno depresivo a partir de datos observacionales poco especificos: deterioro en la apariencia y aspecto personal, lentitud en los movimientos, marcha cansina, tono de voz bajo, facies tristes o poco expresivas, llanto facil o espontaneo en la consulta, escasa concentracion durante la entrevista, verbalizacion de idealizacion pesimista, quejas hipocondriacas, alteraciones en el ritmo del sueno, quejas somaticas difusas y dificiles de encuadrar. (Alberdi Sadupe, Taboada, & Vazquez , 2006).\r\nEn su forma mas grave, puede conducir al suicidio, si es leve, se puede tratar sin necesidad de tratamiento farmacologico, pero cuando tiene caracter moderado o grave se pueden necesitar farmacos y psicoterapia profesional. (OMS, 2017)\r\nEn un estudio realizado a 500 estudiantes universitarios en Lima-Peru, se encontro que la prevalencia de depresion segun los niveles de complejidad corresponde el 9.7% a depresion leve, el 2.8% a depresion moderada y el 0.05% a una depresion severa. \r\nLa presente investigacion busca determinar la prevalencia de la depresion de los estudiantes universitarios en la ciudad Bucaramanga en el ano 2017; utilizando un instrumento disenado para evaluarla clasificandola: en rango normal, ligeramente deprimido, moderadamente deprimido y severamente deprimido.

      "abstract": "Prosody is a non-verbal or suprasegmental feature of language that conveys various levels of information to the listener, including linguistic, affective (attitudinal and emotional), dialectical, and idiosyncratic data.1 The acoustical features underlying prosody include pitch, intonation, melody, cadence, loudness, timbre, tempo, stress, accent, and pauses.2 These acoustical features are typically spared in patients with cortical dementias such as Alzheimer’s disease in which temporoparietal cortices are primarily affected. Patients with Alzheimer’s disease, however, often develop apraxia, which can be defined as a disorder of skilled movement not caused by weakness, akinesia, deafferentation, abnormal tone or posture, movement disorders (such as tremor or chorea), intellectual deterioration, poor comprehension, or uncooperativeness.3Moreover, subtypes of apraxia have been delineated and are defined by the nature of errors made by the patient and the means by which these errors are elicited.4 5 Accordingly, a patient with probable dementia of the Alzheimer’s type is described who had normal prosodic elements to his spontaneous everyday speech, but could not produce the same acoustical features underlying prosody to command. The nature of his errors might constitute what can be termed “ideomotor prosodic apraxia.”\n\nThe patient was a 71 year old, retired physician …",

      "abstract": "Patients with idiopathic parkinsonism suffer from a neurodegenerative disorder of the nervous system. Due to a progressive loss of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) develop problems with motor and non-motor functions. On the motor level the dysfunctions defect the voluntary movements and lead to symptoms like: rigidity, resting tremor and bradykinesia [1]. On the level of cognition PD patients have problems with the executive functions, cognitive flexibility, working memory and control of attention [2]. Furthermore, the speech system gets affected which often leads to dysarthric speech. This hypokinetic dysarthria impacts the phonation, articulation and the respiratory system. The speech deficits include monoloudness, monopitch, reduced stress, imprecise articulation, variability of speech rate, disfluencies and voice tremor [3, 4, 5].PD affects communication as well as other related functions such as cognition, but complex prosodic aspects such as focus marking are less well studied. Prominence marking in German requires changes in intonation and articulation [6]. Speakers use multiple cues in the phonetic domain to regulate prosodic marking [7], e.g. modulation of F0 and syllable duration. Furthermore, there is insufficient literature on the impact of cognition on these phonetic aspects of prominence marking. The aim of this study is to analyse how prosodic prominence correlates with motoric and cognitive abilities in patients with Parkinson’s disease in the complex process of speech production.",

      "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a multifaceted neurodevelopmental condition characterized by multiple psychological and physiological impairments in young children. According to the recent reports, 1 out of every 58 newly-born children is suffering from autism. The aetiology of the disorder is complex and poorly understood, hindering the adaptation of targeted and effective therapies. There are no well- established diagnostic biomarkers for autism. Hence the analysis of symptoms by the pediatricians plays a critical role in the early intervention.In the present report, we have emphasized 24 behavioral, psychological and clinical symptoms of autism.Impaired social interaction, restrictive and narrow interests, anxiety, depression; aggressive, repetitive, rigid and self-injurious behavior, lack of consistency, short attention span, fear, shyness and phobias, hypersensitivity and rapid mood alterations, high level of food and toy selectivity; inability to establish friendships or follow the instructions; fascination by round spinning objects and eating non-food materials are common psychological characteristics of autism. Speech or hearing impairments, poor cognitive function, gastrointestinal problems, weak immunity, disturbed sleep and circadian rhythms, weak motor neuromuscular interaction, lower level of serotonin and neurotransmitters, headache and body pain are common physiological symptoms.A variable qualitative and quantitative impact of this wide range of symptoms is perceived in each autistic individual, making him/her distinct, incomparable and exceptional. Selection and application of highly personalized medical and psychological therapies are therefore recommended for the management and treatment of autism.",

Typically children with SETBP1-HD whose intellect is in the normal or borderline range (IQ 80-90) were diagnosed following genetic testing for behavioral problems and/or severe speech and language disorders (respectively: the inability to produce sounds in words correctly, and deficits in the understanding and/or expression of words and sentences). To date, 47 individuals with SETBP1-HD have been reported. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SETBP1-HD is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic loss-of-function variant in SETBP1 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is supportive, often including multidisciplinary specialists from pediatrics, neurology, physiatry, occupational and physical therapy, speech-language pathology, psychiatry, ophthalmology, and medical genetics. Early intervention programs and special education programs may be needed to address developmental disabilities. Surveillance: Monitoring of: feeding and weight gain; developmental/educational progress and needs; speech and language progress and needs; psychiatric and behavioral interventions; ophthalmologic interventions. Genetic counseling SETBP1-HD is an autosomal dominant disorder typically caused by a de novo pathogenic variant. Most probands reported to date whose parents have undergone molecular genetic testing have the disorder as the result of a de novo SETBP1 pathogenic variant. Rarely, individuals with SETBP1-HD may have the disorder as the result of a SETBP1 pathogenic variant inherited from a parent with germline (or somatic and germline) mosaicism. Once the SETBP1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "abstract": "This survey deals with the early diagnosis and treatment of children with developmental dysphasia, which may prevent the progression of learning and behavior disorders. In the pre-verbal and early verbal stage, the severity of the clinical picture is primarily determined by concomitant motor pathology (motor dysfunction, dysarthria, general and oral dyspraxia) and by receptive pathology (hearing and auditory perception). In the verbal period, linguistic problems start to play a role, and often combine with oral motor symptoms to present a mixed picture. Various language syndromes do not become clear until some time later. After the kindergarten period, the oral motor and perceptual problems decrease and the language disorders continue to play a role and influence the child's conversation, internal speech reading and spelling at school. In a relatively small number of children without oral motor, perceptual or memory problems, there can be a basic syndrome of \"pure dysphasia\" without any other neurological signs. In somewhat more than half the patients, the basic syndrome of pure dysphasia is accompanied by other neurological signs. Treatment should not be confined to speech therapy techniques, but can only be optimally given by a highly trained team whose expertise also extends to the schooling aspect.",

      "abstract": "Introduction. Currently, there is an increase in the number of adults in need of speech therapy due to the increased incidence of loss of speech skills due to various causes, including traumatic brain injury. Speech disorders in patients with traumatic brain injury are represented by aphasia, dysarthria, speech mutism, dysphonia, and, less frequently, stuttering. The presence of a speech defect after a craniocerebral trauma reduces patients' communicative abilities, daily life activity, and contributes to their social isolation. Materials and methods. In the course of the study the methods of theoretical analysis of scientific sources of medical-psychological-pedagogical character were used, oriented on studying the current state of rehabilitation of persons with speech pathology among the adult population. Results. Results. At the present stage of development of defectology and, in particular, speech therapy, intensive work is carried out in the health care system to improve speech therapy for adults with speech pathology. In the acute period after stabilisation of vital functions the patient begins to evaluate his condition: difficulties in speech communication, limitation of independent movement, social and domestic incompetence, the possibility of returning to work is questioned. All this leads to depression, to a number of other mental disorders, which are the cause of social deprivation. The assistance provided by a speech therapist at the earliest stages of the disease to a patient with speech pathology is an important link to the successful management of the patient at further stages of rehabilitation, to achieve the maximum level of functioning, social participation and thus improve the quality of life. Discussion and Conclusion. Rehabilitation of adult patients with traumatic brain injury is a multidisciplinary problem, which is located at the junction of sciences: neurology, psychology, defectology, correctional pedagogy and is currently one of the most significant in modern healthcare. Focal and diffuse brain lesions in adults as a result of craniocerebral trauma are often accompanied by gross and persistent disorders of higher mental functions, including speech. At present, research in the field of speech disorders in adults with traumatic brain injury continues with the aim of solving both theoretical and practical problems of diagnosis to establish the nature of speech deficit, the choice of speech therapy tactics and further rehabilitation programme.",

      "title": "The Evolution of ADHD: A Disorder of Communication?",
      "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric condition. Many believe that the central disability is impaired inhibition, which leads to reduced abilities in social skills, self-control, organization and time management. The behaviors identified by clinicians as problematic-inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity-have been incorporated into several evolutionary models as selectively adaptive cognitive skills for surviving the challenges of a variable Pleistocene environment. We propose that the \"disabilities\" exhibited by individuals with ADHD are maladaptive, and we concur with Barkley that there is a central impairment in the behavioral inhibition system. The underlying neural anatomy and physiology support the possibility that neurotransmitter pathology may have an impact on other interlinked systems (including language), and may also account for the frequent comorbidity of aggression, anxiety, depression, and learning disabilities (many of which are language-related). Language skills compete with other cognitive activities for the attentional system, and thus the evolution of language could not in fact be independent of the evolution of attention. If language represents the ultimate expression of the attentional system, and some individuals with ADHD are seriously impaired in the coordination of interlinked neural systems (including language), then ADHD fits Jerome Wakefield's definition of \"harmful dysfunction,\" and communication impairments should be investigated more thoroughly by clinicians.",

      "abstract": "In persons with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), aberrant sensory perceptions could be as characteristic and disruptive as the presence of anomalies in social communication and interaction or restricted and repetitive interests. Most of them present sensory modulation disorders (hyper- or hypo-responsiveness) in several sensory channels. Furthermore, there is a deficit in the integration of the information from a number of sensory systems (for example, auditory and visual). All this would worsen the core symptoms related with communication and increase the appearance of behavioural problems.This study aims to review the experimental evidence that addresses the role played by the prefrontal cortex in unusual sensory experiences in ASD and its involvement in social aspects. There is evidence of hypoactivation and dysfunction of the neural networks, which include the prefrontal cortex and participate in social cognition, such as the default mode and the mirror neuron system in children with ASD.Sensory-motor problems at an early age correspond to a disruption in the organisation and regulation not only of perception and action but also language, thought, emotion and even memory.Papel de la corteza prefrontal en los problemas sensoriales de los niños con trastornos del espectro autista y su implicacion en los aspectos sociales.Introduccion. En las personas con trastornos del espectro autista (TEA), las percepciones sensoriales aberrantes podrian ser tan caracteristicas y disruptivas como la presencia de anomalias en la comunicacion e interaccion social, asi como de intereses restringidos y repetitivos. La mayoria presenta trastornos de la modulacion sensorial (hiper o hiporresponsividad) en varios canales sensoriales. Ademas, muestra un deficit en la integracion de la informacion procedente de varios sistemas sensoriales (por ejemplo, auditivo y visual). Todo ello agravaria los sintomas nucleares relacionados con la comunicacion y aumentaria la aparicion de problemas conductuales. Objetivo. Revisar la evidencia experimental que aborda el papel de la corteza prefrontal en las experiencias sensoriales inusuales en los TEA y su implicacion en los aspectos sociales. Hay evidencia de hipoactivacion y disfuncion en redes neurales, que incluyen la corteza prefrontal y participan en la cognicion social, como la red por defecto y el sistema de neuronas espejo en niños con TEA. Conclusiones. Los problemas sensoriomotores a edad temprana suponen una disrupcion de la organizacion y regulacion no solo de la percepcion y la accion, sino tambien del lenguaje, el pensamiento, la emocion e incluso la memoria.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Many older people with hearing and vision loss experience reduced communicative capacity. Medical treatments (eg. cerumen removal, lens replacement), and ‘;instant’ therapies (eg. slowed speech, close proximity) may improve communication in the short term. In serious cases, specialist therapists may need to implement longer‐term intervention (eg. environmental control, perceptual aids, communication training). Recurrent communication breakdown can have devastating consequences for interpersonal relationships and psychosocial well‐being. Some older people with severe sensory impairment are able to interact only with skilled communication partners. This condition of age‐related communicative dependence on others has major implications for health care and professional education.",

      "abstract": "Dementia is characterized by a decline in memory, language, problem-solving and in other cognitive domains that affect a person's ability to perform everyday activities and social functioning. It is consistently agreed that cognitive impairment is an important risk factor for developing functional disabilities in patients with dementia. Functional status can be conceptualized as the ability to perform self-care, self- maintenance and physical activity. A person with dementia usually requires help with more complex tasks, such as managing bills and finances, or simply maintaining a household. Good functional performance is fundamental for elderly people to maintain independency and avoid institutionalization. The purpose of this review is to describe functional changes in demented patients, evaluating the variability in subgroups of dementias.Demência é caracterizada por declínio na memória, linguagem, resolução de problemas e de outros domínios cognitivos que afetam a capacidade de realização de atividades cotidianas e atividades sociais. É consensual que o comprometimento cognitivo é um importante fator de risco para o desenvolvimento de incapacidades funcionais em pacientes com demência. O status funcional pode ser conceituado como a capacidade de realizar autocuidado, automanutenção e atividade física. Uma pessoa com demência geralmente requer ajuda para tarefas mais complexas, como gerenciar contas e finanças, ou simplesmente realizar atividades domésticas. Um bom desempenho funcional é fundamental para que os idosos mantenham a independência e evitem a institucionalização. O objetivo desta revisão é delinear alterações funcionais em pacientes com demência, valorizando os subgrupos variados de demências.",

      "abstract": "Elderly persons with and without hearing loss experience difficulty listening to speech in background noise, following rapid speech, attending to multiple speakers, or understanding complex messages. When the listening situation is complex or challenging the person expands additional listening effort, which can lead to fatigue, reduced attention, and forgetfulness. Beyond the age-related effects on hearing, known as presbycusis, the central auditory system suffers decline in processing abilities with memory and attention. This common occurrence for the aging brain to experience some decline in functioning, is known as, “central presbycusis”. Specifically related to the auditory system, the brain declines in its ability to listen to speech in noise, dichotic processing which is attending to stimuli in one/both/alternating ears, and temporal processing which is attending to rapid changes in stimuli. Research shows that engaging in cognitively demanding activities like reading, learning, playing games, playing chess, speaking another language, being physically active, engaging in social activities, and playing music can delay and/or reduce cognitive decline and dementia. This paper will further elaborate on the effects of central auditory processing deficits resulting from central presbycusis in the elderly.",

The most common speech symptoms are bradylalia, dysarthria, hypophonia and impaired prosody. Cognitive changes that occur in the prodromal phase of PD include impairment in executive functions and working memory, followed by impairment in attention and verbal fluency, and that is before the motor characteristics of PD become visible. The aim of the study is to present the case of a 74-year-old patient with Parkinson’s disease who has speech and language difficulties and atypical speech disfluency. Diagnostic processing was performed using a clinical battery of tests for speech – language assessment and neuropsychological assessment. The results of the speech – language assessment indicate significantly reduced intelligence due to non-specific speech disfluency and inaccurate articulation, difficulty in organizing spontaneous expression and understanding grammatical structures, impaired phonemic verbal fluency and difficulties in receptive vocabulary. Neuropsychological processing indicated diffuse deterioration of the examined cognitive functioning to be larger than expected when taking ito consideration the age and probably good premorbid abilities of this person.",

These disorders are intrinsic to the individual, presumed to be due to central nervous system dysfunction and may occur across the life span. Problems in self regulatory behaviours, social perception and social interaction may exist with learning disabilities but do not by themselves constitute a learning disability. The DSM IV (APA 1994) introduced the term learning disorders. Learning disorders are of four types: reading disorder, mathematics disorder, disorder of written expression and learning disorder not otherwise specified. But only a few scientific publications have used this terminology. Learning disorder has been addressed by various labels in research literature such as learning disabilities, reading disabilities, specific developmental disorders of scholastic skills, dyslexia, dyscalculia etc. Literature reviewed here includes all of these, as they are conceptually similar.",

      "title": "Developing an International Core Outcome Set for SSD Interventions",
      "abstract": "Unilateral hearing loss or single-sided deafness (SSD) is defined as normal or near-normal hearing in one ear and a severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing impairment in the other ear.1 Common causes of SSD in adulthood include vestibular schwannoma and associated surgery, Ménière's disease, and bacterial or viral infections. SSD affects an estimated 12 to 27 individuals in every 100,000 of the general population.2Shutterstock/Inspiring, hearing loss, deafness, technology.Figure 1: Steps to develop a core outcome set for SSD interventions for adults. Hearing loss, deafness, technology.Difficulties in daily life as a result of SSD vary considerably from person to person. Functional difficulties in everyday life are commonly reported, such as difficulties in speech perception in noisy environments and poor spatial awareness. SSD can also negatively affect one's psychological well-being, resulting in worries about losing one's hearing in the other ear and/or reduced confidence and belief in one's abilities to participate in social situations. Various social impacts of SSD can result from activity limitations and participation restrictions, including withdrawal from and within situations.3 The multidimensional burden of SSD on an individual's overall health is indicated by reductions in health-related quality of life.4 Interventions like a contralateral routing of signals (CROS) aid or a bone conduction device aim to alleviate the impact of SSD by rerouting signals from the impaired ear to the better-hearing ear.5 In the past decade, we have seen the introduction of cochlear implantation,6 which restores hearing by delivering information directly to the impaired side, thus creating a sensation of true binaural hearing. TREATMENT CHALLENGES The challenge faced by people diagnosed with SSD, health care professionals, and clinical researchers is understanding which intervention (if any) is ideal.7 How can we measure the benefits or harms associated with an intervention for SSD? Existing literature has highlighted inconsistencies in the benefits and risks (side effects), or outcome domains, assessed when evaluating these interventions. For example, clinical studies that evaluate these interventions have measured performances such as speech perception in quiet or noisy environments and sound localization. Studies have also assessed tinnitus symptom severity and quality of life. The tests (measurement instruments) that researchers have chosen to measure these effects also vary widely from study to study. For example, sound localization can be measured using a setup of four loudspeakers arranged at the front, back, and sides (90 degrees apart) or a more complex setup of six loudspeakers arranged in a semi-circle in front of the participant (30 degrees apart). This diversity of chosen measures poses a challenge to both health care users and professionals when comparing and contrasting various study outcomes. In some cases, researchers choose available measures because they are standardized or easily accessible, and not because of their importance to health care users or professionals themselves. ADDRESSING THE INCONSISTENCY Identifying appropriate outcome domains is crucial to designing clinical trials to evaluate the effects of various interventions for SSD.8 Selected outcomes need to be vital and tailored to key stakeholders such as health care users, professionals, or budget holders to minimize bias when making decisions about health care.9 Furthermore, the choice of outcome measures should be based on what is important and of interest to people making decisions about health care, not on what outcome instruments are available or most commonly used. The Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative just celebrated its 10th anniversary. The network brings together researchers interested in the development of agreed and standardized sets of outcomes, known as core outcome sets. Part of the COMET work focuses on developing recommendations on minimum standards for the design of core outcome set (COS) studies.10 A COS is a recommendation of what should be measured and reported in all trials in a specific area as a minimum. If developed from the perspectives of all relevant stakeholders, a COS can overcome the problems imposed by the utilization of diverse measures. In the field of audiology and ENT, a group led by Professor Deborah A. Hall at the University of Nottingham has developed a COS for tinnitus.11 Professor Iain A. Bruce and his team at the NIHR Manchester Biomedical Research Centre are working on the PONCHO study: Prioritizing Outcomes iN Childhood Hearing lOss. THE CROSSSD STUDY The Core Rehabilitation Outcome Set for Single-Sided Deafness (CROSSSD) project is an international initiative that aims to develop a COS for SSD interventions. It aims to find an agreement on what outcomes are critical and should always be measured when evaluating interventions for SSD, using the methodology proposed by the COMET initiative. We have an advisory group of clinical professionals from the United Kingdom, United States, and Europe. The CROSSSD project also works closely with people who have lived experience of SSD. They have been integral to the design and delivery of the CROSSSD study. For example, a promotional video (http://bit.ly/2QbLJk) was developed alongside collaborators with lived experience of SSD to increase awareness of the project and help with global participant recruitment. Our methodology is as follows (Fig. 1): Systematic review of the published literature reporting interventions for SSD to identify the outcome domains and measurement instruments that have already been used.12 Workshops using a range of qualitative methods to explore patient perspectives on outcomes. Interactive online consensus exercise, known as a Delphi survey, with key stakeholders to identify which outcome domains are important when evaluating SSD interventions. Interactive consensus meeting with a subgroup of the key stakeholders to discuss the Delphi survey findings and recommend a minimum set of outcome domains that are relevant to all. So far, we have completed the systematic review of the literature. From 72 papers, we identified a total of 244 outcome domains. Many of these were duplicates or not directly relevant to SSD, and so we were able to produce a shortened list of 44 unique candidate outcome domains. The Delphi survey engaged 277 participants from 30 countries. They suggested five additional candidate outcome domains. The e-Delphi concluded in February 2020 and the CROSSSD team are currently preparing for the interactive consensus meeting to finalize the core outcome domain set. FUTURE STEPS Once a COS is developed, we would know what is important to measure in all studies; however researchers also need to consider how the included outcomes should be measured. The COSMIN (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments) international initiative has collaborated with the COMET initiative to develop guidelines for selecting outcome measurement instruments for outcomes included in a COS.13 For instance, if quality of life is an outcome in a COS, indicated to be critical and important to always measure for SSD interventions, COSMIN standards can help us establish what commonly agreed instrument or questionnaire everyone should utilize to measure it. Appropriate dis emination strategies14 will ensure that anyone designing a trial in this area will have a list of outcomes to measure as a minimum, alongside a list of recommended instruments to utilize. The COS will not prevent researchers from measuring additional outcomes or utilizing supplementary instruments. Future studies in the field should adopt the recommended COS to reduce the heterogeneity of measures utilized. Moreover, only outcomes meaningful to all stakeholders will be employed and, as a result, transparency will be established since both benefits and harms will be reported. Clinical researchers will be supported in thinking critically about what they are trying to measure, and they will not select their outcomes simply based on the popularity or accessibility of available instruments. Uptake of the COS will be encouraged internationally to improve research quality, enhance clinical decision-making, and facilitate meta-analysis in systematic reviews.

      "abstract": "Of the various areas of cognition that may be compromised by acquired neurological trauma or disease, attention deficits are perhaps the most pervasive.[1] Attention, like other cognitive constructs, is viewed as a multifaceted cognitive system reliant on the complex and dynamic interactions of numerous brain regions, including cortical, subcortical, and brainstem structures. Consequently, patients representing the spectrum of acquired neurogenic communication disorders commonly have attention deficits, although the qualitative and quantitative natures of these deficits can vary among the different patient populations. Because of the diversity of attention deficits that can occur in patients with brain damage, clinicians must be able to differentiate these attention disorders and design interventions accordingly. Knowledge of attention functions and disorders is also important because other aspects of cognition (e.g., working memory, inhibition, language) depend on the integrity of attention,[2] [3] placing patients with attention disorders at risk for a variety of other cognitive impairments.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Intellectual disability (ID) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in intellectual and adaptive functioning that begins during the developmental period. The case describes a child with Fragile X syndrome, the most common inherited cause of ID. Adaptive functioning deficits include difficulty acquiring age-appropriate conceptual, social, and practical skills. There are many causes of ID including genetic, environmental, and idiopathic etiologies. The assessment of ID includes evaluating for underlying and/or associated medical conditions and neuropsychological testing to evaluate the child’s cognitive and functional abilities. The severity of ID is determined by the child’s functional abilities. Components of treatment may include speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, family counseling and respite care, behavioral interventions, and educational interventions. Families should also be educated on transition-to-adulthood topics including guardianship. Pharmacologic treatments can be used to treat behavioral symptoms, sleep difficulty, or comorbid psychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Patients with mild cognitive impairment may present deficits in naming, speech production, oral comprehension and written comprehension. In the differential diagnosis, cerebrovascular disease that can lead to cognitive impairment must also be differentiated from endogenous depressive disorder or language impairment. Objectives The aim is to highlight the importance of differential diagnosis in cognitive disorders in relation to a case. Methods A 68-year-old female patient attended a psychiatric consultation derived from neurology when presenting a language disorder. The husband who accompanies her and the patient indicate that she has problems finding words and substitutes other expressions for them or sometimes does not answer or does so with something different from the topic that is being asked. She refers that she presents repetitive language with memory problems, alteration in the evocation of memories. The patient reports mood swings and irritability and crying with a low tolerance for frustration since she cannot express herself. Cranial MRI: cortical and central involutional changes. Periventricular leukoaraiosis and ischemic gliosis-like lesions in the white matter of both hemispheres. Psychopathological exploration: Conscious, oriented. She smiles at the questions but doesn’t answer them. Repetitive language. Alteration in the articulation of language. Depressed mood reactive to current situation. Some irritability Alteration in recent memory and evocation. Results She was diagnosed with organic mental disorder compatible with mild cognitive impairment. Treatment with rehabilitation of the language disorder of vascular etiology is established. Conclusions Imaging and neuropsychological tests should always be performed in a patient with language, memory, and mood disorders to study its etiology. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "abstract": "Velopharyngeal dysfunction (VPD) refers to any situation in which an individual is unable to completely close the nasal airway during speech.The velopharyngeal mechanism is comprised of a complex group of structures that act in unison to control airflow through the nose and mouth by elevation of the soft palate and constriction of both the lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls (►Fig. 1).Any disruption in this mechanism may result in abnormal, poorly intelligible speech.VPD can manifest as hypernasality, nasal emission, decreased vocal intensity, and/or facial grimacing. 1Moreover, patients who suffer from VPD will frequently develop maladaptive articulations to compensate for their speech difficulties. 2umerous etiologies can be responsible for this failure of normal speech production.Myoneurogenic problems can impair muscle control or affect muscle programming.Anatomic irregularities can present as a tissue deficit, structural problems that affect function, or even mechanical interference preventing normal closure.Mislearning comprises a host of etiologies whereby the patient has developed abnormal usage of the velopharyngeal mechanism despite the absence of other pathology. 3elopharyngeal dysfunction is a carefully chosen term that simply denotes the presence of incomplete velopharyngeal closure without making suggestions as to its cause.Use of this nomenclature has gained increasing favor by experts, replacing the previous designation, velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI).This helps to avoid confusion, as VPI has been differentially interpreted as denoting insufficiency, incompetence, and inadequacy-terms that may be similar, but are not synonymous and potentially implicate the cause of the dysfunction rather than describe the clinical finding.VPD is seen in roughly 20 to 30% of individuals who have undergone cleft palate repair, 4,5 and 5 to 10% of patients with a submucous cleft palate (SMCP). 6",

      "abstract": "Delirium, also called as organic brain syndrome, acute brain syndrome, acute brain failure, acute confusional episode and reversible or masked dementia, as a concept, stretches back to the age of Hypocrates (Burns et al., 2004).Delirium is described as a condition characterized by a disturbance of consciousness with reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Classification of M e n t a l D i s o r d e r s , F o u r t h E d i t i o n , T e x t R e v i s i o n ( D S M -I V -T R ) c r i t e r i a ( A m e r i c a n Psychiatric Association, 2000).Also, delirium involves a change in cognition (such as memory deficit, disorientation, language disturbance) or the development of a perceptual disturbance that is not better accounted for by a preexisting, established, or evolving dementia (American Psychiatric Association, 2000).In addition to these, impairment in the brain's ability to integrate perceptions correctly, coupled with memory deficits and confusion may result in psychotic symptoms in delirium.Hallucinations (especially visual and tactile), delusions, paranoia, illusions, and bizarre behavior are the commonly encountered psychotic symptoms in delirium (Leigh, 2008).Delirium is associated with longer hospital stay, poorer functional outcome, and cognitive decline in addition to an elevated morbidity and mortality.Despite these adverse outcomes, delirium recognition rates are low (12-43%) and its management remains inadequate in up to 80% of patients (Morrison et al., 2003).These findings suggest lack of preventive and screening activities, missed diagnoses, and inappropriate management of diagnosed delirium (Michaud et al., 2007). Epidemiology PrevalenceThe prevalence of delirium varies with the population that is being studied (Fong et al., 2009).Delirium is a relatively common disorder, especially in older people with physical illness (Saxena & Lawley, 2009).Community rates of delirium are reported to vary from 0.4% to 2% (Saxena & Lawley, 2009, Fong et al., 2009).In general hospital setting prevalence of delirium has been reported to range from 11% to 33% on admission (Lindesay et al.,",

      "abstract": "Abstracts Following right hemisphere lesions, adults' speech can become copious and inappropriate, with abnormal prosody, and they may be unable to comprehend metaphor or humour. Their symptoms resemble those of children with semantic‐pragmatic language disorder, who use fluent, grammatically complex language, but with poor sensitivity to the communicative situation. The hyperlexia found in some of these children reflects an underlying cognitive problem in integrating semantic information with knowledge of the world. Both groups of patients fail to comprehend inferential meaning or to make use of paralinguistic features. It is hypothesised that the disorders of communication and cognition found in semantic‐pragmatic language disorder may be linked to right hemisphere dysfunction, but this has yet to be confirmed by research. A la suite de lésions de l'hémisphère droit, la parole d'adultes peut devenir désordonnée et mal à propos, avec une prosodie anormale, et il arrive aussi que ces adultes soient incapables de comprendre les métaphores ou l'humour. Leurs symptômes ressemblent à ceux d'enfants avec des troubles du langage sémantico‐pragmatique, qui utilisent avec aisance un language complexe grammaticalement, mais avec peu de sensibilité à la situation de communication. L'hyperlexie trouvée chez certains de ces enfants reflète un problème cognitif sousjacent lié à l'intégration d'informations sémantiques avec des connaissances du monde. Les deux groupes de patients n'arrivent pas à comprendre les raisonnements inférentiels ou à utiliser des traits paralinguistiques. L'hypothèse suivante est suggérée: les troubles de la communication et de la cognition trouvés dans les troubles du langage sémantico‐pragmatique peuvent être liés à un dysfonctionnement de l'hémisphère droit, mais des recherches complémentaires sont nécessaires pour étayer ce point de vue. Nach Läsionen der rechten Hemisphäre können die Sprechäusserungen von Erwachsenen wortreich und unpassend werden, mit abnormer Prosodie. Unter Umständen sind sie unfähig, Metaphoren oder Humor zu verstehen. Ihre Symptome sind denen von Kindern ähnlich, die unter einer semantisch‐pragmatische Sprachstörung leiden und eine fliessende, grammatisch komplexe Sprache benutzen, aber mit geringem Feingefühl für die kommunikative Situation. Die Hyperlexie, der man bei manchen dieser Kinder begegnet, lässt ein grundliegendes, kognitives Problem biem Integrieren der semantischen Information mit ihren Kenntnissen der Umwelt erkennen. Bei beiden Patientengruppen fehlt das Verständnis für ableitbare Bedeutung oder die Anwendung paraliguistischer Eigenschaften. Wir stellen die Hypothese vor, dass Störungen der Kommunikation und der Kognition, die man bei der semantisch‐pragmatischen Sprachstörung findet, mit der Dysfunktion in der rechten Hemisphäre verbunden seien, aber dies muss erst noch durch weitere Forschung bestätigt werden.",

There are data that prove the fact that patients with bipolar disorder show cognitive deficits in all stages of the disorder, but also during remission phases. Within bipolar disorder, bipolar depression occurs more frequently, lasts longer and has a higher rate of relapses than mania. Bipolar patients usually complain of cognitive deficits such as attentional or memory deficits Patients with bipolar disorder experiment during depressive episodes dysfunctions in attention (difficulties in focusing and maintaining attention), memory (deficits of declarative and nondeclarative memory, affected verbal recall and recognition), language (bradyphemia with longer moments of pause during speech), psychomotor performance (psychomotor inhibition, slowness of motor functions when the number of tasks increases), executive functions (limited ability to acquire or relearn different skills), general intellectual functioning (information processing deficits). Recent studies have made some suggestion regarding a certain degree of cognitive impairment that is also found in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder. In order to have a more accurate assessment regarding the degree of cognitive dysfunctions both during depressive episodes and euthymic phases in bipolar disorder, diagnosis criteria for depression and for remission should be strictly respected and coexisting factors that may influence the results should not be taken in consideration.",

      "title": "Learning Disorders: Beyond Dyslexia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Learning disabilities (LD) – the unexpected academic difficulties experienced by many otherwise typically developing persons – are highly heterogeneous in nature. Thus, while at the academic level 80–90% of individuals with LD suffer from poor reading fluency and/or accuracy, at the cognitive level multiple processes are implicated including language, attention, perception and memory. Similarly, at the biological level many brain systems and processes are affected. In the auditory system alone, individuals with LD were shown to process sound abnormally at all levels of the auditory pathway from the brainstem to high level cortical areas. Taken together, current research suggests that a single core deficit model is unlikely to account for the aetiology of LD and furthermore, that the observed pattern of academic strengths and weaknesses is affected little by differences in underlying processes. Therefore, it appears that different underlying vulnerabilities result in similar academic outcomes. Key Concepts Physiological and perceptual processing of the acoustic elements of sound such as its duration, frequency, rate of presentation, etc. The concurrent occurrence of two disorders.

      "abstract": "Apart from well-known and proven consequences such as motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease and dementia in Alzheimer's disease, the neurological consequences of these diseases also cause cognitive and linguistic changes. People with Parkinson's disease have obvious deficits in reading physical books due to broken hand motion, inability to manipulate fingers and joints, and shaking their hands making them trouble turning pages. The same deficits give rise to difficulties in the performance of writing skills causing micrographia. In addition, reading difficulties occur due to impaired visual processing, and problems arise also with the reading comprehension. In Alzheimer's disease, difficulties occur at the level of phonology and semantics, the lexical orthographic processing and visual processing are disturbed which is all reflected in reading in this population. During the act of writing, planning, sequencing, and organization at the level of letters, words, sentences and performance at narrative levels is disturbed. The range and complexity of the grammatical structures is also weakened.Difficulties in reading and writing have been shown to be a sensitive indicator of language dysfunction in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the deficit at different levels of reading and writing can help speech and language pathologysts to develop therapy strategies and improve the overall communication and functioning of the people of this population.",

      "abstract": "Oral language disorders constitute a group of syndromes with a high prevalence among the childhood population. They form a heterogeneous group that ranges from simple problems in articulating a phoneme (dyslalias) to severe disorders affecting communication, such as children's dysarthrias and aphasias. In this paper our objective is to review the neuropsychological profiles of children who manifest different oral language disorders.Due to the wide range of clinical pictures and causations covered by children's oral language disorders, very few systematic reviews have been conducted to obtain an overall view of the neuropsychological profiles of these children. Although the linguistic signs and symptoms of these disorders are well understood, the associated neuropsychological signs and symptoms have not been studied. In some cases, these neuropsychological signs cause greater learning problems in children than the actual language problems themselves.Childhood language disorders are associated with different neuropsychological problems. The most commonly associated neuropsychological deficits are problems involving memory, attention, executive functions, motor dysfunctions, temporal perception, tactile recognition, body scheme, spatial orientation and difficulties in visual discrimination. Mnemonic disorders (essentially in short-term and working auditory memory) are usually a common denominator in the different clinical pictures that make up language disorders. The mnemonic impairment associated to dyslalias deserves special attention as this disorder is sometimes similar to that seen in language problems deriving from clinical pictures with important neurological alterations.",

In one profile, dysfunction of semantic memory and damage to temporal lobe brain structures correspond to a deficit at producing irregular and other memory-dependent inflected forms. Alzheimer’s disease, Semantic dementia, Herpes Simplex Encephalitis, and Williams syndrome fall into this first pattern. In patients with a different profile, motor dysfunction and damage to frontal/basal-ganglia circuits corresponds to abnormal production of regular affixed forms, though retrieval deficits affecting production of irregular forms can also be found. This pattern encompasses (at least) Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, Tourette’s syndrome, autism, and schizophrenia. Both patterns hold cross-linguistically, across (at least) English, Italian, Greek, French, and German, and are discussed in light of diverse neurocognitive perspectives of morphology and language.",

Other common findings are failure to thrive and feeding problems in infancy that persist into childhood, heart defects (especially patent ductus arteriosus), gastrointestinal disorders (including gastroesophageal reflux disease), and dental abnormalities. To date findings in fewer than 50 affected individuals have been reported. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of the 3q29 recurrent deletion is established by detection of the 1.6-Mb heterozygous deletion by chromosomal microarray at the approximate position of chr3:195998129-197623129 in the reference genome (NCBI Build 38). Management Treatment of manifestations: Early speech and language therapy to address speech delays; physical therapy as needed to address fine and gross motor delays; individualized education program (IEP) for school-age children; care by a child psychiatrist/psychologist as needed for neuropsychiatric disorders; feeding therapy and consideration of gastrostomy tube as needed; routine management of dental caries, congenital heart defects, recurrent ear infections. Surveillance: Continued assessment of feeding and nutrition, developmental milestones, cognitive development, and possible neuropsychiatric manifestations. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Parents and older and younger sibs of a proband should be tested for the 3q29 recurrent deletion to encourage close assessment/monitoring of developmental milestones (in children) and monitoring for neuropsychiatric manifestations (in children and adults). Genetic counseling The 3q29 recurrent deletion is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Although most deletions are de novo, inherited deletions have been reported. If the 3q29 recurrent deletion identified in the proband is not identified in one of the parents, the risk to sibs is low (",

      "title": "The biological basis of injury and neuroprotection in the fetal and neonatal brain",
      "abstract": "Abstract A compromised intrauterine environment that delivers low levels of oxygen and/or nutrients, or is infected or inflammatory, can result in fetal brain injury, abnormal brain development and in cases of chronic compromise, intrauterine growth restriction. Preterm birth can also be associated with injury to the developing brain and affect the normal trajectory of brain growth. This review will focus on the effects that episodes of perinatal hypoxia (acute, chronic, associated with inflammation or as an antecedent of preterm birth) can have on the developing brain. In animal models of these conditions we have found that relatively brief (acute) periods of fetal hypoxemia can have significant effects on the fetal brain, for example death of susceptible neuronal populations (cerebellum, hippocampus, cortex) and cerebral white matter damage. Chronic placental insufficiency which includes fetal hypoxemia, nutrient restriction and altered endocrine status can result in fetal growth restriction and long‐term deficits in neural connectivity in addition to altered postnatal function, for example in the auditory and visual systems. Maternal/fetal inflammation can result in fetal brain damage, particularly but not exclusively in the white matter; injury is more pronounced when associated with fetal hypoxemia. In the baboon, in which the normal trajectory of growth is affected by preterm birth, there is a direct correlation between a higher flux in oxygen saturation and a greater extent of neuropathological damage. Currently, the only established therapy for neonatal encephalopathy in full term neonates is moderate hypothermia although this only offers some protection to moderately but not severely affected brains. There is no accepted therapy for injured preterm brains. Consequently the search for more efficacious treatments continues; we discuss neuroprotective agents (erythropoietin, N‐acetyl cysteine, melatonin, creatine, neurosteroids) which we have trialed in appropriate animal models. The possibility of combining hypothermia with such agents or growth factors is now being considered. A deeper understanding of causal pathways in brain injury is essential for the development of efficacious strategies for neuroprotection.",

      "title": "GRIN2A-Related Speech Disorders and Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics GRIN2A-related speech disorders and epilepsy are characterized by speech disorders in all affected individuals and a range of epilepsy syndromes present in about 90%. Severe speech disorders observed can include dysarthria and speech dyspraxia, and both receptive and expressive language delay/regression; more mildly affected individuals may display subtly impaired intelligibility of conversational speech. Epilepsy features include seizure onset usually between ages three and six years, focal epilepsy with language and/or global developmental regression, and electroencephalogram (EEG) showing continuous spike-and-wave discharges in sleep or very active centrotemporal discharges. Seizure types include seizures associated with aura of perioral paresthesia, focal or focal motor seizures (often evolving to generalized tonic-clonic), and atypical absence seizures. Epilepsy syndromes can include: Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS), epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike-and-wave during sleep (ECSWS), childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (CECTS), atypical childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (ACECTS), autosomal dominant rolandic epilepsy with speech dyspraxia (ADRESD), and infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathy. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of a GRIN2A-related speech disorder and epilepsy is established in a proband by the identification of a GRIN2A heterozygous pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Significant speech/language deficits require therapy from a speech pathologist. Seizures should be treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Many different AEDs may be effective, and no one medication has been demonstrated to be effective specifically for these disorders. Prevention of secondary complications: Monitoring for possible adverse effects of AEDs. Surveillance: Developmental surveillance in all affected children; routine monitoring of speech and language by a speech pathologist should be considered for all children, particularly those diagnosed before reaching school age. Agents/circumstances to avoid: In individuals with ECSWS, phenytoin, barbiturates and carbamazepine should be avoided as they are rarely effective, may worsen the EEG, and have negative effects on neuropsychological outcomes. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic at-risk relatives in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt evaluation for speech disorders and/or seizures and institution of treatment. Genetic counseling GRIN2A-related speech disorders and epilepsy are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The proportion of GRIN2A-related speech disorders and epilepsy caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is unknown. Each child of an individual with a GRIN2A-related speech disorder and epilepsy has a 50% chance of inheriting the GRIN2A pathogenic variant. Once the GRIN2A pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "abstract": "Summary Deafness does not in itself cause emotional/behavioural or cognitive problems or psychiatric disorders. However, children with hearing impairment are at greater risk of developing emotional/behavioural problems and neurodevelopmental disorders. The incidence of both seems to be higher in deaf children from hearing families. Most prelingual deafness is caused by recessive genes; hence, most deaf individuals come from hearing families, the majority of whom do not use sign language. Numerous studies, in both hearing and deaf populations, show how the lack of access to language has an impact on the emotional development of children. This article focuses on the mechanisms by which early language deprivation mediates emotional/behavioural difficulties and consequent emotional dysregulation, and may produce behaviours and symptoms that can be misdiagnosed as neurodevelopmental disorders in deaf children and adolescents (from infancy to 18 years of age).",

      "title": "Screening and a comprehensive special educational diagnostic assessment of five-year-old children with developmental coordination disorder",
      "abstract": "Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests itself as difficulties in acquisition and execution of coordinated motor skills, and difficulties that are manifested as clumsiness as well as slowness and inaccuracy of performance of motor skills. This motor skills deficit significantly and persistently interferes with activities of daily living, and impacts academic/school productivity, prevocational and vocational activities, leisure, and play. Difficulties in specific motor skills performance are long-standing and non-progressive. Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period, and motor skills deficits are not better explained by intellectual disability or visual impairment and are not attributable to a neurological condition affecting movement. It occurs in approximately 7% of children, and is more common in boys. It is more common in children with low birth weight, in prematurely born children, and in children with attention disorders, autistic spectrum disorders, or with speech and language disorders. Children with DCD are too often identified in school, and not sooner. \r\nThe main purpose of our quantitative and qualitative research was to identify children with DCD, and apply our comprehensive special educational diagnostic assessment of children with DCD before entering school. \r\nIn the first part of the study, a screening procedure was carried out using 3 tests (the Movement ABC, the Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration and the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire), which included 196 five-year-olds from Ljubljana public kindergartens. \r\nIn our given sample there were 6.6% of children with clinical signs of DCD, 1.5% of them with severe motor problems in terms of DCD. Male to female ratio was 1.6:1. In the borderline DCD group ratio was equal between genders. Results of children with DCD were statistically different from the results of children without DCD in all three tests and in all parts of the tests.\r\nIn the second, qualitative part of the study, 5 case studies involving boys with presumable DCD were analised, based on comprehensive diagnostic assessment using established diagnostic assessment tools, on interviews with parents and professional staff in kindergartens, on the observation and assessment of children's competences in activities of daily living, and on the assessment of children’s individual developmental achievements. \r\nResults showed no specific deviations in term of social factors for the assessed children with DCD. Analysis of the developmental factors, on the other hand, showed different risk factors in early childhood. As expected, the assessed children had problems in gross motor skills, motor planning, lateral dominance, fine motor skills, perception, and in activities of daily living (slowness, difficulties in dressing themselves, in feeding, personal care, and a specific play). Some difficulties were also encountered in individual’s communication, speech and language, some had difficulties in the socio-emotional domain, some with motivation, and some had attention difficulties. Their strengths were in the verbal domain and in cognitive abilities. \r\nBased on our findings, we developed a two-stage model of identification and a comprehensive special educational diagnostic assessment of five-year-old children with DCD. In our final model, the screening process included only the Movement ABC and the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire. A wide range of other diagnostic assessment tools, observation and information received from significant others was included in the later comprehensive diagnostic assessment, for which we proposed a wider range of the team of professionals, that is to take a more interdisciplinary approach. In the end, our research showed a diversity of the DCD phenomenon, an importance of assessing both strengths and difficulties in a child, and a poor insight of child's significant others into his developmental achievements. \r\nFurthermore, some other important and currently not yet researched DCD aspects were found, such as a higher prevalence of girls than expected in a group of children with a borderline DCD, the exceptional psychometric properties of Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire, which was applied to preschool teachers, and finally, the important role of assessing strengths in children with DCD.",

      "abstract": "Childhood maltreatment is a significant risk factor for a host of psychiatric, developmental, medical, and neurocognitive conditions, often resulting in debilitating and long-term consequences. However, there is no available neuropsychological resource reviewing the literature on the associated neurocognitive deficits in children and adolescents. This review comprehensively examines the 23 prior studies that evaluated the intellectual, language, visual-spatial, memory, motor, and/or attention/executive functions in children and adolescents following an experience of childhood abuse and/or neglect. Neurocognitive impairments were frequently reported. Impairments in executive functions were the most frequent and severe reported impairments, although intelligence, language, visual-spatial skills, and memory are also at serious risk for compromised development following maltreatment. However, specific factors such as abuse/neglect duration, severity, type, and timing during development were all associated with neurocognition. This indicates that these factors are of greater importance than just the presence of abuse/neglect in identifying risk for neurocognitive compromise. Such neurocognitive deficits appear to be a consequence to the known neurobiological and brain development abnormalities of this population, suggesting traumatic stress can be a potential cause of neurodevelopmental disorders. These findings have critical implications for the clinical practice and research involving children following childhood maltreatment and other types of traumatic stress.",

Kao posljedica navedenih simptoma, javljaju se složene komunikacijske potrebe. Ljudi su drustvena bica i kao takvima komunikacija je nemjerljivo bitan aspekt svakodnevnog života. U Republici Hrvatskoj oko 53 000 osoba živi s nekim oblikom neuroloskog deficitia kao posljedicom moždanog udara.

Osim poremecaja govora, moždani udar kroz razlicite promjene i deficite utjece na sposobnost komunikacije. Kod mnogih su pacijenata prisutne prisutni neki od sljedecih simptoma; emocionalne promjene, perceptivne promjene, poremecaji pamcenja i koncentracije, promjene raspoloženja. Na rehabilitaciju afazije, kao komunikacijske teskoce, gleda se kroz terapijske ciljeve koji se odnose na povecanje komunikacije dosezanjem maksimalnog potencijala, uklanjanje barijera u adaptaciji, prihvacanje razlika, podupiranje psihickog zdravlja, podupiranje nezavisnosti, te na unaprjeđenje zdravlja i prevenciju bolesti. U rehabilitaciji komunikacijskih sposobnosti sudjeluje tim strucnjaka koji se najcesce sastoje od logopeda, fizioterapeuta, radnog terapeuta, rehabilitatora te ostalih strucnjaka. Sredisnje mjesto u rehabilitacijskom timu zauzima pacijent sa svojom obitelji.

      "abstract": "Children who have difficulty producing age-appropriate, intelligible speech form a diverse \ngroup in terms of the presenting characteristics and the underlying reasons for their difficulty. \nFor some children, difficulties occur as a secondary consequence of primary conditions such as \nhearing impairment, anatomical abnormalities (e.g. cleft palate), motor deficits (e.g. cerebral \npalsy), developmental syndromes (e.g. Down Syndrome or Autism Spectrum Disorder) or \ngeneral learning difficulties. For the majority of children, however, difficulties occur in the \nabsence of any overt organic cause. These children are described as having specific speech \nimpairment (SSI) and will be the focus of this chapter.\n Children with SSI account for the highest rate of referral to paediatric speech and language \ntherapy services. Prevalence rates are notoriously difficult to establish but are believed to be in \nthe region of 10-15 per cent of pre-schoolers and 6 per cent of school-age children (Williams \net al. 2010).\n In some cases, SSI may resolve spontaneously. However, for many children, difficulties \npersist and can significantly impact on their social-emotional and/or academic development. \nChildren who still have difficulty making themselves understood at school entry are at greater \nrisk of peer rejection and social isolation than their intelligible peers. They are also likely to \nexperience difficulties learning to read and spell since phonological processing skills underpin \nboth clear speech and early literacy development (Gillon 2004). Fortunately, there is a substantial and growing evidence base that appropriately targeted intervention for this clinical group \nis\thighly\teffective\t(Gierut\t1998;\tLaw\tet al. 2004).",

      "title": "Introduction and overview of offenders with intellectual disabilities",
      "abstract": "Abstract Intellectual disability (according to the DSM-5) or intellectual developmental disorder (according to the ICD-11) is a disorder with onset during the developmental period that includes both intellectual and adaptive functioning deficits in conceptual, social and practical domains. The term learning disability (LD) is also used, although this term shows more specifically deficits in the domain of learning. The term learning difficulties is often used for specific or generalized intellectual impairment that does not meet all of the criteria of LD. The prevalence of learning disability in prisoners is about 10%. Up to 60% of male prisoners have learning difficulties. Prevalence rates for offending behaviour in patients with LD is higher than in the general population and show a large range, from 2-40%. The main explanatory factor underlying the link between intelligence and offending is the lack of ability to manipulate abstract concepts. Poor academic performance, common in persons with LD, is also linked to offending. With regard to sexual offending, some persons with LD may not have learnt the rules that define acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. Sexual offences may amount to inappropriate, impulsive expressions of emotion rather than premediated violent acts. Violent behaviour in the LD population may be due to frustration, impulsivity or poor problem solving skills. There is no significant difference in the frequency of violent or property offences between individuals with LD and those without. However, sex offences and fire-setting are frequently seen in individuals with LD. Persons with LD are vulnerable suspects and may also be disadvantaged by the criminal justice system because of a lack of appropriate support and legal representation from early stages in the process. In this introductory paper these themes will be addressed. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

Voice disorders are defined, their frequency of occurrence across the life span is reported, and their impact on the lives of individuals with voice disorders is documented. The goal of voice treatment is to maximize vocal effectiveness given the existing disorder and to reduce the handicapping effect of the voice problem. Voice treatment may be (a) the preferred treatment to resolve the voice disorder when medical (surgical or pharmacological) treatments are not indicated; (b) the initial treatment in cases where medical treatment appears indicated; it may obviate the need for medical treatment; (c) completed before and after surgical treatment to maximize long-term post-surgical voice; and (d) a preventative treatment to preserve vocal health. Experimental and clinical data are reviewed that support these roles applied to various disorder types: (a) vocal misuse, hyperfunction and muscular imbalance (frequently resulting in edema, vocal nodules, polyps or contact ulcers); (b) medical or physical conditions (e.g., laryngeal nerve trauma, Parkinson disease); and (c) psychogenic disorders (e.g., conversion reactions, personality disorders). Directions for future research are suggested which maximize clinical outcomes and scientific rigor to enhance knowledge on the efficacy of voice treatment.",

Patients with major neurocognitive disorder experience significant cognitive decline in complex attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, perceptual-motor, and social cognition. The chapter also discusses mental disorders due to another medical condition. These patients can experience psychotic, mood, or anxious symptoms or a personality change; their intellectual functioning usually remains intact. A patient presenting with a first episode of psychiatric symptoms and no prior psychiatric history should be evaluated for an acute medical etiology causing the psychiatric symptoms, particularly if he or she is over 40 years of age. Anticholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine) may slow the rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease, and the combination of an anticholinesterase inhibitor and memantine may be more effective than either medication alone.",

Thus, a critical review of the literature was conducted searching the literature for evidence contributing to a more detailed description of apraxia and its clinical patterns, physiopathology and clinico-anatomical correlations, as well as apraxia assessment.A apraxia é um distúrbio da realização de gestos ou atos motores aprendidos sem que haja anormalidades em canais sensoriais aferentes ou motores eferentes, deterioração intelectual, nem alteração de atenção ou de compreensão dos comandos verbais.

      "abstract": "Semantic dementia (SD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by atrophy of the anterior temporal regions and progressive loss of semantic memory. SD has recently been reported to be associated with a pathologic diagnosis of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with Tar DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) immunoreactive inclusions (FTLD-TDP) type 2 by Mackenzie. In the first several years of the disease, SD patients, especially those with left hemisphere-dominant temporal atrophy, present with primary progressive aphasia, in which language deterioration is obvious; however, they do not have other cognitive and behavioral impairments. The language impairment in SD is termed as word meaning aphasia, in which patients experience both word finding difficulties and word recognizing difficulties (two-way anomia). Phonemic cues are not effective in improving anomia. In addition, SD patients do not experience a sense of familiarity with words that they cannot find or recognize. While reading and writing Japanese words, SD patients, except those who also have motor neuron disease, exhibit well-preserved kana (phonogram) processing. However, in the case of kanji, they often exhibit surface dyslexia while reading and also exhibit phonetic miswriting. In the aphasic stage, SD patients can explain what the objects are and can use them appropriately; however, they cannot find or recognize the names of the objects. On progressing to the semantic memory impairment stage, the patients do not exhibit any familiarity with the objects whose names they cannot find or recognize and are unable to appropriately use these objects. Semantic memory impairment in SD is attributed to damage of gray matter and of superior and inferior white matter connections in the anterior temporal lobe.",

      "abstract": "Aphasia can be defined as an acquired deficit in language processing due to dysfunction in specific areas of the brain. The classic aphasias (Broca's, Wernicke's and Global) are representative of impairment in the very epicenters of language areas, thus inducing signs and symptoms that affect all levels of linguistic processing: phonological, syntactical, lexical, and semantic. However, there is a group of aphasias in which the lesion site spares the classic language areas, thus inducing more subtle signs and symptoms, and leading to a combination of linguistic symptoms mixed with those arising from other cognitive functions also affected by the same lesion. That is the case with the so called “transcortical aphasias” and “conduction aphasia”. Transcortical aphasias are classified as motor, sensory, and mixed. In transcortical motor aphasia (TCMA), the medial and the dorsolateral frontal lobes are compromised, interrupting the connections between these two systems and language areas; TCMA patients have impairment performance on tasks demanding speech generation (diminished fluency, impairment in narrative, and in the production of grammatically complex sentences), and a reduction in the motivation to engage in communication. In transcortical sensory aphasia (TCSA) there is a disorder in semantic processing, manifesting as comprehension and naming impairment, which indicates a disconnection between posterior language areas and semantic memory. In mixed transcortical aphasia (MTA) there is a combination of signs and symptoms of both TCMA and TCSA in varying degrees. Conduction aphasia, in which the core symptom is repetition deficit, represents a primary failure of the phonological loop.",

The deficits in adaptive functioning appear in problems in social communication and participation as well as in mental overload phenomena caused by daily life activities. This overload often results in psychopathological features and psychosocial reactions which are usually observed in Burn-out-Syndromes as e.g. general exhaustion (depletion of primarily reduced mental resources), additional reduced efficacy (accompanied by feelings of insufficiency and poor self-esteem), and most typically feelings alienation (towards intrinsically familiar situations, towards relatives and friends and at least also against oneself ) typically accompanied by irritability and dysphoria.

Concurrent deficits or impairments in adaptive functioning, i.e., an individual's effectiveness in meeting standard expectations in a range of areas, such as social skills and responsibility, communication, daily coping, personal independence, and self-sufficiency. 3. An onset before the age of 18, i.e., the mental retardation is manifested during the developmental period.",

MSDs can arise from a sudden exertion such as lifting a heavy object, or can arise from making the same motions repeatedly or from repeated exposure to force, vibration, or awkward posture over a long period of time. The symptoms may vary from discomfort and pain to decreased body function and invalidity. Although it is not clear to what extent MSDs are caused by work, their impact on working life is huge. MSDs can interfere with activities at work and can lead to reduced productivity, sickness absence and chronic occupational disability [1].",

      "title": "The effect of nasal introduction of anaesthetic in adults undergoing Fibreoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES): A systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The primary objective of this systematic review is to identify and synthesise the best available evidence on the effect of anaesthetic on the physiological aspects of swallowing (rate, strength, and risk of laryngeal penetration or aspiration) as well as client pain and/or discomfort in adults undergoing Fibreoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES). This procedure is also described as Fibreoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing with Sensory testing (FEESS or FEESST) and Videoendoscopic Evaluation of Dysphagia (VEED). Background Dysphagia is the medical term for swallowing disorder. Aetiologies include medical (respiratory illness, medications, general deterioration), neurological or neuromuscular (cerebrovascular accident [CVA], dementia, progressive disease such as Motor Neurone Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease), congenital (cerebral palsy, cleft palate, intellectual disability), traumatic (brain injury, structural change, damage or cancer surgery, radiation therapy), psychiatric, psychological, functional (no known aetiology) and oesophageal structural deformities. 1 Oropharyngeal dysphagia may be described as a ‘sensation that solids or liquids are not being swallowed correctly’. 1(p. 339) Patients may also have symptoms such as coughing, choking, or a feeling of material still in their throat. Impaired swallowing is a problem because it may lead to significant medical conditions such as aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition, dehydration, and weight loss. 2 The FEES is a procedure which allows visualisation of the anatomical structures involved in swallowing. This technique allows assessment of swallow competency, diagnosis of pharyngeal dysphagia, and laryngeal penetration of food or fluids. 3-5 FEES gives a ‘real time’ evaluation, and allows for trialling techniques and modifications of food and fluids to determine therapy strategies for safe swallowing that work for that particular client. It does not expose the client to ionising radiation associated with Modified Barium Swallow (MBS) and provides immediate information about the efficiency of the protective cough reflex. 1, 4-6 The FEES procedure is typically undertaken by speech pathologists and otolaryngologists (Ear Nose and Throat specialists) to evaluate and diagnose swallowing disorders/competence. It involves the transnasal introduction of a flexible nasendoscope through the nose and into the hypopharynx. Food or fluid is then introduced orally and the pharyngeal phase of swallowing process observed. 6 The FEES procedure is an assessment tool designed to aid patients with swallowing difficulties. Figure 1 (adapted from 7) presents a schematic diagram of the flexible nasendoscope placement during the FEES procedure.Figure 1: Illustration of laryngoscope placement during the FEES procedure, adapted from 7During FEES swallowing function is evaluated using anatomical and functional criteria. Food and/or fluid are introduced and there is an evaluation of any premature spillage of the bolus into the pharynx or larynx, whether there is a risk of penetration or aspiration of the bolus before the swallow is triggered. Once the swallow has been completed, evidence of residue within the hypopharynx, or around it, suggests laryngeal or pharyngeal weakness. Evidence of bolus in the trachea is an indication of aspiration. Multiple swallows for each bolus may indicate weakness of the tongue base or posterior pharyngeal wall. 1, 8, 9 FEES allows a physical examination of structural movements during a swallow of different foods and liquids. Interventions, which commonly include dietary and/or behavioural modifications, are prescribed to lessen swallowing difficulty if swallow impairment is diagnosed. 9 A ‘competent’ swallow is commonly defined as timely (less than three seconds after oral preparation of the bolus), complete such that the whole bolus is swallowed without pharyngeal residue, and propulsion to the oesophagus occurs, with no penetration or aspiration into the larynx. A ‘competent’ swallow is not effortful and does not generally require double or multiple swallows.8 An accurate result of the swallow evaluation is critical as it facilitates appropriate patient referral and treatment, outcomes that can significantly affect quality of life 9 and health 3. For many years dysphagia assessment and management was conducted using clinical (bedside) assessment, or videofluoroscopic studies (MBS).10 Bedside assessment involves a trial of food and fluids, and an oro-motor examination. The result of a bedside assessment is reliant on the clinician's ability to detect, and evaluate oral and pharyngeal dysphagia and gain knowledge of oesophageal symptoms based on the patient's medical history. When the FEES swallow evaluation procedure is used, there is a visual assessment of what is actually happening which is not possible in the bedside assessment. Calculated evaluations can be made using results from the bedside approach, but a clear diagnosis is often difficult, 11 and even the most experienced clinicians can fail during a bedside examination to identify approximately 40% of aspirating patients. 11Clinical evaluation has its place, however it is problematic in that silent aspiration (i.e. no overt evidence such as coughing or choking when food or fluids enter below the vocal cords) is not detected.4 Scott et al 12 have pointed out that swallowing is a complex activity involving several rapid, integrated movements, few of which could be observed directly which makes evaluating it complex. In addition, a cough can be an unreliable indicator of aspiration.13 Whilst reasonable conclusions can be made with clinical evaluation, there is the danger of inaccurate diagnosis and inappropriate recommendations leading to negative impacts on patient health outcomes and quality of life 3. Videofluoroscopic studies, such as the MBS, have been used for diagnosis and evaluation of dysphagia since the 1980's. 8 This procedure evaluates the oral phase, pharyngeal phase and the oesophageal transit. Small amounts of food and liquid (with barium paste) are introduced and followed radiographically from mouth to the lower oesophageal sphincter. This procedure is carried out in a radiology suite, with a radiologist and radiology technician present, and generally a speech pathologist. It requires the patient to be able to sit upright. At times this precludes very ill patients and those who find the physical demands of the procedure too difficult. 8 The FEES procedure was formalised by Susan E Langmore in the late 1980's. Its introduction was a “collaborative effort” 8(p. 1386) between the specialties of speech pathology and otolaryngology. Prior to this development, otolaryngologists had largely screened patients and diagnosed swallowing disorders 8. Langmore identified the clinical usefulness of FEES for analysis of function as compared with medical pathology which would only allow assessment of anatomical not functional pathologies. The advantages of FEES over MBS include its portability and easy access for physically disadvantaged patients, the lack of need for a radiology suite (and radiologist), its relative cost-effectiveness, no radiation exposure (and therefore any amount of time can be used to determine a diagnosis), the ability to directly visualise and record the pharynx and larynx, and its sensitivity in detection of and severity rating of aspiration. 3, 5, 6, 14 FEES is the evaluation of choice where a patient is compromised by radiation necessary for the MBS, and especially where repetitive examinations are required, for example for biofeedback. During FEES the food and fluid is dyed with colour to enhance visibility. At times, the end of the scope can become covered with oropharyngeal secretions or food or fluid, although this can be easily cleared by an experienced endoscopist using techniques to slightly change the position of the scope to clear the residue. In addition, during swallowing the endoscope will be momentarily pushed against the posterior pharyngeal wall, causing ‘white-out’ (this occurs for about half a second). 11 Some clinicians may consider this a disadvantage of FEES, as visual recording, or observation, is briefly lost. The risk of complications with FEES is regarded as low, but may include: a reaction to the anaesthetic, laryngospasm, epistaxis (nosebleeds), fainting, laryngospasm. 9 Hence, the availability of medical response if required is necessary when performing a FEES. Swallowing function includes three main phases, namely the oral, pharyngeal and oesophageal phase. Dysphagia may occur in any one of these phases 1 and in individuals of any age.14 FEES effectively evaluates the pharyngeal phase and any laryngeal penetration and aspiration (liquid or food going into the ‘wind pipe’).1, 6, 8, 11 However, it is unable to evaluate either the oral or oesophageal swallow phases as the scope is passed through the nasopharynx (nose and back of the throat). FEES is effective at identifying silent aspiration 3, which may be defined as entry of the bolus below the level of the true vocal folds without any external behavioural signs such as coughing or choking. 4 Speech pathologists have specific training to make recommendations about a safe diet and fluid consistency for a dysphagic client to swallow. Based on the outcomes of the FEES procedure, they can be more certain of the efficacy of their recommendations. The recommended foods and fluids may need to be modified in consistency depending on the evaluation of dysphagia, thereby affecting quality of life of the client. FEES is important in that it facilitates a more precise determination of the food and fluids safe for swallowing as the procedure allows visualisation of the client swallowing those actual consistencies.3, 15, 16 This is why it is important to understand whether the use of anaesthetic during FEES affects the accuracy of the swallow function diagnosis. During FEES the thin flexible nasendoscope is introduced into the client's nose and then passed through to the back of the throat (Figure 1). For accurate placement and prevention of tissue damage, the client is advised to stay still. Anaesthetic is commonly introduced as a means to reduce client anxiety, pain and discomfort and minimise client movement during the procedure. The most common form of anaesthetic introduction is via the application of a topical or spray anaesthetic into the nostril prior to the introduction of the nasendoscope. 1, 10, 15, 17 The use of anaesthetic during the FEES procedure is a topic of debate both in the literature and practice relating to diagnosing and treating swallow function. 2, 18, 19 In practice, otolaryngologists frequently use anaesthetic to evaluate structure whereas speech pathologists are not authorised to use anaesthetic and therefore require the presence of an Ear, Nose and Throat Specialist or other medically trained professional when it is being used. The tendency for FEES to be conducted with anaesthetic, and restrictions relating to which health professionals can administer anaesthetic during FEES limits access to FEES in facilities where there is unavailability of medical practitioners authorised to administer anaesthetic. As is explained in more detail below, the debate on the use of and need for anaesthetic when conducting FEES focuses on whether application of anaesthetic influences swallowing function and the accuracy of the diagnosis of dysphagia as well as anaesthetic's effectiveness for reducing client pain/discomfort and anxiety. The amount of anaesthetic, timing of anaesthetic, use of vasoconstrictor in addition to the anaesthetic and the method of application, have all been shown to vary across research studies and in clinical practice. Types and amounts of anaesthetic as described in the literature include Lidocaine 5, 20 20mg Cophenylcaine, 21 Cocaine, 22 2% Tetracaine.1, 17 Application methods also vary and include being applied nasally, orally, or with a cotton bud 23 or orviaaerosol puff.18 In addition, a vasoconstricting drug may also be applied in order to constrict the nasal mucosa and create a wider space to introduce the scope. 23 The sensation required for efficient swallowing is controlled by three cranial nerves innervating muscles of the mouth and pharynx. These nerves are the trigeminal, glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. 2 The superior laryngeal branch of the vagus nerve is regarded as the most important trigger for swallowing. Anaesthesia of areas innervated by these nerves can affect, but not completely diminish, the ability to swallow. This suggests that a person may have a less efficient swallow due to anaesthesia. 2, 7, 18, 19, 24. Aspiration with anaesthesia is described in the literature 18, suggesting increased risk during a FEES procedure if using anaesthetic. 2, 4, 7, 18, 19, 25 Therefore the clinician is potentially disadvantaged in their decision making. Another advantage of using anaesthetic during the FEES procedure, aside from its potential to reduce patient pain and discomfort raised in the debate over use of anaesthetic and FEES, is its potential to allow a more thorough assessment by the endoscopist because it is less distressing for the patient. However, some practitioners are of the view that the scope manoeuvres easily without anaesthetic. A disadvantage of using anaesthetic during FEES, raised both in discussions amongst those using the FEES procedure in practice in South Australia as well as in the literature 2, 20, is that it may cause a patient to experience a bitter taste. The client also has a ‘numb’ sensation for some time after application of the anaesthetic and is unable to drink or eat, because of the risk of aspiration, for around a half hour after the procedure. In the context of this debate over the use of anaesthetic when undertaking FEES it is important to conduct the systematic review proposed to enhance understanding about whether: (i) anaesthetic has a significant effect on the pain/comfort and anxiety experienced by the patient during the procedure; and/or (ii) it effects swallow function and swallow function diagnosis and thereby leads to an inappropriate management plan being recommended. No systematic review has been undertaken to date on the effects of anaesthetic during the FEES procedure. A preliminary search of the JBI Library of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Library, PubMed and CINAHL found no systematic review protocols or reports on this topic. It is anticipated that the findings of this review will be used to enhance endoscopists’ decision making on the use of an anaesthetic agent when conducting FEES.",

Clinical variantsFTLD is clinically defined according to the consensus criteria by Neary and colleagues (Neary, Snowden et al. 1998).The site of focal cerebral atrophy, i.e., frontal and/or temporal, left and/or right determines the clinical presentation.Behavioral variant FTLD (bvFTLD) is associated with usually a symmetrical frontal dysfunction.The language variants progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA) and semantic dementia (SD) are subsumed under the clinical syndrome of primary progressive aphasia (Mesulam 2001) and show involvement of the left anterior temporal lobe. Behavioral variant FTLDBvFTLD is the most common subtype of FTLD.Patients with bvFTLD show progressive personality and behavioral changes.Deficits in executive function, social interpersonal conduct, loss of insight (anosognosia), emotional blunting, stereotyped verbal output, hyperorality, dietary changes with weight gain, mood changes including irritability, depression, fatuous euphoria, tactlessness, loss of concern for feeling for others, lack of empathy, reduced emotional engagement, utilisation behavior, obsessive behavior, and neglect of personal hygiene all encompass the wide spectrum of clinical symptoms in bvFTLD.BvFTLD can be subdivided into an (1) dorsolateral/medial type with an apathetic profile, and (2) basal type with pronounced behavioral changes (Snowden, Bathgate et al. 2001).Parkinsonian features like rigidity and bradykinesia can be associated with bvFTLD.In many FTLD patients with Parkinsonism, a genetic linkage to chromosome 17 (tau, PGRN) was found, and these cases were termed FTDP-17.Incontinence, orthostatic dysregulation, and the presence of frontal signs (saccadic eye movements, disturbed upward gaze, paratonia, inexhaustible blink reflex, abnormal Luria sequence) on neurological examination may be present.CT or MRI may be normal early in the course, but symmetrical atrophy frontal atrophy and involvement and atrophy of the prefrontal cortex, the paralimbic areas anterior cingulum and frontal insula, and thalamus (Grimmer, Diehl et al. 2004).At later stages, atrophy may be observed of the temporal and parietal cortex (Diehl-Schmid, Grimmer et al. 2007).[F18]-FDG-PET and HMPAO-SPECT are useful to establish the clinical diagnosis and show the typical involvement of the frontal and temporal lobes (Mendez, Shapira et al. 2007;Mosconi, Tsui et al. 2008).

Frailty predicted those of fluid function (memory, processing speed and visuospatial) and crystallised ability, as measured by pronunciation of irregular words.2 Frailty was defined by the Fried phenotype, that is, the presence of at least three of: weakness (measured by grip strength); self-reported exhaustion; slow gait speed; unintentional weight loss (estimated from low body mass index) and low physical activity. In addition to age, sex and education, associations were independent of two important sources of potential confounding: a range of chronic physical conditions, suggesting that frailty is not merely marking general morbidity burden; and depressive symptoms, further suggesting that exhaustion is not a proxy for this well-known dementia risk factor. Finally, results were essentially unchanged when those scoring below the standard Mini-Mental Status Examination clinical threshold were excluded, indicating that associations with frailty operate within the framework of normal cognitive ageing.\n\nSo what is it about ‘frailty’ …",

This lesion is static, the manifestation of the disorder and the needs of the individual changes with age. It may involve muscle stiffness (spasticity), poor muscle tone, uncontrolled movements, and problems with posture, balance, coordination, walking, speech, swallowing, and many other functions. Motor performance is normally coordinated via communication between the cerebral cortex, thalamus, basal ganglia, brain stem, cerebellum, spinal cord and communicating sensory motor pathways. Mental retardation, seizures, breathing problems, bladder and bowel control problems, learning disabilities, skeletal deformities, dental problems, eating difficulties, digestive problems, and hearing and vision problems are also linked with this disorder. Cerebral palsy is non- curable in the accepted sense although several measures such as proper education, therapy and applied technology are being used to help persons who are suffering from this disorder and provide them productive lives. In order to approach cerebral palsy systematically, the medical practioners and physical therapists need to recognize neuromotor deficits, diagnose and classify the type of disorder, and implement a methodical treatment plan.

La disfasia es un trastorno congenito caracterizado por un inicio tardio en el comienzo y/o produccion del lenguaje, tanto en su forma expresiva como comprensiva, que no puede ser explicado por retraso mental, trastornos neurologicos, psiquiatricos o auditivos. De causa desconocida, sus efectos afectan no solo al lenguaje, tambien a sus relaciones sociales, capacidad de atencion y comportamiento. Debe diferenciarse, fundamentalmente, del trastorno del espectro autista y de las afasias adquiridas como el sindrome de Landau-Kleffner. Las exploraciones neurofisiologicas mas utilizadas son el electroencefalograma analogico y cuantificado, la polisomnografia, el potencial evocado troncular y los potenciales cognitivos P300 y N400. Estos estudios muestran la existencia de alteraciones en subgrupos de disfasias como paroxismos, ritmo theta asimetrico y alteraciones de los potenciales cognitivos. Conclusiones. Las actividades bioelectricas anormales plantean la posibilidad de una inmadurez con diversas manifestaciones, a confirmar en nuevos trabajos.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The frontal lobes are the largest and likely most complex structure in the brain. Among other functions, it allows the expression of personality and language, the planning and sequencing of desired movements or actions as well as inhibition of unwanted or undesirable ones. Given the regional distribution of function, lesions or dysfunction in the frontal lobes may lead to such range of personal and social disruptions as aphasia, perseveration, disinhibition, personality changes and acquired sociopathy. Besides trauma, tumours, infections and toxins, abnormal disorders of tau and ubiquitin proteins may lead to neurodegenerative diseases that predominantly affect the frontal lobes. These so‐called frontotemporal dementias or frontotemporal lobar degenerations have become the most active and exciting field of research in the frontal lobes. Key Concepts These are the most salient functions and dysfunctions of the frontal lobes discussed here: Function Frontal lobe‐specific dysfunction Recognition Language Expressive aphasia (Broca's aphasia) Impairment in fluency, naming and ability to repeat. No problems comprehending Executive function Executive dysfunction Perseverative behaviours with inability to sequence goal‐directed movements Personality changes Apathetic personality (dorsolateral) Either abulic/apathetic or disinhibited personality ‘Orbital’ personality (orbitofrontal)",

It therefore forms an important means of quantifying the NINCDS-AD RDA (McKhann et al., 1984) criteria for a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer’s disease, which require that there is impairment in memory functioning plus at least one other cognitive domain such as language, praxis, perceptual skills, problem-solving abilities, attention, or orientation, supported by the Folstein Mini-Mental State Evaluation (MMSE) (Folstein et al., 1975), Blessed Dementia Rating Scale (BDRS) (Blessed et al., 1968), or a similar evaluation. These difficulties must interfere with everyday functional capacity. A diagnosis of possible Alzheimer’s disease is rendered when a patient presents with only a single progressive cognitive deficit, an atypical presentation, or when there is a medical or neuropsychiatric condition that might account for observed deficits but is not considered to be the cause of the dementia.",

Communication is one of most fundamental characteristics of higher cognitive functioning and depends on symbolic encoding, either in sounds, script, or gesture. Functional brain organization shows modifications with age, and these changes in brain dynamics are associated with performance on language tasks. The prevalence of hearing impairment depends on criteria used to define it. Depression can be so profound that it can mimic cognitive dysfunction or aphasia and in all cases will mean that rehabilitation of another specific communication disorder will be rendered more difficult. Dysphagia is common: 78% of people who have had a stroke initially present with the symptom, and a high percentage of those with dementia and progressive neurological disease have dysphagia. Problems with communication and/or swallowing are profoundly disabling to the patient and cause great anxiety to relatives.",

      "abstract": "Autism is one of the behaviorally defined developmental disorders of brain function. It has a variety of genetic and nongenetic etiologies, with etiology being unknown in the majority of children. Boys are more frequently affected than girls. Manifest in the preschool years, autism always affects sociability, communication, and the child's repertoire of activities and interests. Autism encompasses children with a broad range of severities and a variety of other signs of brain dysfunction. These include motor signs, notably stereotypies; abnormal responses to a variety of sensory stimuli; and disorders of affect and attention. A significant proportion of autistic children experience epileptic seizures and have abnormal EEGs. Neuroimaging, preferably magnetic resonance imaging, discloses abnormalities of brain development in a minority of autistic persons. The level of intelligence may range from profound mental deficiency to giftedness. The pattern of cognitive skills is likely to be uneven, typically with better nonverbal than verbal skills. In the preschool years, all autistic children have a developmental language disorder. Verbal expression may range from total lack of language to verbosity with echolalia; comprehension and language use are invariably impaired. While there is no specific pharmacologic agent to mitigate the fundamental disorder, children may benefit from drugs to treat specific symptoms such as attention disorder and seizures. Although autistic behaviors are the consequence of a static disorder of brain function, their character changes with maturation and appropriate intervention. Communication skills and sociability remain deficient but improve in all but the most severely affected children. Outcome is a function of both innate cognitive competence and the effectiveness of early intervention focused on the development of appropriate social skills and meaningful communication. Intelligent autistic adults may be educable, employable, and able to live independently, while more severely handicapped ones require a lifelong protected environment.",

There are few reports in the literature regarding the lifelong cognitive process in children who are affected by ADEM. A few studies and case reports have reported mild deterioration in some cognitive functions such as attention, verbal memory, short-term memory, information processing, processing speed, impulse control, executive functions, and spatial-visual skills after ADEM. Children who experienced ADEM have also been reported to display difficulties in learning and deterioration in academic skills. Specific learning disorder (SLD) is a condition of inadequate reading and/or writing levels and/or mathematics skills that cannot be explained with the child’s age, intelligent quotient (IQ), or education. Although genetic factors have been implicated in the etiology of SLD, The exact etiological factors are still unknown. ADEM, especially in the very early childhood period, has been accused of immaturity of learning skills in the affected children and these patients have been reported to tend to suffer from deteriorating information processing, leading to a blockage in their social development and their learning skills. We report a child who presented to our clinic for difficulties in learning and was detected in his medical history to have suffered from ADEM when he was two years of age. The child was diagnosed with SLD after the examination. We discuss the possible effect of ADEM on the etiology of SLD. A correlation has been found between ADEM and SLD in the recent literature though it is not clear and further prospective cohort studies designed with larger samples are recommended to explore this reported correlation between ADEM and SLD.",

RPK utiče na svakodnevne veštine ali i na školska postignuća. Visoka prevalencija (5-8 %) govori u prilog tome da u svakom razredu ili vrtićkoj grupi možemo očekivati jedno dete/učenika za ovim problemom. Danas, za dijagnostikovanje ovog poremećaja koristimo DSM-V (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) klasifikaciju (četiri kriterijuma). Prema ovom statističkom priručniku RPK se dijagnostikuje ako je izvođenje motoričkih veština ispod hronološkog uzrasta, ako ometa svakodnevne aktivnosti, ako je početak u razvojnom periodu i ako se motorički deficit ne može objasniti nekim drugim oštećenjem (npr. cerebralnom paralizom). Etilogija RPK je multifaktorska. Najviše problema učenici sa RPK pokazuju na nastavi fizičkog vaspitanja, srpskog jezika i matematike. Teškoće sa kojima se susreću su mnogobrojne počev od problema pripreme za čas fizičkog vaspitanja, učešća u takmičarskim igrama, preko problema čitanja, pisanja i računanja. U osnovi ovih teškoća leži problem motoričkog učenja. Zbog svega, vrlo je važno koristiti odgovarajuće strategije za rad sa ovim učenicima. Pravovremenim tretmanom, primenom odgovarajućih metoda i strategija u radu može se uticati na dalji tok i ishod ovog razvojnog poremećaja.",

Se trata de un grupo heterogeneo que abarca desde simples problemas de articulacion de un fonema (dislalias) hasta transtornos graves de comunicacion, como afasias y disartrias infantiles.En este articulo se pretende revisar los perfiles neuropsicologicos de los ninos que manifiestan diferentes problemas del lenguaje oral infantil, no existen apenas revisiones sistematicas que estudien de manera global los perfiles neuropsicologicos de estos ninos. La semiologia linguistica de estos trastornos se conoce en profundidad.Sin embargo, la semiologia neuropsicologica asociada no se ha revisado. En algunos casos, estos signos neuropsicologicos determinan en los ninos mayores problemas de aprendizaje que los propios problemas del lenguaje. Conclusiones. Las alteraciones del lenguaje infantil se asocian a diferentes problemas neuropsicologicos. Los deficitneuropsiclogicos asociados mas frecuentes son los problemas de memoria, de atencion, de funciones ejecutivas, de disfunciones motrices, de la percepcion temporal, del reconocimiento tactil, del esquema corporal, de la orientacion espacial y de discriminacion visual. La alteracion mnesica(fundamentalmente en la memoria auditiva inmediata y de trabajo) suele ser un denominador comun en los diferentes cuadros que determinan problemas de lenguaje.

Forensic Neuropsychology establishes an expert valuation of the brain-injured patient (or supposed), or of the law offender people (or supposed) requiring law protection due to their illness. This discipline has a fundamental role in the study of cerebral organic syndromes, particularly in the dementias. DEVELOPMENT. The demential syndrome is common to a group of diseases as degenerative or cardiovascular disorders, brain tumors, syphilis, alcoholism or toxic factors, etc. When speaking of dementia we refer to a syndrome characterized by a progressive and global deterioration of the cognitive functions (memory, language, attention, space-temporal orientation, praxis, thinking, etc.) with preservation of the level of conscience (DSM-IV). This symptomatology affects the personality of the individual as reasonable being , as well as to his behavior and social adaptation. The decrease or loss of the intellectual and volitives abilities of the affected person of a demential syndrome, if it is permanent, also implies a change in its legal situation, since its legal capacity is altered. Therefore, it will be necessary to adopt protective measures for his person and his patrimony. Even if it is necessary, to promote a process of disability, whose sentence will be emitted by a judge, who will indicate: the degree of the mentioned disability, the trusteeship regime and who is designated as a legal tutor.",

      "abstract": "Hearing loss can result from disorders or damage to the ear (peripheral auditory system) or the brain (central auditory system). Here, the basic structure and function of the central auditory system will be highlighted as relevant to cases of permanent hearing loss where assistive devices (hearing aids) are called for. The parts of the brain used for hearing are altered in two basic ways in instances of hearing loss: (1) Damage to the ear can reduce the number and nature of input channels that the brainstem receives from the ear, causing plasticity of the central auditory system. This plasticity may partially compensate for the peripheral loss, or add new abnormalities such as distorted speech processing or tinnitus. (2) In some situations, damage to the brain can occur independently of the ear, as may occur in cases of head trauma, tumors or aging. Implications of deficits to the central auditory system for speech perception in noise, hearing aid use and future innovative circuit designs will be provided to set the stage for subsequent presentations in this special educational session.

      "abstract": "Abstract Speech is controlled by many muscles and nerves. Disordered speech is called dysarthria (difficulty with articulation). Dysarthria should be differentiated from difficulty of speech due to cerebral cortex damage (dysphasia or aphasia) and difficulty in phonation (dysphonia) due to laryngeal weakness. It can be acute or insidious, static or fluctuating, mild or severe. It may also be caused by cerebellar disorders. Dysarthria is not always caused by tongue weakness; it also can be caused by palatal weakness (nasal speech) or even facial weakness (Bell’s palsy). Some non-neurological causes should also be explored, such as dental and gum disease.",

      "abstract": "Parental alienation is defined as a mental state in which a child, usually one whose parents are engaged in a high-conflict separation or divorce, allies himself strongly with one parent (the preferred parent) and rejects a relationship with the other parent (the alienated parent) without legitimate justification. Parental alienation may affect men's mental health: a) parental alienation negatively influences mental health of male children and adolescents who are victims of parental alienation. Alienated children/adolescents display guilt, sadness, and depressed mood; low self-esteem and lack of self-confidence; distress and frustration; lack of impulse control, substance abuse and delinquent behavior; separation anxiety, fears and phobias; hypochondria and increased tendency to develop psychosomatic illness; suicidal ideation and suicide attempt; sleep and eating disorders; educational problems; enuresis and encopresis; b) parental alienation negatively affects the mental health of adult men who were victims of parental alienation when they were children and/or adolescents. Long-term effects of parental alienation include low self-esteem, depression, drug/alcohol abuse, lack of trust, alienation from own children, divorce, problems with identity and not having a sense of belonging or roots, choosing not to have children to avoid being rejected by them, low achievement, anger and bitterness over the time lost with the alienated parent; c) parental alienation negatively influences mental health of men who are alienated from their children. Fathers who have lost some or all contact with their children for months or years following separation or divorce may be depressed and suicidal.",

      "title": "Late Onset Depression",
      "abstract": "In the older population, one of the serious health concerns that are associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) is a depressive disorder. Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

Recently these disorders have often been combined with the new term, learning and language impaired. A large body of research has burgeoned over the past decade. There are some children who simply exhibit a language delay as well as a few children with a learning disability without a significant language delay. For that reason we will discuss language disability somewhat separate from learning disabilities although they are related and should be viewed as such.",

      "title": "When it is not primary progressive aphasia: A scoping review of spoken language impairment in other neurodegenerative dementias",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Progressive difficulties with spoken language occur across the spectrum of degenerative dementia. When not a primary presenting and dominant symptom, language difficulties may be overlooked in favor of more prominent cognitive, behavior, or motor deficits. The aim of this scoping review is to examine the extent and nature of the research evidence describing (1) the spoken language impairments found in non‐language led dementias, (2) their impact on everyday living, and (3) the reported language interventions. Methods We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, OVID‐EMBASE, PsycINFO, and SpeechBITE using terms related to spoken language for the following dementia types: Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), cortico‐basal syndrome (CBS), behavior variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), early‐onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD), posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), and motor neuron disease associated with FTD (MND+FTD). Risk of bias was assessed with the QualSyst tool. Results Seventy‐three eligible studies were included. A wide range of spoken language impairments were reported, involving both linguistic (e.g., syntactic processing) and other cognitive (e.g., sustained attention) underlying mechanisms. Although the severity of these deficits was scarcely reported, in some cases they manifested as non‐fluent, dynamic, and global aphasias. No papers in the review described either the impact of these language impairments on everyday living or language therapies to treat them. Discussion There is a need to understand better the level of disability produced by language impairment in people living with non–language‐led dementias. Our findings suggest three calls for action: (1) research studies should assess the clinical relevance of any spoken language deficits examined, (2) both linguistic and cognitive underlying mechanisms should be fully described (to inform the design of effective language and behavioral interventions), and (3) trials of language therapy should be conducted in those groups of individuals where significant language impairment is proved.",

Satiety is the quality or state of being fed or gratified to or beyond capacity mediated in the short term by mechanical factors related to swallowing and gastric distention, chemical factors related to taste and smell, and psychological factors (sensory-specific satiety) and in the long term by chemoreception of nutrients and gastrointestinal (GI) peptides and neuroendocrine and neuronal factors and is a major motivation for terminating eating (1).",

Such damage may be obvious, such as paralysis of a limb following an attack of poliomyelitis, or hidden, such as myocarditis following a virus infection. The effects of such damage may be a degree of malfunctioning or disability with which the child and his family can easily cope, or there can be marked interference with the child's development and social adjustment. A child is considered handicapped if he is unable to play, learn, or do things which other children of his age can do, and is unable to achieve his full physical, mental or social potential. Even though physical and mental problems are important in the rehabilitation of such children, emotional and social factors also play a significant role at some time or another and in varying degrees in most handicapping conditions of childhood.",

This article aimed to review neurobiological bases of social cognition and theory of mind which try to explain social cognition. \nPubMed medical search engine was queried to find out the studies and review articles on social cognition and theory of mind in AD and PDDs.\nSocial cognition may be defined as the ability to interact in complex social areas with understanding the others? intentions and thoughts. The mind deficit is theorized to be one of the basic difficulties in autism. Individuals with autism have deficits in recognizing mental processes and mental representations of self and others?. Patients with AD have deficits in social functions which an important part of interpersonal interactions and functioning within a social group; like face recognition, eye contact and emotional expression recognition.\nFrontal lobe, temporal lobe, anterior cingulate cortex, fusiform gyrus, amygdala, posterior association cortex and their internal associations are brain areas associated with social cognition. Fusiform gyrus and amygdala are effective in face perception and recognition. Studies suggest that a deficit in amygdala may lead to social perceptional deficits like face identity and emotional expression recognition. It is determined that individuals with PDDs have hypoactivation in fusiform gyrus during perception of faces. Amygdala has a regulatory effect on fusiform gyrus and in lesions of amygdala, the hypoactivation of fusiform gyrus for emotional salient faces are parallel to the level of amygdala lesion. The common result of many studies is that the hypoactivation of fusiform gyrus is based on some processes related to amygdala. Superior temporal sulcus hypoactivations and abnormal volume measures were found in patients with autistic disorder. Superior tempral sulcus has a role in perception of social stimulus from gaze directions, and eye and body movements of others?. Autism can be defined as a social cognition disorder and is caused by deficits at microscopic and/or macroscopic levels in these brain systems.\nThe review of the neurobiology of social cognition in AD and other PPDs defisits in amygdala and in connections of amygdala with other temporal areas including fusiform gyrus, superior temporal sulcus in early infancy and that leads to a deficit or absence of infant?s interest for faces and other stimuli which are socially significant.

The availability of eye-tracking techniques as well as a variety of neuroimaging technologies enabling researchers to examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of brain activity, has challenged such dichotomies, suggesting that even when participants achieve “scores in the normal range”, this does not necessarily indicate intactness, because the behavioural scores can be shown to be underpinned by atypical neural processes. This holds for a wide range of cognitive domains (e.g., face processing, language, number, attention, inhibition, memory) and across a wide range of neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., Williams syndrome, Down syndrome, Autism Spectrum Disorders, Foetal Alcohol syndrome, Obstructive Sleep Apnea), as well as low/high SES.",

The symptoms must persist for at least one month. Many children with SM also have excessive shyness, poor eye contact, and fear of embarrassment. Despite the failure to speak, the child’s nonverbal communication ability is typically age appropriate and prosocial nonverbal communication such as nodding or giggling is often observed. Since SM frequently co-occurs with other communication disorders, the assessment should include a hearing and speech and language evaluation. Behavioral therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are the primary treatments for SM. Medications are most effective when combined with behavioral treatments and may include the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).",

Speech often becomes dysarthric but language disorders are not well recognised. METHODS: Three patients with PSP (pathologically confirmed in two) are reported in which the presenting symptoms were those of difficulty with language output. RESULTS: Neuropsychological testing showed considerable impairment on a range of single word tasks which require active initiation and search strategies (letter and category fluency, sentence completion), and on tests of narrative language production. By contrast, naming from pictures and from verbal descriptions, and word and sentence comprehension were largely intact. The degree of semantic memory impairment was also slight. CONCLUSIONS: Relatively selective involvement of cognitive processes critical for planning and initiating language output may occur in some patients with PSP. This presentation resembles the phenomenon of \"verbal adynamia\" or \"dynamic aphasia\" seen in patients with frontal lobe damage. Although definite cortical changes were present at postmortem examination, it is likely that the neuropsychological deficits reflect functional frontal deafferentation secondary to interruption of frontostriatal feedback loops.",

Developmental defects of the neural tube, such an various form of myelomeningocele, which manifest themselves during the early stages of the intrauterine life, have an impact on the individuals further development. Its intensity depends on the extend of the defect itself, the feasibility of its correction (usually by surgical means) and a number of external, environmental factors which have an indirect influence on a child's development. The psychological consequences of such defects take the form of various disturbances in the development of cognitive processes: mainly the perception of the outside world and the formation of the cognitive structures involved in self-image formation. At every stage of his and her development, an individual of with a neural-tube defects is subject to many forms of social influence. These may either stimulate or hamper development.

      "title": "Aphasia from a Neurolinguistic Perspective",
      "abstract": "Aphasia is an acquired language disorder subsequent to brain damage in the left hemisphere. It is characterized by diminished abilities to produce and understand both spoken and written language compared with the speaker’s presumed ability pre-cerebral damage. The type and severity of the aphasia depends not only on the location and extent of the cerebral damage but also the effect the lesion has on connecting areas of the brain. Type and severity of aphasia is diagnosed in comparison with assumed normal adult language. Language changes associated with normal aging are not classed as aphasia. The diagnosis and assessment of aphasia in children, which is unusual, takes account of age norms. The most common cause of aphasia is a <italic>cerebral vascular</italic> <italic>accident</italic> (CVA) commonly referred to as a <italic>stroke</italic>, but brain damage following traumatic head injury such as road accidents or gunshot wounds can also cause aphasia. Aphasia following such traumatic events is non-progressive in contrast to aphasia arising from brain tumor, some types of infection, or language disturbances in progressive conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, where the language disturbance increases as the disease progresses. The diagnosis of primary progressive aphasia (as opposed to non-progressive aphasia, the main focus of this article) is based on the following inclusion and exclusion criteria by M. Marsel Mesulam, in 2001. Inclusion criteria are as follows: Difficulty with language that interferes with activities of daily living and aphasia is the most prominent symptom. Exclusion criteria are as follows: Other non-degenerative disease or medical disorder, psychiatric diagnosis, episodic memory, visual memory, and visuo-perceptual impairment, and, finally, initial behavioral disturbance. Aphasia involves one or more of the building blocks of language, phonemes, morphology, lexis, syntax, and semantics; and the deficits occur in various clusters or patterns across the spectrum. The degree of impairment varies across modalities, with written language often, but not always, more affected than spoken language. In some cases, understanding of language is relatively preserved, in others both production and understanding are affected. In addition to varied degrees of impairment in spoken and written language, any or more than one component of language can be affected. At the most severe end of the spectrum, a person with aphasia may be unable to communicate by either speech or writing and may be able to understand virtually nothing or only very limited social greetings. At the least severe end of the spectrum, the aphasic speaker may experience occasional word finding difficulties, often difficulties involving nouns; but unlike difficulties in recalling proper nouns in normal aging, word retrieval problems in mild aphasia includes other word classes. Descriptions of different clusters of language deficits have led to the notion of syndromes. Despite great variations in the condition, patterns of language deficits associated with different areas of brain damage have been influential in understanding language-brain relationships. Increasing sophistication in language assessment and neurological investigations are contributing to a greater, yet still incomplete understanding of language-brain relationships.",

When impairment is isolated to language, the term “primary progressive aphasia” is appropriate; when impairment is present in object naming (i.e., anomia) and word meaning (i.e., agnosia), with other aspects of language and cognition relatively intact, the term “semantic dementia” is apt. The initial symptom is typically “forgetfulness for names,” and although paraphasic errors, dyslexia, dysgraphia, visual agnosia, and executive dysfunction usually evolve with time, many patients perform daily activities remarkably well over the initial 2 to 5 years of symptoms. Progression can vary, with symptoms reflecting the topography of progressive cortical dysfunction. Typically, degeneration spreads posteriorly in the ipsilateral temporal lobe, with involvement eventually extending to the perisylvian, frontosubcortical, and sometimes superior parietal regions in the dominant hemisphere.",

At their peak, a vast range of somatic reactions include, among others: (1) palpitations and cool extremities and pallor (peripheral vaso-constriction); (2) respiratory difficulties; (3) the urge to urinate, intestinal cramps and alternating diarrhea and constipation, and vomiting; (4) muscle tension in the face, trembling, and incoordination of the hands; (5) speech difficulties due to troubled breathing and incoordination of muscles involved in articulation (“tongue-tied”). These are also accompanied by blunted perceptiveness and diminished responsiveness.",

The patients are inmates of the State Institution for Feeble-Minded of Western Pennsylvania. To express ideas in language we must understand the meaning of words and the formation of ideas, and we must have a co-ordinate action of the muscles concerned in speech. In these cases of aphasia one or more of these conditions are absent, with the general absence of the power of verbal experssion,",

Despite this, people sleep less and less due to different factors including economic activities, work stress, social demand, erroneous beliefs about sleep, excessive use of electronic devices, long hours of work or rotating shifts, and such circumstances generate conditions in which people sleep less than 7 hours a day, well, sleeping less than 7 hours a day is considered as sleep restriction and restricting sleep only a couple of hours per night can lead to deterioration in health and quality of life, producing a significant decrease in cognitive performance. When the restriction extends to 2 weeks, it can reach levels of impairment that are comparable to 2 nights in total sleep deprivation, resulting in problems in memory consolidation, as well as impaired attention, learning and executive functioning (working memory, cognitive flexibility, self-monitoring, impulsiveness, planning and inhibition, and social cognition). Although the association between sleep restriction and memory disorders is well known, there is insufficient information regarding alterations in executive functions, specifically those of social cognition in subjects with sleep restriction. Social cognition involves those human skills necessary to successfully interact in a social environment and according to recent research, it can be affected if people cannot sleep.",

      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders are pervasive developmental disorders that are defined as a group of disorders in which large number of developmental areas are damaged. The most damaged area is social communication and interaction which are followed by stereotypical and repeated behaviour, interests and activities. There are five pervasive developmental disorders and they are: autism, Asperger syndrome, Rett's syndrome, disintegrative childhood disorder and atypical autism. The cause of autism is biological heritage and symptoms are: late pronunciation or slow speech, difficulties in social interaction, inability to smile and to recognize emotions of other people. Furthermore, as a rule they do not like physical contact with other people and have sensitive sensory system. \r\nSensory integration is organization of senses that is used in our body. Senses are here to provide important information to our body. There are like „food for our brain“. If brain can't provide that kind of information than it will lead to sensory integration disorder. That means that senses of touch, sight, hearing, smell, taste, vestibular sense and proprioception will probably not be integrated and that will lead to serious problems in future life. Sensory integration disorder can appear by itself, or it can come with other disorders like Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, intellectual disorders, cerebral paralysis and others. Some scientists think that child can have predisposition for these disorders while others think that increase of Earth pollution can contribute to these disorders. Early identification of sensory integration disorder is very important, combined with the right therapy session. Preschool teachers who work with children with this kind of disorder should work on their professional development, on their communication skills and partnership with their parents.",

      "abstract": "Por afasia se entiende la alteracion del lenguaje expresivo y/o receptivo a causa de una lesion cerebral .  Este trastorno tiene una alta prevalencia afectando al  21%-38% de pacientes que sufren un accidente cerebrovascular . Las areas del lenguaje pueden verse afectadas de diferente manera dependiendo del tipo de  lesion que presente el paciente (etiologia, extension, localizacion,…) y de factores personales (personalidad, factores intelectuales, motivacion,…) pudiendo dificultar en diverso grado a su capacidad comunicativa. A pesar de la alta prevalencia de este trastorno, el conocimiento del termino “afasia”  en la poblacion general, es todavia altamente desconocido en relacion con otros trastornos neurologicos con menor incidencia y prevalencia, como  la Enfermedad de Parkinson o la Esclerosis Multiple. La afasia puede llegar a ser el deficit cognitivo mas devastador secundario al ACV, hasta el extremo de que algunos pacientes consideran que con la alteracion del lenguaje han perdido su identidad personal, creando sentimientos de profunda angustia e invalidez que afecta a todas las esferas de su vida. Este articulo intenta explicar, utilizando un modelo conexionista, en que consiste la afasia, cuales son los principales sindromes afasicos  y cuales sus caracteristicas mas importantes con el objetivo de aportar informacion que facilite a la enfermera  interactuar comunicativamente de la manera  mas eficaz posible, aprovechando al maximo las habilidades conservadas de nuestro paciente  y abrir una puerta al desarrollo de los cuidados enfermeros de la persona con afasia. Abstract Aphasia is understood as the expressive and/or receptive language alteration caused by brain damage. This disorder has a high prevalence affecting 21%-38% of patients that suffer a cerebrovascular accident. The language areas can be affected in different ways depending on the type of damage that the patient suffers (etiology, spreading, location) and personal factors (personality, intellectual factors, motivation) creating difficulties of different grades in his/her communicative capacity. In spite of the high prevalence of this disorder, the knowledge of the term in society is highly unknown in relation to other neurological disorders of less incidence and prevalence, such as the Parkinson`s disease or the multiple sclerosis. Aphasia can become the more devastating cognitive deficit secondary to the cardiovascular accident. This is to the point that some patients consider that they have lost their personal identity because of the language alteration, creating feelings of anxiety and disability that affect all the areas of their life  . This article tries to explain what the aphasia is, which are the main aphasic symptoms and its most important characteristics, using a connectionist model. Its main aim is to provide information. This is mainly to help the nurse communicate in the best effective way, taking advantage of the abilities that the patient keeps and to give way to the development of the nursing care with aphasic person. Key words: Aphasia, nursing care, language disorders, communication,communication Aids for disabled.",

Since the disorder is usually caused by a trauma to the brain, the speech function is often damaged as well. Additional problems in communicating can come from the inability to motion or communicate using the body language. Speech is a human express orally through a series of complex movements that alter the basic tone created by voice. So, CP’s speech is a rare and unique from the normal human because of the error of connections between the cortex and other parts of the brain such as the cerebellum. Normal human feels really hard to understand the CP’s speech when they communicate each other. Technology is one of the solutions that can help the CP’s speech problem by creating software that can convert the speech or voice to the text.",

      "abstract": "Neurological involvement is a typical feature of several inherited metabolic diseases. The onset of signs and/or symptoms may appear as early as the first days of life or after an interval of normal or near-normal growth and development. Metabolic decomposition usually presents with a severe clinical phenotype, which include poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and loss of consciousness. This spectrum of manifestations is often fatal; however, severe neurological sequelae and/or regression of neurodevelopmental milestones can be the prominent signs in those who survive. Overall, treatable inborn errors of metabolism can be divided in three groups, namely: (Group 1) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism giving rise to acute or chronic intoxication; (Group 2) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism affect in genergetic processes; and (Group 3) inborn errors involving cellular organelles, including lysosomal, peroxisomal, glycosylation, and cholesterol synthesis defects. The spectrum of neurological manifestations includes developmental delay, seizures and epilepsy, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, movement disorders, vision and hearing impairment, peripheral neuropathy, and psychiatric abnormalities. The main anatomical/imaging patterns reflects selective vulnerability of nervous system substance and include atrophy, (predominantly) symmetrical abnormalities, and dysmyelination, As several patients with neurometabolic diseases responds favorably to therapeutic trials, early detection and early intervention is of utmost importance to prevent catabolic-related damage and to revert to normal or near-normal parameters neurodevelopmental milestones.",

Dementia is characterized by a decline in memory, language, problem-solving and in other cognitive domains that affect a person's ability to perform everyday activities and social functioning. It is consistently agreed that cognitive impairment is an important risk factor for developing functional disabilities in patients with dementia. Functional status can be conceptualized as the ability to perform self-care, self- maintenance and physical activity. A person with dementia usually requires help with more complex tasks, such as managing bills and finances, or simply maintaining a household. Good functional performance is fundamental for elderly people to maintain independency and avoid institutionalization. The purpose of this review is to describe functional changes in demented patients, evaluating the variability in subgroups of dementias.",

By definition, the term alexia describes a condition in which reading ability is lost as a result of some neurological insult, such as head injury or stroke. With alexia, it is assumed that the individual had adequate reading achievement prior to the neurological insult, and therefore, the disability is not developmental in nature.",

      "abstract": "Dementia is a collective term used to describe the problems that people with various underlying brain disorders or damage can have with their memory, language and thinking.\n Alzheimer's disease, vascular disease, front temporal dementia are the best known and most common disorders under the umbrella of dementia. Dementia as a clinical syndrome is characterized by global cognitive impairment, which represents a decline from previous level of functioning, and is associated with impairment in functional abilities and, in many cases, behavioral and psychiatric disturbances. It is a chronic progressive debilitating disease that is largely a disorder of old age. It is characterized by widespread impairment of mental functioning, progressive memory loss, language difficulties, confusion and disorientation. These impairments are often accompanied by behavioral and psychological disturbance. The behavioural disturbances associated with dementia are defined as symptoms of disturbed perception, altered thought content, mood and behavior. Dementia is not merely a problem of memory. It reduces the ability to learn reason, retain or recall past experience and there is also loss of patterns of thoughts, feelings and activities. Additional mental and behavioral problems often affect people who have dementia, and may influence quality of life and the need for institutionalization. As dementia worsens individuals may neglect themselves and may become disinhibited, the individual may become incontinent as their condition worsens. Depression affects 20–30% of people who have dementia, and about 20% have anxiety. Psychosis and agitation/aggression also often accompany dementia. The evidence base on the prevalence of dementia is expanding rapidly, particularly in countries with low and middle incomes. There is such a wide range of dementia and levels of severity that the associated complications are vast. Complications may include increased infections anywhere in the body, loss of ability to function or care for self, loss of ability to interact, abuse by an overstressed caregiver, reduced lifespan, and side effects of medications used to treat the disorder.We select this problem as our research study because we want to assess effectiveness of structural teaching programme (STP) on knowledge regarding dementia among adults in a selected community area at Delhi/ NCR”. The study aims to assess the knowledge regarding knowledge regarding dementia among adults in a selected community area at Delhi/ NCR”. This study is a type of experimental research. The research approach used in this study was experimental survey approach. A purposive sampling technique was used to select the samples. The size of the sample was 30 individuals. Data were collected by using closed questionnaire schedule. Analysis was done by descriptive and inferential Statistics. The result showed that the mean post-test knowledge score (20) was higher than the mean pre-test score (20). The mean difference pre-test score (6.8) of knowledge was significant at 0.05% level at the “t”=7.42*P<0.05. Hence research hypothesis H1 was accepted. This indicates that the planed reaching program was effective in increasing the knowledge about dementia and prevention of dementia among adults.",

      "title": "A Study of Experimental Methods for Teaching Emotionally Disturbed, Brain Damaged, Retarded Readers",
      "abstract": "IN RECENT YEARS there has been a growing awareness that there is a distinct syndrome f r e quently associated with children who are slow learners, especially retarded readers, which has been characterized under such headings as hyper kinetic disorder (Laufer, Denhoff and Solomons, 1957), minimally brain damaged (Burks, 1957), visual-motor impairment (Strauss and Lehtinen, 1947), and primary reading disturb ance (Rabinovitch et al., 1956). Generally, these children are thought to have some central nervous system abnormality of function, subcortical or cor tical or both, which has interfered with their abil ity to receive or retain and reproduce visual, audi tory or motor cues, as well as inducing the behav ioral syndrome. Behaviorally, these children can often be identified in that they have a short atten tion span, are hyperactive, easily distracted, and readily overwhelmed by anything new or different. They reveal tendencies to perseverate, with con siderable difficulty in shifting, and poor ability to abstract and to generalize. In reading they often reverse words (such as saw for was), are unable to pronounce words and fail to develop effi cient techniques in reading new words. Their spell ing is usually quite poor because they have no un derstanding of letter sounds and have a poor con cept of phonics; there may be mirror writing with out awareness and their handwriting is often hard ly legible. These symptoms have been given de tailed attention by Strauss and Lehtinen (1947) and Strauss and Kephart (1955), and descriptions of these children can be found in recent artic les by Laufer et al., (1957) and Rabinovitch et al., (1956). The purpose of the present paper is to describe a remedial educational approach that has been found useful with children who evidence such diffi culties. This experimentation has been conducted at the Emma Pendleton Bradley Hospital, which is a residential treatment center for emotionally dis turbed children who have the potential of at 1 e a s t normal intelligence.",

      "abstract": "In article, psychological and pedagogical sources on the mentioned problem areanalyzed, the meaning of the concept of «erased dysarthria» is determined, and theclassification of minimal manifestations of dysarthria in preschool children is provided.Manifestations, causes, and forms of dysarthria are also characterized by analyzingpsychological and pedagogical literature. The leading defect in dysarthria is a violationof the phonetic and prosodic aspects of speech. Violations of speech and language indysarthria are manifested in different degrees and depend on the nature and severity ofthe damage to the nervous system. In mild cases, there are separate distortions ofsounds, «slurred speech», in more severe cases - distortions, substitutions andomissions of sounds are observed, tempo, expressiveness, modulation suffer, and ingeneral the pronunciation becomes indistinct. With severe lesions of the centralnervous system, speech becomes impossible due to complete paralysis of the speechand motor muscles. Directions of corrective work with children of preschool age withmanifestations of dysarthria are determined and the feasibility of their use issubstantiated. The effectiveness of corrective exercises, types of work and didacticmaterial with children with manifestations of dysarthria in the course of corrective workis substantiated. Study confirmed the proposition that: research on the correctiveorientation of educational work, taking into account the stages of the formation ofmental processes, age and individual characteristics of the psyche, behavior, workcapacity, is the key to the development of children preschool age with dysarthria.",

OBJETIVO: contribuir para um maior conhecimento do profissional fonoaudiólogo sobre as causas, consequências, diagnóstico e formas de tratamento da apneia obstrutiva do sono (AOS), a fim de favorecer a definição da conduta por este profissional, seja ela, encaminhar para um diagnóstico, tratar (por meio de fonoterapia) essa patologia ou indicar o tratamento médico, seja ele, cirúrgico ou conservador. CONCLUSÃO: as possíveis alterações fonoaudiológicas encontradas nestes pacientes são: língua alargada apresentando hipotonia, palato mole com volume aumentado, dificuldade na alimentação devido ao aporte insuficiente de ar e ao bruxismo, possivelmente causado pela tensão e ansiedade decorrentes das noites mal dormidas. Outras alterações podem ser encontradas decorrentes do tratamento cirúrgico empregado em alguns casos, como a disfagia ou até mesmo alterações na fala e na ressonância da fala decorrente de uma uvulopalatoplastia. O enfoque do tratamento fonoaudiológico é a mioterapia dos músculos envolvidos, priorizando a musculatura palatal. Percebe-se que o fonoaudiólogo pode contribuir para amenizar os sintomas encontrados nestas patologias, proporcionando uma qualidade de vida melhor aos seus portadores.",

Mada / Madonmada has shown similarity with various psychiatric conditions such as “acute stress disorder,” “posttraumatic stress disorder,” “brief psychotic disorder,” and “adjustment disorder.” The present study provides insights for clinical implementation of “ Mada / Madonmada ” in the diagnosis and management of “trauma- and stressor-related disorders” in terms of Ayurveda . It is astonishing that thousands of years before, “ Acharya Bhela ” has documented the conditions such as trauma- and stressor-related disorders in the form of Mada or Madonmada .",

SCD is defined as a primary deficit in the social use of nonverbal and verbal communication. SCD has very much in common with pragmatic language impairment, which is characterized by difficulties in understanding and using language in context and following the social rules of language, despite relative strengths in word knowledge and grammar. SCD and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are similar in that they both involve deficits in social communication skills, however individuals with SCD do not demonstrate restricted interests, repetitive behaviors, insistence on sameness, or sensory abnormalities. It is essential to rule out a diagnosis of ASD by verifying the lack of these additional symptoms, current or past. The criteria for SCD are qualitatively different from those of ASD and are not equivalent to those of mild ASD. It is clinically important that SCD should be differentiated from high-functioning ASD (such as Asperger syndrome) and nonverbal learning disabilities. The ultimate goals are the refinement of the conceptualization, development and validation of assessment tools and interventions, and obtaining a comprehensive understanding of the shared and unique etiologic factors for SCD in relation to those of other neurodevelopmental disorders.",

      "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders, affective/emotional disorders and exposure to adverse life circumstances are the main sources of psychological impairment in school age children. They should be distinguished from transient psychological symptoms occurring in normal development that do not significantly affect children's emotional and social functioning. An early recognition and assessment is the first step towards adequate treatment of conditions associated with psychological impairment. Any severe or persistant behavioral or emotional symptom occurring in children should be considered a possible early sign of a neurodevelopmental disorder warranting further investigation. Neurodevelopmental disorders are generally associated with delays early in development affecting several domains (language, social functioning, emotional and behavorial regulation) and are predominant in boys. These disorders are highly comorbid and require multidisciplinary assessments and treatment plans. Emotional and behavioral conditions arising from early deprivation or maltreatment also affect various developmental domains and may have lasting consequences. Finally, many of the disorders showing rising prevalences in adolescence or early adulthood also have some developmental precursors before puberty. Progress in identification, appropriate assessment and treatment of early manifesting symptoms and conditions interfering with adaptive functioning is a major mental health issue requiring multidisciplinary competencies.",

It is suggested that iow-level discrimination impairments result from damage to the contralateral postcentral gyrus, and from damage to structures such as the posterior insuia and the parietal operculum. Furthermore, the processing of specific tactile features (e.g. shape, size, versus texture) appears to occur in functionally and neuroanatomlcally separate regions. High-level impairments such as tactile agnosia and aphasia, on the other hand, appear to result from damage to structures in the inferior parietal lobe. The deficit in these disorders appears to reflect loss of access to integrated object descriptions, or loss of access to meaning representations.",

      "abstract": "22q11.2 Deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is a chromosomal microdeletion that affects approximately 40 to 50 genes and affects various organs and systems throughout the body. Detection is typically achieved by fluorescence in situ hybridization after diagnosis of one of the major features of the deletion or via chromosomal microarray or noninvasive prenatal testing. The physical phenotype can include congenital heart defects, palatal and pharyngeal anomalies, hypocalcemia/hypoparathyroidism, skeletal abnormalities, and cranial/brain anomalies, although prevalence rates of all these features are variable. Cognitive function is impaired to some degree in most individuals, with prevalence rates of greater than 90% for motor/speech delays and learning disabilities. Attention, executive function, working memory, visual-spatial abilities, motor skills, and social cognition/social skills are affected. The deletion is also associated with an increased risk for behavioral disorders and psychiatric illness. The early onset of psychiatric symptoms common to 22q11.2DS disrupts the development and quality of life of individuals with the syndrome and is also a potential risk factor for later development of a psychotic disorder. This review discusses prevalence, phenotypic features, and management of psychiatric disorders commonly diagnosed in children and adolescents with 22q11.2DS, including autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and schizophrenia/psychotic disorders. Guidelines for the clinical assessment and management of psychiatric disorders in youth with this syndrome are provided, as are treatment guidelines for the use of psychiatric medications.",

      "title": "Confabulation: Implications for Criminal Justice, Forensic Mental Health, and Legal Professionals",
      "abstract": "Physical and psychological brain disruptions have the ability to impair vital memory functions and processes. For instance, a physical injury to the brain’s frontal lobe can disrupt executive functions, which would include the capacity to plan or multitask, impulse control, and decision making. Similarly, the presence of a degenerative disease such as Alzheimer’s disease can degrade the frontal lobe and lead to executive dysfunction (e.g., short-term memory loss and Broca’s aphasia-a dysfunction of language production). A dangerous potential result of such frontal damage is a phenomenon known as confabulation, which is the unintentional production of memories and statements that are objectively false. In other words, confabulation is lying without the intention of doing so. This cognitive disturbance not only has an impact on daily life, but confabulation is particularly problematic for criminal justice-involved individuals. In general, confabulation makes it difficult for an individual to participate in and navigate through all aspects of the criminal justice system. Moreover, those who may work on behalf of the afflicted, may be negatively impacted by their inability to discern truth from fiction. Individuals suffering from confabulation may be prone to waiving important legal rights (e.g., Miranda rights) or false confessions during interrogations, incompetence to stand trial (i.e., unable to follow legal proceedings and assist defense counsel with their case), or providing false testimony during trials. Each possibility detracts from the integrity of various legal processes. Despite these diverse consequences, there is a dearth of empirical research on the consequences of confabulation in criminal justice settings. In an effort to raise awareness of confabulation in the criminal justice system and encourage further research, this article provides an overview of the symptoms and effects associated with confabulation for professionals working in criminal justice, forensic mental health, and legal settings.",

      "title": "Abnormal time experience, bizarre delusions and verbal-acoustic hallucinations in schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "The integrity of time consciousness is the condition of possibility of the identity through time of an object of perception as well as of the person who perceives it. I will present our findings about abnormal time experience (ATE) in people with schizophrenia. These data may support the following hypothesis: if the continuity of temporal experience disintegrates (of which ATE are experiential manifestations), overarching meaningful units are no longer available, thereby creating temporal gaps, e.g., in one's stream of consciousness. In some cases, thoughts that are no longer experienced as embedded in one's stream of thoughts are experienced as, e.g., thought interferences, blockages, insertion or withdrawal. These symptoms cannot be explained as a mere disturbance of attention or comprehension at the level of semantic combinations. Rather, the disturbance could be searched for at a more basic level where the temporal coherence of conscious awareness is constituted. A failure of the constitutive temporal synthesis may create micro-gaps of conscious experience. In the most severe cases, thoughts or other mental phenomena that are no longer embedded in the continuity of basic self-experience may appear in consciousness as “erratic blocks” and experienced as being inserted, or, if further externalized, as auditory hallucinations (“voices”). This coheres with the hypothesis that a breakdown of temporality may be bound up with the breakdown of prereflexive self-awareness.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is the most serious and disabling of all mental disorders, affecting just under 1 % of the population. While its etiological bases remain obscure and consequently its nosological boundaries are uncertain, the condition classically has its onset in childhood or early adolescence [1]. It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

Without hearing rehabilitation, hearing loss can cause detrimental effects on speech, language, developmental, educational, and cognitive outcomes in children. <h3>Observations</h3> Consequences of hearing loss in children include worse outcomes in speech, language, education, social functioning, cognitive abilities, and quality of life. Hearing loss can be congenital, delayed onset, or acquired with possible etiologies including congenital infections, genetic causes including syndromic and nonsyndromic etiologies, and trauma, among others. Evaluation of hearing loss must be based on suspected diagnosis, type, laterality and degree of hearing loss, age of onset, and additional variables such as exposure to cranial irradiation. Hearing rehabilitation for children with hearing loss may include use of hearing aids, cochlear implants, bone anchored devices, or use of assistive devices such as frequency modulating systems. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Hearing loss in children is common, and there has been substantial progress in diagnosis and management of these cases. Early identification of hearing loss and understanding its etiology can assist with prognosis and counseling of families. In addition, awareness of treatment strategies including the many hearing device options, cochlear implant, and assistive devices can help direct management of the patient to optimize outcomes.",

      "title": "Renal dysfunction in fetal alcohol syndrome: a potential contributor on developmental disabilities of offspring.",
      "abstract": "The term fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) signifies the triad of intrauterine growth retardation, microcephaly and short palpebral fissures, due to prenatal exposure to alcohol (1-4). Those severely affected have unusual facial dysmorphism with microcephaly, narrow forehead, short palpebral fissures with hypoplastic upper lip (5-7). In addition, they have developmental delay, behavior dysfunction or deficit, intellectual impairment and/or mental retardation (8,9). The term fetal alcohol effects (FAE) describe less extreme changes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Criteria have not yet been established for the diagnosis of FAE, but there is consensus that the diagnosis requires deficiencies in two of the above categories and a history of maternal alcohol abuse (1-4). \r\n\r\nPrenatal alcohol exposure has also been linked to cardiac anomalies, urinary and kidney anomalies, neural tube defects, cleft lip with or without cleft palate, gastrointestinal and genital abnormalities, dental anomalies, limb and joint abnormalities, scoliosis, ptosis, strabismus, epicanthal folds, microphthalmia, myopia, short up-turned nose, broad or low nasal bridge, low set ears and rotated ears (10-12). \r\n\r\nRenal structural anomalies of FAS include cross-fused ectopia, renal hypoplasia and urethropelvic junction obstruction have been reported in children with FAS (10,12). More recent clinical and experimental studies have also shown that fetuses exposed to ethanol perinatally have a number of renal functional abnormalities, including impairment in renal acidification and potassium excretion as well as a defect in urinary concentrating ability, even in the absence of any structural abnormalities (13-15). The scanning electron microscopy examinations of the rat kidney following fetal exposure to alcohol, showed mitochondrial swelling and cytoplasmic vacuolation of the epithelial cells of the distal nephron, suggesting the possibility of alcohol induced renal tubular cell injury (16). Assadi and Ziai also reported that offspring of alcoholic mothers particularly those children with FAS have lower plasma zinc levels and that the urinary excretion of zinc is increased in these infants, suggesting a direct relationship between urinary losses and lower plasma zinc levels (17). \r\n\r\nIt is estimated that approximately 5% of all congenital birth defects are attributable to prenatal alcohol exposure across the globe (18-20). Estimates for the incidence of full-blown FAS, is 8 for every 1,000 live births, while that for FAE range from 10-30 per 1,000 live births (18-20). It is estimated that 110,000 newborns annually are affected by alcohol. Cost estimates for FAS/FAE are exorbitant. It is also estimated that 12% of the annual cost for all institutional care for the mentally retarded patients, in the Western communities, are for individuals with FAS/FAE (21). \r\n\r\nDespite the wide spread incidence, FAS remains to be difficult to diagnose clinically, and difficult to research. The clinical features may not be readily obvious and individually are not specific to only FAS (6,9,22). The neonatal period is the most difficult to diagnose FAS. In the neonate the facial dysmorphic feature is subtle, often obscured by periorbital or general facial edema. Mental retardation and developmental impairment may not be evident for several years. Throughout gross specific clinical features can vary. No single feature is found in every case. Also, there exists some overlap between FAS and other syndromes. A history of alcohol abuse in pregnancy is often under reported or denied. Physicians tend to under diagnose FAS either due to lack of familiarity with the syndrome or a reluctance to place a label with negative social connotations. \r\n\r\nThe most distressing consequence of prenatal alcohol exposure is the central nervous system damage (7,8). The affected newborn may exhibit poor sucking, tremulousness, unusual body posturing, abnormal reflexes, and disturbed sleep patterns. The older infant demonstrates measurable decrements in mental and motor development, poor visual recognition, memory and decreased expressive and receptive language. Affected preschoolers demonstrate decreased IQ scores, attention deficits, delayed reaction time and decrements in fine and gross motor performance. The school aged child has decreased achievement scores, is easily distracted, learning disabled, shows poor organization and cooperation and has a rigid approach to problem-solving (7,8). Adolescents and adults with FAS have an average IQ of 65 with a range from 20 to 90. Those with FAE have an average IQ of 80, ranging from 40 to 100 (1-6). Despite higher IQ scores, individuals with FAE generally have achievement test scores similar to those with full FAS. In general, more physical manifestations are associated with poorer intelligence. However, there is a wide overlap in the ranges and the degree of brain damage is not always directly proportional to the severity of physical malformations, making it difficult to predict intelligence on an individual basis. Adolescents and adults exhibit a wide variety of behavioral problems, including impulsivity, social withdrawal and anxiety. Most have problems in adaptive living, lacking judgment and problem-solving skills. Few adults with FAS or FAE are self-sufficient. \r\n\r\nThe identification of renal dysfunction and zinc deficiency in FAS is important from a prognostic point of view and to permit adequate and comprehensive management of patients with this syndrome. \r\n\r\nPrevious studies have shown that birth defects that result from prenatal zinc deficiency are likely caused by a defect in DNA and protein synthesis (23-25). It is also known that zinc deficiency can lower the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase in multiple organs of alcoholic patients (26). \r\n\r\nBecause zinc plays an important role in DNA synthesis and current data are inconclusive, it is possible that alcohol-induced zinc deficiency may contribute to alcohol related birth defects observed in FAS (17). This possibility remains a reasonable hypothesis and requires further study. \r\n\r\nAlcohol induced organ damage arises not only from the direct effects of alcohol on tissues but also from the metabolism and the metabolites of alcohol. Recent investigations have focused on assessing the direct effect of alcohol versus acetaldehyde toxicity, the role of nutrition with impaired placental function and synergic effects of nicotine and caffeine (26). More specifically, mechanisms for FAS involving altered protein synthesis and hypoxemia have been considered (26). Class I and Class II alcohol dehydrogenases are the enzymes that are primarily responsible for initial degradation of alcohol, acetaldehyde, in humans. It has been found that acetaldehyde can cross the human placenta from the maternal to the fetal compartments. Toxic aldehydes generated in this initial degradation step are further oxidized by aldehyde dehydrogenases. It seems likely that genetic variation in alcohol metabolism may lead to differences in the propensity of individuals to develop alcohol induced organ damage. With DNA probes, it will now be possible to assess the role of alcohol metabolizing enzymes in the development of organ damage. \r\n\r\nAs to a specific mechanism by which alcohol may impair fetal growth and development, impaired protein synthesis, abnormal delivery or regulation of glucose in the fetus, altered zinc metabolism, and hypoxia are key considerations under investigation. Better understanding of the mechanism involved may permit more meaningful therapeutic intervention. \r\n\r\nThe timing of alcoholic exposure is also crucial (22). The most crucial period for anatomic abnormalities is early in the first trimester, which includes the time segment preceding pregnancy recognition. The third trimester appears to be the most vulnerable period for overall gross and central nervous system development. Intrauterine growth retardation cannot be detected by ultrasonography until approximately 27 weeks gestation. \r\n\r\nFAS/FAE is particularly tragic because it is totally preventable, simply through abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy. It is the responsibility of health care professionals, social and government agencies to protect the unborn child from the devastating effects of alcohol. The most effective weapon for prevention of FAS is education which targets every non-pregnant of childbearing age (27,28). Pregnant women who are identified to use alcohol should be intensively counseled to discontinue further alcohol consumption. Although this will not reverse any damage already produced, at least any further damage is prevented. \r\n\r\nIdentification of women at risk is often difficult. Simple questioning can be unreliable because of poor recall or denial. Since direct questioning regarding alcohol can be intimidating, questionnaires may be developed for assessment of risk. Hopefully through continued educational efforts, we will successfully imprint the awareness that alcohol consumption during pregnancy is unacceptable.",

      "title": "Sentence comprehension in ageing and Alzheimer's disease",
      "abstract": "Abstract The ability to correctly interpret complex syntax and long sentences is gradually impaired as people age. Typical ageing is characterised by working memory deficits, which are thought to play an important role in determining whether syntax can be comprehended correctly, and neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are thought to exacerbate these limitations. Furthermore, declines in processing speed appear to cause increasing difficulty in the proper allocation of cognitive resources necessary for sentence processing. Typically ageing adults may compensate for these deficits successfully when interpreting sentences using semantics or intact cognitive functions, but AD patients may exhibit deficits too severe for this to occur. The causes of syntax comprehension deficits in Alzheimer's are still contested, and may consist of language‐specific impairments or deficits in general cognition impacting linguistic behaviour. In this review, we aim to give an overview of the main markers of cognitive ageing and AD in the domain of sentence comprehension, as well as discuss potential underlying factors that may affect sentence comprehension in older speakers and Alzheimer's patients.",

We consider the relationship between developmental dysphasia and epilepsy, bearing in mind that this association may occur fortuitously, as a consequence of the same cause or taking the epilepsy to be responsible for the language disorder, as seizures or continuously (epileptic aphasia).We assess the relation between developmental aphasia and seizure aphasia in the epilepsies, especially the syndrome of acquired epileptic aphasia of Laundau-Kleffner (LKS). Based on the findings in the literature and a personal series of nine cases, we studied their general characteristics, clinical heterogeneity, associated clinical signs and EEG changes (present in all patients); coexistence of convulsive seizures (67-90%); aetiopathogenic findings invoked but not currently conclusive; negative neuroimaging findings apart from some SPECT and PET data; differential diagnosis; clinical course and prognosis difficult to predict. The pharmacological and/or surgical treatment, complemented by logopedics and psychopedagogics (good results in < or = 50% of the cases), the unpredictable course of LKS has to be assessed cautiously.No direct relation can be confirmed between epilepsy and language disorders, although a relationship may be found in some cases. The hypothesis that LKS, continuous spike-and-wave during slow sleep and partial benign atypical epilepsy are the severe, moderate and mild forms of the same epileptic syndrome is generally accepted. This appears during a phase of maturation in which the brain is particularly vulnerable, and is characterized by continuous spike-and-wave complexes during slow sleep, which lead to cognitive and behaviour disorders.",

      "title": "Impact of prematurity on the auditory function development",
      "abstract": "Prematurity is a high risk factor for the development of somatic and neurological diseases, as well as pathology of sensory systems. Premature babies are susceptible to the development of peripheral or central, congenital or acquired hearing impairments, which usually form in the first months or years of a child’s life. Their timely detection and correction is facilitated by the introduction of neonatal audiological screening. However, due to the presence of a wide range of comorbidities, mainly neuropsychiatric disorders, which specialists and parents focus on, these children, having successfully passed the screening procedure, may later “slip away” from the field of vision not only of the audiologist, but also of the otorhinolaryngologist, despite on the hearing impairment that is developing in them. At the same time, the delay and / or impairment of auditory speech and language development, associated cognitive impairment, as a rule, is attributed to neuropsychiatric deficits, rather than auditory sensory deprivation. The aim of the study was to assess the state of auditory function in premature infants who have reached the age of 10 years. We examined 16 children aged 10 years with an average gestational age at birth of 27,6 ± 2,9 weeks, with an average body weight of 1104 ± 448 g. There was no information about acute otitis media in the past in any of the cases. Traditional ENT examinations with otomicroscopy and a comprehensive audiological examination with an assessment of speech intelligibility were carried out, if necessary, radiation diagnostic methods were used. In 12 children, the otoscopic picture and auditory function were within normal limits. Four subjects had otoscopic and audiological signs of adhesive otitis media, verified by multispiral computed tomography of the temporal bones, which was regarded as the outcome of recurrent / persistent exudative otitis media (EOM) that occurred in the past. All 4 patients were diagnosed with grade I hearing loss, in equal proportions conductive and mixed. Most babies were born deeply premature, with many risk factors for the development of EOM. The examination of hearing and speech function showed impairment of speech intelligibility, which was significantly worse compared to children without peripheral hearing loss, which, in all likelihood, was one of the reasons for the academic failure of children, complaints about which their parents made. Due to the fact that EOM in premature babies can be asymptomatic and unrecognized, at the same time, it has a negative effect on hearing and speech development, the need for regular preventive examinations of such children by an otorhinolaryngologist with the obligatory involvement of tympanometry at least twice a year until they reach age 9–10 years.",

      "abstract": "References 665The term frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is used here to describe a clinically and pathologically heterogeneous group of non-Alzheimer forms of dementia arising from degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes. The prototypical, and most common, clinical syndrome is frontotemporal dementia (FTD), manifesting as behavioural and personality changes, involving disinhibition, stereotypy, unsocial acts and language disorder, leading to apathy, mutism and late neurological (frontal release or extrapyramidal) signs (Neary et al., 1998; Neary et al., 2005; Neary et al., 2007). However, the spectrum of illness is wider, involving cases where movement disorder, with relatively mild dementia, is the major disabling feature (Cordes et al., 1992; Wszolek et al., 1992; Lynch et al., 1994) or others with the linguistic disorders of semantic dementia (SD) and progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA) (Snowden et al., 1992; Neary et al., 1998; Neary et al., 2005; Neary et al., 2007). FTD can be accompanied by clinical motor neurone disease (MND) in about 10 per cent cases giving the syndrome of frontotemporal dementia with motor neurone disease (FTD1MND) (Neary et al., 1998; Neary et al., 2005; Neary et al., 2007). Onset of illness is usually before 65 years of age, with duration being between six and nine years, though up to 15 years is not uncommon (Neary et al., 1998; Rosso et al., 2003; Neary et al., 2005; Neary et al., 2007).",

      "title": "Deformities of Cerebral Palsy Treated By Ilizarov Technique",
      "abstract": "Cerebral palsy is a condition that affects thousands of babies and children each year. It is not contagious, which means no one can catch it from anyone who has it. The word cerebral means having to do with the brain. The word palsy means a weakness or problem in the way a person moves or positions his or her body. A kid with Cerebral palsy (CP) has trouble controlling the muscles of the body (hall mark of the condition is motor dysfunction, i.e. there is abnormal muscle tone, abnormal posture and movement) [1,2]. Normally, the brain tells the rest of the body exactly what to do and when to do it. But because CP affects the brain, depending on what part of the brain is affected, a kid might not be able to walk, talk, eat or play the way most kids do. It is a non-progressive but often changing motor impairment syndromes. It is usually secondary to an insult of limited duration or anomalies of the brain arising in the early stages of development. (Viz. prenatal, intranatal, neonatal and post natal up to 5 years). The changing clinical picture results from developmental maturation and intervention. The clinical expression of the case depends on the extent and area of brain damage, growth of the child, coexisting developmental problems.",

      "abstract": "Neurobehavioral manifestations of developmental impairment of the brainIndividual characteristics of human nature (e.g. introversion, extroversion, mood, activity, adaptability, aggressiveness, social ability, anxiety) do not need to be primarily innate. They can be determined by the action of various influences and their interactions on functional development of the brain. There is ample epidemiological and experimental evidence that chemical and/or physical factors acting during sensitive time windows of the brain development can cause mental, behavioral, emotional and/or cognitive disorders. Environmental pollutants, addictive substances, drugs, malnutrition, excessive stress and/or hypoxia-ischemia were reported to induce functional maldevelopment of the brain with consequent neurobehavioral disorders. The article provides review on most significant neurobehavioral manifestations of developmental impairment of the brain during prenatal, perinatal and early postnatal period. The most known adverse factors causing developmental neurobehavioral dysfunctions in humans as well as in experimental animals are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Specific learning disorders -referred as dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysorthography, dysgraphia, among others- are multidimensional challenges for the academic, emotional and social performance of children and adolescents. These are not due to sensory deficits or teaching failures, but rather are the result of specific neurobiological abnormalities. In the case of dyslexia, for instance, neuroimaging research has found atypical activation in critical regions of the left hemisphere, such as the fusiform gyrus or the temporoparietal region, involved in decoding and phonological abilities, and reduced functional connectivity among these and other (in)directly relevant language production areas. On another hand, dyscalculia, involves changes in the intraparietal sulcus and the thalamus with effects on the processing of numbers and working memory. The neuropsychological evaluation is the touchstone of diagnosis for these learning disorders and for the planning of more individualized remediation. A variety of neuroscience-informed treatments (e.g., hemispheric stimulation, cognitive training, transcranial electrical stimulation, and educational computer games) have been successful in increasing reading and executive functions. Further research is, however, still required to gain an improved understanding of these conditions and an ethical obligation among professionals to follow the developments in this emerging field of learning disorder neuroscience.",

Terapi farmakologi seperti pemberian Antidepresan dan Antipsikotik atau disebut juga dengan neuroleptik untuk menurunkan frekuensi dan tingkat keparahan simtom-simtom psikotik pada penderita skizofrenia. Pengobatan dengan antipsikotik sering menimbulkan efek samping seperti mulut kering (xerostomia). Xerostomia sekunder untuk hiposalivasi juga dapat mengakibatkan karies gigi rampan, infeksi jamur mulut seperti kandidiasis, perubahan rasa, mulut berbau, atau mulut terbakar. Karies gigi merupakan penyebab utama kehilangan gigi di kalangan kelompok muda. Hilangnya satu atau beberapa gigi dapat menyebabkan gangguan fungsi pengunyahan, bicara dan estetika yang dapat mempengaruhi kualitas hidup seseorang. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui hubungan gangguan psikotik skizofrenia paranoid terhadap kehilangan gigi sebagian pada pasien di Rumah Sakit Jiwa Banda Aceh. Pengambilan sampel dilakukan dengan cara Non-Probability Sampling dengan metode Purposive Sampling yang didapat sebanyak 24 orang subjek. Data yang diperoleh dari penelitian di analisis dengan Uji Chi-Square untuk melihat hubungan kehilangan gigi sebagian pada pasien skizofrenia paranoid dengan pengaruh lama konsumsi obat, jenis kelamin dan obat yang dikonsumsi. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan pada variabel jenis kelamin tidak memberikan hasil yang signifikan karena nilai p = 1.000.

Pharmacological therapies such as antidepressants and antipsychotics or also called neuroleptics are intend to reduce the frequency and severity of psychotic symptoms in schizophrenics. Treatment with antipsychotics which oftenly cause some side effects such as dry mouth (xerostomia). Secondary xerostomia to hyposalivation can also result in dental caries, oral fungal infections such as candidiasis, changes in taste, bad breath or burning mouth sensation. Dental caries is a major cause of tooth loss among young group. The loss of one or several teeth can cause functional of mastication, speech and aesthetic disorders that can affect a person's quality of life. This study aims to determine the correlation of paranoid schizophrenic psychotic disorders to partial tooth loss in patients at Banda Aceh Mental Hospital. The method of acquiring the data were delivered by Non-Probability Sampling that use Purposive Sampling method obtained by 24 subjects. Data which obtained from the study were analyzed by the Chi-Square Test to see the correlation of partial tooth loss in paranoid schizophrenic patients with the effect of duration in medication treatment , gender and medication consumed. The results indicate that the gender variable did not provide significant results because of the p = 1.000. Nevertheless the variable of duration in medication treatment indicate a significant results because of the p = 0.041 and also the variable of the drugs consumed also indicate a significant results of the p = 0.027. The results of the study reveal a significant correlation between psychotic disorders of paranoid schizophrenia to partial loss of teeth in patients at the Banda Aceh Mental Hospital with a significant duration of treatment and type of drugs consumed by the patient, but there is no significant correlation to gender.\r Keywords: Paranoid Schizophrenia, Antidepressant Drugs, Antipsychotic Drugs, Xerostomia, Dental Caries, Partial Tooth Loss.",

      "title": "THE CHILD WHO HAS SEVERE NEUROLOGIC IMPAIRMENT",
      "abstract": "The formulation of a diagnosis in a child who has neurologic impairment should not (except in extreme circumstances) be made on the basis of a single finding. For example, the presence of delayed milestones, primitive or exaggerated reflexes, abnormal muscle tone, abnormal posture, abnormal neurologic examination, and temporal course should all be used to make the diagnosis of cerebral palsy. Furthermore, because each condition has a spectrum of disabilities from mild to severe involvement, determination of the child's abilities and impairments should be part of the diagnostic process. Because the child lives in a number of different environments, assessment of the child's functional abilities and evaluation of the environments should be made. Finally, evaluations by specialists in physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, psychology, special education, and nutrition may be necessary to complete the child's diagnosis. The ability to examine the child over a period of time (i.e., continuity of care) allows the practitioner to provide a more accurate prognosis for future development. It also enables easier diagnosis of the child when he or she is acutely ill. This also allows a more trusting relationship to develop with the parent and enhances the ability to influence the psychosocial conditions that affect outcomes. Finally, all these children should have care coordination (case management) (i.e., someone who can ensure that they receive the care they need, without duplication) across all settings, including home, school, hospitals, and ambulatory facilities.",

A large group of children has severely impaired language learning abilities in the absence of a clear cause. These children have developmental language disorder (DLD). Many children with DLD also develop psychiatric symptoms which are associated with other neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorder.In this article, we provide information on children with DLD, on the often atypical language development of children with other neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorder, and on the mechanisms that may explain the co-occurrence of language problems and psychiatric symptoms.We discuss relevant literature and insights from clinical practice.Psychiatric symptoms can hinder language development and, vice versa, children with language problems are more vulnerable to develop behavior associated with a psychiatric diagnosis. Given the frequent co-occurrence of language problems and psychiatric symptoms in children, there is a high chance that a psychiatrist will encounter children with language difficulties in daily clinical practice.Knowledge and awareness of this co-occurrence benefits clinical care, and has important implications for diagnosis and intervention of children with neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorders.",

      "title": "Estrés diario y calidad de vida en las personas con lesión medular espinal",
      "abstract": "La Lesion Medular Espinal (LME) refiere a un suceso vital mayor que provoca importantes y permanentes cambios. Consiste en un cese de la senal neuronal que oca-siona una restriccion de las funciones motoras, sensitivas y vegetativas por debajo de la lesion. Una LME afecta gravemente a las funciones y capacidades de la persona. El estres diario puede entenderse como de¬mandas coti¬dianas y frus¬trantes que condicionan la interac¬cion del sujeto con el medio. Se ha encontrado que un aumento en la percepcion de contrariedades predice un empeoramiento de la sintomatologia psicologica y somatica. Las personas con una LME se en¬frentan a un amplio conjunto de situa¬ciones estresantes novedo¬sas. La calidad de vida (CV) es un constructo complejo y aun no se ha alcanzado un acuerdo general en su definicion. Puede interpretarse como un estilo personal cuyas caracteristicas serian encontrar un equilibrio entre expectativas, esperanzas y realida-des conseguidas o asequibles. Los objetivos principales de esta tesis fueron el desarrollo y validacion de una es-cala de me¬dida del estres diario en la LME, por un lado, y la medida y valoracion de la CV en la poblacion de lesionados medulares, asi como por que variables resulta mas influenciada, por otro. Para cubrir el primer objetivo, desarrollamos la Escala de Estres Diario para la Lesion Medular Espinal (EED–LME–26). Resulta importante puesto que en la actuali-dad no existe ninguna herra¬mienta para este proposito en esta poblacion. Para su crea-cion se utilizo una muestra de 105 sujetos. Se realizo un analisis factorial exploratorio obteniendose 9 dimensiones del estres. Posteriormente, aplicando analisis factorial confirmatorio validamos 8 de las 9 dimensiones anteriores. La validez concurrente de la escala se com¬probo a traves de correla¬ciones con otras medidas del estres psicoso-cial, mostrando que nuestra escala es adecuada para la evaluacion del estres diario en la LME. Para estimar la CV en la LME, se valoro el impacto de diversos indicadores obje-tivos, variables sociodemograficas, y psicosociales asi como la relacion de CV con la salud subjetiva. A tal fin, se llevo a cabo un analisis de regresion multiple hacia ade-lante. Su resultado mostro que la CV en los participantes de nuestra muestra se asocia negativamente con la gravedad de la LME, con una peor salud fisica, y con un incre-mento en la variable “consumo de analgesicos”. Y hubo una correlacion positiva con un nivel alto de hardiness, apoyo social, y vivienda adaptada. Consideramos que la EED–LME–26 sera un instru¬mento que pueda utilizarse en investigacio¬nes sobre la influencia del estres diario en lesionados medulares. Tambien podra servir al personal sani¬tario, psicolo¬gico y psiquia¬trico de cara a obtener infor-macion util y rele¬vante para la terapia con la LME y tratar trastornos psicologicos colaterales a la LME. En relacion con nuestro estudio de la CV en personas con una LME, se han proporcionado datos de interes tanto desde una perspectiva orientada a la salud, como, tambien, para colaborar con las distintas asociaciones de lesionados medulares y dis-capacitados, de manera que estas puedan emplearlos como un instrumento de sensibi-lizacion de los organismos oficiales. Adicionalmente, tanto la EED–LME–26 como las conclusiones derivadas de nuestra evaluacion de la CV en personas con una LME, podran resultar utiles de cara a actuar en lesionados medulares que no logran adaptarse a su nuevo entorno, que han perdido su trabajo y el panorama laboral no es propicio. Asimismo, resulta importante para establecer una optima relacion social y/o familiar. Logicamente tambien es im-portante que la sociedad asimile a los lesionados medulares como personas validas y capacitadas.",

      "title": "Swallowing Disorders and Rehabilitation Techniques",
      "abstract": "Dysphagia may be defined as \"difficulty moving food from the mouth to the stomach\" (M. Donner, Dysphagia, 1, 1988) and encompasses impaired airway protection and problems with secretion management. There are a variety of neurological and neuromuscular conditions that can impair the oral, pharyngeal and esophageal phases of swallowing and cause dysphagia in infants and children. Neurologic conditions can be acute in onset (e.g. hemorrhagic, infectious, inflammatory, traumatic, cerebral infarctions) or chronic (e.g. cerebral palsy, genetic disorders, encephalopathy, myopathy, neuropathy). There are various conditions that will cause neurogenic dysphagia that are also progressive in nature and can worsen in adulthood (e.g. Arnold-Chiari malformation, intracranial malignancies, dystonia, metabolic disorders, degenerative cortical conditions). These various conditions can progress rapidly or may be subtle and slow in their emergence. Symptoms of dysphagia in infants and children include: failure to thrive, meal-time distress, spitting, vomiting, choking, coughing and gagging during meals, refusing food, excessive oral secretions, oral-tactile hypersensitivity, aspiration-related respiratory conditions, and gastroesophageal or pharyngeal reflux. The ability to swallow, suck and breathe are completely developed at birth. Recent ultrasound studies of the fetus indicate that suckling is present between the 18th and 24th week and that by 34 weeks in-utero a regular burst-pause pattern of swallow is present. This burst-pause pattern together with a stable airway are prerequisites for normal infant feeding. By the time a child is between 18 to 24 months of age, independent self-feeding for most foods is well established. The normal anatomical and physiological development of the infant swallow will be presented and contrasted with the adult swallow. Conditions that impair this normal pattern of swallow will be presented and their symptoms discussed as they relate to infants and children. When problems persist beyond 6 months of age \"intervention usually is required to resolve difficulties with spoon feeding, cupdrinking, chewing, self-feeding skills and suckling\" (Sheppard, 1997, p.57). Table Feeding disorders and dysphagia in infants and children can be both physiological or behavioral in nature. If the child is unable to eat successfully or displays negative and aversive behaviors during mealtimes, problems in parent-child interactions may emerge that place unusual stresses on the family. Stress may contribute to creation of persistent behavioral abnormalities and aversive meal-times reactions. Therefore it is important that swallowing intervention is initiated as early as possible to avoid the pervasive problems that may occur in children who are not eating normally. A thorough medical/behavioral history and clinical feeding evaluation must be conducted before starting treatment. This evaluation should be family-centered and include observations during feeding. Because management of these children may be complicated, multidisciplinary team evaluations should be conducted. The members of this team may include pediatricians, gastroenterologists, neurologists, speech-language pathologists, nurses, physical and occupational therapists, radiologists, otalaryngologists, pharmacists and psychologists to develop a diagnosis and plan of management. Provision of treatment of dysphagia is usually conducted by the speech-language pathologist trained in pediatric dysphagia and includes: therapeutic strategies for nonnutritive oral stimulation, airway and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) management, habilitation of feeding, drooling, nutritional and mealtime management techniques. For those children who have been intubated, management includes teaching techniques that will facilitate transitioning from nonoral to oral feeding. Successful rehabilitation of children with swallowing disorders requires knowledge of the parameters of normal and abnormal oral pharyngeal and esophageal swallowing plus skill in the integration of a variety of essential therapeutics techniques.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Illness behavior refers to the ways in which symptoms are perceived, understood, acted upon, and communicated and include facial grimacing, holding or supporting the affected body part, limping, using a cane, and stooping while walking. Illness behavior can be unconscious or conscious: In the former, the person is unaware of the mental processes and content that are significant in determining behavior; conscious illness behavior may be voluntary and conscious (the two are not necessarily associated). The first broad category of inappropriate illness behavior is defensiveness, which is characterized by denial or minimization of symptoms. The second category includes somatoform disorders, factitious disorders, and malingering and is characterized by exaggerating, fabricating, or denying symptoms; minimizing capabilities or positive traits; or misattributing actual deficits to a false cause. Evaluators can detect the presence of inappropriate illness behaviors based on evidence of consistency in the history or examination; the likelihood that the reported symptoms make medical sense and fit a reasonable disease pattern; understanding of the patient's current situation, personal and social history, and emotional predispositions; emotional reactions to symptoms; evaluation of nonphysiological findings; results obtained using standardized test instruments; and tests of dissimulation, such as symptom validity testing. Unsupported and insupportable conclusions regarding inappropriate illness behavior represent substandard practice in view of the importance of these conclusions for the assessment of impairment or disability.",

      "title": "Problems with Object Permanence: Rethinking Traditional Beliefs Associated with Poor Theory of Mind in Autism",
      "abstract": "Poor Theory of Mind (ToM) (or difficulties imputing mental states to self and others) [1], (See also [2-5]) is often blamed for certain responses and behaviour in autism. However, the Theory of Mind Task Battery requires an understanding of language, the use of cognitive skills, as well as the child’s motivation and attention to complete. All of these factors are either weak or under-developed in individuals with autism suggesting that this is not the best means to measure one’s understanding that other people have their own thoughts, plans, beliefs, or point of view. Behaviours like strong defiance, insistence on sameness, fear associated with sudden change and severe anxiety may be related to difficulties seeing beyond the ‘now’ [6]. This paper suggests that some of the stress and anxiety in the autism population may actually be due to delayed object permanence (OP) (knowing something may still exist even if it is out of sight), which can appear as poor ToM. This delay in establishing OP is governed by single focused attention. For more information on this concept see: Lawson, W. (2011) The passionate mind, JKP:London. Although ToM and OP are defined differently, this paper aims to show the relationship between them and how one concept can influence the other using examples in everyday life to illustrate how poor OP is associated with single focused attention, which detracts from the bigger picture.",

      "title": "Disorders of voice",
      "abstract": "A significant number of children and adults experience problems with the production of voice or phonation which compromise their effectiveness as communicators. Many voice disorders or dysphonias have an identifiable organic aetiology. This may take the form of benign growths known as vocal nodules, which are related to sustained vocal abuse. Unsurprisingly, vocal nodules are commonly found in children who regularly shout and scream and in professional voice users (e.g. singers) who place above average demands on their voice. Alternatively, a malignant growth may pervade the tissues of the larynx to such an extent that a partial or complete laryngectomy is necessitated. The adult who undergoes a laryngectomy can achieve voice production after surgery through the use of an artificial or electronic larynx, the production of oesophageal voice or surgical voice reconstruction. Aside from benign and malignant growths, other organic aetiologies of voice disorders include infections (e.g. viral laryngitis), neurological impairment (e.g. vocal fold paralysis), vocal fold haemorrhage, and laryngeal trauma (e.g. as a result of endotracheal intubation). Speech and language therapists work closely with ENT specialists (or otolaryngologists) in the assessment and treatment of organic voice disorders.",

Los fenomenos de hiperlexia se describen en ninos que presentan alteraciones o retraso en el desarrollo y se caracterizan por la habilidad para acceder a la lectura de forma precoz y autoaprendida. Esta habilidad para la decodificacion de palabras no se correlaciona con el nivel intelectual y puede cursar con diferentes grados de retraso mental y, siempre, con dificultades de relacion social. El autismo es el trastorno prototipico de los trastornos de espectro autista (TEA), que se caracteriza fundamentalmente por alteraciones cualitativas en la interaccion social, en el desarrollo de la comunicacion y el lenguaje y la presencia de un repertorio limitado de intereses, acompanado de respuestas estereotipadas o peculiares. Desarrollo. La presencia de hiperlexia en ninos con autismo es mas frecuente que en otras alteraciones del desarrollo. Este fenomeno se relaciona con las habilidades mejor conservadas de memoria visual, discriminacion visual y motivacion/interes hacia el material representado de forma visual que presentan las personas con autismo. Sin embargo, no todas las personas con autismo presentan hiperlexia, ni todos los ninos con hiperlexia presentan autismo, a pesar de la evidencia de que el fenomeno de hiperlexia se observe con mas frecuencia en el autismo y en los TEA.

      "abstract": "ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in behavior and communication and social interaction of the diagnosed person, having negative consequences on functioning and performance in different areas. With different forms of manifestation and degrees of impairment, the individual with ASD presents difficulties in contextual and/or sensory perception of stimuli, which causes maladaptive responses from him/her, often accompanied by motor difficulties. The purpose of this article is to identify the existence of the benefits that the practice of motor and sports activities have on sensory processing in children with ASD. The results highlight that there are associations between sensory processing difficulties and motor impairments, even from the first years of life, with the motor and sensory areas being in neural connection and developing at the same time at an accelerated pace. Practicing motor and sports activities leads to improvements in different areas: physical and mental health, motor skills (oral and visual, gross and fine motor skills, manual dexterity, balance, ability to relax and control body movements), cognitive and sensory processing (memorization, sequencing, attention, cognitive flexibility, inhibitory control of body movements, academic performance), communication and social interaction skills (establishing and maintaining friendships, acceptance from others), adaptive behaviors (reduction of stereotyped and self-aggressive behaviors, self-stimulation, hyperkinetic behavior).",

      "abstract": "The article substantiates the medical-psychological-pedagogical approach to determining the delay in psycho-speech development. In speech therapy practice, as well as in the field of special education in general, there is a widespread violation of psychophysical development, which is separated into a group of violations called “delayed speech development”. Given that speech belongs to the cognitive function of the human body, when it is disturbed, all leading mental functions suffer: perception, thinking, memory, imagination. Accordingly, the inertia of speech development, as a rule, indicates the inertia of maturation / formation of leading mental processes. Numerous studies in the field of speech therapy show that with delayed speech development, there is a steady trend of delayed manifestations of mental development. Accordingly, today, more and more practitioners are using the definition of “delayed psychospeech development” when defining the manifestation of a disorder that was previously defined as “delayed speech development”. The theoretical and experimental lack of development of the problem of early diagnostic and corrective assistance to a child with delayed psycho-speech development in a sensitive period makes it difficult to activate its adaptive and compensatory capabilities. Understanding the positions of leading scientists in the field of special, age-related psychology, analysis of experimental data on the problem of researching the psycho-speech development of children with psycho-speech development delay in the unity of early and preschool age showed that the issue of comprehensive intervention to help children with psycho-speech development delay is not fully disclosed. Defining the terminologically meaningful aspect of the concept of psycho-speech development in the case of delay in psychospeech development in relation to the relevant age periods, we consider it integrative in relation to mental, speech, intellectual, emotionalvolitional development, which has a certain structure, the variability of which is characterized by individual-typical features of impaired development with delayed psycho-speech development, which formed the basis of our understanding of the essence of this phenomenon.",

Clinical featuresThe clinical picture of Angelman syndrome has been broadly documented, principally in children, but with an increasing emphasis on adolescents and adults.Clinical diagnosis is based on a set of physical (Fig. 1) and behavioral features (Williams et al., 2006) (Table 1).All patients have developmental delay with severely impaired cognitive skills.They show specific speech impairment; about one-third of patients speak no words at all, and the others rarely use more than five words.This contrasts with better receptive verbal communication and communication skills based on spontaneous or learned signs.Behavior is characteristically overactive, exuberant, sociable, and happy, with frequent smiling and laughing (Pelc et al., 2008a).Developmental motor impairment includes mild to moderate axial hypotonia, present from birth, and eventual spastic hypertonia of the limbs that may become apparent during the first year of life (Dan & Cheron, 2008).Despite varying degrees of ataxia, most patients develop independent walking.Gait is distinctive, with a wide support base, extension and lateral rotation of the lower limb, elbow flexion, and wrist supination.About 90% of patients have epileptic seizures.Seizure onset is often between 1 and 3 years.Many seizure types, both generalized and focal, have been reported, including epileptic spasms, myoclonic absences, myoclonic, atonic, tonic, and tonic-clonic seizures, but atypical absence and myoclonic seizures have been particularly emphasized.As in other developmental conditions with epilepsy, the seizure disorder often improves in late childhood, although epilepsy can persist or reappear in adulthood, and be difficult to Fig. 1.Facial characteristics of a child with Angelman syndrome.Visual contact, fair eyes, midface hypoplasia, wide smiling mouth.www.intechopen.comThe Lessons from Angelman Syndrome for Research and Management 61 A. Consistent features (100%) Developmental delay, functionally severe.Movement or balance disorder, usually ataxia of gait, and/or tremulous movement of limbs.Movement disorder can be mild.May not appear as frank ataxia but can be forward lurching, unsteadiness, clumsiness, or quick, jerky motions Behavioral uniqueness: any combination of frequent laughter/smiling; apparent happy demeanor; easily excitable personality, often with uplifted hand-flapping, or waving movements; hypermotor behavior Speech impairment, none or minimal use of words; receptive and non-verbal communication skills higher than verbal ones B. Frequent features (more than 80%) Delayed, disproportionate growth in head circumference, usually resulting in microcephaly (-2 standard deviations of normal head circumference) by age 2 years.Microcephaly is more pronounced in those with 15q11.2-q13deletions Seizures, onset usually before 3 years of age.Seizure severity usually decreases with age but the seizure disorder lasts throughout adulthood Abnormal electroencephalogram, with a characteristic pattern (Dan and Boyd 2003).The electroencephalographic abnormalities can occur in the first 2 years of life, can precede clinical features, and are often not correlated to clinical seizure events How to referenceIn order to correctly reference this scholarly work, feel free to copy and paste the following:",

      "title": "Metaphor Comprehension in Schizophrenic Patients",
      "abstract": "People with schizophrenia often exhibit difficulties to comprehend figurative expressions, such as irony, proverbs, metaphors and idioms, with a general proneness to neglect the figurative meaning and to accept the more literal one. This inability is usually referred to as concretism and it constitutes a clinical manifestation of the broader language dysfunction called Formal Thought Disorder. The current review focuses on the neuropsychological and neuroanatomical underpinnings of schizophrenics' misinterpretation of a subgroup of figurative expressions, i.e., metaphors. Metaphors are heterogeneous in nature, classifiable according to various criteria; for instance, metaphors can be conventional and familiar, or conversely, novel and unusual. These linguistic distinctions are substantial because the comprehension of the different types of metaphor entails partially different cognitive strategies and neural substrates. This review gathers studies that have directly investigated which neurocognitive deficits explain the inefficient comprehension of metaphor in schizophrenia. Several impairments have been put forward, such as general intelligence, executive functions and Theory of Mind deficits. Moreover, the neural correlates of metaphor comprehension in schizophrenia, like the left inferior/medial frontal gyrus and the temporal lobe, match those cortices affected by the neuropathology of schizophrenia. Even though the causal defective mechanism is still a matter of investigation, we provide an attempt to integrate existing findings",

      "abstract": "Abstract Dementia is characterized by an insidious and progressive loss of memory, disorientation, cognitive decline in other domains, and affective flattening. It is often accompanied by neuropsychological deficits such as aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or disturbances in executive functioning including planning, organizing, and sequencing of events in a logical fashion. Behavioural symptoms such as withdrawal, depression, delusions, motor restlessness, wander-ing, or aggression may complicate dementia, particularly in advanced stages of the disorder. These behavioural symptoms may occur, in part, secondary to loss of orientation and memory, with loss of autobiographic memory perhaps being most devastating. A patient, for example, who is impaired in retrieving past social interactions from autobiographical memory or recalling other relevant personal information may be more likely to respond with increasing irritability or anxiety in situations that are actually or perceived unfamiliar. Such a patient may perhaps choose a ‘safety first’ strategy or remain captured in indecisiveness, which could manifest in ruminating thinking and stereotyped behaviour, or displacement activities expressing motivational conflict and ambivalence. In any event, the combination of memory loss with other cognitive disturbances certainly leads to a profound deterioration of social competence. It is also noteworthy that, in addition to the problems the patients have themselves, which they generally deny except in the earliest stages of the disorder (anosognosia), dementia creates a substantial burden on patients’ spouses, children and other carers.",

      "title": "Deterioration",
      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

However, Self-consciousness is multifaceted: it includes awareness of the body, perceptions, one's own history, identity, and one's own projects. Self-consciousness is linked to consciousness of others i.e. to social cognition supported by identification of others, but also by comprehension of facial expression of emotions, comprehension and expression of emotional prosody, pragmatic abilities, ability to infer other's people's mental states, thoughts, and feelings (theory of mind and empathy), knowledge of social norms and rules, social reasoning. The subtypes of dementias (and namely Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia) affect heterogeneously the different aspects of the self-and other-consciousness.

      "title": "[Causes, diagnosis and treatment of neurogenic dysphagia as an interdisciplinary clinical problem].",
      "abstract": "The intricate mechanism of swallowing can be divided into three phases: oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal. Dysphagia is a disruption in the swallowing process, which include difficulty in transporting (or a lack of transporting) a food or liquid bolus from the mouth through the pharynx and esophagus into the stomach. Causes of disruptions in the swallowing process can be divided into superior (oropharyngeal) and inferior (esophageal) according to Paradowski et al. Neurlologic dysphagia may be caused by a disruption in different parts of the central nervous system (supranuclear level, level of motor and sensory nuclei taking part in swallowing process, peripherial nerves level and a pathology of muscle cells and spindles) or neuromuscular and muscular disorders. Neuromuscular disorders causes according to Waśko-Czopnik et al. are: stroke, brain tumors, brain injury, bulbar and pseudobulbar paralysis, neurodegenerative diseases (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis), tabes dorsalis, multisystem degenerations, Parkinson's disease, delayed dyskineses, Huntington's disease, myasthenia and myasthenic syndromes, myopathies and peripherial neuropathies. The correct diagnosis evaluation include history taking, physical examination with palpation and consultations (laryngological, gastrological and neurological). According to Halama radiological esophagogram, videofluoroscopy, flexible endoscopic examination, ultrasound examination, manometry, electromyography, scintigraphy and 24 hour pH monitoring are main diagnostic procedures of dysphagia. Some of the reasons for the neurologic dysphagia may be treated by surgical and pharmacological methods. Neurologic dysphagia rehabilitation is difficult, long-lasting and often falling far short of expected results. Primary it should include neurologic cause treatment if it is possible. According to WHO International Classification of Functioning and Health in 2001 non-invasive methods of dysphagia treatment may be divided into reconstitution, compensatory and adaptive techniques. The most popular reconstitution methods are thermal stimulation (Lazzar's) or tactilethermal application (Rosenbeck's) techniques which may be applied for abnormal duration of stage transition (DST). Abnormal duration of stage transition considerably increase probability of aspiration. Dysphagia treatment by compensatory methods consist in various techniques of swallowing and posture changes application. Adaptive techniques include dietary changes--avoiding of sustenances strengthening dysphagia and adequate dietary intake. The basic principle of dysphagia rehabilitation is that the most effective way to regain efficiency is the regeneration on remains of lost function. Carrying out imperfect swallowing acts is probably the best way of increasing effectiveness and efficiency of swallowing. On the other hand imperfect swallowing acts may be hazardous because of the danger of aspiration and inhalation pneumonia.",

      "abstract": "Handwriting is one of the most complex motor proficiencies and is a main scholastic assignment during childhood. Basic skills are required for penmanship such as viso-spatial coordination on top of cognitive abilities such as planning, organizing and reviewing the written text. Illegible handwriting and increased variability both in time and space are some of the components causing poor penmanship. Children with difficulty in handwriting wilt write in a slower manner and usually produce excessive pressure on the pen and paper Leading to early fatigue. Handwriting difficulties could be divided into two main categories: primary, stemming from developmental disorder, and secondary, due to an acquired neurological disease. Primary handwriting difficulty is by far the most common cause of poor penmanship in children; Language impairment, fine motor coordination problems, Learning disabilities and children with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder are at risk for developing poor primary penmanship. However, children who present loss of handwriting skills may be the presenting symptom of an acquired neurologic disorder. Meticulous background surveys and detailed physical and neurological examination are essential for revealing other underlying motor and non-motor manifestations of the acquired disease. Secondary handwriting difficulty necessitates additional tests and imaging for movement disorders, inflammatory disease, vascular and neurodegenerative diseases according to the clinical presentation. This review presents cases of acquired pediatric handwriting disorders and discussions in recent literature regarding developmental and acquired handwriting difficulties in childhood.",

The severity of impairment and the variety of symptoms associated with neurodevelopmental disorders or with particular epilepsy syndromes reflect focal or global, structural or functional dysfunction of neuronal networks. The complex relationship between neurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy is secondary to common factors that include genetics, cognition, motor and language function. The epileptic encephalopathies are associated with regression or slowing of cognitive, language or behavior and the accepted working hypothesis is that this is a direct consequence of the seizures or of the interictal epileptiform activity, as opposed to the associated medical condition. The evidence that recurrent seizures or abnormal electrical activity can cause specific cognitive, language or behavioral abnormalities even in accepted epileptic encephalopathies is still controversial. Data from animal studies and the clinical experience from epileptic encephalopathies of early life imply that there are developmental time windows crucial to the type of epilepsy syndrome and to cognitive and behavioral outcome.The management of children in whom a neurodevelopmental disorder coexists with epilepsy is a difficult problem that requires a multidisciplinary approach that addresses both the epilepsy and the specific cognitive or behavioral problem and is tailored to the needs of the individual child.",

      "abstract": "Rhythmic skills are natural and widespread in the general population. The majority can track the beat of music and move along with it. These abilities are meaningful from a cognitive standpoint given their tight links with prominent motor and cognitive functions such as language and memory. When rhythmic skills are challenged by brain damage or neurodevelopmental disorders, remediation strategies based on rhythm can be considered. For example, rhythmic training can be used to improve motor performance (e.g., gait) as well as cognitive and language skills. Here, we review the games readily available in the market and assess whether they are well-suited for rhythmic training. Games that train rhythm skills may serve as useful tools for retraining motor and cognitive functions in patients with motor or neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease, dyslexia, or ADHD). Our criteria were the peripheral used to capture and record the response, the type of response, and the output measure. None of the existing games provides sufficient temporal precision in stimulus presentation and/or data acquisition. In addition, games do not train selectively rhythmic skills. Hence, the available music games, in their present form, are not satisfying for training rhythmic skills. Yet, some features such as the device used, the interface or the game scenario provide good indications for devising efficient training protocols. Guidelines are provided for devising serious music games targeting rhythmic training in the future.",

      "abstract": "Auditory processing disorders (APDs) are associated with an inability to process auditory information which cannot be explained by abnormal hearing thresholds. This review focuses on APDs that are liable to be found in subjects with language-based learning disabilities such as dyslexia. Although the causal relationship between the presence of an APD and reading deficits is still poorly understood, it is clear that in many cases (estimated range between 30-50%) the presence of an APD may serve as a marker of language-based learning problems. While some dyslexic children can be characterized by poor performances in auditory temporal processing (resolution, masking, ordering, integration) they can also experience hearing difficulties with competing or degraded acoustic signals (for example, during dichotic listening or in the presence of a noisy background). Behavioural hearing deficits are not always found in dyslexic children; when present they may be explained, at least partly, by the task complexity which induces strong cognitive load. However, there is no doubt that the co-morbidity of APD and dyslexia can create difficulties in communication and academic skills. In addition to these behavioural indices of APD, evidence for abnormal function of the descending auditory pathway is provided in dyslexia. We here present preliminary results showing 1) differences in the developmental trajectories when normal reading and dyslexic children are compared for auditory descending pathway function and 2) deficient high level process (attention) which appears in literacy problems and auditory processing deficits (dichotic listening) through feedback connections from higher to lower areas. These abnormalities, in turn, may be accompanied by different behavioural manifestations of APD.

Cognitive dysfunction in epilepsy is often multifactorial and may relate to the underlying etiology or epilepsy syndrome, comorbid psychiatric disease, interictal epileptiform discharges, effects of seizures, antiepileptic drugs, and surgical interventions. Studies have addressed the prevention of impairment and, less commonly, methods for cognitive enhancement. This chapter examines the possible underlying mechanisms of cognitive deficits in epilepsy, methods for prevention of dysfunction, issues in study design, and data regarding cognitive enhancement.",

One 13-year-old subject with male sex has the symptom, where the subject's behavior resembles autistic behavior such as being very hyperactive, experiencing tantrums (biting his own hand or throwing things if his desire is not fulfilled), losing language skills and speech, ability to intertwine poor social interaction, as well as developmental deterioration or abnormality after experiencing the normal phase at the age of two years, followed by a real loss of trained skills. The method used for children who have disintegration syndrome is by motion therapy with the aim that the subject can maximize concentration and focus in order to be able to survive in an activity or activity and be able to use fine and rough motor skills with flexibility. The result of this therapy is that there is a slight change from the previous behavior, namely an increase in concentration behavior, eye contact becomes longer than usual and is not easily tantrum and more obedient.",

      "abstract": "Unexplained physical signs and symptoms represent a significant portion of patient presentations in acute care settings. Even in cases where a patient presents with a known medical condition, functional or somatic symptoms may complicate the diagnostic and treatment processes and prognostic outcome. One umbrella category for neurologically related somatic symptoms, functional neurological disorder (FND), presents as involuntary neurological symptoms incompatible with another medical condition. Symptoms may include weakness and/or paralysis, movement disorders, non-epileptic seizures, speech or visual impairment, swallowing difficulty, sensory disturbances, or cognitive symptoms (1). While FND presents as neuropsychiatric, providers commonly report feeling hesitant to diagnose these disorders. Inexperience or lack of appropriate education on relevant research regarding evidence-based practices or standard of practice (SOP) may result in over- or underperforming diagnostic workups and consultations, utilizing inappropriate medications, and failing to offer evidence-based psychological interventions. Being mindful of these challenges when treating patients presenting with functional symptoms in acute care settings can help to support and protect the patients and care team and appropriately control healthcare costs.",

      "abstract": "Millions of children are impacted by neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), which unfold early in life, have varying genetic etiologies and can involve a variety of specific or generalized impairments in social, cognitive and motor functioning requiring potentially lifelong specialized supports. While specific disorders vary in their domain of primary deficit (e.g. autism spectrum disorder (social), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (attention), developmental coordination disorder (motor) and developmental language disorder (language)), comorbidities between NDDs are common. Intriguingly, many NDDs are associated with difficulties in skills related to rhythm, timing and synchrony though specific profiles of rhythm/timing impairments vary across disorders. Impairments in rhythm/timing may instantiate vulnerabilities for a variety of NDDs and may contribute to both the primary symptoms of each disorder as well as the high levels of comorbidities across disorders. Drawing upon genetic, neural, behavioural and interpersonal constructs across disorders, we consider how disrupted rhythm and timing skills early in life may contribute to atypical developmental cascades that involve overlapping symptoms within the context of a disorder's primary deficits. Consideration of the developmental context, as well as common and unique aspects of the phenotypes of different NDDs, will inform experimental designs to test this hypothesis including via potential mechanistic intervention approaches. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Synchrony and rhythm interaction: from the brain to behavioural ecology’.",

It seems even more quiet because the noise it does make (its symptoms) is often attributed to other causes. Nevertheless the disruption in coping capacity and attendent breakdown in usual behavioral patterns causes more psychosocial and academic‐economic hardship than have begun to be appreciated. Cognitive mental changes such as impairment in attention, memory, and information processing even when mild and apparently transient can produce altered patterns of achievement and self confidence with long lived reverberations. Emotional irritability and lethargy also produce a chain of reactions likely to outlive the primary source of the disruption. Add to this decreased frustration tolerance, increased fatigability, lowered resilence to stress and uncertainty as to the origin of these difficulties and one has recipe for prolonged impairment. Place these ingredients into the person of a child, with all a child's limits on autonomy and verbal self report and the result is a myriad of reported and unreported social, academic and even familial disruptions exacerbated by the common clinical failure of identification of their correct underlying etiology.",

      "title": "What Potential Does the Applied Behavior Analysis Approach Have for the Treatment of Children and Youth with Autism",
      "abstract": "The assertion that applied behavior analysis is the most powerful approach in the treatment of autistic behaviors warrants examination. Applied behavior analysis is characterized by discrete presentation of stimuli with responses followed by immediate feedback, an intense schedule of reinforcement, data collection, and systematic trials of instruction. This highly structured format seems to meet the needs of individuals with autism who typically respond to routine and directness. However, a critical analysis of the approach is necessary to determine the real potential of applied behavior analysis in the treatment of children and youth with autism. *********** Autism is a spectrum disorder that encompasses many labeled disorders such as autism, pervasive developmental disorders, and Asperger syndrome (Jacobson, 2000). Symptoms of this psychological disorder typically include varying levels of impairment in interpersonal skills, emotional or affective behavior, and intellectual functioning. One of the most pervasive characteristics of the disability, however, is a delay or impairment in the ability to produce and respond to language (Secan, Egel, & Tilley, 1989). Many children with autism do not develop speech and other children with the disorder often exhibit unusual speech patterns such as echolalia or the repetition of what has been heard. Frequently, the tone of their speech is flat and unexpressive. Language difficulties are compounded by social impairments. Children with autism frequently are unresponsive to others, fail to make eye contact, and miss social cues such as a person's facial, verbal, postural, and gestural responses (Gena, Krantz, McClannahan, Poulson, 1996). In addition to these areas of difficulty, other common disturbances involve stereotypic behaviors, self-stimulatory behaviors, self-injurious behaviors, repetitious actions, preoccupation with select objects or topics, aggression, inflexibility in routines, and over-sensitivity to sensory stimuli. Autism is a developmental disorder that is usually identified before 3 years of age. Strange behaviors appear early in the child' s life and diagnosis has been expedited by more public awareness of the disability (e.g., popular cinema such as Rain Man). This is certainly a positive outcome of such attention, but inaccurate portrayal of the disability can lead to public misunderstanding. For example, only a small percent of individuals with autism possess the splinter skills of Raymond in Rain Man (i.e., card counting ability). Research has not been able to pinpoint any single causation of autism; consequently, interventions for the disability have varied greatly. Heflin and Simpson (1998) provide a very thorough overview of interventions for children and youth with autism that incorporate strategies from psychoanalytic, medical, educational, and behavioral perspectives. The sheer number of possible interventions for parents and/or guardians to consider is overwhelming and confusing. Researchers, themselves, debate about the potential of various treatment options (Lovaas, 1987). Some experts make optimistic claims to cure the disability (Lovaas, 1993), while other professionals focus on remediating a specific behavior or building a particular skill (Stromer, Mackay, & Remington, 1996). Caregivers and educators are faced with the problem of choosing the most promising treatments. Treatments that concentrate on emotional disturbances related to autism stem from the psychoanalytic approach. Holding Therapy, for example, attempts to build a bond between the child with autism and the parent/guardian. The caregiver is advised to hold the infant very closely and tightly as s/ he speaks in a comforting tone, even when the child tries to escape the embrace. Another approach that emphasizes relationship building is the Son-Rise program (Kaufman & Kaufman, 1998). Parents are to repeat the actions of the child in an environment that is not distracting or stimulating. …",

Entretanto, cerca de 40%-50% das criancas afetadas se desenvolvem normalmente. Estudos em modelos animais demonstram que as convulsoes neonatais em roedores produzem efeitos adversos neurologicos de longo prazo, tais como: deficits na aprendizagem, memoria visuo-espacial, prejuizo na flexibilidade cognitiva, comportamento autista, caracterizado pela baixa preferencia pela novidade social, deficit de discriminacao social e comportamento tipo ansioso.

Em P60 os animais foram avaliados pelos seguintes paradigmas: a caixa de condicionamento operante e o labirinto em T. A amostra foi composta por 25 animais, 11 controles e 14 experimentais. Estes testes avaliam: aprendizagem associativa visuo-espacial, consolidacao da memoria, memoria de trabalho, comportamento perseverante, controle inibitorio e flexibilidade comportamental. Os dados sugerem que o grupo experimental, na caixa de condicionamento operante, nao exibiu prejuizo na aprendizagem associativa visuo-espacial, que houve a consolidacao da memoria, nao apresentou comportamento perseverante, prejuizo na memoria de trabalho e nem comportamento perseverante. No labirinto em T o grupo experimental mantiveram preservadas a memoria de trabalho, a memoria de referencia e motivacao, e nao exibiram prejuizo na flexibilidade comportamental.

Cramps and improper breathing appear during speech. Stuttering is accompanied by physical symptoms that appear in stressful communication with the child. Stuttering is widespread in the world, and it originates from ancient times. First, it occurs between the second and third years of life, when speech develops intensively, but it may occur later. The cause of stuttering is explained by three theories: constitutional, developmental and environmental. The speech-language development of children is increasingly influenced by the media, which have become an important part of everyday life. There are more division of stuttering. The first division is on physiological, primary, secondary and acute / abrupt stuttering, while the other is psychogenic and neurogenic, which appear later in life. There are five stages of stuttering development, of which three stages appear during preschool age (developmental speech failure, border stinging, initial stuttering), stage during school age (transient stuttering) and stage during adolescence and further (advanced stuttering). Speech therapy is performed with the child - indirect and direct, before which diagnostic procedures are required. The child has fear of speaking and situations that require speaking, which affect his psychological state and selfconfidence. It is therefore important to provide support and encourage it in progress. A research was carried out to find out how often preschool teachers have interactions with a child who has a speech disorder and in cooperation with a therapist carries out speech excerises, how often do they cooperate with the child's parents and in which way those children included in working with other children. The results show that most preschool teachers do not consider themselves competent to work with children with a speech disorder, but they have cooperated with parents in every possible way. These children were daily involved in the work of the group that contributes to their further growth and development.",

      "title": "Auditory disorders related to strokes",
      "abstract": "Following strokes, disorders of auditory perception produced by lesions located in the territory of the internal carotid artery or of the vertebrobasilar system can be observed. These disorders were gathered in several different clinical forms, now conventional: auditory agnosia is defined as the impossibility of recognizing environmental sounds, words, and music which the patient, however, is said to hear. Pure word deafness is the impossibility of understanding spoken language to repeat or to write under dictation in the absence of another sign of aphasia. Cortical deafness is defined as the feeling of being deaf contrasting with the integrity of the tonal audiogram. Amusia is auditory agnosia specific for music. These central disorders of auditory perception may result from lesions of either the right, left, or both cerebral hemispheres, usually involving parietotemporal cortical areas (Lechevalier et al., 1999). The outcome may be favorable in some cases of cerebrovascular etiology. In reality, such clinical profiles are far from being so distinct. There are intermediate forms, for example: absolutely pure cases of word deafness (relating to only the sounds of language) are extremely rare. Moreover, evolutionary forms were published, initially observed as a form of cortical deafness, then like an auditory agnosia (Godefroy et al., 1995). In spite of these irregularities it seems to us justified to maintain the individuality of these clinical entities, notably because of the acoustic characteristics of the three types of the sounds (musical, verbal sounds, and environmental sounds).",

In addition to the actual hearing loss, other factors contribute to the hearing handicap experienced by older persons. These include difficulty in understanding speech in noisy situations, difficulty in supplementing hearing with visual information, and the slowing of cognitive and psychologic processes. Many forms of amplification are available and can be very useful in reversing much of the functional impairment associated with hearing loss. A comprehensive audiological assessment should be recommended before selecting the type of hearing aid or assistive listening device. Such a referral also affords an opportunity for more extensive aural rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Childhood auditory processing disorder as a developmental disorder: The case for a multi-professional approach to diagnosis and management",
      "abstract": "Auditory processing disorder (APD) is diagnosed when a patient presents with listening difficulties which can not be explained by a peripheral hearing impairment or higher-order cognitive or language problems. This review explores the association between auditory processing disorder (APD) and other specific developmental disorders such as dyslexia and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. The diagnosis and aetiology of APD are similar to those of other developmental disorders and it is well established that APD often co-occurs with impairments of language, literacy, and attention. The genetic and neurological causes of APD are poorly understood, but developmental and behavioural genetic research with other disorders suggests that clinicians should expect APD to co-occur with other symptoms frequently. The clinical implications of co-occurring symptoms of other developmental disorders are considered and the review concludes that a multi-professional approach to the diagnosis and management of APD, involving speech and language therapy and psychology as well as audiology, is essential to ensure that children have access to the most appropriate range of support and interventions.SumarioLos problemas de procesamiento auditivo (APD) se diagnostican cuando un paciente presenta dificultades de atención que no se pueden explicar por un trastorno auditivo periférico o por otros problemas cognitivos de orden superior o del lenguaje. Esta revisión explora la asociación entre APD y otros trastornos específicos del desarrollo como la dislexia o el déficit de atención con hiperactividad. El diagnóstico y la etiología de los APD son similares a los de otros trastornos del desarrollo y está bien establecido que los APD frecuentemente se asocian a problemas del lenguaje, lectura y atención. Las causas genéticas y neurológicas del APD están muy pobremente comprendidas, pero la investigación genética sobre el desarrollo y la conducta en otros trastornos, sugiere que los clínicos esperarían que los APD se presenten frecuentemente con otros síntomas. Se han considerado las implicaciones clínicas de los síntomas que concurren con otros trastornos del desarrollo. Por ello, la revisión concluye que es esencial un enfoque multi-profesional para el diagnóstico y el tratamiento de los APD, que involucran al terapeuta en habla/lenguaje, al psicólogo y al audiólogo, para asegurar que el niño tenga acceso a las posibilidades de apoyo y de intervención más apropiadas.",

Explicit memory is a conscious recollection of either episodic or semantic memory. Episodic memory is from personal experience and is context-specific while semantic memory refers to general knowledge. Implicit memory is from priming, procedure memory or skills. On-line message held by the brain is the working memory. Prospective memory is about something to be done in the future. Over-reliance on gist memory brings in false memory. The stirring of emotion has effect on encoding and consolidation. Explicit memory depends on medial temporal and prefrontal lobes. Priming impinges directly on cerebral cortex. Procedure memory or motor skills are closely related to basal ganglia. Cerebellum plays an important role in classical conditioning and complex motor learning. Age effect on memory is mainly from decreased speed and capacity of the central executive function. Age-associated memory impairment could be normal aging while mild cognitive impairment could be preclinical dementia. Alzheimer's disease starts with episodic memory, frontotemporal dementia defects semantic memory and Lewy's body dementia impairs working memory.",

      "abstract": "Language is often assumed to rely on domain-specific neurocognitive substrates. However, this human capacity in fact seems to crucially depend on general-purpose memory systems in the brain. Evidence suggests that lexical memory relies heavily on declarative memory, which is specialized for arbitrary associations and is rooted in temporal lobe structures. The mental grammar instead relies largely on procedural memory, a system that underlies rules and sequences, and is rooted in frontal/basal-ganglia structures. Developmental and adult-onset disorders such as Specific Language Impairment, autism, Tourette syndrome, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and non-fluent aphasia each seem to involve particular grammatical deficits and analogous non-linguistic procedural memory impairments, as well as abnormalities of procedural memory brain structures. Lexical and declarative memory remain relatively intact in these disorders, and may play compensatory roles. In contrast, Alzheimer’s disease, semantic dementia, fluent aphasia and amnesia each affect lexical and declarative memory, and involve abnormalities of declarative memory brain structures, while leaving grammar and procedural memory largely intact. Overall, the evidence suggests that declarative and procedural memory play critical roles in language disorders, as well as in language more generally.",

      "title": "ASSESSMENT OF THE INTELLIGIBILITY OF SPEECH IN PERSON WITH DYSARTHRIA",
      "abstract": "Dysarthria is a speech disorder that belongs to the group of neurologically based communication disorders. It can occur at any age – at birth or after an injury or even after an illness. Dysarthria may range in severity from minimal impairment to that which make the speech practically unintelligible. Excessive nasalization, disordered speech prosody, imprecise articulation, and variable speech rate are often associated with damage to neuromuscular systems regulating speech. Disorders in speech physiology may result in distortion of the acoustic signal and reduced speech intelligibility. Reduced speech intelligibility affects all aspects of life. Individuals with intelligibility deficits experience difficulties with social interaction, academic performance, and vocational placement. The purpose of this article is to present some of the results obtained after conducting a study to assess the Intelligibility of speech in persons with dysarthria. The methodology that was used is Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment Second edition (FDA-2). The test is translated and adapted into Bulgarian language according to its phonetic rules. The test is also used to determine the form of dysarthria. The participant of the study are total of 80 people aged between 20-90 years old with acquired dysarthria. All of them have a confirmed neurological diagnosis such as stroke, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, epilepsy, etc. The participants are divided into five groups according to the form of dysarthria – flaccid, spastic, ataxic, extrapyramidal and mixed dysarthria. The assessment of intelligibility of speech is carried out at three levels - words, sentences and conversation. Each person is required to read 10 words, 10 sentences and to have a 5-minute conversation on the topic of favorite activities and hobbies. The results obtained of all five groups of dysarthria are analyzed by statistical methods. They show that there is a statistically significant difference in terms of intelligibility of speech in the different forms of dysarthria. The most difficult to understand for the listener is the speech of the mixed type of dysarthria. This group of people have unintelligible speech at all three levels – words, sentences and conversation. The first part of the FDA-2 requires reading of ten words. The persons demonstrate similar results in reading words. The listener can understand more than six words from the participants‘ utterances with ataxic, flaccid and extrapyramidal type of dysarthria. The second task of the test evaluates intelligibility at sentence level. The highest scores show persons with the ataxic dysarthria. This means that their speech is understandable at the sentence level. The most difficult task for all participants is the conversation. The speech of persons with dysarthria when having a conversation is most difficult to understand by the listener. The results confirm the hypothesis that the severity of dysarthria has a negative influence on the degree of intelligibility of speech according to the different forms of dysarthria.",

Some gradual mental decline is seen with normal aging.

Children often respond differently in this situation to adult presentations. They may have a period of mutism when the prognosis might look poor and yet they subsequently make rapid progress and recover speech. They have greater potential for neural plasticity and language recovery, although they often have persisting difficulties in oral and written language. Alternatively, there may be a presentation with a paroxysmal event such as a seizure or a period of depressed consciousness, and the unusual behaviour that may accompany dysphasia and dysarthria may be misinterpreted in the child, whereas for the adult with the more common ‘stroke-like’ presentation, it would be immediately considered. Rarely the aphasia/dysphasia may itself be the paroxysmal event where actually recognising that the child's disrupted communication is the basis of any observed behaviours can be the greater challenge.",

      "abstract": "Childhood Cerebral Palsy – the group of diseases concerned with motor disorders as the result of brain damage or dysfunction of certain brain centers – is usually acquired during the first years of life, at the time when the system of primary movement patterns is developing. Primary movements are genetically programmed for protection and survival, and also for the development of the conscious movement system. Developmentally their role is to support: - maturation of the nervous system (synaptogenesis, myelination, and brain plasticity) - brain function (cognitive development, emotional maturation) - sensory-motor integration. Dysfunctions of motor development and sensory-motor integration in the child with CP are a reflection of the type of neurological insult and the developmental stage of the infant/child when the neurological insult occurred. The developmental stages can be divided into prenatal (in utero); natal (during the birth process); or postnatal (after birth but during the first years of life). Each developmental stage is vulnerable to specific neurological insults. Prenatal palsy can be caused by infection, toxicity in the fetus, or compromised health in the pregnant mother. Some primary motor patterns and reflexes, such as Trunk Extension, Automatic Gait, Grasp, Swallowing and Sucking develop in utero. Prenatal brain damage will cause poor expression of these reflexes and adversely impact the next stage of development. Natal palsy is generally caused by neurological insult during birth: a consequence of premature birth, sudden deliveries, narrow pelvis of the mother, use of forceps during birth, etc. Natal trauma can negatively affect the activation of primary motor patterns and reflexes characteristic of a normal successful birth. In such cases the expression of these genetic programs will be abnormal. The primary movements and reflexes of childbirth, such as Head Righting, Perez, Tonic Labyrinthine (TLR) in extension, Bauer Crawling, Sequential Side Rotation, Spinning, and Sucking may be dysfunctional. Postnatal palsy is often caused by an infection with encephalitic symptoms. Other causes include childhood cranial injury, central nervous system injury, and poor systemic health. Infant motor patterns and reflexes will be stressed by postnatal CP, and may develop dysfunctionally or pathologically. Dynamic reflexes (e.g., Grasp, Hands Pulling, Automatic Gait, Sequential Side Rotation, Spinning); positional reflexes (e.g., Asymmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex [ATNR] Symmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex [STNR], Babkin Palmomental, Tonic Labyrinthine Reflex",

As such, the question is whether SLI and LKS should rather be considered along a continuum or as two entirely distinct entities. In addition, the rationale for using antiepileptic medications in rare forms of SLI is discussed.",

      "title": "Executive Functioning in Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "The executive function (EF) is a set of abilities, which allows us to invoke voluntary control of our behavioral responses. These functions enable human beings to develop and carry out plans, make up analogies, obey social rules, solve problems, adapt to unexpected circumstances, do many tasks simultaneously, and locate episodes in time and place. EF includes divided attention and sustained attention, working memory (WM), set-shifting, flexibility, planning, and the regulation of goal directed behavior and can be defined as a brain function underlying the human faculty to act or think not only in reaction to external events but also in relation with internal goals and states. EF is mostly associated with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). Besides EF, PFC is involved in self-regulation of behavior, i.e., the ability to regulate behavior according to internal goals and constraints, particularly in less structured situations. Self-regulation of behavior is subtended by ventral medial/orbital PFC. Impairment of EF is one of the most commonly observed deficits in schizophrenia through the various disease stages. Impairment in tasks measuring conceptualization, planning, cognitive flexibility, verbal fluency, ability to solve complex problems, and WM occur in schizophrenia. Disorders detected by executive tests are consistent with evidence from functional neuroimaging, which have shown PFC dysfunction in patients while performing these kinds of tasks. Schizophrenics also exhibit deficit in odor identifying, decision-making, and self-regulation of behavior suggesting dysfunction of the orbital PFC. However, impairment in executive tests is explained by dysfunction of prefronto-striato-thalamic, prefronto-parietal, and prefronto-temporal neural networks mainly. Disorders in EFs may be considered central facts with respect to schizophrenia and it has been suggested that negative symptoms may be explained by that executive dysfunction.",

It is suggested that iow-level discrimination impairments result from damage to the contralateral postcentral gyrus, and from damage to structures such as the posterior insuia and the parietal operculum. Furthermore, the processing of specific tactile features (e.g. shape, size, versus texture) appears to occur in functionally and neuroanatomlcally separate regions. High-level impairments such as tactile agnosia and aphasia, on the other hand, appear to result from damage to structures in the inferior parietal lobe. The deficit in these disorders appears to reflect loss of access to integrated object descriptions, or loss of access to meaning representations.",

Because the basis of normal brain function is not sufficiently understood, the basis of abnormal function is understood poorly. Even in disorders where the fundamental biochemical defect is known, such as phenylketonuria (PKU) and other enzyme defects, the exact basis for brain dysfunction is uncertain. The outcome for treated PKU, galactosemia, homocystinuria, and lysosomal disorders is not yet optimal. The various forms of nonketotic hyperglycinemia often respond poorly to current therapy. Less familiar disorders, with or without seizures, such as deficient synthesis of serine or creatine and impaired glucose transport into the brain, and disorders with variable malformations, such as Smith‐Lemli‐Opitz (SLO) syndrome and the congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs), may initially be thought to be a nonspecific form of developmental delay. Less familiar disorders, with or without seizures and disorders with variable malformations may initially be thought to be a nonspecific form of developmental delay. Simple tests of urine, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid may lead to a diagnosis, accurate genetic counseling, and better treatment.

Poor sleep is associated with negative outcomes across a range of dimensions that impair quality of life, increases risk for other diseases, and may interact negatively with the progression and treatment of other disorders. Evidence for effective psychological interventions to improve sleep in later life, specifically cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, is robust and well described.

      "title": "Developmental coordination disorder continues to evolve",
      "abstract": "Motor coordination has classically been understood in terms of harnessing degrees of freedom and performance variables in the neuro-musculo-skeletal system. In clinical examination, however, coordination is often seen as resulting from a selective contribution to sensorimotor processing by proprioceptive, vestibular input and cerebellar modulation. Therefore, impaired coordination (often described as ataxia) typically rules out other causes such as muscle weakness, abnormal muscle tone, disrupted motor planning, or the occurrence of involuntary movements. This is both a great strength and a difficulty in clinical neurology: many descriptors are based on phenomenological observation, but also have a localizing connotation. For example, dystonia is not any one type of muscle tone impairment, as implied by etymology, but reflects basal ganglia dysfunction. It is distinct from spasticity, which indicates abnormal corticospinal tract function.1 Similarly, aphasia (literally absence of speech) does not overlap with anarthria (absence of articulated speech) but refers to language difficulties that can be traced to other brain regions. Yet, the clinico-anatomical approach is less accurate or is inappropriate when clinical signs relate to brain development.2 In this context, replacing the privative prefix ‘a’ by ‘dys’ sometimes serves to denote the developmental character and signal differences in presentation, clinico-anatomical correlation, outcome, and management needs, as in (developmental) ‘dysphasia’ versus (acquired) ‘aphasia’, or ‘dyspraxia’ versus ‘apraxia’. Growing interest in neurodevelopmental conditions has led many clinicians and researchers to move beyond these semantic considerations. They have adopted a more pragmatic approach to define more useful frameworks for understanding the complexity at stake and assessing intervention approaches. The developmental coordination disorder (DCD) construct has thus emerged to describe a comprehensive developmental condition in which impairments in a child's capacity to develop and execute coordinated motor skills cannot be explained by cognitive or sensory dysfunction or other neurological conditions. In DCD, the hallmark ‘coordination disorder’ is inclusive and not specifically clinico-anatomically localizing. The construct has superseded the restrictive characterization of dyspraxia. Therefore, dyspraxia could potentially be used to address an overlooked aspect of the complex motor phenotype in other defined neurodevelopmental disorders, whether generic (e.g. autism spectrum disorder or cerebral palsy) or specific (e.g. neurogenetic syndromes), which has not been common practice. In many clinical situations, DCD has also proved more relevant than previous concepts based on supposed minimal brain lesions or dysfunction. In 2012, Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology (DMCN) published the outcome of a several-year-long effort by the European Academy of Childhood Disability (EACD) to provide recommendations for the diagnosis, assessment, and management of DCD. These recommendations were based on sound appraisal of the body of studies available then and endeavoured to translate results into good clinical practice. The recommendations have been very influential in clinical practice worldwide. They have also further shaped and clarified the DCD concept for the provision of service and for clinical research. A wealth of new studies published since then have brought valuable insights into motor performance, executive functions, cognition, visual functioning, mental health, other aspects of ‘comorbidity’, quality of life, assessment, as well as clues to pathophysiology and the potential for improving outcomes.3, 4 The way we approach DCD has also changed. To cite but one example relating to nosology, the fifth and latest revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) now lists DCD as a main disorder under a new ‘Neurodevelopmental Disorders’ cluster. In this issue of DMCN, we present the fully updated EACD recommendations,5 which marks an important, historic step in the understanding and treatment of DCD. We expect these recommendations to improve identification, evaluation, and management of this condition. Hopefully, they will continue to enhance the current practical relevance of the DCD construct and contribute to our evolving understanding of DCD in the wider context of developmental disorders.",

In the last ten years, only 1% of all autism research focused on developing post-secondary education programs and training in adult health services. Taking into account this dichotomy of interests, we must think about the different stages of life, such as early intervention, school inclusion, bullying, associated mental and medical disorders, lack of group belonging, job opportunities and the aging. Only by becoming aware of each of them can we achieve a better quality of life for people with autism and their families.El autismo es un trastorno del neurodesarrollo de base neurobiológica caracterizado por déficits en la cognición social y la comunicación, intereses restringidos y conductas estereotipadas.

Ataxia is the most important sign of cerebellar disease. Cerebellar ataxia is defined as lack of accuracy or coordination of movement which is not due to paresis, alteration in tone, loss of postural sense or the presence of involuntary movements (DeJong, 1979). Cerebellar ataxia relates to motor dysfunctions of the limbs, trunk, eyes, and bulbar musculature. Ataxia of gait refers to incoordination of walking, which might be so severe that the patient cannot walk (abasia). Postural ataxia refers to ataxia of stance and sitting and includes truncal ataxia.The patient may be unable to sit or stand without support (astasia).

Unfortunately for psychology, those who gave subject this attention approached it with a bias resulting from preoccupation with system of psychotherapeutics known as psycho-analysis. Owing to this bias these investigators found in these lapses confirmation of their theories about mental and they have used these lapses and their interpretations of them as a means of introducing uninitiated into mysteries of so-called new psychology. According to this new such lapses are not explainable by principles of orthodox psychology, are due to operation of mental processes of which individual is not and cannot be aware at time of lapse, are manifestation of activity within the of desires of a painful or disgusting or unthinkable nature, and betray something which individual does not want to know or have known about himself. In following analyses of such lapses (slips of tongue, etc.) as have recently come under my notice or have been studied by me, I shall show that such psychic mishaps or accidents can be satisfactorily explained by principles of orthodox psychology, do not involve unknown or unknowable mental processes, are not manifestations of repressed desires, are not unconscious betrayals of individual's secret self, and that they furnish not slightest basis on which to construct a psychology of unconscious. The careful scrutiny of circumstances surrounding lapses (slips, forgettings, accidental breakages, etc.) proves that these mistakes are results of verifiable psychophysiological processes, that known laws of orthodox psychology are adequate to explain them, that they are psychologically determined (not psychically determined), that they are not valid psychic acts and do not give expression to repressed, unknown, and unknowable motives of an undesirable, discreditable, or disgusting nature.

Sur le plan du langage, elle est notamment responsable d'importants troubles de la comprehension et de difficultes d'acces lexical en denomination. Des troubles de la lecture et de l'ecriture y sont aussi frequemment associes. Dans les tâches d'ecriture, la performance de ces patients est caracteristique de la dysorthographie de surface avec sensibilite a la regularite orthographique des mots et production majoritaire d'erreurs phonologiquement plausibles. La relation entre ce deficit de production ecrite et l'atteinte de la memoire semantique reste cependant controversee. Selon certaines propositions, la dysorthographie de surface est directement dependante de l'atteinte de la memoire semantique. L'observation de patients presentant des troubles de comprehension sans repercussion apparente sur l'ecriture appuie plutot l'hypothese selon laquelle cette activite peut etre effectuee sans mediation semantique obligatoire. Dans cet article, nous faisons la synthese de deux etudes de cas unique, menees aupres de patients presentant une demence semantique. Les resultats qu'ils obtiennent dans des tâches experimentales explorant les liens existant entre les concepts preserves ou alteres et les capacites d'ecriture sous dictee des mots correspondants, confirment que la dysorthographie de surface est directement liee au deficit semantique. Ils viennent egalement appuyer les propositions theoriques selon lesquelles la memoire semantique joue un role central dans le fonctionnement de l'ecriture. En plus de confronter les modeles recents de l'ecriture, cette etude fournit un cadre pouvant servir de base a l'evaluation et a la reeducation de la dysorthographie de surface.",

      "title": "The cognitive pattern of vascular dementia and its assessment",
      "abstract": "Prevailing definitions of dementia are based on the Alzheimer disease (AD) model, which places major emphasis on memory impairment. In other dementias, such as vascular dementia (VaD), several other cognitive dysfunctions predominate over the memory disorder. The cognitive pattern changes according to the type of VaD. In multi-infarct dementia (MID), cortical lesions may cause loss of instrumental functions manifested by aphasia, amnesia, apraxia, or agnosia. Language in MID patients has shorter phrase length, restricted lexical variability, simplified syntax, and low verbal fluency; dysarthria or mechanical impairment of speech with abnormal pitch, melody, or articulation rate also occur. The latter are rare in degenerative dementias. Compared with AD, patients with MID demonstrate superior performance on verbal learning and memory, better delayed recall, and lower rates of forgetting, intrusions, and false positives. Subcortical ischemic dementia, subcortical hemorrhages, or single subcortical strategic infarcts frequently impair executive functions, attention, and speed of information processing; anterograde memory is generally less impaired than in AD patients. The two main problems of batteries used for evaluation of dementia such as those recommended by CERAD (verbal fluency test, a brief naming test such as the Modified Boston Naming Test, free recall of a word list, with immediate and delayed recall, followed by a recognition task of the same words, and line drawings of figures), as well as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), are (1) their strong emphasis on memory, temporal and spatial orientation, calculation, language, and constructional praxis, and (2) their failure to assess executive functions. Simple tests of executive function include the Trail Making Test, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and the EXIT-25. A simple and effective test is the CLOX, an executive variation of the clock-drawing task. Depressive symptoms and other psychiatric disturbances are particularly common in VaD and become sources of cognitive and functional disability. Several questionnaires assess the neuropsychiatric manifestations of dementia including the Neuro-Psychiatric Inventory (NPI), the BEHAVE-AD test, the Cohen-Mansfield Scale, and the CERAD Behavioral Rating Scale for Dementia. Finally, development of dementia after a stroke may represent true VaD in patients with intact cognition before the stroke, or AD + CVD when the dementia occurs in patients that already had memory problems before the ictus. The diagnosis of VaD is a challenging clinical problem that encompasses the fields of medicine, neurology, psychiatry, and psychology.",

In addition, indicated that movements are often uncoordinated, slower, variable and hesitant in initiation, while other researchers reported longer movements and reaction times as well as difficulties in balance and postural control. Further limitations in spontaneous or symbolic play and limited opportunities to practice motor skills were observed in school and/or community settings, primarily during their developmental years. It is apparent that these individuals display delayed motor development and atypical motor functioning, which may be attributed to structural differences in the neurological system, delayed brain development, and a compromised somatosensory system.",

In these cases, there is a medical basis for the language problem. Working with signing Deaf people often resembles work with minority foreign language speakers, especially when these people are educated and articulate sign language users.

      "title": "GABAergic neurotransmission alterations in autism spectrum disorders",
      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of complex disorders of neurodevelopment characterized by difficulties in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication, and repetitive behaviors. In ASD, deficits in social cognition and related cognitive functions would be the resultant of reduced synchronization between brain regions. A possible explanation for ASDs is the disturbance of the delicate balance between excitation and inhibition in the developing brain which may have profound impact in neurobehavioral phenotypes. At least some forms of autism would be caused by a disproportionately high level of excitation (or weaker inhibition) in neural circuits that mediate language and social behavior (local circuits). A more excitable cortex (more weakly inhibited) is functionally more poorly differentiated and could lead to broad ranging abnormalities in perception, memory and cognition, motor control, and seizures. An imbalance between excitation and inhibition could be due to an increase in glutamatergic signaling (excitatory) or reduced inhibitory GABAergic signaling. γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain and some forms of ASDs are associated with alterations of GABAergic signaling. Proper inhibitory GABAergic signaling is essential for normal neural circuit function. If the inhibition is disturbed, excessive excitation results in disturbances in the excitation/inhibition balance and, consequently, dysfunction of cognitive processes. Defects in GABA A receptor subunits has been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders with variable clinical presentations, supporting the hypothesis that genetic variants in GABA A receptor subunits may be risk alleles for ASD and epilepsy. Also, expression data and protein levels show a dysregulation in multiple GABA A and GABA B receptors in key sites of the brain in subjects with autism which could explain several clinical phenotypes including the presence of seizures, learning disabilities and mental retardation. In this review, we examine the evidence that alterations of GABA A receptors modified the GABAergic signaling and the excitation/inhibition ratio in ASD.",

Factors influencing the increased risk of hearing loss relate, for example, to abortion, older age, too frequent exposure to noise. Hearing loss usually occurs gradually. Symptoms that may indicate hearing loss are buzzing or tinnitus, dizziness, balance problems, ear pain, or a feeling of a foreign object. It is important to check the hearing in newborns in order to react in time to possible irregularities. Symptoms of deafness in a child occur in the form of non-response to sounds and lack of interest in musical toys. Children between the ages of 8 and 12 months will not respond to their name in case of hearing loss, and the absence of speech is possible",

      "title": "Pediatric neurodegenerative disorders and anesthesia considerations",
      "abstract": "Pediatric neurodegenerative disorders encompass a wide range of conditions that result from progressive damage to cells and nervous system connections that are essential for mobility, coordination, strength, sensation, and cognition. Neurodegenerative diseases affect millions of people worldwide. Neurological disorders are disorders that involve the brain, spinal cord or nerve and muscle. Children with neurological disorders may have disorders such as epilepsy, developmental delay, cerebral palsy, meningitis, genetic/metabolic diseases or diseases of muscle or nerve such as muscular dystrophy or peripheral neuropathy. These illnesses are frequently severe and potentially have long lasting consequences for the affected children. The pathologies most frequently responsible for psycho-physical disorders can be summarized into three groups: collaboration difficulties (autism spectrum disorders, intellectual impairment, phobia); motor dysfunction (cerebral palsy, epilepsy, other brain pathologies, neuromuscular disorders), and craniofacial anomalies (Down syndrome, other genetic syndromes). Due to their clinical history, and the lack of collaboration, in pediatric non-cooperative patients with Special Needs (SN), the anesthesiological risk may result difficult to assess, despite the fact that they meet the criteria of the outpatient management applied for the patient without disabilities. The perioperative management of pediatric patients with psycho-physical disorders with related relational and cognitive problems must be carefully planned, in order to make the entire hospitalization process as comfortable and as less traumatic as possible. General anesthesia is the most suitable type of anesthesia in pediatric patients with Special Needs (SN), although anesthetic complications are more frequent in these patients, mainly due to comorbidities, taken drugs and anatomical peculiarities. Some studies observed no correlation between multiple anesthesia exposures and neurodevelopmental deficits, while others reported that even a single exposure could increase the risk of deficits. An increased risk of developmental or behavioral disorders as the consequence of surgeries requiring general anesthesia was observed. Based on current studies, it is necessary to endeavor to limit the duration and numbers of anesthesia and the dose of anesthetic agents. The evaluation must include history and physical examination pertaining to the conditions requiring special anaesthetic considerations. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial in managing these neurological disorders in pediatric patients to improve overall quality of life and long-term outcomes.",

      "title": "Hearing loss and hearing amplification: An important etiological factor in the assessment of mental disorders",
      "abstract": "Listening is an important factor in cognitive maturation and development of speech as the most complex and most perfect symbol system in human communication. The hearing disorder in any period of life will have a significant impact on the overall personality development and can lead to disorders of mental functions. More or less severe hearing loss makes hearing- voice communication difficult, in cases when other treatment options have been exhausted (medicaments , surgical or combined) requires auditory amplification ie. The use of hearing aids. Audiologic and psychiatric diagnosis imposes a problem for observation of the hearing disability that are often disguised as a clinical picture of depression, anxiety, paranoia, mental and behavioral disorders which require team work of experts and education of doctors of all specialties. Besides the audiologic diagnostics application of the questionnaire Hearing Handicap Inventory (HHI) and the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) will allow Grading of hearing disabilities, emotional and social assessment of hearing loss as well as the real need for hearing rehabilitation. The existence of auditory handicap runs defense mechanisms aimed at maintaining self-esteem, which affects the formation of a special person with depleted identity that is characterized by: suspicion, distrust, limited control, egorigidity and impulsivity. Depression and anxiety are most often reactions to hearing handicap. Application of Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) scales to assess depressive and anxiety features according to ICD-10 can significantly affect the early detection of these two disorders in persons with impaired hearing. The absence of sound has changed the perceptual reality there is insufficient emotional stimulation which gradually changes the personality of a person with hearing loss in terms of expression of psychological changes, changes in personality and behavior. The degree of change is correlated with age, indicating the need for hearing amplification with the aim of timely socialization, adaptation and integration into the social system. Given the social aspect of the problem as a primary source of difficulty, boundaries extend between the professions involved in team activities of perception and care for people with hearing loss and deafness.",

      "title": "Burden of Care and Parent-Child Relationship of Parents of Autistic Children",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONAll parents wish for a healthy baby, but some parents though not by their choice are gifted with a special child, like a child with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Mentally Retarded (MR), Down Syndrome and so on. Some Parents are able to cope up with such a situation whereas, other experience psychological problems (Peshwaria, R. A. and Ganguti, R. et al., 1995). Many parents experience periods of disbelief, deep sadness and depression and self-blame and guilt whereas others experience helplessness, feelings of inadequacy, anger, shock and guilt (Gupta and Singhal 2005).According to the DSM-IV, child autism is defined as a pervasive developmental disorder having the following main characteristics: (a) qualitative impairment in social interaction; (b) qualitative impairment in communication; (c) restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests, and activities; (d) delays in at least one of the following three areas: social interaction, language as used in social communication, symbolic or imaginative play. The Key building blocks for social relationships (i.e., communication, social understanding, and emotional responsiveness) are impaired in individuals with autism (Travis and Sigman, 1998).The birth of an autistic child adds situational crisis, one that results from an unanticipated, traumatic event beyond parental control. When parents become aware of their child's disorder they are inevitably shocked and painfully surprised that they must suddenly adjust to the new role as the parents of an exceptional child and they must adjust their self-image to cope with new responsibilities and functions (Gregory, 1991). The presence of a child with developmental disability in the family calls for a lot of adjustment on the parents and other family members (Peshawaria R, Venkatesan S. 1992)Review of literature revealed that the presence of a child with a disability or illness is stressful for parents especially mothers but most of the studies are done outside India. Studies pertaining to burden of care and parent child relationship of parents of autistic and normal children are almost nil. In view of this, the present study is taken up with the main objective of doing a comparative study between the parents having an autistic child and those with a normal child, evaluating their quality of life, burden of care and the parent-child relationship.HypothesesProposed hypotheses of the study areHa1. The parents of *autistic children and parents of **normal children differ significantly on Burden of care.Ha2. The parents of *autistic children and parents of **normal children differ significantly with respect to parent - child relationship.METHODParticipantsThe sample for the present study includes 107 parents of autistic children (57 mothers and 50 fathers) and 118 parents of normal children (67 mothers and 51 fathers). The age group of the sample is between 30 - 45 years. The sample for this study was delimited to accessible, biological mothers and fathers of children from Pune and Mumbai city of Maharashtra, diagnosed with ASD four and above years of age or under by a qualified health care provider. The mother/father of the diagnosed child had to live with, provide care for and raise the child. To reduce measurement error, the sample was delimited to mothers who read as well as understand English/Marathi or both. The diagnosis of the child was within two year of this study and done by a valid and reliable screening tool or multi-professional team during the preschool-age years.MATERIALS AND PROCEDURE1. Burden Assessment Schedule (Thara et al., 1998). BAS is a most frequently used tool to asses the burden of care of psychiatric patients in India. It measures burden in nine areas: (a) Spouse related (b) Physical and mental health (c) External support (d) Care-giver's routine (e) Support of patient (f) Taking responsibility (g) Other relations (h) Patients' behaviour (i) care-givers' strategy. …",

Sleep disorders are divided into two general categories, dyssomnias and parasomnias. Dyssomnias are disorders where there are problems falling asleep, staying asleep or of excessive sleepiness; they are characterized by irregularities in the timing, quantity and quality of sleep. Parasomnias are disorders about sleep–wake transitions and are characterized by strange or abnormal behaviours, incidents or experiences that occur during sleep.",

Neuroimaging researchers had pointed some anatomical and functional alterations in ADHD. These findings are consistent with cognitive-linguistic profiles, such as inhibition of response, deficit in executive function and working memory and attention deficits. Children with ADHD may also experience reading and writing difficulties (make more errors in linguistic tasks such as reading, phonology, rapid naming) and have rare linguistics resources (lack of words or fragments of information omission resulting in an incoherent speech, change the logical order of prayer and the production of discourses confused). However, it´s important to highlight that such manifestations are secondary consequences of the problems inherent in the regulation and attention and self-regulation in ADHD.",

      "abstract": "Applied behavioral analysis (ABA) is an evidenced-based treatment used in the treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptomology. This treatment modality addresses difficulties individuals with ASD experience, including deficits in social communication, and repetitive and/or restricted behaviors. A variable pattern of developmental milestone acquisition, particularly language, is an early indicator of ASD. Perhaps due to the variability in presentation, the mean age at diagnosis is 4-5 years old despite feasibility of diagnosis as early as 2 years of age. Tracking a child's development is essential for early identification of ASD, with age at diagnosis significantly impacting intervention outcomes in this population. Ideally, individuals with suspected ASD are comprehensively assessed and engaged in intensive early intervention with personalized goals targeting multiple domains of functioning, including cognitive abilities, adaptive functioning, and/or language functioning. Unfortunately, significant barriers (e.g., too few qualified professionals, inaccessible treatment centers, long waitlists) have been identified that preclude access to care for many individuals in need of evaluation and/or treatment. Given the typical delays in identification and the frequent barriers to access, assuring families that the care of their child is of paramount importance and will be met with high quality, evidence-based practices is appropriate. The purpose of the multi-site study was to assess treatment-as-usual across autism intervention centers, drawing archival data from Autism Comprehensive Educational Services (ACES). Results indicated no significant differences in standardized scores of adaptive functioning but significant differences in criterion referenced skills across three time points. Future directions are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Dysarthria is a disturbance in the sensorimotor processes of speech production associated with damage to the central and/or peripheral nervous system. Together with apraxia of speech (AoS; see Chapter 21, this volume), the dysarthrias comprise the motor speech disorders. In their classic text, Darley, Aronson, and Brown (1975) defined dysarthria as a speech disorder resulting from a weakness, paralysis, or incoordination of the speech musculature that is of neurological etiology. As will be discussed later in this chapter, this definition does not align completely with current concepts in neurology, especially in regard to the various syndromes in the category of movement disorders. Many dysarthrias are not accompanied by obvious weakness or paralysis, and incoordination is difficult to assess clinically. A more contemporary definition is from Duffy (2013): “A group of neurologic speech disorders resulting from abnormalities in the strength, speed, range, steadiness, tone, or accuracy of movements, required for control of the respiratory, phonatory, resonatory, articulatory, and prosodic aspects of speech production” (p. 4). Duffy expands this definition to indicate etiology (abnormalities of the central or peripheral nervous system) and associated motor signs or symptoms (weakness, spasticity, incoordination, involuntary movements, or excessive, reduced, or variable muscle tone). An alternative definition is given in a later section of this chapter following discussion of several background issues.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics ARID1B-related disorder (ARID1B-RD) constitutes a clinical continuum, from classic Coffin-Siris syndrome to intellectual disability with or without nonspecific dysmorphic features. Coffin-Siris syndrome is classically characterized by aplasia or hypoplasia of the distal phalanx or nail of the fifth and additional digits, developmental or cognitive delay of varying degree, distinctive facial features, hypotonia, hypertrichosis, and sparse scalp hair. Frequencies of other features, such as developmental delay (with speech often more affected than motor development), is consistent across the clinical spectrum, and may include malformations of the cardiac, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and/or central nervous systems. Other findings seen in individuals with ARID1B-RD include feeding difficulties, slow growth, ophthalmologic abnormalities, hearing impairment, seizures, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and autistic features. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ARID1B-RD is established by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ARID1B by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment for strabismus, refractive error, hearing loss, congenital heart defects, obstructive sleep apnea, constipation, gastroesophageal reflux, cryptorchidism, scoliosis, and seizure disorders. For significant feeding issues, a nasogastric and/or gastrostomy tube may be required. Developmental therapies, including speech/language and feeding therapy, is recommended for those with developmental delay. Surveillance: At least annual assessment of developmental progress and educational needs; annual ophthalmology evaluation and assessment for scoliosis (until growth is complete). Audiology evaluation, behavior assessment, and hormonal evaluation/bone age as needed based on symptoms. Those with seizures should be monitored as clinically indicated. Genetic counseling ARID1B-related disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. With the exception of two families in which a parent and child had features consistent with ARID1B-related disorder, all individuals diagnosed to date have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Once the ARID1B pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

Each of us is convinced of being a unique and stable individual, different from other individuals. These properties - stability ad coherence - belong to an image of ourselves that was proposed to us by the Other's look during the mirror phase. Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena. However, this is not observed in chronic sequelae of brain lesions (e.g. right hemisphere syndrome or amnesic syndrome), even though the patients may present a broken up image of themselves.",

A typical executive task can be defined as the capacity to maintain one’s attention on the current task, that is, responding only to the correct but not to distractive stimuli. Impairments of executive functions, or executive dysfunctions, have a growing impact on everyday life and academic achievement and are usually an early feature, and one of the core features, in brain injury and memory and behavioral disorders. Furthermore, emerging evidence indicates that memory therapeutics cannot achieve their clinical benefits in cognition if executive dysfunction is not effectively and simultaneously treated. Improvement of executive functions might be achieved through targeting some signaling pathways in the brain, including the brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathways. These agents may be useful either as stand-alone interventions for patients with executive dysfunction and/or psychiatric and memory disorders or as essential adjuncts to drugs that target the underlying pathology in various brain injury and memory and behavioral disorders.",

Three categories of manifestations of psycho-violence are distinguished: verbal aggression; dominant behavior; manifestations of jealousy that affect the victim of violence in different ways. Violations developing after the experienced psycho-violence affect all levels of an individual’s functioning and lead to sustainable personality changes. Objective: to identify the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories. My theoretical study of the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories made it possible to identify specific features of the consequences for different age categories. Consequences for children: sleep disturbances; hyperreactivity; impaired memory and concentration; irritability; a sharp decline in school performance; change of worldview; the emergence of many complexes; low self-esteem; maladaptation; health problems (various diseases occur); difficulty in building relationships; developmental delays (mental, emotional, speech); constant stress, fear, expectation of danger; suicidal tendency, asocial lifestyle. The consequences of psycho-violence in adults are disorders of a psychological and physical nature: sleep disturbances; nervous breakdowns; irritability; depression; anxiety; difficulty concentrating; panic conditions, heart attacks; loss of self-esteem; decreased self-esteem; violation of social relations; decrease in labor productivity. The consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories are different, the general thing is that violations affect all levels of a person’s functioning and lead to persistent personality changes.",

      "abstract": "Fluency disorders other than stuttering, which is the major and above all most known form, can be observed and require rehabilitation. Fluency is the quality which enables speech to flow effortlessly with a comfortable delivery, pace and simple transitions. Acquired over a period of several years during childhood, fluency can be altered by numerous neurological syndromes, such as Parkinson's disease, spasmodic dysphonia, or substitution phonations such as the esophageal or tracheoesophageal voice. Their severity is variable and judged above all by the efficacy of communication. Management of the duration and spacing of language segments and their homogeneity with respect to meaning are just as important as the stability of the phonatory organs.",

      "abstract": "Oral communication is one of the most important forms of communication. It is through which the speaker directly delivers the content of the verbal message to the addressee. Usually, the existence of any defect or disorder in the speaker’s vocal cords may result in not delivering the message properly. One of the problems that cause such improper delivery of a verbal message is voice disorders, especially voice hoarseness (Dysphonia). Thus, this paper is entitled (Dysphonia as a Speech Disorder), which refers to the changes occurring in the speaker’s voice that are marked as disorders compared to the normal patterns. Such disorder occurs due to a defect in the elements needed for the process of voice production in a healthy person. This disorder is not confined to a specific age group. It can occur at any age, from childhood onwards, and it may be a temporary or chronic disorder.&#x0D; Speech disorders and their treatment methods are often approached in the domain of applied linguistics, and dysphonia is one of those voice disorders that have not received ample attention from researchers in general, and speech pathologists in particular, despite the steady increase in the number of cases day after day due to several factors including the noise pollution and crowdedness in cities, and some everyday duties that cause injury, which then can be an effective factor for this disorder to occur.&#x0D; Hence, this study is determined to introduce the most important modern trends in rehabilitating voice disorders and presenting methods for curing them.",

      "title": "Anger Disorders",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Anger is a frequently experienced emotion for most people (1). When mild to moderate in intensity and expressed in constructive, nonhostile ways, anger can lead to positive, adaptive behaviors such as expressing feelings; asserting one's rights, thoughts, and feelings; problem solving; redressing concerns; setting appropriate limits on the behavior of others; and motivating effective behavior (1,2). Anger, however, is a double-edged sword, often leading to many negative outcomes. For example, chronic anger and hostility are associated with health problems such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, compromised immune functioning, dental problems, and overall mortality (3). Intense anger is often associated with marital discord, abusive parenting, intimate partner violence, and other relationship problems (4,5). Anger has also been implicated in school violence, bullying, and disrupted teen relations. Anger may also lead to major or minor property damage (4), and an overall propensity to aggression and violence (6). Anger is also associated with reduced work effectiveness and problems such as being placed on probation, demotion, and termination (7). For some angry individuals, their anger is totally externalized and entirely justified, leaving their sense of self untouched. For others, however, their anger impairs their sense ofpsychological well-being; they feel out of control and overwhelmed by their anger and feel anxious, embarrassed, guilty, ashamed, and depressed by their anger and anger-related reactions. While these are but a few examples, anger and its dysfunctional expression affects the physical, psychological, interpersonal, educational, and vocational lives of many people.",

At an early stage of most neurodegenerative diseases, including the Frontotemporal Dementias, it can be very difficult to determine whether a person has symptoms of a progressive illness or is suffering from a condition less likely to progress, or even exhibiting symptoms consistent with normal aging. It is critical to identify individuals with MCI, since people with this clinical syndrome are at elevated risk of progressive cognitive decline. In the case of Primary Progressive Aphasia, a neurodegenerative disease in which speech and/or language abilities are gradually lost, a speech-language pathologist (SLP) may be one of the initial clinical providers in the MCI stage. The SLP is therefore critical in helping to determine whether a change in language abilities is a result of normal aging, a neurodegenerative process, or other etiologies.",

Genetics and epigenetics changes may contribute to a longer or shorter life expectancy. With advancing ageing, there is a decline in both performance and fitness, which is exhibited as frailty (loss of physiological processes and changes in metabolism) as well as cognitive decline. Cognitive changes are characterized by loss of memory, confusion as well as agitation. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), incipient dementia or isolated memory impairment is a brain function syndrome, which involves the onset of cognitive impairment beyond those which might be expected considering the age and education of the individual. This chapter has identified a number of pathways which may enhance lifespan; which include decreased signalling of insulin/insulin-like growth factor ((IGF)-1), an increase expression of sirtuins, increased telomere length and modestly decreased mitochondrial function.",

      "title": "OCCUPATIONAL STRESS IN COMPUTER OPERATORS",
      "abstract": "During work, a person is exposed to various types of stressors that can negatively affect an individual's health and reduce labor productivity. Irrational organization of work, poor interpersonal relations in the team, too short deadlines for the realization of the work tasks, inadequate microclimatic conditions, non-ergonomic design of equipment and tools, as well as accelerated changes and innovations in technology, which require additional education and acquisition of new knowledge and skills, are just some of the factors that negatively burden the person who works.In response to occupational stress, disorders occur on a physiological, psychological and behavioral level. Under conditions of stress, a person, as a social and emotional being eager for affirmation and proof, turns to some bad habits, such as consuming cigarettes, alcohol, psychostimulant substances or anxiolytics, which additionally have a bad effect on health. Employees who are exposed to chronic stress cannot be expected to achieve the desired professional results because they lose motivation, innovative thinking and increased absenteeism from work. Stress often worsens without the support of relatives, the environment and colleagues. Therefore, early recognition of signs of stress, identification of stressors and taking measures and procedures to combat unwanted factors, as well as providing support are of great importance for both human health and to reduce company costs.In this paper, we surveyed 120 computer operators, 72.5% female, average age 37.6 years, and 27.5% male, average age 39.2 years old. 7.8% had a high school diploma, 8.6% higher education, and 83.6% high education. Among them, 32.5% stated that they have moderate, while 29.2% state that they have a high level of stress at work. Poor working conditions and short deadlines are cited as the most common reasons. Of these, 25.6% associated stress with the current epidemiological situation of Covid-19. A significant percentage, 25.2% feel worn out or exhausted, 10% wake up tired, and 8.3% try to overcome fatigue in order to complete their work tasks.Fatigue, apathy, dissatisfaction, overtime work, „bringing work home― can negatively affect family and social relationships as well as leisure activities. There are a variety of stress management techniques at the individual and organizational levels, including group therapies, support and counseling, and breathing exercises that can help overcome the negative effects of stress. Workplace stress must be minimized, in order to ensure a favorable work environment, as well as the physical, mental and social well-being of the working man",

      "abstract": "Background: Hyperlexia is the phenomenon of spontaneous and precocious mastery of single‐word reading that has been of interest to clinicians and researchers since the beginning of the last century. Methods: An extensive search of publications on the subject of hyperlexia was undertaken and all available publications were reviewed. Results: The literature can be subdivided into discussions of the following issues: (1) whether hyperlexia is a phenomenon that is characteristic only of specific clinical populations (e.g., children with developmental delays) or whether it can also be observed in the general population; (2) whether hyperlexia is a distinct syndrome comorbid with a number of different disorders or whether it is a part of the spectrum of some other clinical condition(s); (3) whether hyperlexia should be defined through single‐word reading superiority with regard to reading comprehension, vocabulary, general intelligence, any combination of the three, or all three characteristics; (4) whether there is a specific neuropsychological profile associated with hyperlexia; (5) whether hyperlexia is characterized by a particular developmental profile; and (6) whether hyperlexia should be viewed as a disability (deficit) or superability (talent). Conclusions: We interpret the literature as supporting the view that hyperlexia is a superability demonstrated by a very specific group of individuals with developmental disorders (defined through unexpected single‐word reading in the context of otherwise suppressed intellectual functioning) rather than as a disability exhibited by a portion of the general population (defined through a discrepancy between levels of single‐word reading and comprehension). We simultaneously argue, however, that multifaceted and multi‐methodological approaches to studying the phenomenon of hyperlexia, defined within the research framework of understanding single‐word reading, are warranted and encouraged.",

Approximately 30% of individuals with the 7q11.23 duplication have one or more congenital anomalies. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of the 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is established by detection of a recurrent 1.5- to 1.8-Mb heterozygous duplication of the Williams-Beuren syndrome critical region (WBSCR). Management Treatment of manifestations: Aortic dilation is treated with beta blocker therapy and/or surgery as needed. Constipation should be aggressively managed at all ages to prevent encopresis and impaction. Address developmental disabilities, including ASD, through early intervention programs (including speech/language therapy, physical therapy, and occupational therapy), special education programs, and vocational training. Address ASD with applied behavior analytic interventions and other empirically supported psychosocial approaches. Address childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) or manifestations of this disorder with intensive speech/language therapy to maximize effective oral communication and prevent or limit later language impairment and/or reading disorder. Address emotional and behavioral disorders (aggression, social anxiety, selective mutism) with cognitive-behavioral therapy, applied behavior analysis behavior modification intervention, and psychotropic medications as needed. Surveillance: Routine monitoring of head circumference in infancy. Annual monitoring of aortic diameter (including Z scores in children) and behavior. Annual assessment by occupational and physical therapists and speech and language pathologists until age six years. Genetic counseling The 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner. About 27% of probands have an affected parent. When a parent has the 7q11.23 duplication, the risk to each sib of inheriting the duplication is 50%. If the 7q11.23 duplication identified in the proband is not identified in the parents, the risk to sibs is low (",

The diagnosis of a chronic and recurrent mental disorder influences a person’s self-image and has a strong impact on all members of the family. In the adjustment to the diagnosis, each individual usually undergoes a process in which a variety of beliefs and emotions may arise that will have to be dealt with, in parallel to education about and acceptance of the disorder. It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

      "abstract": "Dyslexia is the most common form of specific learning disabilities. Dyslexia is observed in 5-17.5 % of schoolchildren, and among children with specific learning disabilities, it accounts for about 70-80 %. Usually, dyslexia manifests itself as the inability to achieve an appropriate level of reading skills development that would be proportional to their intellectual abilities and writing and spelling skills. Secondary consequences of dyslexia may include problems in reading comprehension and reduced reading experience that can impede the growth of vocabulary and background skills. The review discusses neurological management of reading and writing as complex higher mental functions, including many components that are provided by various brain areas. The principles of dyslexia classification, the main characteristics of its traditionally defined forms are given: phonemic, optical, mnestic, semantic, agrammatic. The article analyzes the cerebral mechanisms of dyslexia development, the results of studies using neuropsychological methods, functional neuroimaging, and the study of the brain connectome. The contribution to dyslexia development of disturbances in phonological awareness, rapid automated naming (RAN), the volume of visual attention (VAS), components of the brain executive functions is discussed. The origin of emotional disorders in children with dyslexia, risk factors for dyslexia development (including genetic predisposition) are considered. Dyslexia manifestations in children are listed, about which their parents seek the advice of a specialist for the first time. In the process of diagnosing dyslexia, attention should be paid to the delay in the child’s speech development, cases of speech and language development disorders and specific learning disabilities among family members. It is necessary to consider possible comorbidity of dyslexia in a child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, dyscalculia, developmental dyspraxia, disorders of emotional control and brain executive functions. Timely diagnosis determines the effectiveness of early intervention programs based on an integrated multimodal approach.",

      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

      "abstract": "Non-organic voice disorders are characterised by an impaired voice sound, and/or reduced vocal capacity, and/or laryngeal sensory disturbances, all in the absence of causal organic laryngeal pathology. Psychogenic causes, a \"psychological disequilibrium\", and an increased tension of the laryngeal muscles are presumed to be one end of the spectrum of possible factors leading to the development of the disorder. In making a diagnosis, perceptive and acoustic methods for voice analysis are used in addition to the ENT-examination and the laryngostroboscopy. An assessment of the degree to which the patient feels him/herself subjectively affected by the voice disorder also plays an important role. If the history reveals any indication of psychosocial stress or conflict, the patient is offered psychological consultations. These conflicts seem less often to be deep rooted psychopathological problems but rather daily anxieties, failures, injuries, annoyances, disappointments regarding the sufferer him/herself and others, the non-fulfillment of desires, feelings of inadequacy and of lack of self-confidence. The patients may find it difficult to speak about conflicts and feelings, and they follow social conventions to an excessive extent. In frustrating situations patients tend to react aggressively towards themselves rather than towards others and are too quick in seeking a solution to any problem that may arise. The role of the voice as a \"barometer of emotion\", where a disorder may be regarded as a sign of emotional stress, has to be taken into consideration before starting a therapy: If the non-organic voice disorder is obviously due to vocal misuse and muscle tension, a more symptom-orientated voice therapy may be favoured. If psychosocial stress seems to play a greater role, additional counseling may be necessary. Only by using this approach can the patient be offered a therapy which goes into the causes and thereby addresses the whole person.",

Depression is common and serious problem that often starts in childhood. Today is estimated that approximatly 10-15% of children in general population has syptoms of depression. It is associated with an increased risk of other psychiatric disorders, poor academic success, underdeveloped social skills and even suicidal thoughts. The primary symptoms of depression are continuous feelings of sadness and hopelessness and mood changes. Symptoms of depression in children also include irritability or anger, social withdrawal, changes in appetite (either increased or decreased), changes in sleep (sleeplessness or excessive sleep), difficulty concentrating, etc. Depressive disorders include Major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, depressive disorder, indeterminate and bipolar disorder. Depression in children can be caused by any combination of factors that relate to physical health, life events, family history, environment, genetic vulnerability and biochemical disturbance. Depression should be recognized and diagnosed as early as possible in children and adolescents in order to start treatment on time. The most efficient treatment is a treatment that is not focused on depressive symptoms only, but also on functioning on daily bases in children.",

      "title": "AUTISM AS A DISORDER OF THE IMMATURE BRAIN",
      "abstract": "Autism (or better the autistic spectrum disorders – ASDs) is now known to be a strongly genetically-influenced disorder of early childhood with an extremely broad range of severity. It is not a “disease,” in the sense that it has many etiologies, mostly genetic rather than environmentally-determined. In most cases multigenic effects on brain development are modulated by environmental influences. Core deficits include a) social obtuseness, blunted empathy and deficient insight, b) impaired verbal and nonverbal communication and imagination, and c) cognitive and behavioral inflexibility and stereotypies. Cognition, not a defining criterion, regularly has an extremely uneven profile. The neurologic basis of motor abnormalities, aberrant sensory processing and epilepsy remains poorly understood, so are the causes for early regression of language, sociability, and play in toddlers. Electrophysiologic and brain imaging reveal subtle abnormalities, as has so far neuropathologic examination of the few brains available for study. All children with poor language must undergo prompt, definitive hearing testing and all children require a physical and neurologic evaluation to rule out diagnosable and treatable etiologies, which are infrequent. There is no place for routine genetic or laboratory testing, brain imaging or electrophysiologic investigation outside of clear clinical indications, unless the child is enrolled in a formal research study. Language and psychological evaluation is needed to prescribe on-going individualized education, the most potent tool available for altering brain development. There is no medical cure and the use of neurotropic medications is limited to improving troublesome symptoms that interfere with education and behavior at home and in school. Prognosis for independence in adulthood is unreliable in very young children so that early intensive intervention is critical and often highly beneficial within the biologic constraints of the child's brain.",

      "title": "Cognitive functions in children with cerebellar malformations",
      "abstract": "In the last few years the role of the cerebellum has been increasingly demonstrated, not only in the coordination of movements and control of posture, but also in cognitive functions. Cerebellar involvement in cognitive processes has been best characterized by Schmahmann and Sherman in adults.1 They described cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS), which involves the disturbances of executive functions, impaired spatial cognition, linguistic difficulties, and personality changes. Acquired focal cerebellar lesions represent the best models in which to study cognitive functions in paediatric cerebellar disorders. In children with low-grade cerebellar astrocytoma several studies demonstrated visuospatial, language sequencing, and memory problems.2 Cognitive impairment has also been reported in cerebellar malformations. In Joubert syndrome and related disorders, developmental delay and/or cognitive impairment are considered to be key features, while normal cognitive functions are exceptional. Despite normal Full-scale IQ (IQ=93), one patient showed specific difficulties in visuospatial organization and in some executive functions.3 This pattern of deficits is partly reminiscent of CCAS. In rhombencephalosynapsis, cognitive functions are mostly impaired at a level of mild intellectual impairment, but without a typical cognitive profile.4 Additionally, behavioural problems such as attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder are frequent. In children with non-progressive congenital ataxia detailed neurocognitive examinations revealed significant cognitive deficits affecting, particularly, attention, processing speed, and visuospatial functions.2 The study of cognitive functions in cerebellar malformations presents some difficulties: (1) cerebellar malformations are rare (Joubert syndrome is one of the most frequent cerebellar malformations and its estimated prevalence is 1:100.000); (2) severe cognitive impairment may disable a formal IQ assessment; and (3) typical clinical signs such as limb ataxia, dysarthria, or abnormal eye movements may impair the performance of neurocognitive tasks. In the view of these difficulties, the cohort of patients reported by Bolduc et al.5 is remarkable (n=49). Although the small number of children in the various diagnostic subgroups and their young age are limitations of this study, the authors present interesting and important findings. Cognitive functions were impaired in 39% of patients with different cerebellar malformations. This finding confirms the high prevalence of cognitive impairment in patients with cerebellar malformations compared with the total population (1.5%).6 Visual reception and expressive language were particularly affected. Additionally, both internalizing and externalizing behavioural disorders could be found in 25% and 15% of the patients respectively. Involvement of visual reception and expressive language as well as behavioural disorders are again reminiscent of CCAS. In cerebellar malformations, CCAS seems to be less specific than in patients with postnatally acquired cerebellar lesions. The authors found that severity of cognitive impairment correlated well with associated supratentorial abnormalities and severity of vermian malformation (e.g. patients with Dandy-Walker malformation and Joubert syndrome generally showed more severe cognitive impairment). This finding suggests that the volume of the cerebellar vermis and the involvement of other anatomical structures may play a significant role in cognitive functions. Patients with non-progressive congenital ataxia may show the same spectrum of neurocognitive impairment, but in these patients the brain anatomy is usually normal. Therefore, structural abnormalities cannot be the only explanation for the neurocognitive impairment in children with congenital cerebellar disorders. Recently, functional disruption of the white matter tracts containing efferent axons within the superior cerebellar peduncles has been shown to be a critical pathopysiological component of posterior fossa syndrome.7 This suggests that abnormalities of the white matter tracts connecting the cerebellum with the brainstem and cerebral hemispheres may impair neurocognitive functions in children with cerebellar disorders. Diffusion tensor imaging is an innovative magnetic resonance imaging technique allowing the qualitative and quantitative study of the white matter tracts in the cerebro-cerebello-connection.8 The study of the cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathways in children with cerebellar malformations may increase our understanding of the role of the cerebellum in cognitive functions.",

      "abstract": "This review discusses the assessment of psychotic disorders in prelingually deaf patients and the related challenges.Although prelingually deaf patients are often diagnosed with psychotic disorders, the clinical presentation of this group is complex and no clear guidelines regarding the assessment process can be formulated due to the lack of valid, reliable research. Sign language dynamics or language dysfluency may be falsely recognized as disorganized thinking. Some of the symptoms indicating disorganized thinking in the case of spoken languages may fulfill specific functions when used in sign language (for example object chaining). Furthermore, deaf individuals experience multiple stressors that may be considered as risk factors for developing delusions, especially for those growing up in hearing, non-signing families. Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge that some seemingly delusional beliefs shared by prelingually deaf people may be associated with the lack of assisted learning, gullibility, low level of confidence in healthcare or deaf communities' social norms. The question concerning the sensory modality of hallucinations experienced by deaf individuals remains unresolved. Patients' accounts suggest that hallucinations described as auditory may be perceived as lip-reading without identifying the speaker's face, among others. However, for those who provide help it is far more important to recognize the function of hallucinations and to differentiate them from normative experience.It is essential to expand our knowledge regarding the clinical presentation of psychotic disorders in deaf individuals in order to develop assessment guidelines and tools and, above all, increase the well-being of those suffering from psychotic disorders, as well as of those whose diagnosis remains unclear.",

      "title": "Neurodevelopmental, Neurobehavioral, and Psychosocial Aspects of Cerebral Palsy",
      "abstract": "Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of permanent movement disorders caused by non-progressive disturbances in the developing brain. While motor impairments such as spasticity and dyskinesia are hallmark features, CP also encompasses the significant neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral challenges. Cognitive deficits, ranging from mild intellectual disabilities to specific impairments in memory, attention, and executive functioning, are common and often exacerbated by comorbidities such as epilepsy or sensory impairments. Language and communication difficulties, including dysarthria and expressive-receptive language disorders, further hinder academic and social integration. Learning disabilities, compounded by motor and cognitive limitations, necessitate individualized educational plans and assistive technologies to support academic success. Behavioral comorbidities, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are prevalent in CP, complicating social interactions and academic progress. Management strategies include behavioral therapies such as applied behavior analysis and, when necessary, pharmacological interventions such as stimulant medications. Neurobehavioral assessments in CP are challenging due to motor and sensory impairments, requiring adapted tools and multidisciplinary collaboration for accurate evaluation. Psychosocial and emotional well-being is significantly impacted, with individuals often experiencing frustration, low self-esteem, and social isolation. Families also face emotional, financial, and social burdens, necessitating family-centered care approaches, including respite care, parent training programs, and support groups.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Developmental disabilities exist in children and adolescents, enabling them to live an independent and self-governing life, requiring special health related services. We are intended to inform dental professionals in planning and implementing a dental treatment for people with developmental disabilities. Cerebral palsy is defined as being a group of motor abnormalities and functional impairments that affect muscle coordination, and characterized by uncontrolled body movements, intellectual disabilities, balance-related abnormalities or seizure disorders. These patients can be successfully treated in normal dental practices, but because they have problems with movements, care must be tailored accordingly. Down syndrome, a very common genetic disorder, is usually associated with different physical and medical problems, intellectual disabilities, and a developmental delay. These patients can be treated with success in dental offices, this way making a difference in the medical care for people with special needs. Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, verbal and non-verbal communication and by restricted and repetitive behavior. Self-injurious behavior, obsessive routines and unpredictable body movements can influence dental care. Because of the coexisting conditions (epilepsy or intellectual disability), one can find this people among the most challenging to treat. There is a need of greater awareness, focus and education in the field of the unique and complex oral health care that people with disabilities need. Making a difference their oral health positively influences an already challenged existence. According to the ethical principles, patients with developmental disabilities should be treated equitably depending on their necessities.",

      "abstract": "Functional speech disorders (FSDs), a subtype of functional neurological disorders, are distinguishable from neurogenic motor speech disorders based on their clinical features, clinical course, and response to treatment. However, their differential diagnosis and management can be challenging. FSDs are not well understood, but growing evidence suggests a biopsychosocial basis distinct from structural lesions that cause neurogenic motor speech disorders.Following an overview of FSDs, four patients are described to illustrate the range of clinical manifestations, biopsychosocial contexts, and responses to treatment of FSDs. The path to differential diagnosis is discussed, with particular attention to positive features that led to the FSD diagnosis. Approaches to education, counseling, and management are discussed.This case series demonstrates that FSDs can present with a variety of manifestations including dysfluencies, articulation errors, dysphonia, rate and prosodic abnormalities, and combinations of disruptions in speech subsystems. FSDs may present in the context of known recent or remote physical or psychosocial trauma or, as in many cases, in the absence of an identifiable triggering event. FSDs are recognizable by positive clinical features and should not be considered a diagnosis of exclusion. With appropriate identification, counseling, and treatment, FSDs may resolve, sometimes rapidly; in some cases, treatment may be prolonged or ineffective.",

      "abstract": "Based on a review of recent publications, the paper offers an insight into the issue of sensory processing disorder (SPD), discusses its signs and symptoms, and gives examples of behaviors that can be seen in children with SPD. It points to the fact that sensory processing disorder can significantly hinder or even limit children's functioning in their social life, family, and school as it deprives them of experiences that are essential for learning and normal development. That is why it is important to diagnose the disorder early to implement treatment that will help to overcome and/or adapt to SPD. The problem of sensory processing disorder is important as more and more children are suffering from it. It should also be mentioned that it is frequently a comorbid condition, which co-occurs, for example, with autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and intellectual disability or develops in children at risk of developmental disorders (due to perinatal complications, cesarean section or prematurity).",

      "title": "[Cognitive and behavioral consequences of epilepsy during the course of brain development].",
      "abstract": "The notion that cognitive and behavioural dysfunctions of epileptic origin can be prolonged and with an insidious onset, has meant a radical conceptual change about epilepsy considered so far uniquely as a paroxysmal disorder. Also, these dysfunctions can be the only observable manifestations of the disorder. It is particularly true in some epileptic syndromes with onset in childhood. Epileptic dysfunctions are characterized by a discontinuity in time (intermittent, recurrent), in space (cerebral localization of the dysfunction and its spread). They often have a significant relationship with sleep. These features, with sometimes the existential dimension of some symptoms (intermittent loss of the flux of consciousness, intermittent perceptual distortions or cognitive-emotional dysfunction) are not seen in any other congenital or acquired disorders of the human brain. Longitudinal clinical studies in which the epileptic variable can be directly correlated with the precise study of the cognitive dysfunction (also with increasingly complex methods of brain imaging) are a difficult, relatively new multidisciplinary task, especially in the very young child. Case examples of children followed from early childhood to adulthood will illustrate the diversity of observed cognitive and behavioural abnormalities directly caused by the epileptic activity which can be massive or very discrete. One is only beginning to document precisely the late consequences (or absence of) of some early childhood epilepsies that had a direct impact on developing brain function at some point.",

Tais comprometimentos podem causar alteracoes na respiracao, na fonacao, na ressonância e na articulacao da fala. Estes comprometimentos podem ser decorrentes de traumatismo craniano (TC). O TC e uma agressao cerebral resultante de uma pancada na cabeca e/ou uma queda com fratura craniana. Na fala disartrica pode haver, tambem, falha no mecanismo velofaringeo devido a paralisia/paresia do palato mole. Neste caso, o resultado acustico para a fala e a hipernasalidade e a emissao de ar nasal, que podem ser tratadas atraves do uso de uma protese de palato elevadora (PPE). Na disartria, o ritmo da fala tambem pode estar alterado, implicando alteracoes nos locais de acento frasal (AF), na insercao e na duracao das pausas silenciosas (PS). Sendo assim, interessou-nos investigar a estruturacao ritmica da fala disartrica decorrente de TC. Para tanto, obtivemos a colaboracao de uma falante disartrica, usuaria de PPE, falante nativa do portugues brasileiro (PB) acometida por TC. O estudo desta fala isartrica teve como objetivos: comparar as condicoes de uso e nao uso da PPE; comparar a estruturacao ritmica da fala disartrica brasileira (FDB) com uma fala sem comprometimentos (FSC); comparar a estruturacao ritmica da FDB com uma fala isartrica francesa (FDF); estudar a relacao sintaxeprosodia na estruturacao ritmica da fala tanto na comparacao com a FSC quanto na comparacao com a FDF; adquirir melhor entendimento da fala disartrica pos TC, considerando o modelo de ritmo da fala para o PB de Barbosa (2006). Para cumprir estes objetivos, acompanhamos o tratamento com PPE da falante disartrica de 1995 a 2005. Neste periodo coletamos e analisamos oito leituras de um mesmo texto realizadas por ela usando a PPE e duas leituras sem esta protese: uma em 1995 e outra em 2005. A FSC correspondeu a leitura do mesmo texto da FDB. A FDF correspondeu a leitura de outro texto frances. Nestas leituras realizamos analises acusticas e de sua organizacao ritmica em unidades vogal-vogal (VV), grupos acentuais (GA), AF e PS. Nas analises das oito leituras da FDB houve reducao no numero de PS, reducao da participacao das PS na duracao do texto lido e aumento da taxa de elocucao (TE). A estruturacao ritmica da FDB com e sem a protese foi a mesma. Houve diferenca significante entre a FDB e a FSC para a TE e para a duracao das PS, mas nao para a duracao dos GA nem para o numero de unidades VV. Na comparacao entre a FDB e a FDF nao houve diferencas significativas quanto a TE, taxa de articulacao e numero de unidades VV por GA. Na relacao sintaxe-prosodia, as marcas sintaticas IDF (independencia forte) e COORD (independencia de uma conjuncao coordenada) foram significativas tanto para a FDB quanto para a FSC. Mas nao para a FDF.

      "title": "Epilepsy and Seizures",
      "abstract": "For more than a century, clinicians have observed a strong link between epilepsy and psychiatry as evidenced by frequent psychopathologies, psychosocial disturbances, and cognitive deficits among people with epilepsy. In many countries, until recently, epilepsy was conceptualized as a mental health disorder. Epilepsy can be associated not only with episodic behavioral disorders ictally and during the peri-ictal period but also with chronic behavioral disturbances interictally. Indeed, even when optimal seizure control is achieved and cognitive impairment is absent, epidemiological studies have shown greater vulnerability of people with epilepsy toward psychosocial distress (Sillanpää et al. 1998). A wide variety of etiologies affecting the central nervous system (CNS) can involve very similar behavioral signs and symptoms (Table 10–1 ). Primary signs and symptoms of central nervous system disturbances Cognitive Affective dysregulation Communication/language dysfunction Intellectual impairment Impaired judgment Dysmnesia/inattention Disorientation Behavioral Anxiety Alteration in arousal Mood (elevation, depression, apathy) Motor (hyperkinetic, hypokinetic, or akinetic) Personality traits/changes Dyspraxia Perceptions Auditory Gustatory Kinesthetic pain/paresthesias/anesthesia Olfactory Visual Source. Adapted from Tucker 2002, p. 674. In this chapter, we first provide an overview of the evaluation and management of epilepsy, focusing on the diverse neurobehavioral manifestations of seizures as influenced by seizure origin and extent of electrical propagation. In subsequent sections, we review the evaluation and management of the more common neuropsychiatric complications and comorbidities of the epilepsies and seizures.",

      "title": "Sleep problems in children with dyslexia: understanding the role of sleep in neurocognitive development through the lens of developmental disorders",
      "abstract": "It has long been recognised that sleep is more than a passive recovery state or mere inconvenience. Sleep plays an active role in maintaining a healthy body, brain and mind, and numerous studies suggest that sleep is integral to learning and memory. The importance of sleep for cognition is clear in studies of those experiencing sleep deprivation, who show consistent deficits across cognitive domains in relation to nonsleep-deprived controls, particularly in tasks that tax attention or executive functions 1. Poor sleep has been associated with poor grades, and academic performance suffers when sleep is sacrificed for extra study 2. Thus, it is perhaps unsurprising that children with developmental disorders of learning and cognition often suffer from sleep disturbances. These have been well documented in children with autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), where sleep problems can be particularly severe. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that sleep can be atypical across a spectrum of learning disorders. Understanding the ways in which sleep is affected in different developmental disorders can not only support the design and implementation of effective assessment and remediation programs, but can also inform theories of how sleep supports cognition in typical development. The study by Carotenuto et al. 3 in this issue makes a valuable contribution to this literature by looking at sleep disturbances in children with developmental dyslexia. Dyslexia is the most common specific learning disorder, affecting around one in 10 children in our classrooms. It is characterised by difficulties with reading and spelling and is primarily caused by a deficit in phonological processing. However, dyslexia often co-occurs with other developmental disorders, such as ADHD and specific language impairment, and there can be striking heterogeneity between children. This has led to the suggestion that dyslexia can result from complex combinations of multiple risk factors and impairments 4. Consequently, research attention is turning towards the wider constellation of subclinical difficulties often experienced by children with dyslexia, including potential sleep problems. Two preliminary studies have found differences in the sleep architecture of children with dyslexia in comparison with typical peers, using overnight sleep EEG recordings (polysomnography) 5, 6. Notably, children with dyslexia showed unusually long periods of slow wave sleep and an increased number of sleep spindles. Slow wave sleep and spindles are related to language learning, most notably through promoting the consolidation of new vocabulary 7. Children with dyslexia have pronounced deficits in learning new oral vocabulary, providing a plausible theoretical link between sleep disturbances and language difficulties. If sleep problems do in fact exacerbate the learning difficulties associated with dyslexia, as well as impacting on daily cognitive function, this could have important implications for intervention and support programs. However, an important first step is to establish the nature and extent of sleep disturbances in dyslexia. Previous studies 5, 6 have used small samples (N = <30) and examined a large array of sleep parameters on a small number of unusual nights (where children were wearing sleep recording equipment), as opposed to looking at global patterns over time. As such, how representative these findings are is questionable, and consequently these studies should be viewed as hypothesis-generating rather than hypothesis-testing. Carotenuto et al. 3 address some of these concerns, administering questionnaire measures of sleep habits to the parents of 147 children with dyslexia and 766 children without dyslexia, aged 8–12 years. A sample of this size allows for a robust analysis of sleep characteristics. Therefore, their findings that children with dyslexia showed higher rates of several markers of sleep disorders lend significant weight to suggestions that dyslexia might be associated with an increased risk for sleep problems. Importantly, the sleep questionnaire used by Carotenuto et al. 3 allows for a breakdown of sleep disturbances. It is interesting to note that they found the greatest difficulties in initiating and maintaining sleep, sleep breathing disorders and disorders of arousal. This closely mirrors the types of sleep problem documented in children with ADHD 8. While Carotenuto et al. 3 took care to exclude children with comorbid diagnoses, many children with dyslexia show subtle features of attention disorders that do not reach clinical thresholds. Future studies that can establish whether sleep disturbances are associated with subclinical attention problems or dyslexia per se will be particularly informative for understanding which cognitive skills most critically relate to sleep. This is also vital information for establishing whether information about sleep habits could have clinical relevance in the assessment and management of children with dyslexia. There are a number of ways in which Carotenuto et al.'s findings could be taken forward in future studies. Not least, the findings need to be replicated using more objective measures of sleep, including polysomnography and/or actigraphy, both of which can be administered in the home environment. It is notable that neither of the two polysomnography studies to date observed differences in sleep onset time or night-time awakenings in children with dyslexia compared with typical peers. Although this could be a result of a lack of statistical power due to the very small samples in these studies, the discrepancy could also be due to the subjective nature of the questionnaires used. Future studies must also take care to recruit samples that are free of referral bias. Carotenuto et al. recruited their sample via referrals to a hospital clinic; hence, it is possible that such children may be more likely to present with multiple issues (including sleep problems), rather than reading difficulty alone. Thus, it will be important to examine the prevalence of sleep difficulties in referred and nonreferred samples. Although Carotenuto et al. make substantial progress in establishing the frequency of sleep disorders in dyslexia, the study design cannot test causal hypotheses or establish whether there was a link between sleep difficulties and severity of reading impairment. Indeed, a great challenge in the field of sleep and developmental disorders is establishing the extent to which sleep is causally related to cognitive difficulties. It is possible that brain abnormalities associated with disorders can cause both cognitive and sleep differences without them being directly linked to each other. Moreover, sleep difficulties may simply be a consequence of increased anxiety associated with having a developmental disorder. Randomised controlled trials are often viewed as the gold standard means of establishing causality. For example, a recent study has shown that a sleep intervention for children with ADHD led to significant improvements in ADHD symptomatology and working memory 9. Given that the type of sleep problems encountered by children with dyslexia are similar to those in ADHD, it is tempting to propose that such an intervention may prove useful for children with dyslexia. However, it is important to be cautious: only 42% of the children with dyslexia in the Carotenuto et al. study suffered sleep difficulties. This indicates that while having dyslexia seems to greatly increase a child's risk of sleep problems, sleep disturbances are unlikely to represent a causal pathway to reading difficulties. Therefore, it is unlikely that a sleep intervention would be useful for all individuals with dyslexia. Nonetheless, it remains plausible that sleep difficulties could exacerbate cognitive and literacy difficulties in some children, who might then benefit from clinical intervention. If this is the case, then such interventions should be seen as complementary to literacy-targeted interventions that tackle the reading difficulty itself. Further research is needed to ascertain whether and how sleep difficulties contribute to the difficulties experienced by children with dyslexia, and to establish which children with dyslexia are at the greatest risk of sleep disturbances. Understanding the role of sleep in developmental disorders is vital, not only to improve assessment and treatment for affected children and families, but also to advance theoretical models of sleep and neurocognitive development. While sleep problems are common in several neurodevelopmental disorders, these problems are likely to differ qualitatively and quantitatively across children with different difficulties. Therefore, it is important to study sleep problems within each learning disorder as well as to look at the heterogeneity across the spectrum of learning difficulties. Studies such as the one by Carotenuto et al., which looks specifically at sleep in dyslexia, are crucial in this regard, raising awareness of the possible role of sleep difficulties and opening up a plethora of potential lines of future research in this area.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is essential for various cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes, including attention, memory, executive function, emotional regulation, and interpersonal interactions. Sleep disruptions undermine these functions, resulting in measurable impairments in daily activities, occupational performance, and public safety. Adequate sleep supports sustained vigilance and concentration, whereas sleep deprivation is associated with attentional lapses, diminished cognitive control, and impaired sensory processing. Memory consolidation, which depends on both non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, is particularly susceptible to disruption by sleep loss. Executive functions, such as working memory, impulse control, and decision-making, are notably impaired due to the prefrontal cortex's heightened sensitivity to insufficient sleep. Sleep deprivation increases amygdala reactivity, weakens prefrontal-amygdala connectivity, and contributes to emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, and risk-taking behaviors. Chronic sleep deprivation exacerbates cognitive deficits, emotional instability, and motor performance decline, leading to higher error rates and reduced workplace productivity. Given its widespread consequences, chronic sleep deprivation constitutes a significant public health concern. This narrative review synthesizes contemporary research on the effects of sleep and sleep loss on waking behavior, with a focus on attention, memory, executive function, emotional regulation, and daytime performance.",

      "abstract": "The cognitive impairment associated with PD involves a broad range of deficits including difficulty with executive functions such as working memory, inhibition, decision-making, and cognitive multitasking, learning, and visuoperceptual skills. Even early in the disease, when motor symptoms tend to predominate, there is evidence that cognitive functions can be compromised. Owing to the presence of executive-type dysfunction in PD, some researchers likened the cognitive deficit of PD to that seen with frontal lobe damage. The anatomical basis of PD, however, suggests otherwise. Dopamine depletion in the basal ganglia, and the downstream depletion of dopamine in the frontostriatal circuitry is often thought to be the foundation of the cognitive deficits associated with PD. In addition to cognitive impairments, a language deficit attends Parkinson’s disease (PD) alongside the other motor and non-motor aspects of the disease. This language deficit is characterized by difficulty processing various types of figurative language, and has been associated with various PD-related cognitive deficits, such as deficits in working memory (WM). Varied assessment tools have been used to characterize the neuropsychological functions associated with this language deficit, most of which involve some measure of frontally-based cognitive skills. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of frontal lobe function on higher-level language function in the non-demented PD (NDPD) population.

Phenomenological details of visitor experiences are expected to reflect the functions of deep temporal lobe structures; common details involve cosmic meaningfulness, vestibular experiences, flickering, complex visual sensations and alimentary references. After intense experiences, interictal-like behaviors similar to religious conversions (widening affect, sense of personal, desire to spread the word, concern about Man's destiny) emerge. Normal people who are prone to these experiences show frequent temporal lobe signs and specific personality characteristics that include enhanced creativity, suggestibility, mild hypomania, anxiety, and emotional lability. Learning histories that encourage the use of right temporal lobe functions for the consolidation of memory, such as compartmentalization of beliefs or repression due to early sexual abuse, predispose to intense visitor experiences. The most frequent precipitants are psychological depression, personal (existential) stress and proximal exposure to the focal tectonic strain fields that accompany luminous phenomena.

The situation has become even more important in recent years with the implementation of early-screening identification for autism and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. This is especially true because one of the most salient early markers for autism is late onset of talking. However, late onset of speech is not a specific marker for ASD, as the late talking may be a symptom of not only autism, but also intellectual disabilities (formally known as mental retardation), hearing loss, speech/pronunciation difficulties, language disorders, or social communication disorder as well. In addition, for the overwhelming majority of late-talking children, the delayed onset is simply a passing developmental stage with no long-term adverse consequences for communication, achievement, or intellectual development.",

      "abstract": "Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience challenges in various developmental areas, particularly in social skills, communication, and repetitive behaviors. A significant proportion of individuals with ASD have limited or no speech, while others never acquire functional speech. The disorder is characterized by high heterogeneity, which is believed to be influenced by genetic diversity. ASD is often comorbid with other disorders, including anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, and other behavioral disorders. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of ASD, personalized intervention programs are necessary. However, assessing children with ASD with standardized tools can be challenging due to their heterogeneity and limited compliance with psychometric standards. Furthermore, the choice of appropriate assessment tools is hampered by a wide range of behaviors and communication limitations. The heterogeneity of cognitive profiles in individuals with ASD poses additional challenges in diagnosis and test interpretation. Standardized intelligence quotient (IQ) assessments may not accurately reflect the intelligence of individuals with ASD, and adaptive behavior measures may provide a better comparison. Communication assessment in ASD involves tests or questionnaires administered to the child or filled out by parents. However, most assessments lack standardization for children with ASD and communication impairments. Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) tools, such as the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) and speech-generating devices, can support communication in children with ASD. Standardized communication systems, such as sign language and symbol sets, have been developed for individuals with disabilities. However, there is a lack of standardized sets or lexicons of meanings, specifically designed for individuals with ASD. This chapter highlights the challenges and considerations in assessing communication and intelligence in children with ASD, emphasizing the need for personalized and comprehensive assessment approaches tailored to their unique profiles.",

These dysfunctions are associated with poor real-life functioning. Social cognition deficits mediate in part the impact of neurocognitive dysfunction on functional outcome. Aims To review literature findings on prevalence, severity and association with functional outcome of neurocognitive and social cognitive deficits in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Methods We searched PubMed for English/Italian or French full-text publications with the keywords. schizophr*/psychosis/psychot*/AND neurocognitive/cognitive/neuropsychological/memory/attention/”executive function”/learning/”social cognition”/”theory of mind”/”affect recognition”/”acial emotion recognition”/”emotional intelligence”/”emot* recognition”. Furthermore, we manually searched the reference lists of relevant papers, systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Results In people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, neurocognitive and social cognition deficits were observed in all phases of the disorders, even after symptom remission. Some of these deficits were observed in subjects at high-risk to develop schizophrenia before psychotic onset. In all these subjects, cognitive deficits are associated with worse psychosocial functioning and poor quality of life. Pharmacological treatments do not alleviate cognitive deficits, which can also limit the benefit of other psychological or psychosocial interventions. Conclusions Neurocognitive and social cognition deficits need to be targeted by specific interventions to improve real-life functioning and quality of life of people with schizophrenia or psychotic disorders.

While psychotic features, i.e. delusions, hallucinations and disordered thinking, are critical to diagnosis, accompanying cognitive deficits are receiving increasing attention. Such deficits, occurring early in the course of the disease, are incapacitating, perhaps more so than the psychotic features (Harvey et al ., 2003), and have prognostic significance (Fujii and Wylie, 2003). They may be seen in apparently unaffected relatives of people with schizophrenia (Faraone et al ., 1995). In this issue of Brain , Whalley et al . (2004) demonstrate changes in brain responses to cognitive demands in a group of people who are at risk of developing schizophrenia (having two or more first‐ or second‐degree relatives with the disease). Furthermore, a distinctive pattern of brain activation characterizes those in whom the disease may be emerging.\n\nAt‐risk subjects and matched controls underwent functional MRI (fMRI) while silently completing sentences that varied from strongly constrained (e.g. ‘He mailed the letter without a ………’) to weakly constrained (e.g. ‘Rushing out, he forgot to take his………’). Four levels of constraint were used to manipulate task difficulty (higher constraint = easier sentence completion). At‐risk subjects showed abnormal responses to increasing task difficulty in frontal, thalamic and cerebellar regions. None of the subjects met diagnostic criteria for a psychotic illness. Moreover, none were on any medication and none sought treatment or even considered themselves unwell.

In vision, age-related changes are seen in contrast sensitivity, scotopic processing, and visual processing speed, which have consequences for activities such as reading and driving. Aging is also associated with changes in smell, taste, and balance. Beyond simple perceptual processing, age-related sensory changes can increase cognitive demands, requiring greater involvement of domain-general cognitive processes during perception that reduce resources available for other operations. Capturing individual variability in sensory changes and their consequences is an important part of understanding normal and pathological aging.",

      "abstract": "Dyskinesia is characterized by complex, irregular involuntary movements involving lips, tongue, extremities, and/or trunk. The term “dyskinesia” is often used to encompass complex involuntary movements that do not fit into another category of involuntary movements. Focal dyskinesia is commonly seen in the lips and tongue (orolingual dyskinesia or oral dyskinesia). Drug side effects are the most common cause of generalized dyskinesia, usually those that influence dopamine such as L-dopa and neuroleptics (drug-induced dyskinesia, tardive dyskinesia). Motor stereotypies are repetitive occurrences of the same movements; movements commonly encountered in this condition range from simple movements like shaking arms and nodding to complex movements. Motor stereotypies are commonly observed in children with Asperger syndrome, Rett syndrome and other automatisms, and mental retardation. In adults, stereotyped movements are seen in cases of severe infectious encephalitis, autoimmune encephalitis (e.g., limbic encephalitis), cerebrovascular diseases involving the frontal lobe, and neurodegenerative diseases like frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Tics are irregular, typically brisk movements ranging from shock-like simple movements resembling myoclonus (simple tic) to complex movements (complex tic). Patients with tics tend to repeat certain movements like blinking or grimacing, but in the patients with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, tics appear as a variety of movements including vocalization (vocal tic). These patients can stop the movements for several seconds, but it is often followed by rebound; they often feel an urge to move before a bout of tics and feel release after the bout.",

      "title": "Dementia: A Cross-Cultural Perspective on Risk Factors",
      "abstract": "Dementia is one of the most devastating mental illnesses that affect older adults, accounting for a large proportion of new cases of mental illness in old age and causing significant distress to individuals and their families. This paper provides a review of research on the frequency of dementia and the factors that put people at risk, with implications for prevention and intervention. Where possible, we address ethnic or cultural differences. However, while ethnic minority elders are a rapidly growing group in the United States, too little research has been conducted about dementia in these groups, including differences in rates of the disorder and risk-factor profiles. DEFINITION AND PREVALENCE According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual/Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), dementia is a decline in memory and other cognitive abilities whereby the decline interferes with daily, social, and occupational functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Other cognitive disturbances include aphasia (especially problems remembering names of people or things), apraxia (impaired physical movements despite intact physical capability), agnosia (trouble identifying objects), and problems with executive functioning (e.g., difficulty with planning or thinking abstractly). Dementia has a number of causes, which makes this complex disorder difficult to diagnose. For diagnosis, it is important to rule out other reasons for cognitive impairment such as delirium, depression, malnutrition, medication side effects, alcohol abuse, and infections. The overall prevalence of dementia in adults aged 65 and older ranges from 1.8 percent to 6.7 percent (Chui, 1998). The prevalence of dementia increases with age, doubling every 5. years until age 95 (Jorm, Korten, and Henderson, 1987). The two most common types of dementia are Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Alzheimer's disease is a brain disorder that impairs multiple areas of cognitive functioning and worsens over time. Onset of the disease is typically insidious, usually beginning with loss of recent memory, then progressively affecting other areas of cognition such as language production and comprehension. The clinical diagnosis typically entails a neurological examination, neuropsychological assessment, evaluation of the course of cognitive and behavioral impairments, neuroimaging, and exclusion of other potential causes of cognitive impairment (Reisberg et al., 1997). Vascular dementia is based on the understanding that cerebrovascular types of diseases like stroke can cause brain injury and lead to cognitive impairment. A diagnosis of vascular dementia requires the following: (i) the presence of dementia, (2) evidence of cerebrovascular disease, and (3) onset of the dementia soon after a vascular event (Roman et al., 1993). Unlike the course of Alzheimer's disease, the course of vascular dementia may not be smoothly progressive but rather may be characterized by plateaus. Researchers have observed ethnic and crossnational differences in the frequency of these types of dementia. In general, overall rates of dementia are similar cross-nationally and crossculturally, but notable differences exist in rates of different subtypes of dementia. For example, in the United States and Northern Europe, Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, followed by vascular dementia (Skoog, 1998), whereas Japan and China have higher rates of vascular dementia, followed by Alzheimer's disease (Joan, iggi; Yoshitake et al., 1995). Within ethnic groups in the United States, African Americans tend to have higher rates of vascular dementia than whites (Yeo, Gallagher-- Thompson, and Lieberman,1996). In addition, mixed dementia (with features of both vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease) may be more common among African Americans than among whites. Some findings suggest that rates of different types of dementia vary by gender. …",

In the assessment of competence, it is important that the person has the ability to make a choice, the ability to give directives, and the ability to do for oneself. Cognitively impaired patients therefore require assistance and protection in legal matters already at an early stage of the disease.",

      "title": "Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)",
      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, encompasses fear and avoidance of social or performance situations, with prominent fear of embarrassment or humiliation (see Box 18–1 for the DSM-5 criteria). The disorder is very common, with a lifetime prevalence of 12% (Ruscio et al. 2008). It typically has onset by teenage years and is often chronic. The scope of feared situations can range from fear of a few specific public performance situations to a more generalized fear of most social situations. In this chapter we review the psychosocial and medication approaches with the strongest evidence base for efficacy in the treatment of SAD. DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder 300.23 F40.10 Marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in which the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. Examples include social interactions (e.g., having a conversation, meeting unfamiliar people), being observed (e.g., eating or drinking), and performing in front of others (e.g., giving a speech). Note: In children, the anxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during interactions with adults. The individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show anxiety symptoms that will be negatively evaluated (i.e., will be humiliating or embarrassing; will lead to rejection or offend others). The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety. Note: In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, clinging, shrinking, or failing to speak in social situations. The social situations are avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation and to the sociocultural context. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder, such as panic disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder. If another medical condition (e.g., Parkinson's disease, obesity, disfigurement from burns or injury) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly unrelated or is excessive. Specify if: Performance only: If the fear is restricted to speaking or performing in public.",

Cognitive enhancers can improve intellectual function and have been approved for Alzheimer’s dementia, dementia of Parkinson’s disease, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Cognitive enhancers are being developed for other cognitive disorders. There are many advantages for development of symptomatic cognitive enhancers compared to disease-modifying agents. Cognitive enhancers typically modulate transmitter systems. Cross-disease phenotypes such as executive function impairment may represent a development strategy for cognitive enhancing agents. Life cycle management strategies for cognitive enhancers include expanding indications to disorders with related pathophysiology or to different stages of disease severity and development of alternate formulations. Cognitive enhancers can restore essential cognitive capability and are a critical element of optimal care of patients with neurologic and psychiatric disorders.",

The person diagnosed with depression is unable to concentrate, to sustained attention and to retrieve information. Speed is also impaired. Those particularities impact on language and communication for persons with depression. There is a link between poor verbal interaction and the flow of ideas. Depressive persons use less words in communication and avoid the use of verbal language. In major depressive disorder, the most frequent depressive disorder, affecting 10-25% of women and 5-12% of men, verbal fluency is impaired. Words repetitions are frequent. This is an indicator for impaired working memory. Concentration is also affected, ideo-verbal disorganization and unstructured sentences are present. Adjectives and negative semantic words are used. Depressive persons prefer more past tense then present tense and future tense is almost absent. They use the ”I” more than persons without depression or in remissions. Language display by depressive persons could be a valid indicator for early and differential diagnosis. This study is a narrative one focus on highlight the language displayed by persons with depressive disorder as a refection of specific cognitive, affective ad perceptual changes.",

In line with the WHO's principle of attending to the consequences of disease as well, speech rehabilitation has to deal not only with aphasia in terms of speech disorder (i.e., impairment) but also with aphasia in terms of communicative ability disorder (i.e., disability) as well as with aphasia in terms of psychosocial interference (i.e., handicap). Current speech therapy orientations can be assigned to these three dimensions and the need for these three levels of approach can be assessed accordingly in light of the course of the condition. Given the speech disorder's frequently limited amenability to therapeutic intervention, a psycholinguistics-communication oriented speech rehabilitation as well as counselling and psychologically focussed measures are increasingly relevant to enable a more appropriate response to reduced communicative independence and ensuing psychosocial handicaps.",

This brain-environment interaction through the auditory input is found to be partial o totally abolished in congenitally deaf children, in whom the lack of early detection and intervention results in an incomplete auditory-neural development and a progressive and permanent hearing and language handicap.\r\nConclusions: Congenital deafness implies an invisible disability whose lack of immediate habilitation drives to permanent hearing and communication sequelae, with consequent not just biological but psychological and social impact.

Like these types of epilepsy, MAE is polygenically determined with little non-genetic variability. The disease is characterized by the following criteria: genetic predisposition (high incidence of seizures and/or genetic EEG patterns in relatives); mostly normal development and no neurological deficits before onset; primarily generalized myoclonic, astatic or myoclonic-astatic seizures, short absences and mostly generalized tonic-clonic seizures; no tonic seizures or tonic drop attacks during daytime (except for some rare cases with a most unfavourable course); generalized EEG patterns (spikes and waves, photosensitivity, 4-7/sec rhythms), no multifocal EEG abnormalities (but often pseudofoci). There is a partial overlap with other 'syndromes', such as benign and severe myoclonic epilepsy in infants (Dravet et al., 1985a, b), myoclonic epilepsy of infancy and early childhood (Aicardi and others). In differential diagnosis the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in its stricter sense has to be considered, and also atypical benign partial epilepsy or pseudo-Lennox syndrome. Discussion is presented of possible pitfalls in the classical syndromic approach to classifying epilepsies of early childhood, and of the advantages of a neurobiological view for understanding the immense variability of clinical manifestations of epilepsy.",

It is usually acquired as a result of stroke, brain tumor, or other brain injury, and results in impairment to the production and/or comprehension of spoken and/or written language. Rehabilitation can reduce the level of impairment and mitigate its impact, but a significant number of individuals are left with a life-long chronic disability that influences a wide range of activities and prevents full re-engagement in life. The long-term impact of aphasia varies across individuals; however, given the importance of language communication in virtually all aspects of daily life, it is not surprising that most, if not all, individuals experience a reduction in their ability to participate in everyday activities, with the result that social isolation and depression are relatively common.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a clinical syndrome diagnosed when three core criteria are met. First, there should be a language impairment (i.e., aphasia) that interferes with the usage or comprehension of words. Second, the neurological work-up should determine that the disease is neurodegenerative, and therefore progressive. Third, the aphasia should arise in relative isolation, without equivalent deficits of comportment or episodic memory. The language impairment can be fluent or non-fluent and may or may not interfere with word comprehension. Memory for recent events is preserved although memory scores obtained in verbally mediated tests may be abnormal. Minor changes in personality and behavior may be present but are not the leading factors that bring the patient to medical attention or that limit daily living activities. This distinctive clinical pattern is most conspicuous in the initial stages of the disease, and reflects a relatively selective atrophy of the language network, usually located in the left hemisphere. There are different clinical variants of PPA, each with a characteristic pattern of atrophy. The underlying neuropathological diseases are heterogeneous and can include Alzheimer's disease as well as frontotemporal lobar degeneration. The clinician's task is to recognize PPA and differentiate it from other neurodegenerative phenotypes, use biomarkers to surmise the nature of the underlying neuropathology, and institute the most fitting multimodal interventions.",

It was found that children in the autistic spectrum have deficits in ToM. One of the suggestions was that unlike autistic people, ToM skills are normally developed in schizophrenia patients, but \"lost\" in the first psychotic episode. The deficit may disappear on remission from the acute phase, as described in some studies. A substantial body of research has highlighted the impaired ToM in schizophrenia. There is good empirical evidence that ToM is specifically impaired in schizophrenia and that many psychotic symptoms--for instance, delusions of alien control and persecution, the presence of thought and language disorganization, and other behavioral symptoms--may best be understood in light of a disturbed capacity in patients to relate their own intentions to executing behavior, and to monitor others' intentions. However, it is still under debate how an impaired ToM in schizophrenia is associated with other aspects of cognition, how the impairment fluctuates with acuity or chronicity of the schizophrenic disorder, and if it is a state or trate marker. The paper reviews the current literature and suggests potential implications and future research areas.",

Their communicative action involves more isolated gestural acts and fewer gestures combined with vocalisation. The inability to imitate speech and gesture is reported, as well as grabbing another person's hand and bringing it to a certain object. The severity of autism symptoms correlates with motor skills. The nonverbal aspect of communication is the main basis of speech. It also manages to facilitate or even enable professionals to establish valid communication with the child. The Augmentative and Alternative Communication System complements the lack of natural communication skills of children with communication deficits. Visual-graphic systems belong to the group of the most widespread and most popular non-technological aids in rehabilitation. The most common image-based system is PECS. Graphic symbols can also be organised in communication books and in the methodological part of this paper I suggest my example. The purpose of the whole methodical procedure and aids that I propose is primarily the development of speech communication.",

Zwar werden als Ursache einiger sprachlicher Störungen Defizite im semantischen Gedächtnis vermutet, hauptverursachend sind jedoch gestörte exekutive Leistungen, die aus einer Dysfunktion der dorsolateralen striato-präfrontalen Schleife und aus Unterbrechungen nicht-dopaminerger subkortiko-frontaler Systeme resultieren. Da die Basalganglien, gemeinsam mit dem Frontalkortex, für die Kontrolle zielgerichteten Verhaltens zuständig sind, zeigen sich bereits früh im Krankheitsverlauf exekutive Störungen, die negative Auswirkungen auf Sprachverarbeitungsprozesse haben. Zu diesen Störungen gehören beeinträchtigte Plausibilitätskontrollen, fehlende Korrekturen, Sprachantriebsstörungen, unzureichende Fokussierung von Gesprächspartnern und thematischer Progression, mangelhafte Inhibition irrelevanter Umweltreize, ungenügende Erfassung der Intentionen des Gesprächspartners sowie defizitäre strategische Abrufprozesse aus dem semantischen und episodischen Langzeitgedächtnis.",

      "title": "Auditory processing disorder: Clinical and international perspective",
      "abstract": "APD may be considered a developmental, hearing or neurological disorder, depending on etiology, but in all cases, it is a listening difficulty without an abnormality of pure tone sensitivity. It has been variously defined as a disorder of the central auditory system associated with impaired spatial hearing, auditory discrimination, temporal processing, and performance with competing or degraded sounds. Clinical testing typically examines perception, intelligibility and ordering of both speech and non-speech sounds. While deficits in higher-order cognitive, communicative, and language functions are excluded in some definitions, recent consensus accepts that these functions may be inseparable from active listening. Some believe that APD in children is predominantly or exclusively cognitive in origin, while others insist that true APD has its origins within the auditory brainstem. However, children or their carers presenting at clinics typically complain of difficulty hearing speech in noise, remembering or understanding instructions, and attending to sounds. APD usually occurs alongside other developmental disorders (e.g., language impairment) and may be indistinguishable from them. Consequently, clinicians are uncertain how to diagnose or manage APD; both test procedures and interventions vary widely, even within a single clinic. Effective remediation primarily consists of improving the listening environment and providing communication devices.",

Among the characteristic traumatic disorders of cognition are slow reaction time and processing of information, poor performance after delay, imprecision of judgments and thinking, inability to use language to retrieve information and solve problems, sensorimotor dysfunctions, and loss of what has been learned up to the time of injury. Cognitive response complexity is created by the interaction between cognition and language, communication, executive functioning, and self-regulation of behavior. Cognition is a generic term referring to a wide range of disparate functions used for assessing information, adaptation, and planning. Effective selective attention, in the presence of distractors, implies allocation of attentional resources to target detection. Since the neurological support for cognition is so anatomically widespread, it is highly susceptible to diffuse axonal injury consequent to impact and acceleration/deceleration trauma.",

      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders of genetic and environmental etiologies. Some ASD cases are syndromic: associated with clinically defined patterns of somatic abnormalities and a neurobehavioral phenotype (e.g., Fragile X syndrome). Many cases, however, are idiopathic or non-syndromic. Such disorders present themselves during the early postnatal period when language, speech, and personality start to develop. ASDs manifest by deficits in social communication and interaction, restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior across multiple contexts, sensory abnormalities across multiple modalities and comorbidities, such as epilepsy among many others. ASDs are disorders of connectivity, as synaptic dysfunction is common to both syndromic and idiopathic forms. While multiple theories have been proposed, particularly in idiopathic ASDs, none address why certain brain areas (e.g., frontotemporal) appear more vulnerable than others or identify factors that may affect phenotypic specificity. In this hypothesis article, we identify possible routes leading to, and the consequences of, altered connectivity and review the evidence of central and peripheral synaptic dysfunction in ASDs. We postulate that phenotypic specificity could arise from aberrant experience-dependent plasticity mechanisms in frontal brain areas and peripheral sensory networks and propose why the vulnerability of these areas could be part of a model to unify preexisting pathophysiological theories.",

      "title": "The importance of social relationships in the process of cognitive ageing",
      "abstract": "Due to ageing populations worldwide, the number of people with cognitive impairments and dementia is increasing rapidly. Insight in the risk factors is crucial in order to develop interventions that prevent or delay the development of the disease. We investigated to what extent social functioning is associated with cognitive decline. Three stages of cognitive decline are considered, including subjective memory complaints, cognitive decline and dementia. The findings in this PhD thesis show that multiple aspects of social functioning are associated with different stages of cognitive decline. Better feelings of affection and behavioral confirmation protect against the development of subjective memory complaints and contribute to the recovery thereof. In addition, people recovered more often from subjective memory complaints if they were in a relationship, had a larger family composition, and had better feelings of status. Poor social relationships were also associated with cognitive decline. This was found for both the structure (e.g. small social network or low frequency of social contact), and the function (e.g. low social support and feelings of loneliness) of social relations. Particularly a lack of social interaction is associated with incident dementia. This effect is of comparable strength as other well-established risk factors for dementia, such as physical inactivity, smoking, and depression. It is well-known that non-smoking, a healthy diet and physical activity reduce the risk of cognitive decline. Our findings show that better social functioning should be added to this list. This is an important fact for GPs, geriatricians or policymakers who may still wonder whether promoting social interaction could be beneficial. We therefore advocate that more attention is paid to social functioning in the prevention of dementia.",

      "title": "Recognition of Emotional Facial Expressions in Alexithymia",
      "abstract": "The term Alexithymia (from Greek: lack of words for emotions), refers to a specific disturbance in affective-emotional processing that is manifested through following salient features: 1) difficulty in identifying and describing feelings and emotions verbally, 2) difficulty in distinguishing between feelings and somatic sensations that accompany emotional arousal, and 3) externally-oriented thinking and impaired symbolic activity (Taylor & Bagby, 2004). The most recent research has stressed point that in alexithymia there is not only a difficulty in expressing emotions verbally but also a deficit in cognitive processing of emotions (Berenbaum & Prince, 1994; Jessimer & Markham, 1997; Lundh & Simonsson-Sarnecki, 2002; Parker, Taylor, & Bagby, 1993; Roedema & Simons, 1999; Suslow, 1998; Suslow & Junghanns, 2002); as a consequence, emotions remain undifferentiated and poorly regulated (Taylor, Bagby, & Parker, 1991) and those afflicted are more likely to misinterpret their emotions as being symptoms of illness (Taylor & Bagby, 2004).First studied in classical psychosomatic or somatic disorders, alexithymia is known today as a personality trait (Martinez-Sanchez, Ato, Corcoles, Huedo, & Selva, 1998; MartinezSanchez, Ato, & Ortiz, 2003), normally distributed in general population with significantly higher levels in male subjects (Franz et al., 2008; Schimmenti, 2016). A high level of alexithymia is considered as a possible vulnerability factor for a variety of psychiatric disorders and physical illnesses (Taylor, Bagby, & Parker, 1997), such as substance use disorders, somatization, anxiety and depression, and even schizophrenia (Lumley, Neely, & Burger, 2007).Alexithymics appear to be less able to recognize their emotion signals and regulate emotions effectively (Taylor et al., 1997). Several studies demonstrated that alexithymic individuals are impaired in their ability to recognize emotion when both stimulus and response are non-verbal, suggesting that alexithymia, the lack of words for emotion, is not just a verbal phenomenon. Several authors hypothesized that hampered regulation of emotion in alexithymia might be based on deficits in perception and further processing of emotional stimuli (Aleman, 2005; Martinez-Sanchez, Montero, & de la Cerra, 2002; Lane, Sechrest, Reidel, Shapiro, & Kaszniak, 2000). This statement has been empirically supported by imaging data (Kano et al., 2003; Mantani, Okamoto, Shirao, Okada, & Yamawaki, 2005; Moriguchi et al., 2006) and event-related potentials (Pollatos & Gramann, 2011).One of most fruitful areas of investigation that has occupied investigation of alexithymia is study of patterns of recognition of facial expressions of emotion. It is well established that facial emotion recognition has an important place in emotion regulation, interpersonal communication skills, and in development of psycho-pathologies (Ozturk, Kilic, Deveci, & Kirpinar, 2016).In this line, previous studies have shown a significant correlation between alexithymia and a lack of ability to recognize emotions in photographs of facial expressions (Allerdings, 1997; Lane et al., 1996, 2000; Mann, Wise, Trinidad, & Kohanski, 1994; McDonald & Prkachin, 1990; Pandey & Mandal, 1997; Parker et al., 1993; Parker, Prkachin, & Prkachin, 2005; Prkachin, Casey, & Prkachin, 2009). These deficits have been found with tasks in which participants were required to reply in a very short period of time (Pedrosa et al., 2009), as well as in those with masked stimuli to make it difficult to recognize them (Kugel et al., 2008; Reker et al., 2010), and with static emotional stimuli, such as FACS, and dynamic videos (Katsyri, Saalasti, Tiippana, von Wendt, & Sams, 2008; Ridout, Thomas, & Wallis, 2010) (for a review, see Grynberg et al., 2012).Despite interest in studying relationship between alexithymia and emotion recognition, there are only a few studies addressing role of alexithymia in facial recognition tasks with parts of face, such as work of Swart, Kortekaas, and Aleman (2009) and Schimmenti (2016). …",

      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder is a group of neurodegenerative disorders that is caused by a physiological disorder of the brain which represents a change in its shape and structure and is characterized by difficulties with social interaction &amp; communication and by restricted &amp; repetitive behavior. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) presents with behavioral characteristics that can occur in the early developmental stages of individuals. Autism symptoms appear in the majority of children between the ages of 12 and 18 months. Early indicators of autism include challenges faced by the individual in making eye contact, being unresponsive to his or her name, having difficulty following another person's gaze or in pointing a finger to an item and having poor imitation with nonverbal communication issues. Because most parents are unaware of these \"early\" indicators of autism, majority of the children with autism do not receive a diagnosis until they reach the age of 3. Dental issues such as bruxism, non-nutritive chewing, tongue thrusting, masochistic behaviors, erosion, xerostomia, dental caries, gingival disorders and delayed tooth eruption are common in children with ASD. These children present with an unusual response to stimuli making it difficult for the parents/caretakers to maintain their child's oral hygiene and poses a challenge for dentists to operate on the child. Therefore, it is important to prevent or intervene in any kind of dental disease at an early stage. The current review article focuses on children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and the oral hygiene concerns they face, as well as describes the various therapy options for these individuals.",

      "title": "Eating and swallowing disorders in children with cerebral palsy",
      "abstract": "Introduction. Cerebral palsy is characterized by abnormalities of muscle tone, movement and motor abilities caused by disorders in brain development. Many children with cerebral palsy have severe swallowing problems. Cerebral Palsy. Cerebral palsy is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by abnormalities in brain development. Swallowing is a process by which a bolus that is formed within the oral cavity is transported through the pharynx into the esophagus and stomach. It has four phases: preparatory oral, oral, pharyngeal and esophageal. Swallowing disorders in children with cerebral palsy. Swallowing disorders vary depending on the type of cerebral palsy. Children with spastic paralysis have a more pronounced disorder of the voluntary phases of swallowing, while children with athetoid paralysis are expected to have a disorder at the oral-motor level. Neurological lesions may affect the muscle function of the jaw, cheeks, lips, tongue, palate and pharynx, which is manifested by difficulties in controlling saliva and swallowing. Diagnosis and treatment of dysphagia in cerebral palsy. Diagnosis and treatment of dysphagia is best accomplished by a team of experts including a pediatrician, neurologist, otorhinolaryngologist, gastroenterologist, radiologist, dental specialist, speech therapist, nutritionist, and a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation. Conclusion. Dysphagia is a common comorbidity in children with cerebral palsy. Although swallowing disorders often correlate with the type of cerebral palsy, the most prevalent signs of dysphagia include: coughing, prolonged feeding time, laryngotracheal penetration and aspiration, suffocation, which leads to dehydration, malnutrition, but also to the need for alternative feeding methods. It is important to emphasize the importance of early treatment by a team of experts, with a speech therapist as a team leader.",

      "title": "[Dangerous practices and games at school].",
      "abstract": "Dangerous practices and games at school. Three separate categories of dangerous games can be distinguished. The non-oxygenating or fainting games, which consist of mechanical compressions or strangulative mechanisms. These are performed in the search of pseudo-hallucinogenic sensations. There are several such games: from the simple but non-the-less dangerous \"tomato game\", performed by younger children (from 3-4 years of age), to the \"choking game\", between 7 and 14 years of age. \"Aggressive\" or \"violent\" games which use physical and psychological violence from a group of people towards a single individual. Acute neurological complications can be the consequence of such games, and their degree depends on the duration and intensity of the strangulation. These can vary from cerebral edema, loss of consciousness, long term cerebral damage (deafness, blindness, bedridden), irreversible coma and death. Physical consequences of aggressive games are equally important, such as vertebral fractures, cranial trauma, organ rupture. Victims of violence present repeated psycho-traumatic manifestations. Preventive messages associate information on the risks of such games with civic education (listening, solidarity and trust in others), the development of psychological and social skills, an active involvement in school-life and concrete responsibility taking. Early identification of symptoms of these practices by family members and professionals helps to avoid their repetition and increased danger, even addictive patterns.Pratiques et jeux dangereux en milieu scolaire. Les pratiques dangereuses en cour d’école sont multiples. Les jeux dits de non-oxygénation ou d’évanouissement consistent, par un mécanisme de compression ou de strangulation, à rechercher certaines sensations pseudo-hallucinatoires. Les jeux dits d’agression ou jeux violents utilisent la violence physique ou psychologique de manière gratuite d’un groupe de jeunes envers une personne seule. Leur caractère répétitif dans le temps définit le harcèlement. La durée et l’intensité de la strangulation peuvent induire des complications neurologiques aiguës (oedème cérébral, perte de connaissance prolongée), des lésions cérébrales définitives (surdité, cécité, état grabataire), un coma irréversible, le décès. Les conséquences physiques des jeux d’agression sont très lourdes : fractures de la colonne vertébrale, traumatismes crâniens, ruptures d’organes. Les enfants victimes ont des manifestations psychotraumatiques répétées. Les messages de prévention associent, outre une information sur les risques, une éducation à la citoyenneté (écoute, cohésion, solidarité, confiance en l’autre), le développement de compétences psychologiques et sociales de l’enfant, une implication active du jeune dans la vie scolaire et la prise de responsabilités concrètes. Le repérage par les familles et les professionnels de symptômes chroniques évocateurs de ces pratiques permet d’éviter leur répétition et leur dangerosité encore accrue, voire un passage à l’addiction.",

      "abstract": "Vocal cord paralysis is a voice disorder when one or both vocal cords do not open or close correctly. In most cases, no underlying cause for the condition can be found. Symptoms of vocal cord paralysis include changes in the voice, such as hoarseness or a breathy voice, ineffective coughing, pain in the throat when speaking, dysphagia, sore throat, aspiration, etc. In Ayurveda, it can be correlated with Swarakshaya based on clinical presentations. It is a condition where voice alteration is brought about, as seen during speech and announcing with high or low pitch, inaudible or distinct sound. Due to various Nidana like Athyuchabhashana (speak in a loud voice), Abhighata (injury), Soka (grief), etc., the aggravated Dosha invades and localizes in the Sabdavahisira (vocal cords) and leads to changes in the functions of the voice box and causing Swarakshaya. Here, a case report of 32- a 32-year-old female presenting with symptoms of difficulty speaking and a low-pitched voice, diagnosed with vocal cord paralysis with respect to Swarakshaya, is narrated. The patient underwent Panchakarma procedures like Nasya for 7 days with Yashtimadhu taila, followed by ksheera dhooma, Gandoosha with Yashtimadhu taila and selected Samana medicines (Jivantyadi gritha). The study shows a satisfactory outcome, particularly in the quality and loudness of voice.",

      "title": "Measuring the Written Language Disorder among Students with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder",
      "abstract": "Background: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a mental health disorder. People diagnosed with ADHD are often inattentive (have difficulty focusing on a task for a considerable period), overly impulsive (make rash decisions), and are hyperactive (move excessively, often at inappropriate times). ADHD is often diagnosed through psychiatric assessments with additional input from physical/neurological evaluations. Written Language Disorder (WLD) is a learning disorder. People diagnosed with WLD often make multiple spelling, grammar, and punctuation mistakes, have sentences that lack cohesion and topic flow, and have trouble completing written assignments. Typically, WLD is also diagnosed through psychological educational assessments with additional input from physical/neurological evaluation. Literature Review: Previous research has shown a link between ADHD and writing difficulties. Students with ADHD have an increased likelihood of having writing difficulties, and rarely is there a presence of writing difficulties without ADHD or another mental health disorder. However, the presence of writing difficulties does not necessarily indicate the presence of a WLD. There are other physical and behavioral factors of ADHD that can contribute to a student having a WLD as well. Therefore, a statistical association between these factors (in conjunction with written performance) and WLD must first be established. Research Question: To determine the statistical association between WLD and physical and behavioral aspects of ADHD that indicate writing difficulties, this research reviewed methodologies from the literature pertaining to contemporary diagnoses of writing difficulties in ADHD students, and reveal diagnostic methods that explicitly associate the presence of WLD with these writing difficulties among students with ADHD. The results demonstrate the association between writing difficulties and WLD as it pertains to ADHD students using an integrated computational model employed on data from a systematic review. These results will be validated in a future study that will employ the integrated computational model to measure WLD among students with ADHD. Methodology: To measure the association of WLD among students with ADHD, the authors created a novel computational model that integrates the outcomes of common screening methods for WLD (physical questionnaire, behavioral questionnaire, and written performance tasks) with common screening methods for ADHD (physical questionnaire, behavioral questionnaire, adult self-reporting scales, and reaction-based continuous performance tasks (CPTs)). The outcomes of these screening methods were fed into an artificial neural network (ANN ) first, to ‘artificially learn’ about measuring the prevalence of WLD among ADHD students and second, to adjust the prevalence value based on information from different screening methods. This can be considered as the priming of the ANN. The ANN model was then tested with data from previous studies about ADHD students who had writing difficulties. The ANN model was also tested with data from students without ADHD or WLD, to serve as control. Results: The results show that physical, behavioral, and written performance attributes of ADHD students have a high correlation with WLD (r = 0.72 to 0.80) in comparison to control students (r = 0.30 to 0.20), substantiating the link between WLD and ADHD. It should be noted that due to lack of female participation, most studies in the literature only employed and reported on the relationship between WLD and ADHD for male participants. Discussion and Conclusion: By testing ADHD students and control students against the WLD criteria, the study shows a strong correlation between WLD and ADHD. There are limitations to the results’ accuracy in terms of a) sample size (average n=88, mean age = 19, 8 studies used for a meta-analysis), b) analysis (original study reviewing ADHD factors first, WLD factors second), and c) causation (the study only reviews prevalence of WLD in ADHD students, not causation). A clinical trial will validate the data and address some of these limitations in a future phase of the research. A computational causal model will be introduced in the discussion portion to illustrate how causation between writing metrics and WLD as it pertains to ADHD can be achieved. These results open the door to advancing pedagogical techniques in education, where students afflicted with ADHD and/or WLD could not only receive assistance for the behavioral aspects of their disorder, but also expect assistance for the learning aspects of their disorder, empowering them to succeed in their studies.",

      "abstract": "Ménière's disease (MD) is a clinical condition defined by spontaneous vertigo attacks (each lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours) with documented low- to midfrequency sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear before, during, or after one of the episodes of vertigo. It also presents with fluctuating aural symptoms (hearing loss, tinnitus, or ear fullness) in the affected ear. The underlying etiology of MD is not completely clear, yet it has been associated with inner ear fluid volume increases, culminating in episodic ear symptoms (vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness). Physical examination findings are often unremarkable, and audiometric testing may or may not show low- to midfrequency sensorineural hearing loss. Imaging, if performed, is also typically normal. The goals of MD treatment are to prevent or reduce vertigo severity and frequency; relieve or prevent hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness; and improve quality of life. Treatment approaches to MD are many, and approaches typically include modifications of lifestyle factors (eg, diet) and medical, surgical, or a combination of therapies.The primary purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to improve the quality of the diagnostic workup and treatment outcomes of MD. To achieve this purpose, the goals of this guideline are to use the best available published scientific and/or clinical evidence to enhance diagnostic accuracy and appropriate therapeutic interventions (medical and surgical) while reducing unindicated diagnostic testing and/or imaging.",

      "title": "Sensory Integration Therapies for Children With Developmental and Behavioral Disorders",
      "abstract": "Sensory-based therapies are increasingly used by occupational therapists and sometimes by other types of therapists in treatment of children with developmental and behavioral disorders. Sensory-based therapies involve activities that are believed to organize the sensory system by providing vestibular, proprioceptive, auditory, and tactile inputs. Brushes, swings, balls, and other specially designed therapeutic or recreational equipment are used to provide these inputs. However, it is unclear whether children who present with sensory-based problems have an actual \"disorder\" of the sensory pathways of the brain or whether these deficits are characteristics associated with other developmental and behavioral disorders. Because there is no universally accepted framework for diagnosis, sensory processing disorder generally should not be diagnosed. Other developmental and behavioral disorders must always be considered, and a thorough evaluation should be completed. Difficulty tolerating or processing sensory information is a characteristic that may be seen in many developmental behavioral disorders, including autism spectrum disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, developmental coordination disorders, and childhood anxiety disorders. Occupational therapy with the use of sensory-based therapies may be acceptable as one of the components of a comprehensive treatment plan. However, parents should be informed that the amount of research regarding the effectiveness of sensory integration therapy is limited and inconclusive. Important roles for pediatricians and other clinicians may include discussing these limitations with parents, talking with families about a trial period of sensory integration therapy, and teaching families how to evaluate the effectiveness of a therapy.",

      "abstract": "Hearing loss gives rise to a number of disabilities. Problems in recognizing speech, especially in difficult environments, give rise to the largest number of complaints. Other kinds of disabilities may concern the reduced ability to detect, identify and localize sounds quickly and reliably. Such sounds may be warning or alarm signals, as well as music and birds singing. The communicative disability affects both hearing-impaired people and other people in their environment--family members, fellow workers, etc. Hearing-impaired people are not always aware of all the consequences of the impairment; they do not always know what they are missing. Several studies have shown that uncorrected hearing loss gives rise to poorer quality of life, related to isolation, reduced social activity, and a feeling of being excluded, leading to an increased prevalence of symptoms of depression. These findings indicate the importance of early identification of hearing loss and offers of rehabilitative support, where the fitting of hearing aids is usually an important component. Several studies also point to a significant correlation between hearing loss and loss of cognitive functions. Most of these studies show such a correlation without being able to show whether the hearing loss caused the reduction in cognitive performance or if both the hearing loss and the cognitive decline are parts of a common, general age-related degeneration. A couple of these studies, however, indicate that the uncorrected hearing loss may be the cause of cognitive decline. Whichever alternative is true, the correlation should be seen as a clear indication for early hearing aid fitting for those needing it. Monaural hearing aid fitting in subjects with bilateral hearing loss may give rise to a reduced ability to recognize speech presented to the unaided ear, the so-called late-onset auditory deprivation effect. This functional decline is reversible in some but not all subjects after fitting of a hearing aid also on the previously unaided ear.",

The total symptom complex suggests that there is an underlying neuropathology<sup>2</sup>which leads to periodic overloading and underloading of the central nervous system. These alternating states of excessive facilitation and inhibition vary the child's awareness and response to the same stimuli and causes what we have termed perceptual inconstancy.",

      "title": "Efficacy of Cognitive Remediation in EpilepsyEfficacy of Cognitive Remediation in Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONEpilepsy is a neurological disorder affecting 1% of the total population worldwide. In India, the prevalence rate is 5.59 per thousand (Bharucha, 2003). Epilepsy or seizure can be defined as occasional, sudden, excessive rapid and local discharges of grey matter (Jackson, 1873). The clinical manifestation of epilepsy is synapse, drying of mouth, nausea, blurring of vision. The basic mechanism of epilepsy is due to many cellular changes in membrane conductance and neurotransmitter alterations affecting the neuronal interaction.Cognitive deficits are seen in areas of attention, memory and executive functioning. Behavioural and personality disturbances are also present.(Benett, 1992). Circumstantialities are seen in both spoken and written language. Slowness in thinking, poor abstraction and calculation ability are other cognitive deficits seen in epileptic patients. The nature and extent of cognitive deficits depend on seizure type, frequency, age of onset, duration of disorder and the etiology (Benett, 1992).Restoration and reestablishment are the techniques employed for cognitive remediation. Along with it compensatory techniques are also employed. Neuropsychological remediation is used for correcting different facets of cognitive deficits like attention, memory, executive functioning. They have been attempted at hyper-active children, alcoholics and people with psychiatric decomposition.AIMThe aim of the study was to develop and test the efficacy of cognitive remedial measures.HYPOTHESISThere will be significant difference in the pre and post therapy cognitive scores in the various tests.METHODOLOGYDESIGN OF THE STUDYSamplingThe purposive sampling method was taken to collect the sample. Patients fulfilling the criteria of the study were contacted. The sample size was 46 out of which after the elimination of the drop outs the sample size remained 30. The inclusion and exclusion for the sample size is as under:^ Inclusion criteria.^ Age between 18 and 45.^ Subjects having primary education.^ Persons having normal vision and hearing.^ On regular medication.^ Exclusion criteria:^ Subjects with any psychiatric and neurological illness.^ Mental retardation as assessed clinically.^ History of alcohol abuse.^ Symptomatic epilepsy.ProcedureThe sample was taken from two major hospitals and the criteria of local was kept in mind so that commuting won't be a problem for the patients especially the treatment group. The patients who had consented for the cognitive remediation programme were included in the treatment group and the patients who were ready to come for 2-3 times were in the control group.The patients were psycho educated about the research and the benefits after their participation in the study.Pre therapy assessment:The number of tests administered were -1.

      "abstract": "Social cognition (SC) refers to the high cognitive processes involved in social interactions. SC is a complex concept that includes several abilities such as emotion perception, theory of mind, and communication. Impairments of SC, frequently observed after acquired brain injury (ABI, traumatic brain injury (TBI) or stroke), could result in behavioral problems. Impairments of SC, known to be among the most devastating consequences of ABI (especially TBI), are even more strongly associated with problems in daily life functioning and unfavorable social outcome than cognitive deficits. The relatives of patients with ABI describe frequent changes in behavior and personality including disinterest or dislike of others, self-centeredness, lack of empathy, unreasonable or inappropriate behavior, poor self-monitoring, apathy, difficulties in following the rules of social interaction, disorganized language output, and poor conversation. In many cases, these disabilities are not overcome, but instead tend to get worse. However, objective neuropsychological assessment of SC impairments is still difficult because of the lack of appropriate measures, and their rehabilitation is little developed. The goal of the present study is to present a rehabilitation protocol aimed at improving the three aspects of SC (emotion perception, communication and theory of mind). This protocol is composed of seven group sessions that combine analytical and ecological techniques. We use the group as a tool to create social interactions, the feedbacks of the peers contributing to the development of SC insight in patients with ABI. The protocol could still be improved by using video, individual “coaching” sessions to increase awareness, and by involving relatives. For the last points, we plan to offer therapeutic education workshops for patients and their relatives to enhance understanding of the concept of SC, promote awareness, and to better integrate caregivers.",

Except for the fluency issues, stuttering can include secondary behaviors: unusual facial or body movements, blinking or grimacing. Stuttering often includes speaker's negative communication attitudes which can lead to decreased self – esteem or developing anxiety. Communication attitudes are often neglected as they represent deeper aspects of stuttering, unlike speech disfluencies.\r\n The purpose od this paper is to give review of recent literature regarding speaker's communication attitudes, relationship between anxiety and stuttering and the realtionship between communication attitudes and therapy. Communication attitudes should be assesed during speech and langugage assesment. If there is need, they should be included in therapy. If anxienty is present, psychological therapy is also needed to make sure the results of therapy are optimal. The realtionship between anxiety and stuttering needs to be explored, since anxiety is a very complex construct. Stuttering therapy can lead to decreasing negative communication attitudes, however, the duration of the retention of the positive results is currently unknown. There is a need to conduct more research including more participants and clear methodology in this field.",

      "abstract": "There is often difficulty differentiating between psychosomatic, somatopsychic, multisystem illness, and different degrees of medical uncertainty. Uncommon, complex, and multisystem diseases are commonly misdiagnosed. Two case histories are described, and relevant terms differentiating psychosomatic, somatopsychic, and multisystem illnesses are identified, reviewed, and discussed. Adequate differentiation requires an understanding of the mind/body connection, which includes knowledge of general medicine, psychiatry, and the systems linking the body and the brain. A psychiatric diagnosis cannot be given solely based upon the absence of physical, laboratory, or pathological findings. Medically unexplained symptoms, somatoform disorder, and compensation neurosis are outdated and/or inaccurate terms. The terms subjective, nonspecific, and vague can be used inaccurately. Conversion disorders, functional disorders, psychogenic illness, factitious disorder imposed upon another (Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy), somatic symptom disorder, psychogenic seizures, psychogenic pain, psychogenic fatigue, and delusional parasitosis can be over-diagnosed. Bodily distress disorder and bodily distress syndrome are scientifically unsupported and inaccurate. Many “all in your head” conditions may be related to the microbiome and the immune system. Better education concerning the interface between medicine and psychiatry and the associated diagnostic nomenclature as well as utilizing clinical judgment and thorough assessment, exercising humility, and maintaining our roots in traditional medicine will help to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient trust.",

      "title": "Prevention and diagnosis of neuropathy during dental treatment",
      "abstract": "Peripheral nerves are often subjected to various forces such as surgical invasion, trauma, disease infiltration, and drug action. These attacks cause the peripheral nerve fibers to be pulled, pressed, damaged, or ruptured, resulting in a decline in peripheral function or loss of function. This symptom is often expressed in various ways such as numbness, palsy, paralysis, neuropathy, and nerve abnormality. Paralysis in the oral and facial areas includes motor palsy associated with efferent peripheral neuropathy such as the facial and hypoglossal nerves and sensory palsy associated with afferent peripheral neuropathy such as the inferior alveolar nerve and the lingual nerve. In addition, dysgeusia, taste disorders, dysfunction of autonomic nerves, and autonomic neuropathy may occur in the oral cavity and the facial region as one of paralysis. If these symptoms or disorders recover within days to weeks, it is temporary loss of motor and sensory function due to blockage of nerve conduction, and the diagnosis is neurapraxia. On the other hand, if the symptoms of paralysis persist and the aftereffects remain, or if the function does not recover at all, it can be diagnosed as axonotmesis or neurotmesis. Paralysis is exceedingly difficult to diagnose the prognosis and degree of disability only by the initial symptoms. In particular, the sensory function is more difficult to evaluate than the motor function because the sensory cannot be visualized, and therefore the diagnostic criteria cannot be determined, and inaccurate diagnosis causes confusion in the course of treatment. As a result, despite the definitive diagnosis being Neurapraxia, there is the possibility of giving unnecessary medication, surgical treatment, or wrong physical therapy. Not only that, but for axonotmesis and neurotmesis, which must be treated early, there is a possibility that the start of treatment will be delayed. A quantitative and objective, reproducible and accurate diagnosis is needed to determine the prognosis of paralysis and to make treatment decisions. Accurately grasping the cause of external force applied to the peripheral nerves and the timing of damage, it is possible to cure peripheral functions if the amount and duration of drug therapy and physical therapy and the timing of surgical treatment can be correctly determined. The purpose of this review is to explore preventive and diagnostic methods for peripheral neuropathy during dental treatment. Therefore, we considered the need for a Precision tactile function test for painful trigeminal neuropathy and neuropathic pain, considering the time to fix the symptoms of neuropathy. In addition, we discussed the treatment experience of hyperalgesia and allodynia caused by disorders of the somatosensory nervous system.",

Studies of CP in relation to birth weight (BW) and gestational age (GA) estimate that infants of very low birth weight (VLBW); i.e., of BW less than 1500 g, or very immature infants; i.e., with GA less than 32 weeks, are between 40 and 100 times more likely to have CP than normal BW infants or infants born at term [1, 2]. No other disability associated with preterm birth, such as learning impairments, mental retardation, behavioral problems or sensorineural deficits, shows such a high difference in prevalence in relation to birth at term or normal BW. This means that CP following preterm birth, or brain compromise affecting the motor system, is probably related to a pathomechanism specifically affecting the immature brain, which stresses the importance of gaining insight into the following questions:",

      "title": "The three aspects of malady.",
      "abstract": "The English language has the luxury of having four different words that describe deficient health states: disease, illness, sickness, and malady. Malady is a term that is not used very often and it does not have a specific denotation: the other three terms do. It is customary to use the word disease in a medical sense, referring to the medical definition of a condition that negatively affects the functioning of an individual. The medical definition will include references to laboratory findings and to the (diminished) performance of different body systems. Usually, the definition of a disease will include notions about causative and risk factors, ideas about the way in which the pathological processes develop, statements about the prognosis, and reactions to different treatments.\r\n\r\nThe word illness is used to describe what persons feel about themselves. They describe their feelings in various ways, sometimes referring to a particular organ (in France, the liver is often seen as being at the bottom of things, the reason for feeling ill; the Slavs use the same word for life and the stomach and complain about its malfunction, Iranians and others refer to their heart, and so on). Sometimes, when feeling ill, patients are uncertain what words to use to describe their state and will choose words that they feel attract the attention of their doctor or their family. Thus, when seeking help from doctors, they will refer to pain in organs and when speaking to their family they will talk about functioning, complain of being tired, unable to do things, and so forth.\r\n\r\nSickness is a word describing yet another aspect of not being in good health. It refers to the societal recognition of the state of illness. Societies recognize certain states of dysfunction and disease as being sufficiently important to be given sickness benefits that include the permission to be absent from work, reimbursement for expenses incurred in the process of treatment and possibly other support.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the three terms do not cover the same territory. They overlap to an extent that will vary from country to country and from one social group to another. Some people who have a disease do not feel ill. Some of those who feel ill or even very ill do not seem to have any physical reason for it, no tissue damage, no dysfunction in the main body systems. Sometimes, sickness will cover people who are neither diseased nor feel ill: such was the case with the psychiatric treatment of dissidents. In some instances people have a disease that is not being recognized by society as being sufficiently important to receive sickness benefits.\r\n\r\nA number of questions arise from this conundrum. Should people who say that they are feeling ill without having any demonstrable tissue damage be considered as malingerers? Should we try to discover an untreatable disease in people who do not feel ill? What should be done to assess needs for care – count the numbers of people who feel ill (and will come forward to seek help), or count those who have a medically diagnosable disease regardless of how they feel? Or define needs on the basis of epidemiological studies that define a case in accordance with the official definition of sickness? And how should we evaluate the success of a health service – by establishing whether the population is satisfied (because those who feel ill have received help)? Or should we be considering that a service is successful if all the people who have a disease have been reached regardless of whether they need or want any help from the health service system?\r\n\r\nThere are conditions that would be considered a sickness by society, a disease by the medical profession and an illness by those who suffer from them. Their number, however, is not all that large as one would think and for conditions that do not fall into this group the questions listed above (and many others) will arise. There is no strict rule that could be followed to answer them nor is it possible to reject any of the three definitions. It is therefore necessary that physicians and public health decision makers remain aware of the three aspects (and territories) of maladies with which they are dealing even if that complicates their life and their actions. Such is the world in which we live.",

      "abstract": "Specifically, some studies show that FAE effects are greater or categorically different when alcohol exposure occurs in early development, or the first trimester for a mother, rather than in later development (Muralidharan et al., 2013).High alcohol consumption over all three trimesters correlated with the greatest possibility of developing a FAE disorder (May et al., 2013).Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), a more severe FAE disorder, results from heavy alcohol use while pregnant.Standard diagnostic criteria of FAS include appearance of a smooth philtrum (medial cleft in the upper lip), thin upper lip, small eyes, growth deficiency and functional central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities (Bertrand et al., 2004).Additional side effects include microcephaly, flattened nose, and learning disabilities.Behaviorally, people with FAS show hyperactivity, cognitive impairment, slower development than their peers, social behavior deficits, and abnormal emotional processing (Fernandes et al., 2015).While the physiological, behavioral, and neurological defects range in severity, they have lifelong implications such as attention problems, poor arithmetic skills, and trouble understanding social cues (Fernandes et al., 2015).Most FAE experiments examine the effects of moderate to heavy alcohol exposure on the fetus (Valenzuela et al., 2012).Fewer studies examine the effects of lower levels of alcohol consumption on development and behavior.In fact, one study suggested that low amounts of fetal ethanol exposure are tolerable, because the body can dispose of toxins, and changes in somatic growth were seen only when exposure reached a minimum threshold dose (Jacobson",

This chapter will review definitions as they apply to disability, impairments reported in fibromyalgia patients, and constructive approaches that allow individuals with the syndrome to work most effectively. The World Health Organization defines disability as a limitation of function that compromises the ability to perform an activity within a range considered normal. Efforts to manage work disabilities consider issues such as age, sex, level of education, psychological profile, past attainments, motivation, retraining prospects, and social support systems. Additionally, work disability issues take into account work-related self-esteem, motivation, stress, fatigue, personal value systems, and availability of financial compensation. An impairment is an anatomic, physiologic, or psychological loss that leads to disability. Impairments include pain from work activities (e.g., heavy lifting), emotional stress (e.g., working in a complaint department), or muscle dysfunction (e.g., cerebral palsy).",

      "title": "Factors Associated with Outcome in Extremity Surgery",
      "abstract": "Musculoskeletal diseases can heavily influence a patient’s life due to their inherit impact on ability/capability. Ability/Activity/capability is defined by The World Health Organization (WHO), as a multilayered concept that involves a dynamic interaction between body functions and structures, health conditions (disorders or disease), ability to participate, environmental factors and personal factors. Lack of capability due to a musculoskeletal injury or illness can result in reduced mobility, independence and quality of life. Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) are used to quantify symptom intensity and magnitude of activity intolerance (i.e. ability/capability/disability ). Considerable variation exists in both PROMS and the subjective experience of musculoskeletal diseases. A great portion of this variation is explained by mental health (psychological distress, cognitive bias [misconceptions] regarding pain) and social health, rather than objectifiable measures such as radiographs. While negative thoughts, misconceptions and a lacking support system can influence capability negatively, strong social support, days full of meaning, purpose and structure, a hopeful and curious mindset, and healthy thoughts/coping mechanisms, help people manage adversity and will help them adapt and build resiliency. Patients seeking care want to be helped, people with impairments want to be understood. For clinicians seeking to aid their patients on the road to recovery it is important to understand what factors drive the very questions patients came to visit them with. Patients are more than just their symptoms, objectified by the biomedical measures of illness, they are influenced by the entire paradigm of biomedical, psychological and social factors.",

      "title": "Dysphasia after stroke and legal capacity",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Although after stroke dysphasia or aphasia is not equal to incapacity, the legal capacity of patients can be doubted. The patients’ ability to fully comprehend the given information and make decisions may be impaired. Stroke is sudden, life threatening and likely to affect capacity even in the absence of dysphasia. There are currently no published guidelines in the management of legal issues for patients and professionals. Method A literature review in the Pubmed database has been made, using the key‐words: stroke, legal capacity, decision‐making Result Brain injury after stroke may impair appreciation of decisions’ consequences and/or communicating decisions effectively, while the capacity to reason remains. Stroke may affect various brain areas, i.e. prefrontal cortex involved in decision‐making (ventromedial prefrontal cortex damage may lead to impulsive decision‐making). A right‐brain stroke may cause poor executive function, lack of initiation or neglect. Left‐hemisphere strokes may lead to aphasia and reduced capacity evaluation. The dysphasic may understand more than he can express, or vice versa. Difficulties further compounding communication problems include: reading and writing; numeracy; inattention/concentration; fatigue; emotional control (lability); perseveration; intellectual functioning. Receptive aphasia can impair understanding medical options, while expressive aphasia may prevent communicating relative decisions. Patients may also be susceptible to undue influence regarding testamentary and financial capacity due to communication deficits and varying levels of dependence. Depression following stroke can further impair capacity. Conclusion The patient may have a communication rather than a capacity deficit. Judging a patient’s ability to weigh information is often the most difficult aspect of legal capacity assessment. There is little literature or high court jurisdiction regarding whether dysphasia after stroke impairs patients’ capacity. Evaluation of the prerequisites for legal capacity requires a multi‐professional cooperation.",

The development of gross motor functions, such as head control, sitting, and walking is likely to be delayed, but fine motor function is usually preserved unless disorders of the central nervous system are present. These children can eventually catch up with their normal peers in terms of development and growth as a result of central vestibular compensation. The visual and somatosensory systems, pyramidal and extrapyramidal motor system (cerebellum, basal ganglia, cerebrum) and intellectual development, compensate for vestibular failure in infants and children with congenitally hypoactive or absent function of the semicircular canals and otolith organs.",

      "abstract": "Theory of mind impairments is seen in various neurodevelopmental disorders. Neurodevelopmental disorders are impairments of the growth and development of the brain or central nervous system. This also refers to the disorder of brain function that affects emotion, self-control, learning ability, and memory and that unfolds as the individual grows. India faces a great burden of neurodevelopmental disorders due to dual challenge of genetic and acquired disease burden posed by nutritional, infectious, toxic, and traumatic insults. Various neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, developmental language disorders as well as acquired disorders of the right brain (and traumatic brain injury) impair Theory of mind. Theory of mind in everyday parlance is one of the subcomponents of social cognition, which embraces all the skills required to manage social communication and relationships in humans. Impairment of Theory of mind ability is often seen in children even in cases with a normal or high level of intelligence and other cognitive abilities. Ayurveda implies that whatever affects the body has its effects on the mind and vice versa. When critically viewed the Manovishayas like Chintya, Vicharya, Oohyam play a key role in the thought process, aim fixing, task completion and other behavioural patterns. Thus, eccentricity of Manovishayas can lead to behavioural abnormalities like Manovibrama, Budhivibrama, Anavasthithachithatwa, etc. Hence, the study of connections between fundamental neurophysiological mechanisms and highly complex social behaviour, such as Theory of mind which will enable us to better understand the respective roles of innate predisposition and cultural learning in human life. Studies in the social, cognitive, and affective sciences currently seem to be the most fruitful approach to successfully contrasting both the mind body dualism which is an integral part of Ayurveda in understanding the neurodevelopmental disorders.",

Instead, some people maintain relatively normal cognitive functioning despite neuropathologic burden, a phenomenon called cognitive resilience. Using a longitudinal, epidemiological, clinical-pathologic cohort study (N=348), the present research investigated associations between well-being and cognitive resilience. Consistent with pre-registered hypotheses, higher eudaimonic well-being (i.e., Ryff Psychological Well-being Scale) and higher hedonic well-being (i.e., Satisfaction with Life Scale) were associated with better-than-expected cognitive functioning relative to one’s neuropathological burden (i.e., beta-amyloid, neurofibrillary tangles, Lewy bodies, vascular pathologies, hippocampal sclerosis, and TDP-43). The association of eudaimonic well-being in particular was present above and beyond known cognitive resilience factors (i.e., socioeconomic status, education, cognitive activity, low neuroticism, low depression) and dementia risk factors (i.e., ApoE genotype, medical comorbidities). This research highlights the importance of considering eudaimonic well-being in efforts to prevent dementia.",

This decline in old age is a consequence of changes in brain anatomy, morphology and volume and functional deficits. Nervous tissue, particularly in the hippocampus and cortex, is subject to various degenerative processes including a decreased number and efficacy of synapses, a decrease in transmitter release, neuronal loss, astrogliosis, changes in astrocytic morphology, demyelination, deposits of β-amyloid and changes in extracellular matrix proteins1-4. These and other changes affect not only the efficacy of signal transmission at synapses, but also the functioning of glia and extrasynaptic (Volume') transmission mediated by the diffusion of transmitters as well as other substances through the volume of the extracellular space (ECS)5-10. This mode of communication without synapses provides a mechanism of long-range information processing in functions such as vigilance, sleep, chronic pain, hunger, depression, long-term potentiation (LTP), longterm depression (LTD), memory formation and other plastic changes in the central nervous system (CNS)7,11,12.",

Impairments within each of these ‘core’ clinical domains can range in severity from mild to profound, and intellectual disability may be present in more severe cases. The classification of ASD broadly includes classic autism (childhood autism; autistic disorder), Asperger syndrome and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) (Levy et al. 2009). Classic autism is frequently diagnosed around the age of 3 (and may be diagnosed as early as 2 years of age) (Baird et al. 2003; Landa, 2008). Asperger syndrome often presents with more subtle symptoms, and is usually diagnosed later on in childhood (frequently around 11 years of age), and occasionally in adults (Howlin and Asgharian 1999; Toth and King 2008).",

There are three forms of the disease, of which type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF 1) is the most common. NF 1 is an inherited autosomal-dominant disease, with a high rate of new mutations. In addition to the many physical manifestations and complications that occur in persons with NF 1, there are also numerous cognitive difficulties, including lower general intellectual functioning, learning difficulties, but also problems in attention, visual abilities, executive functions, and speech. Attention disorders are up to three times more common in people with NF 1, while learning disabilities are present in more than half of these subjects. Disturbances in the field of visuospatial perception are recognisable even in the preschool period. About 80% of children with NF1 exhibit various speech and language disorders: slow early speech development, slower vocabulary enrichment, syntactic, semantic and phonological speech disorders. Disruption of executive functions will manifest itself in the areas of working memory, organisation, planning / problem solving. This will reflect as the underperformance in academic achievement. Nearly one-third of these persons have emotional and social problems.",

Linguistic anxiety may develop due to disturbance of functional interactions between various systems in any healthy individual, but the risk of it developing increases significantly by the presence of initial speech defect such as post-stroke aphasia.

Adolescents with major depression showed working memory deficits and processing speed deficits from the early stages of information processing to the later stages of motor output.

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment and dementia are characterized by a progressive and devastating reduction in most cognitive abilities, functional independence, and social relationships. Dementia represents a substantial financial burden on society, one that is comparable to the financial burden of heart disease and cancer. Due to its insidious onset, cognitive impairment can be clinically silent for several years; therefore, diagnosis occurs late in the disease process, and treatment becomes almost useless. The identification of predictors of dementia may help identify the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the disease and lead to the development of a more effective medical diagnosis and therapy, and thus an early treatment. Review of the literature suggests that in those individuals with less cognitive impairment (normal/predementia group), hearing loss has an association with language comprehension, and when cognitive impairment increases (moderate or severe dementia group), the contributing effect of hearing loss as a cognitive ability-impairing factor also increases. Greater understanding of the links between hearing impairment and cognition may have important implications for the screening and diagnosis of cognitive decline in older people with hearing impairment.",

      "title": "Pediatric hearing loss: common causes, diagnosis and therapeutic approach.",
      "abstract": "Pediatric hearing loss limits the child ability to develop effective auditory and speech capabilities. Early rehabilitation of hearing loss results in higher levels of linguistic, academic and social skills. To achieve the best outcomes, proper and timely diagnosis is essential. The etiology of hearing loss can be classified according to its nature as sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), conductive hearing loss (CHL) or mixed hearing loss (MHL). Congenital hearing loss could be genetic or non genetic (acquired), syndromic or non-syndromic. Hearing loss can be classified according to the severity into mild (26-40 dB HL), moderate (41-70 dB HL), severe (71-90 dB HL) and profound (more than 90 dB HL). Management of hearing loss is mainly influenced by the nature, the bilaterality, the severity and the age at diagnosis. Severe to profound bilateral SNHL can be managed by cochlear implantation (unilateral or bilateral), if picked up at early age while mild to moderate bilateral SNHL are easier to manage with conventional hearing aids. CHL has less impact on the speech development of the child. It is usually managed by correcting the underlying etiology such as otitis media with effusion or even surgically in cases of external ear atresia or ossicular malformations. Unilateral SNHL have fortunately no impact on the language development of the child and can be passed undiagnosed until preschool-aged children. The implementation of national newborn hearing screening programs has improved the management of affected children by rehabilitating them at early stages to allow for normal speech development. In this review article, we aim to highlight the most common causes of pediatric hearing loss, their character and presentation and to review the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches of a deaf child.",

      "abstract": "A common neurological condition known as epilepsy is characterized by recurrent bouts of uncontrollable body movements that affect only a portion of the body (partial) or the full body (generalized), occasionally accompanied by loss of consciousness and control over bowel or bladder function. Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure. The duration of postictalphase varies from minutes to hours depending on the type of seizure, the frequency and intensity of seizures, and the length of the seizure.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a public health problem and one of the most common complaints in medical practice. Sleep disturbances may manifest as difficulty falling asleep (sleep-onset insomnia), maintaining sleep continuity (waking in the middle of the night and difficulty going back to sleep) or waking too early in the morning long before the desired time (early morning insomnia). Insomnia can significantly affect daytime functioning, leading to waking up in the morning tired, reduced productivity, a tendency to make mistakes and have accidents, inability to concentrate, frequent daytime sleep and a poor quality of life. The etiology and pathophysiology of insomnia include genetic, environmental, behavioural and physiological factors. Although insomnia can affect any gender and age group, women and the elderly are more vulnerable and are more likely to develop insomnia. A detailed sleep history is key to assessing insomnia. Clinicians must be able to recognise sleep disturbances and rule out other sleep-related disorders. The aim of treating insomnia is to improve sleep and alleviate the distress or dysfunction caused by this disorder. Psychological therapy methods, drug therapy, or combinations of these methods can be used to treat insomnia. Some behavioural interventions are feasible in primary care, but lack of training in these methods limits theiruse. Various natural and over-the-counter drugs, such as melatonin-based drugs, are used as sleeping pills. Melatonin has been evaluated as a sleeping pill in different doses, demonstrating a small but significant effect on sleep latency.",

Early detection and intervention significantly improve outcome, with about one third of autistic persons achieving some degree of independent living. Indications for developmental evaluation include no babbling, pointing, or use of other gestures by 12 months of age, no single words by 16 months of age, no two-word spontaneous phrases by 24 months of age, and loss of previously learned language or social skills at any age. The differential diagnosis includes other psychiatric and pervasive developmental disorders, deafness, and profound hearing loss. Autism is frequently associated with fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis, and may be caused by lead poisoning and metabolic disorders. Common comorbidities include mental retardation, seizure disorder, and psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety. Behavior modification programs are helpful and are usually administered by multidisciplinary teams, targeted medication is used to address behavior concerns. Many different treatment approaches can be used, some of which are unproven and have little scientific support.

In clinical practice, medication seems to be broadly as effective for people with learning disabilities. The effectiveness of medication in the treatment of challenging behaviours is less well established, although evidence for effectiveness is accumulating for some types of problem behaviour. When treating behavioural problems, medication is often used in combination with other management strategies. Knowledge of side effects is important, because people who have difficulty communicating may not be able to Report problems before they become severe. When using medication, it is important to try to achieve the best benefit: risk ratio, taking into account the person's other health problems and disabilities.

It is generally assumed that these subjects are quite helpless and that they suffer general deterioration. This is at variance with results of training and rehabilitation during which many thus affected subjects become independent, which is essential for their social integration. Despite this they have to experience sociopsychological attitudes which are prejudices with a typical stereotype which ignore the unique structure of everybody's potential who lost eyesight. The source of prejudices is general lack of information of people as regards actual sequelae of loss of eyesight and the emotional reaction of people with normal eyesight. A certain part is also played by tradition which does not take into account results of modern care of thus affected subjects. Prejudices cause in subjects with severely affected eyesight and in blind persons mental stress and render their actual social integration (employment, partnership etc.) more difficult. The solution is to train resistance against prejudices in thus affected subjects and to intensify health education on the given problem.",

The symptomatology of the disorder is demarcated as positive and the negative symptoms. The positive symptoms including delusions, illusions, auditory hallucinations, and thought disorders are the additional behaviors that develop after an individual develops the illness whereas the negative symptoms include introverted behavior, poor sociability, emotional blunting, amotivation, and cognitive deficits that reflect a decline in the normal functioning capacity of the person. People with psychotic disorders exhibit a significant reduction in the overall quality of life particularly in the domains of physical and mental health, social intercourses, self-esteem, and interpersonal relationships. Psychotic disorders are also one of the leading causes of disability and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) globally, causing a dent in the economy of a country through the inherent direct healthcare costs and the indirect costs (productivity and income losses) causing a depletion in capital and labor resource pool and subsequently causing a decrease in the overall productive capacity of the country. The existing literature highlights the importance of early interventions in psychosis, community-based multidisciplinary approaches including cognitive behavior therapy, somatic interventions, and pharmacotherapy in curtailing the impact and ameliorating the overall quality of life in people with psychosis.",

      "title": "Late Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Diagnosis: A New Perspective on Life",
      "abstract": "Introduction Autism Spectrum Disorder is usually diagnosed in early childhood, but an increasing number of adults are identified as autistic later in life (Huang et al., 2020). Many experience frustration due to missed early intervention opportunities. The lack of recognition of their condition during childhood or adolescence may have contributed to secondary mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression or low self-esteem, complicating the adjustment process after diagnosis (Bargiela et al., 2019). However, providing appropriate support can enhance their quality of life and promote better mental health outcomes. Objectives To assess the patient’s clinical case to identify autism spectrum disorder in older adulthood. Methods A 23-year-old male patient complained of an inability to concentrate, stress and fear when around people, and difficulties in social situations. Objectively observed: stereotyped movements, noticeable anxiety, avoidance of eye contact, non-compliance with social rules, specific language use and slow thinking. The patient had no history of diagnosed psychiatric illness. Since childhood, he has disliked the feeling of clothes touching his body, physical contact with others, making eye contact. The patient also exhibited impaired social development, being unable to initiate and maintain relationships with peers. Stereotypical, repetitive movements, sensory processing deviations have been observed since childhood. The patient has various phobias from a young age. Psychological examination revealed insufficient attention with observed fluctuations, impaired attention-shifting ability. The pace is very slow, the thinking is characterized by an average level of generalization, concreteness, and stereotypy. Personality traits included rigidity, depression, compulsiveness, internal tension. Based on the clinical picture and psychological tests, the patient was diagnosed with F84.0 Autistic Disorder, according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10 th Revision. In this case, the following methods were used in the assessment: Kraepelin’s and Schulte’s methods, pictograms, the 4-1 method, the Childhood Autism Rating Scale. Results The literature highlights that ASD involves difficulties in social interaction, repetitive behaviors, sensory sensitivities, and distinct thinking patterns. Up to 90% of individuals with ASD experience sensory irregularities, which is consistent with this case, as the patient shows social challenges, repetitive movements, slow thinking, and sensory issues. Diagnosing autism in adulthood can improve quality of life by fostering understanding and access to support. In this case, the patient’s past social and workplace difficulties may be attributed to autism, guiding the development of effective support strategies. Conclusions In conclusion, while a late autism diagnosis can be life-changing, it also comes with unique challenges that must be addressed through appropriate support.

      "abstract": "High Functional Autism (HFA) in adults, former known as Asperger Syndrome in DSM-IV-TR, was lately included in the wide umbrella of autism spectrum disorders in DSM 5. Asperger Syndrome (AS) is characterized by altered social interactions, restricted interests and repetitive stereotypical behavior just like other types of autism, with the exception of good language development and normal psychomotor and cognitive skills. (1,2) The purpose of this article is to investigate data in current literature about diagnosis, characteristics, functionality, comorbidities, treatment and outcome for adults diagnosed with AS/HFA. Individuals diagnosed with AS have difficulties in finding a job and/or a vocational niche which would secure a financially stable and independent life. They also find it harder to maintain their jobs and social relationships. (6,10) Most of them work jobs far below their skills level as difficulties start with the skills required for a job interview. So, although they are qualified for the job they apply to, they are rejected due to poor abilities to engage in reciprocal conversation or think and quickly respond to questions addressed during a job interview Autism spectrum disorders are frequently associated with comorbidities like: hyperactivity, poor attention and concentration, compulsions, preoccupations, sleep problems, anxiety and fears, depressive mood, tics, etc., all these being features of coexisting neuropsychiatric disorders such as ADHD, affective disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders etc. (22) High Functional Autism is a pathology not so well known and often confounded with others like depression, OCD, psychosis and/or personality disorders. The diagnosis is complicated and an elaborate family and personal history is needed, along with intensive testing and scales. These individuals are precious to society due to their incredible capacity to focus restrictively on an area of interest, so they can have amazing performances if they are guided accordingly. They don't need support only as children but throughout their entire life, and the higher the rate of support, the better the outcome.",

      "abstract": "Foreign Accent Syndrome, in het Nederlands ook wel het buitenlandsaccentsyndroom genoemd, is een motorische spraakstoornis waardoor patienten hun moedertaal gaan spreken met een accent dat buitenlands klinkt in de oren van luisteraars. In dit proefschrift geven we een duidelijke neurolinguistische beschrijving van drie van de subtypes van het syndroom, namelijk neurogene FAS (die ontstaat na schade aan het centrale zenuwstelsel), FAS op ontwikkelingsbasis en psychogene FAS (FAS in associatie met een psychiatrische stoornis). Op basis van onze analyses, kwamen we tot de conclusie dat 1. de segmentele (op niveau van het foneem, een klank die de kleinste distinctieve entiteit vormt) en suprasegmentele kenmerken (het niveau boven dat van het foneem, heeft bvb. betrekking op intonatie en ritme) niet volstaan voor eenduidige diagnostische differentiatie tussen de verschillende subtypes: andere (neurologische of psychiatrische) symptomen, evenals symptoomaanvang, evolutie en remissie zijn vaak informatiever in dit opzicht. 2. er mogelijk een vierde variant van FAS bestaat! Bij ons corpusonderzoek vonden we dat FAS ook werd beschreven na kaakchirurgie. We besloten om in dit geval te spreken van een organisch-mechanische FAS. 3. de kleine hersenen (het cerebellum) een niet te onderschatten rol spelen in de pathofysiologie van de aandoening. 4. FAS een stoornis van duale aard is, die zowel kenmerken van een planningsstoornis als executieve stoornis in zich draagt. Eerder werd aangehaald dat FAS een opvallend aantal klinische overeenkomsten vertoont met de spraakapraxie (een planningsstoornis waarbij de patient problemen ondervindt bij het plannen van de klanken en klanksequenties) en de atactische dysartrie (een executieve stoornis waarbij de patient problemen heeft met het uitvoeren van de geplande sequenties via de articulatoren). Toch lijkt de spraak van mensen met voorgaande aandoeningen veel ernstiger verstoord te zijn dan in het geval van FAS. Na een vergelijking van de pathofysiologie en de perceptuele fonetische kenmerken van deze aandoeningen hebben we geconcludeerd dat de overeenkomsten in het klinisch beeld op het neurobiologisch vlak gerelateerd kunnen worden aan (functionele of structurele) schade van de zeer belangrijke cortico-thalamische-striatopallidale verbindingen en voornamelijk de motorische cortex, de insula, de basale ganglia en het cerebellum betreffen.",

In the auditory system, age-related changes are seen in domains such as auditory sensitivity, temporal processing, and spatial localization, which have significant effects on speech understanding. In vision, age related changes are seen in contrast sensitivity, scotopic processing, and visual processing speed, which have consequences for activities such as reading and driving. In addition to hearing and vision, aging is associated with changes in smell, taste, and balance. Beyond simple perceptual processing, age-related sensory changes can increase cognitive demands, requiring greater involvement of domain-general cognitive processes during perception that reduce resources available for other operations. Capturing individual variability in sensory changes and their consequences is an important part of understanding normal and pathological aging.",

      "abstract": "Changes in sensory systems are common as we get older, and become more likely with increasing age. In the auditory system, age-related changes are seen in domains such as auditory sensitivity, temporal processing, and spatial localization, which have significant effects on speech understanding. In vision, age related changes are seen in contrast sensitivity, scotopic processing, and visual processing speed, which have consequences for activities such as reading and driving. In addition to hearing and vision, aging is associated with changes in smell, taste, and balance. Beyond simple perceptual processing, age-related sensory changes can increase cognitive demands, requiring greater involvement of domain-general cognitive processes during perception that reduce resources available for other operations. Capturing individual variability in sensory changes and their consequences is an important part of understanding normal and pathological aging.",

The correlates of emotional incapacities, emotional hypersensitivity, and normal emotional activities in psychopaths are studied and discussed in this paper. Emotional hypersensitivity might be linked with: a history of neglect, rejection and abuse; insult; changes which are forced or not under control of the psychopath; obstacles that prevent the psychopath to do what he or she wants to do; narcissistic injury; broken friendships or relationship. Normal emotional functioning might be associate with grief, warm relationship, adequate attention, disease, academic and/or occupational success, impressive events, confrontations, contemplation and maturation, hidden suffering (also as a result of neurobiological determination).",

Acontecem episódios repetidos de hipoxemia e hipercapnia, e com eles o sono torna-se superficial e fragmentado, resultando em distintas complicações ao indivíduo e à coletividade. O objetivo deste estudo foi revisar a literatura quanto às consequências individuais, econômicas e sociais causadas pela SAOS. Identificaram-se diversas complicações da SAOS relacionadas ao indivíduo: (1) alterações físicas e comportamentais: sono excessivo, fadiga, ansiedade, irritabilidade, depressão, redução da libido, diminuição da qualidade de vida, astenia, consequências metabólicas (ganho de peso, diabetes e dislipidemia) e cardiovasculares (hipertensão arterial sistêmica, aterosclerose e doença coronariana); (2) disfunção neurocognitiva: déficits de atenção, percepção, memória, raciocínio, juízo, pensamento e linguagem. Quanto à relação da SAOS e repercussões socioeconômicas, tem-se: (1) aumento do número, proporção e gravidade de acidentes automobilísticos devido à diminuição da concentração do motorista; (2) prejuízos ocupacionais com queda na produtividade, demissões e acidentes de trabalho; (3) prejuízo social: o individuo com SAOS representa também um perigo potencial para toda a sociedade por aumento de imperícias; (4) aumento de gastos públicos e privados: manutenção de rodovias e estrutura de fiscalização e apoio, gastos previdenciários, custos diagnósticos, terapêuticos e hospitalares. A SAOS deveria ser considerada uma doença de saúde pública, dados seus inequívocos prejuízos individuais, sociais e econômicos. Políticas específicas deveriam ser implementadas visando à redução do impacto dessas consequências.",

In this article I discuss recent research that has focused on quantifying the predictors of disability in real-world functioning, with cognitive impairment being one of the major predictors. Other important developments include the development of direct measures of the ability to perform the skills required to achieve everyday functional goals—skills referred to as “functional capacity.” Studies have shown that these abilities may be influenced by cognitive impairments and may be better predictors of disability than are cognitive deficits. I also examine the current literature on the treatment of cognitive impairments and functional disability, including both pharmacological and behavioral interventions.",

Delayed development is denned as a substantial retardation as compared to the standard indicators in any of the basic spheres: motor, communicative, cognitive, adaptive-behavioral, and socioemotional ones. Global developmental delay is characterized by a significant lag in two or more spheres. The use of current diagnostic techniques, such as the Bayley or Griffiths scales, can provide an objective quantitative assessment of both an infant's overall development and indicators in individual spheres. At the preliminary examination stage, it is expedient to carry out a Denver developmental screening test that may be directly used in a doctor's consulting room. The causes of global developmental delay/intellectual disability in infants may be perinatal central nervous system (CNS) lesions; brain malformations; intrauterine infections; intrauterine intoxications; early-onset psychoneurological diseases (neuroinfections, CNS injuries, epilepsies, autism spectrum disorders, etc.); congenital hypothyroidism; genetic diseases. Among all genetic causes of global developmental delay/intellectual disability, there are chromosomal anomalies (25-30%), monogenic diseases (metabolic diseases, neuroectodermal syndromes, diseases with predominant grey and white matter involvement). The diagnostic possibilities of current genetic methods are considered.",

It also considers whether individuals with non-specific ID show difficulties with Working Memory (WM) and other complex thinking skills, in relation to typically developing comparisons of comparable chronological age or mental age. Contributing factors to non-specific ID are complex, with a number of factors that could be implicated: environmental factors; pre-/post-natal complications; and genetic factors. An area of cognition often considered to be closely related to the WM system involves Executive Function (EF), with the central executive being heavily involved. Difficulties in adaptive functioning are related to and potentially caused or aggravated by the WM deficits of individuals with ID. Interventions and treatments can in some cases mitigate underlying causes, such as restricting phenylalanine in those with phenylketonuria, or be directed at comorbid physical and mental disorders to improve daily functioning and quality of life.",

The onset and severity of terminal decline vary greatly between individuals. It is thought that a certain degree of cognitive decline occurs due to biological changes in the aging human brain, but evidence suggests that more abrupt and perceptible decline is often associated with an underlying death process or disease pathology. Decline is often gradual and relatively imperceptible for a period of several years, then increases dramatically in closer proximity to death. Future investigations are necessary to characterize disease‐specific decline trajectories and understand how specific areas of cognition (i.e., memory, vocabulary) are affected by terminal decline.",

The problems are characterized by a lack of intentionality and symbol formation, which indicates that the deviant development of communication in autism is associated with a specific cognitive style. The central coherence theory can offer insight into the specific communication problems of people with autism, since a weaker drive for central coherence leads to problems in sense-making and, consequently, in communication. In the case of the comorbidity of autism and learning disability, the communication problems are aggravated. The crucial point is the determination of the level of sense-making, taking this comorbidity into account. Assessment and intervention have to be tuned to individual needs, in order to increase the communicative competence of people with autism and learning disability.",

The domains of dysfunctions are positive symptoms, negative symptoms, cognitive impairments, mood and suicidity, and aggression. Cognition is the sum total of mental processes that makes us acquire knowledge and keeps us aware of our surroundings and thus enables us to arrive at appropriate judgments. Cognitive deficits are recognized as enduring and persistent features in schizophrenia and can be neuro-cognitive or relating to social cognition. Neurocognitive deficits are deficits in speed of processing, attention / vigilance, working memory, verbal memory, visual memory, reasoning and problem solving, social cognition. Cognitive function can be assessed by various methods like experimental approach, neuropsychological and psychometric and ecologic approach. Cognitive deficits are present at onset of illness producing substantial impairment. Unlike psychotic symptoms, which remit with treatment, functional impairments remain stable over time. Detail understanding of such symptoms will help in disability limitation. Various cognitive remediation programmes are underway with such intent. Articles till March, 2012 were searched through PubMed and Google Scholar, which were studied in an attempt of understanding the topic. The information was structured and organized.",

While cognitive impairment is a hallmark of the syndrome, memory and problem-solving abilities are also significantly affected.

      "abstract": "Selective mutism is a communication disorder of the child, defined as the persistant inability to speak in one or more social situations whereas the child is capable of understanding language and of speaking in other situations. This trouble is generally extra-familial and mainly concerns girls. Until recently, it was considered to be rare but is, in fact, quite probably under-diagnosed. It often begins before the age of five and several years may elapse before it is identified and treatment is begun. It can be symptomatic of quite a number of diverse personality organizations which must be considered before it is possible to offer a prognosis and the appropriate treatment. Many psychopathological hypotheses exist to explain the origin of this complex disorder. Several factors have been associated with it such as difficulties in the mother/child relationship, separation anxiety, immigration, a psychological traumatism, the notion of a family secret, and more recently, social phobia (or, more generally, anxiety troubles). The prognosis of this disorder is reserved, depending essentially on the underlying psychopathological structure, the precocity of the diagnosis and treatment, the family psychopathology and possible associated troubles such as intellectual deficiency, psychomotor or language developmental delays. To obtain the best chances of success, treatment must be global (including the child, his family and teachers) and « multi-modal », associating individual therapy (analytic and/or cognitive-behavioral type), family therapy and pharmacological treatment (if the component of anxiety seems to be massively present).",

      "title": "Sleep less and bite more: Sleep disorders associated with occlusal loads during sleep",
      "abstract": "Occlusal overload during sleep is a significant clinical issue that has negative impacts on the maintenance of teeth and the longevity of dental prostheses. Sleep is usually viewed as an 'out-of-functional' mode for masticatory muscles. However, orodental structures and prostheses are not free from occlusal loads during sleep since masticatory muscles can be activated at a low level within normal sleep continuity. Thus, an increase in masticatory muscle contractions, by whatever the cause, can be associated with a risk of increased occlusal loads during sleep. Among such conditions, sleep bruxism (SB) is a type of sleep-related movement disorders with potential load challenge to the tooth and orofacial structures. Patients with SB usually report frequent tooth grinding noises during sleep and there is a consecutive increase in number and strength of rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA). Other types of masticatory muscle contractions can be non-specifically activated during sleep, such as brief contractions with tooth tapping, sleep talking, non-rhythmic contractions related to non-specific body movements, etc.; these occur more frequently in sleep disorders. Studies have shown that clinical signs and symptoms of SB can be found in patients with sleep disorders. In addition, sleep becomes compromised with aging process, and a prevalence of most sleep disorders is high in the elderly populations, in which prosthodontic rehabilitations are more required. Therefore, the recognition and understanding of the role of sleep disorders can provide a comprehensive vision for prosthodontic rehabilitations when prosthodontists manage complex orodental cases needing interdisciplinary collaborations between dentistry and sleep medicine.",

      "abstract": "Soggetti portatori di disabilitŕ presentano spesso disturbi endocrini e metabolici, primitivi o secondari alla menomazione psico-fisica. La disabilitŕ č spesso provocata da malattie geneticamente determinate, da traumi cranici o midollari con conseguenti alterazioni neurologiche, o da patologie infettive cerebrali con esiti significativi. Si comprende quindi facilmente la possibile associazione fra la disabilitŕ e disordini della funzione ipotalamica e ipofisaria, con quadri di ipopituitarismo di varia entitŕ. Ne conseguono manifestazioni cliniche, spesso subdole e non facilmente diagnosticabili, almeno nella fase iniziale, che, se non vengono riconosciute tempestivamente, possono avere conseguenze serie. Ad esempio un deficit di ormone della crescita o dell'ormone tiroideo o una carenza di cortisolo, in etŕ infantile possono dar luogo a gravi conseguenze patologiche. Un'altra patologia associata alla disabilitŕ č l'obesitŕ, sia ipotalamica che conseguente alla scarsa attivitŕ fisica. L'obesitŕ facilita lo sviluppo di diabete mellito, peraltro associato talora a malattie geneticamente determinate. Pertanto in una struttura residenziale per disabili č necessaria la consulenza di uno specialista endocrinologo al fine di riconoscere tempestivamente, sulla base di esami clinici e di laboratorio, eventuali patologie endocrine e metaboliche. Questo consente di intraprendere subito una terapia sostitutiva. L'assistenza sanitaria specialistica comprende l'attuazione di schemi di terapia adeguati, la compliance alla terapia, l'attuazione di idonei percorsi diagnostici e di follow-up. Grandi difficoltŕ si incontrano inevitabilmente nell'attuare programmi di attivitŕ fisica e di dieta al fine di limitare l'aumento ponderale. Un corretto intervento in questo campo richiede la collaborazione fra lo specialista e la strut- tura residenziale che assiste il disabile e percorsi di facilitazione per queste attivitŕ anche attraverso convenzioni stipulate ad hoc. Č fondamentale, infine, l'ottimizzazione di un'assistenza multidisciplinare ben integrata.",

      "abstract": "Understanding of how healthy development happens, how it is derailed and what can be done to prevent and keep it on track have been deepened, thanks to advances in neuroscience, molecular biology, genetics, Epigenetics, behavioral and social science. Converging evidence from scientific research and practical experience indicates that the influence of the early years can extend over a lifetime, as it affects the foundation s of learning, behavior, both physical and mental health. Multiple developmental impediments that limit the ability of children with normal potential to benefit from available learning opportunities have been identified including emotional problems (fear, anxiety), maladaptive adjustment, disruptive behavior, impairment s in executive functioning and other socio-emotional problems. Young children encountering any combination of these difficulties or risk factors are likely to have seriously disrupted capacity to engage in productive, goal directed activity. A common underlying problem links all of these domains –diminished capacity for self regulation in the areas of attention, emotion and behavior. Toxic stress and malnutrition during pregnancy increase the risk of the offspring to maladaptive response to stress, while repeated early exposures to threatening situations in infancy and early childhood can disrupt the development of the prefrontal cortex. This leads to emotional problems and compromised working memory, attention, inhibitory control and cognitive/mental flexibility. A weak foundation can seriously undermined the lifelong health and productivity of individuals, affecting family, community, extending to social and economic vitality of the nation. In contrast, well –developed capacities in these important aspects of self –organization can help children manage adversity more effectively and acquire the biological foundation for school readiness, literacy and numerical skills, and academic success, enabling children to be actively engaged competent learners and responsible citizen in the future for the country. In Thailand, DOH‘s several early childhood developmental screening surveys during 1999 to 2010, found ,among 1-5 year old, 28-32% suspected developmental delay with 25-28% in age 1-3 and 32-43% in age 4-5. In 2010 survey, children living in municipal areas had slightly lower prevalence of delay than those in rural area 27 VS 31%. (2010). The developmental domains most affected were language and fine motor adaptive function, both of which very crucial for learning. Developmental Language Disorder in young children has been found to relate to higher risk for later learning disability in primary school. About 1 in 6 children in the United States had a developmental disability in 20062008, ranging from mild disabilities such as speech and language impairments to serious developmental disabilities, such as intellectual disabilities, cerebral palsy, and autism. Early detection must be followed by early intervention to enhance child development, prevent serious handicapping condition and to be more cost effective. The increase of prevalence of Autistic Spectrum Disorder has been remarkable over the last two decades, for example, in USA from 1-2:1000 to 14.7 : 1,000 or about 1 in 68 children age 8 in 2010, according to CDC The Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network.

      "abstract": "The process of separation and individuation is a developmental psychological process, which takes place at various phases of child development within his first three years of life. These phases include the Normal Autistic Phase, the Normal Symbiotic Phase, the Separation-Individuation Phase (with sub-phases Differentiation, Practicing and Rapprochement, On the Way to Object Con­stancy) and the Final Separation and Psychological Birth of the Human Infant. Undisturbed transition through the developmental phases leads to the es­tablishment of psychological structure in the hu­man infant, which means that he reaches autonomy and independence, thus becoming an individual. For children which were born with physical dis­abilities and have their intellectual capacities pre­served (i.e. in cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy etc.), the fulfilment of this process is endangered, because their development was stuck at the Nor­mal Symbiotic Phase due to two types of factors. The first group represents factors of physical dis­ability (i.e. impossibility to move, obtain inde­pendent experiences and, consequently, the inabil­ity to detach from the Object), while the second group represents reactions to this hindrance (i.e. overprotection, which further thwarts attempts to detach from the Object).",

      "abstract": "Assessment of motor development is an important part of the study of the neuropsychic development of children, which is carried out by a pediatrician during preventive examinations. To identify the causes of motor disorders, in addition to studying the anamnesis, it is necessary to conduct a physical examination of the child with the appointment of additional research methods. It is important to remember that developmental delay does not always indicate the presence of any disease but requires dynamic monitoring. However, if they progress, then these patients are more likely to be diagnosed with specific neuromuscular disorders. In this case, the pediatrician should pay attention to the neurological status of the child, assess visual acuity and hearing. At the same time, one should not forget that motor disorders are often combined with a general developmental delay (mental retardation) of the child. Fasciculation of the tongue, loss of motor skills, organomegaly, coarsening of facial features, increased levels of creatine phosphokinase (more than 3 times higher than normal), respiratory failure, in the presence of general weakness, a sharp deterioration in the child’s condition, accompanied by lethargy, vomiting, development of convulsive syndrome, disorders detected on MRI of the brain, are alarming symptoms that require urgent intervention by specialists (neurologist, genetics). Also, some hereditary (chromosomal and monogenic) diseases are often combined with the development of motor disorders. The best results are achieved if the early diagnosis of diseases accompanied by movement disorders is carried out using an interdisciplinary approach.",

Clinical observations of patients not only with focal prefrontal pathology but also with other conditions affecting the frontal system (e.g., traumatic head injury, dementia) confirm the assumption that these patients present an overt decrease in the ability to express ideas in writing. It is proposed that complex aspects of writing, such as planning, narrative coherence, and maintained attention, are significantly disturbed in cases of impairments of executive functions. Frontal lobe patients not only have difficulties in keeping the effort required for writing, but also to organize the ideas in the written texts. The term dysexecutive agraphia is proposed to refer to this writing disorder. Three illustrative cases are presented.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder with a typical onset in adolescence or young adulthood. Global lifetime prevalence is about 0.3–0.7% (van Os and Kapur, 2009). Symptoms can be divided into positive symptoms (e.g., delusions and hallucinations), negative (deficit) symptoms (e.g., anhedonia, blunted affect, and avolition), and disorganization symptoms (e.g. disorganized speech). In addition, the majority of schizophrenia patients show cognitive dysfunctioning. In general, schizophrenia patients have deficits in most cognitive domains (e.g., attention, memory, and executive functioning) approximately one standard deviation below the normative mean (Mesholam-Gately et al., 2009). However, there is no specific cognitive profile that distinguishes schizophrenia patients from patients with other Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) diagnoses. Schizophrenia is often preceded by a prodromal period of months to years in which mild psychotic and other symptoms can occur and psycho-social functioning deteriorates.",

      "title": "The Effects of Sleep-Related Breathing Disorders on Waking Performance",
      "abstract": "IntroductionSleep is a necessary and reversible behavioural state of perception, cognition, psyche and physical conditions.Abnormal sleep behaviours may include e.g.difficulties in falling asleep, breathing difficulties such as different kinds of apneas, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep onset-REM, leg movements, sleepwalking, sleep talking, tooth grinding and other physical activities.These anomalies involving sleep processes also include sleep itself, dream imagery or muscle weakness.Within sleep there are two separate states, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eyes movement (REM).REM sleep is defined by EEG activation, muscle atony, and episodic bursts of rapid eye movement.NREM (non-REM) sleep is subdivided into four stages (stages 1, 2, 3 and 4 -Rechtschaffen & Kales) or three stages (N1, N2 and N3 -AASM), which are defined by the electroencephalogram (EEG).The NREM stages are parallel to the depth of sleep continuum (lowest in stage 1 and highest in stage 4 sleep).NREM sleep and REM sleep continue to alternate through the night in cyclically.REM sleep episodes become longer across the night, stages 3 and 4 become shorter across the night.Sleep disorders have an impact on the structure and distribution of sleep.A distinction is important in diagnosis and in the choice of treatments.There are three very important sleep disorders: Insomnia, Narcolepsy and Sleep Apnea Syndrome.Altogether, in Western Europe already suffer more than 10 % of the population from Sleep-Awake-Disturbances which has to be treated urgently; 800,000 from Sleep Apnea Syndromes and 25,000 from Narcolepsy (PETER et al. 1995).1. Insomnia is a sleeplessness and includes a decreased total sleep time, a poor sleep efficiency too little and a poor sleep quality caused by one or more of the following: trouble falling asleep (delayed sleep latency), waking up a lot during the night with trouble returning to sleep, waking up too early in the morning, and/or having unrefreshing sleep/not feeling well rested (even after sleeping 7 to 8 hours at night).Under this criterion the frequency is in the western industrial countries between 20-30 % in which about 10-15 % suffer under a very severe illness and 40 % of all depressions may be preceded by insomnia first.2. Narcolepsy is a genetic disorder and characterized by sleep onset REM sleep, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness.www.intechopen.comSleep Disorders 118 The exact prevalence of the general population is unknown.Great differences exist in its appearance frequency.So the frequency of Japan is 0.16 % and of Israel 0.0002 %.Central Europe (0.006 %) and the USA (0.06-0.1 %) are located in the middle.3. Sleep Apnea Syndromes (SAS) are common disorders, which are characterized by repeated oropharyngeal occlusions occurring during the sleep time (sleep-related breathing problems, intermittent hypoxemia) and may be associated with suppression of SWS sleep (disrupted and fragmentized sleep architecture).Due to intermittent hypoxemia and disrupted sleep architecture, SAS leads to impaired daytime functioning in various (neuro)psychological and affective domains and has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, principally from adipositas, cardiovascular and neurological diseases.The prevalence of moderate SAS (AHI >15/h) is 9% in male and 4% in female, respectively.25-30 % Sleep Apnea Syndromes were described at patients with hypertension and 35-45 % with patients with on the left heart-failure.The SAS frequency increases with an advancing age and reaches their peak at the age from 50 to 70 years.80% of the patients suffer under excessive daytime sleepiness and a reduced sustained attention.Resulting from this it comes to performance losses both professional and in the ability to drive motor vehicles.Fragmentation of sleep and increased frequency of arousals occur in association with this three disorders and a number of other sleep disorders as well as with medical disorders involving physical pain or discomfort.In this chapter, the author will describe neuropsychological dysfunctions/courses and neuropsychiatric syndromes due sleep disorders which were characterized by 1. excessive daytime sleepiness 2. attention deficit, 3. memory dysfunction, 4. executive dysfunction, 5. driving difficulties, 6. motivation and emotional deficits, 7. psychiatric consequences (e.g.depression, anxiety) and 8. lack of ability to recognize the effects of behaviour.There are wide varieties of difficulties in assessment, treatment and rehabilitation for cognitive impairment, psychiatric disorders and behavioural disability after sleep disorders.In our studies we used neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric methods in different patient groups in a sleep laboratory.Over the past five years we have been testing and treating more than 2000 patients with different sleep disorders and more than 5000 neurological patients.During admission to the clinic, all patients were selected according to their clinical diagnosis (ICD-10) and were examined neurologically, (neuro)psychologically, psychiatrically and medically.The test persons must not suffer from any severe psychiatric disorders.The study was carried out involving randomly selected patients with sleep disorders.

      "abstract": "La clinique générale de l’autisme est bien connue mais le triptyque troubles des interactions sociales, de la communication verbale et non verbale, et intérêts restreints est peu spécifique. La connaissance de particularités sensorielles, sensori-motrices et cognitives est insuffisamment répandue. Pourtant, les arborescences de symptômes singulières pour chaque personne autiste deviennent familières à ses accompagnants proches (parents et professionnels). Mais tous se trouvent conjoncturellement démunis par des troubles du comportement : – soit parce que les symptômes de l’autisme sont amplifiés ou modifiés ; – soit parce que des syndromes psychiatriques s’ajoutent à l’autisme ; – soit parce que des maladies du corps sont associées à l’autisme (génétiques ou neurologiques) et ont aussi une expression psychique et comportementale. Ces différentes causes sont souvent confondues dans les services, d’autant plus qu’elles peuvent interférer. Or les traitements ne sont pas les mêmes, qu’ils soient éducatifs, institutionnels ou médicamenteux. Une approche psychiatrique exclusive sera erronée. Notamment les traitements médicamenteux sont souvent inappropriés, source de conflits entre les professionnels, avec les familles, et aussi, parfois, avec la justice. Inversement, tout rapporter à l’autisme peut nous égarer. Seront présentés des éléments pour le diagnostic différentiel avec des exemples qui relèvent de ces trois causes : – ce qui est dû à l’accentuation des troubles autistiques : ici, la poussée de l’adolescence et la sexualité seront des facteurs importants ; – des maladies psychiatriques que l’on peut reconnaître malgré le mélange avec la pathologie autistique : la comorbidité psychiatrique proprement dite ; – ce qui relève de la comorbidité somatique d’expression psychiatrique (des maladies organiques : génétiques, neurologiques dont l’épilepsie, et des algies diverses).",

Some of the commonly seen disabilities are cognitive disorder (MR), vision impairment, mental health condition, intellectual disability, acquired brain injury, Autism, speech and language disorder. Physical disability may be a temporary one or a permanent one in order to a person’s physical capacity or mobility they include Cerebral palsy, Epilepsy and muscular dystrophy. Developmental disability is Down Syndrome, Autism, Dyslexia and processing disorder, the behavioural problems are Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder and others which require additional assistance for the individual from the caretakers. A special School provides special education for the children with severe learning disabilities and other disabilities. According to the census of 2011, more than one million people in the world live with some form of disability. In India out of 121cr population 2.68cr (2.21%) population are disabled among that 56% are male and 44% are female in particular 69% of disabled persons are from a rural background and 31% from an urban background. In India, Uttar Pradesh is the state which has highest of persons with disability and the state which has the lowest number of persons with disability is Jammu and Kashmir. In Tamil Nadu, the statistics of 2011 has 4.4% of persons with disability. The problems faced by the disabled are conveyance, poverty, lack of family support and public support likewise the care takers of disabled persons also face problems such as stress, depression and also difficulty in coping up with society. The interventions which can be implemented to the care takers are family system programmes, instructional programmes, interactional programmes, counselling and motivation.

      "title": "Fragile X Syndrome and it's Association with Autism",
      "abstract": "The fragile X syndrome, which is considered to be synonymous with the Martin-Bell syndrome, is a relatively common form of X-linked mental retardation. The syndrome seems to occure in many different ethnic groups and its prevalence among mentally retarded males has been estimated to be in the order of 2 to 6%. The karyotypic hallmark of the syndrome is made up with a pronounced constriction near each tip of the long arm of the X chromosome(fragile site), shown in vitro only under conditions in which thymidylate production is blocked(lowered folate levels). Special culture media are needed to demonstrate this constriction site. Major clinical features associated with the syndrome include macroorchidism, large or prominent ears, significant emotional and behavioral dysfunctions such as hyperactivity, self-injury, lack of eye contact and social interaction, schizophrenia, autism, etc., and speech and language dysfunctions ranging from nonverbal to verbal speech with moderate to severe expressive language delays. Some have minor clinical features in common such as an increase in birth weight high forehead, prognathism, increased head circumference in infancy and childhood which did not persist into adult life. The recent research findings have shown that the fragile X syndrome is associated with infantile autism. Many patients with the fragile X syndrome fulfill the diagnostic criteria for infantile autism. Therefore it is recommendable that any patient with developmental delays and autism or autistic manifestations should have a chromosomal analysis, including fragile X examination. In the present review, historical aspects, incidence, and clinical features are presented. Recent anecdotal reports of the association with autism and the clinical improvement following high dose folic acid treatment will be discussed.",

Autism, seizures, schizophrenia and mild dysmorphic features are less commonly seen. The 15q11.2 BP1–BP2 microdeletion involving four genes (i.e., TUBGCP5, CYFIP1, NIPA1, NIPA2) is emerging as a recognized syndrome with a prevalence ranging from 0.57%–1.27% of patients presenting for microarray analysis which is a two to four fold increase compared with controls. Review of clinical features from about 200 individuals were grouped into five categories and included developmental (73%) and speech (67%) delays; dysmorphic ears (46%) and palatal anomalies (46%); writing (60%) and reading (57%) difficulties, memory problems (60%) and verbal IQ scores ≤75 (50%); general behavioral problems, unspecified (55%) and abnormal brain imaging (43%). Other clinical features noted but not considered as common were seizures/epilepsy (26%), autism spectrum disorder (27%), attention deficit disorder (ADD)/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (35%), schizophrenia/paranoid psychosis (20%) and motor delay (42%). Not all individuals with the deletion are clinically affected, yet the collection of findings appear to share biological pathways and presumed genetic mechanisms. Neuropsychiatric and behavior disturbances and mild dysmorphic features are associated with genomic imbalances of the 15q11.2 BP1–BP2 region, including microdeletions, but with an apparent incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity.",

Many deafblind syndromes have additional dysfunctions of the central nervous system (learning disabilities, delayed mental development etc). Since communication to a large extent is based on an intimate interaction between sight and hearing, this dual sensory loss can if not compensated give rise to severe sensory deprivation and communications problems. We will report results from cognitive studies in Usher and Alstrom syndrome and some clinical observations regarding CHARGE syndrome. The etiologies of deafblindness with additional cognitive dysfunctions have to be diagnosed very early in order to enhance basic communication skills and habilitation in children with deafblindness have to be enhance the use of multiple sensory capacities such as hearing, vision, tactile, smell, and taste.

      "title": "Normal and Pathological Aging: From Animals to Humans",
      "abstract": "While aging is associated with modest declines in certain aspects of cognitive function (memory, executive function, processing speed), many cognitive domains can remain relatively stable until late in life. In contrast to the mild decline observed in normal aging, pathological aging such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects global cognitive function – impairing memory, language, thinking, and reasoning, and interferes substantially with daily living capacity. Changes in the structural integrity of the brain underlie the cognitive declines that occur in both aging and AD, however different brain structures are affected. In healthy aging, mild functional changes are predominantly detected in the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia, while in AD, pathology initially accumulates and disrupts function in the medial temporal lobe (disrupting memory), progresses to cortical structures, and eventually globally impacts the brain. Cognitive decline with normal and pathological aging is mediated by a complex interaction of multiple factors that include genetic and nongenetic risk factors that determine the age of onset as well as the rate of decline. Importantly, the progression and decline can be prevented or slowed by certain lifestyle factors (exercise participation, stress management) and pharmaceutical interventions (statins, hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women). While most individuals will experience some degree of cognitive decline with aging, conversion to MCI or AD is not an inevitable consequence of aging. It is likely that additional strategies to promote healthy brain aging will be uncovered in the next years that will further contribute to successful brain aging and will help to maintain a high quality of living through the last decades of life.",

      "title": "A study of the normative psychometric properties of the ALFIE, a novel measure of accelerated long-term forgetting in temporal lobe epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Background: Patients with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) typically complain of memory difficulties, but these are not always evident on objective memory assessments. This discrepancy may result from under- or over-reporting of memory problems as a result of motivation (e.g., to avoid confrontation, functional consequences on employment), impact of psychosocial factors (e.g., mood) or epilepsy patients’ perception of their difficulties (e.g., memory disturbances may cause difficulties with patients’ metamemory, meaning they lack the ability to accurately comment on their cognitive capabilities). Alternatively, this could be explained by a lack of specificity in current memory measures that utilise delay periods of 30-40 minutes. Research suggests that extending published memory tests to assess recall over a longer period (e.g., a two-week delay) allows the memory deficits described by those with TLE to be seen – a phenomenon known as Accelerated Long-term Forgetting (ALF). However, the literature has yet to address difficulties with test ecological validity and clinical practicability.\r\nAim: The aim of this research was to further develop a novel measure of ALF to examine whether it was a clinically viable test measure. This was explored through assessments of validity, reliability, and acceptability/practicability of the implemented test procedure, for this novel measure.\r\nMethod: 50 healthy participants’ objective memory performance was assessed by asking them to recall and recognise information at three time points: immediately after presentation of stimuli (T1), after 40 minutes (T2), and after two-weeks (T3). Alongside a published story and word list tasks, a novel measure was used – the Accelerated Long-term Forgetting In Epilepsy (ALFIE) test. We believe this to be more ecologically valid and clinically practical than other memory measures, due to the test using multi-modal stimuli drawn from real-life televised news broadcasts (concordant with a verisimilitude approach), with use of telephone follow-up phone-calls to assess two-week recall and recognition. Subjective memory performance was assessed via use of a self-report questionnaire.\r\nResults: Convergence of results on the ALFIE and published memory measures was found. Although extension of the published measure to a two-week delay might then seem justifiable, the ALFIE test showed greater correlations with subjective memory scores than the published story and word lists tasks. This suggests greater ecological validity of the ALFIE measure than the published memory test. Reliability was assessed through inter-rater reliability and analysis of parallel forms. The ALFIE showed high inter-rater reliability and although parallel forms reliability was poor, through standardisation versions may be used as alternate forms. Low attrition rates suggest that use of a two-week delayed assessment via telephone might be a clinically viable solution for specialist Epilepsy services assessing ALF, often over large geographical regions (where it would be costly, impractical and hard to co-ordinate for patients to return for extended delay follow-ups within such a restrictive time limit). Significant differences in performance between genders needs further examination, but may partially be explained through emotional salience of materials.\r\nConclusion: The ALFIE test appears to be a viable test measure for assessing memory that is more ecologically-valid and clinically practicable than current memory measures.",

      "title": "Incidence Of Post-Operative Delirium In Geriatric Patients Undergoing Hip Replacement Surgery Using Pre-Operative Haloperidol",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Delirium is acute onset &amp; fluctuating disturbance in mental state that causes patient appear confused, disoriented or with difficulty to focus and with decline in cognitive function (memory, orientation, speech), circadian disturbance and behavior of patient either agitated or sleepy,in other words sudden confusion. Delirium, also known as acute confusional state, is an organically-caused decline from a previously baseline level of mental function that develops over a short period of time (hours to days). Delirium is not a disease itself, but a syndrome encompassing disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. It may also involve other neurological deficits, like psychomotor disturbances (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed), impaired sleepwake cycle, emotional disturbances, and perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations and delusions). Objective To determine incidence of post-operative delirium in geriatric patients undergoing hip replacement surgery using pre-operative haloperidol. Patients and Methods This study is conducted through geriatric patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and the incidence of pre.&amp; post-operative delirium. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted post-operative surgical ICU in Demerdash hospital which was closed unit and had the same well-established pain, sedation and delirium assessment practices. A delirium was monitored through CAM score in their stay in ICU (max. for &amp;7 days from admission post-operative). Results Several trials stated that the usage of Haloperidol pre-operative decrease the duration and the severity of Delirium rather than the incidence of delirium. In our trial we will detect the incidence of delirium with using prophylactic haloperidol in geriatric patients undergoing Hip replacement surgery. In our study revealed that using prophylactic pre-operative haloperidol decrease the incidence of delirium among geriatric patient as well as decreasing both the duration and the severity of delirium among the study group. Conclusion Our study and results revealed that Haloperidol as antipsychotic drug have beneficial effect on reduction of incidence of delirium in post-operative geriatric patients, also it showed effect on duration of delirium and severity of the disease as well as ICU stay.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Nearly 90% of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) develop voice and speech disorders during the course of their disease (1,2). These disorders are characterized by reduced voice volume (hypophonia); a breathy, hoarse, or harsh voice quality (dysphonia); imprecise consonant and vowel articulation due to reduced range of articulatory movements (hypokinetic articulation) and a tendency of these movements to decay and/or accelerate toward the end of a sentence; reduced voice pitch inflections (hypoprosodia, monotone); and rushed, dysfluent, hesitant, or stutteredlike speech (palilalia). Collectively, these disorders have been termed hypokinetic dysarthria (3). They may be among the first signs of PD, with hypophonia and dysphonia typically preceding articulation, prosodic and fluency disorders (1,2,4). Hypokinetic dysarthria in individuals with PD typically results in reduced speech intelligibility. Reduced facial expression (hypomimia) is also common in individuals with PD. Together, these can be interpreted as a person being cold, withdrawn, unintelligent, and moody (5,6). These factors may also impair the ability to socialize, convey important medical information, interact with family members, and maintain employment (5).",

They wax and wane spontaneously over time and look like fragments of normal movements. Their frequency may increase in situations of stress or challenge and during emotional excitement. The symptomatology is attenuated during sleep and by goal-oriented behavior/concentration. Tics can be voluntarly suppressed for limited periods of time; the sensory-motor phenomena before a tic may be used as signal. Apart from simple movements and vocal impulses, more complex motor (e.g., slapping oneself, hopping, copropraxia = obscene gesturing, echopraxia = imitation of others) and linguistic discharges (such as coprolalia = use of obscene language, palilalia = repetition of the most recently spoken syllables or words and echolalia = repetition of words spoken by others) can also occur. The combination of chronic (lasting longer than a year) vocal and multiple motor tics is termed Tourette syndrome (TS). The indication and choices for pharmaco therapy (e.g., tiapride, risperidone, aripiprazole) within a broader therapeutic framework will be presented, including the pharmacological strategy with comorbid mental disorders like ADHD and OCD.",

Dyslexia and autism areseparate conditions. Similarly, dyslexia and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are also separateconditions. Dyslexia is considered a reading or learningdisability. It happens because of differences in partsof your brain that process words and language.3 Someexperts estimate that it affects about 7% of peopleworldwide, equally regardless of sex and race.1Somedemographical data also said it affects roughly around10% of the population globally. Including people withsymptoms but without a diagnosis, dyslexia may affectup to 20% of people worldwide.1Among Americansabout 5%-15% have some symptoms of dyslexia, likeslow reading, trouble spelling, or mixing up words.Adults can have this learning disorder, but most peopleare diagnosed early in life. Others don’t realize they havedyslexia until they get older. 3 In Bangladesh, dyslexia isa new concept to most educators and parents, and manydyslexic people themselves.

      "title": "FBXL4-Related Encephalomyopathic Mitochondrial DNA Depletion Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics FBXL4-related encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndrome is a multi-system disorder characterized primarily by congenital or early-onset lactic acidosis and growth failure, feeding difficulty, hypotonia, and developmental delay. Other neurologic manifestations can include seizures, movement disorders, ataxia, autonomic dysfunction, and stroke-like episodes. All affected individuals alive at the time they were reported (median age: 3.5 years) demonstrated significant developmental delay. Other findings can involve the heart (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, congenital heart malformations, arrhythmias), liver (mildly elevated transaminases), eyes (cataract, strabismus, nystagmus, optic atrophy), hearing (sensorineural hearing loss), and bone marrow (neutropenia, lymphopenia). Survival varies; the median age of reported deaths was two years (range 2 days – 75 months), although surviving individuals as old as 36 years have been reported. To date FBXL4-related mtDNA depletion syndrome has been reported in 50 individuals. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of FBXL4-related mtDNA depletion syndrome is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in FBXL4 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Management is best provided by a multidisciplinary team including neurology, nutrition, clinical genetics/metabolism, and developmental pediatrics. Other specialties may be involved as needed. To date no definite treatment is available; thus, treatment is mainly supportive: assuring adequate nutrition and standard treatment of neurologic complications including developmental delay / intellectual disability, seizures, cardiac complications, eye involvement, and hearing loss. Administration of cofactors and antioxidants, used in mitochondrial disorders with (generally) limited evidence of benefit, may be considered. Surveillance: No surveillance guidelines have been published. The treating physician should decide about the frequency of follow up of eyes, hearing, heart, feeding difficulties, liver, neurologic complications, and neutropenia based on the patient's findings. Genetic counseling FBXL4-related mtDNA depletion syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. When both parents are heterozygous carriers, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier (heterozygote), and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the FBXL4 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

Then, a brief outline of normal speech development is provided. Even in the case of primary SSD, diagnosis and treatment planning requires an understanding of possible proximal causes, and therefore a thorough investigation of hearing, phonological processing, and oral-motor structure and function is also required. The clinical management of SSDs by the speech-language pathologist (SLP) is covered. The process for assessing a child who has been referred due to suspected speech problems is necessarily comprehensive due to the nature of questions that must be answered by the SLP.",

Multiple sclerosis patients also suffer from social cognition impairment, which affects their social functioning. The objective of the current paper is to assess the effect of neurocognitive impairment and its potential correlation with social cognition performance and impairment in multiple sclerosis patients.An overview of the available-to-date literature on neurocognitive impairment and social cognition performance in multiple sclerosis patients by disease subtype was performed.It is not clear if social cognition impairment occurs independently or secondarily to neurocognitive impairment. There are associations of variable strengths between neurocognitive and social cognition deficits and their neural basis is increasingly investigated.The prompt detection of neurocognitive predictors of social cognition impairment that may be applicable to all multiple sclerosis subtypes and intervention are crucial to prevent further neural and social cognition decline in multiple sclerosis patients.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive Impairment (CI) and Dementia (D) are chronic and progressive pathologies that as time passes will evolve into a state of dependency (diminution or absence of the ability to perform daily life actions); this implies that the affected person will have to be assisted by a caregiver. In the early stages, this clinical condition shows a loss or pathological decline on cognitive functions (memory, attention, language, praxis, gnosias or executive functions), with certain preservation of functional habilities (Bagnati et al., 2005; Arizaga, 2011). The above said means that in the initial stages the patient has a partially effective development on their daily life, therefore the moments of assistance he or she will require will be few. In advanced stages (moderate and severe) there will be a mayor symptom evolution, which will lead to a longer time  of care, that is, the time load dedicated to the affected person will be increasing. In the early stages, the role of primary caregiver is expected to be carried out by a direct relative, usually a spouse, but as time passes, an external caregiver must be assigned.\r\nAssisting an older adult with neurodegenerative pathology in a state of dependence involves effort and dedication. Those who serve this population for long periods often suffer an overload that impacts on a psycho-emotional level and sometimes require a medical-pharmacological treatment. Among the described risk factors for overload, clinical signs of mild depression appear, alongside with anxiety, high levels of stress and physical discomfort (Mendez & Solano Perez, 2016; Giraldo et al.,  2010; Carrillo et al., 2014). In this regard, there is a plurality of interventions, where self-help groups, psychotherapy and informative workshops stand out. Some authors argue that the specific and concrete contribution generates security and trust in the caregiver, strengthening his or her attitude and disposition to the assistance task (Hernandez et al., 2014).This indicates that there should be specific guidance to perform the task of caring with quality. Quality of care is understood as the ability of the caregiver, their knowledge on the subject and the ability to make decisions (Barrera-Ortiz et al., 2013; Amador-Marin & Guerra Martin, 2017). We currently have free support spaces for family members of people with CI or D, but not a specific space for caregivers. Experts on the subject report that those who daily assist people with these conditions suffer from stress or psycho-affective pathologies due, in many cases, to lack of experience or training in the subject or not having strategies properly organized in a work plan (Alvarado, 2010; Canevaro & Smith, 2013).\r\n In 2012, from a private institution in the city of La Plata, an orientation space was created for family members and for assigned caregivers of people with CI and D. The active participation of caregivers caused the space to be installed as a specific educational proposal and it was decided to make it open to the community at the School of Psychology, via the Extension Secretariat.  The orientation space for the assigned caregivers, that was called GOC (Caregiver Orientation Group), was then opened and caregivers of people suffering from CI and D attended.\r\nObjectives\r\nTo guide the practice in the care of people with cognitive disabilities and dementias. To acquire effective management of behavioral symptoms in different dementia, cognitive deficit management and efficacy in communicating with the patient.\r\nMethods\r\n Weekly meetings in workshop mode with work plan analysis, caregiver stress monitoring and cognitive-behavioral management strategies.\r\nResults\r\n The GOC proposal, that was developed during 2014-2015, gave more value to caregivers activity. Due to its impact, it led to the creation of the “Caregiver of Dependent Older Adults” course that was developed by EUO UNLP in 2017-2018 with a high number of graduates. This encourages responsible practice in caring for the elderly with CI.\r\nConclusions\r\nTaking into account the demographic change and the prevalence of cognitive impairment, it is essential to have quality alternative educational practices with specific contents that guide the good practices of caregivers.",

Psychological factors are decisive, and they usually include a major anxiety generated by intrapsychic conflicts, which are converted by unconscious defense mechanism into symptoms. The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness. The secondary gain is external and includes attention and care from caregivers or others.",

      "abstract": "Look‐alike or sound‐alike (LASA) medication names may be mistaken for each other, e.g. mercaptamine and mercaptopurine. If an error of this sort is not intercepted, it can reach the patient and may result in harm. LASA errors occur because of shared linguistic properties between names (phonetic or orthographic), and potential for error is compounded by similar packaging, tablet appearance, tablet strength, route of administration or therapeutic indication. Estimates of prevalence range from 0.00003 to 0.0022% of all prescriptions, 7% of near misses, and between 6.2 and 14.7% of all medication error events. Solutions to LASA errors can target people or systems, and include reducing interruptions or distractions during medication administration, typographic tweaks, such as selective capitalization (Tall Man letters) or boldface, barcoding, and computerized physician order entry.",

      "title": "Aging, Disability and Frailty",
      "abstract": "Despite multiple and often overlapping definitions of disability and frailty, both are common clinical characteristics of aged individuals though not identical. The geriatric syndrome of frailty is described as status of global impairment of physiological reserves involving multiple organ systems. The clinical correlate of frailty manifests as increased vulnerability, impaired capability to withstand intrinsic and environmental stressors, and limited capacity to maintain physiological and psychosocial homeostasis. Geriatric frailty is found in 20–30% of the elderly population over 75 years and increases with advancing age. It was reported to be associated with long-term adverse health-related outcomes – increased risk of geriatric syndromes, dependency, disability, hospitalization, institutional placement, and mortality. The clinical phenotype of frailty manifests as multi-system pathologies characterized by low physical activity, global weakness with low muscle strength, fatigability/exhaustion, overall slowness particularly of gait, loss of weight among others. These above-mentioned clinical symptoms could be explained by (or related to) some ‘preclinical’ diagnoses such as sarcopenia, osteopenia, nonspecific balance disorders, nutritional problems, and overall deconditioning. More recent studies found the frailty clinical phenotype to be associated with pathologic laboratory markers (IL-6, CRP, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, IGF-1, D-dimers), which suggest possible pathogenesis involving hormonal dysregulation, immuno-aging, pro-coagulation and pro-inflammatory status. In the article, current recommendations for future research strategies of frailty syndrome will be discussed.",

      "title": "Pseudobulbar Affect: When Patients Laugh or Cry, but Don't Know Why",
      "abstract": "[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Disruption of neural circuitry undermines voluntary control of affect Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is a disorder of affective expression that manifests as stereotyped and frequent outbursts of crying (not limited to lacrimation) or laughter. Symptoms are involuntary, uncontrolled, and exaggerated or incongruent with current mood. Episodes, lasting a few seconds to several minutes, may be unprovoked or occur in response to a mild stimulus, and patients typically display a normal affect between episodes. (1) PBA is estimated to affect 1 to 2 million people in the United States, although some studies suggest as many as 7 million, (1,2) depending on the evaluation method and threshold criteria used. (3) Many terms have been used to describe aspects of PBA (Table 1 (4) and Box, page 58 (5-10)). This abundance of often conflicting terminology is thought to have impeded efforts to categorize emotional expression disorders, determine their prevalence, and evaluate clinical evidence of potential therapeutic options. (11) Where to look for pseudobulbar affect PBA has been most commonly described in major neurologic disorders: * Alzheimer's disease * amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) * multiple sclerosis (MS) * Parkinson's disease * stroke * traumatic brain injury (TBI). Of these disorders, most studies have found the highest PBA prevalence in patients with ALS and TBI, with lesser (although significant) prevalence in Parkinson's disease (Table 2, page 59). (1,12) These big 6 diagnoses are not a comprehensive list, as many other disease states are associated with PBA (Table 3, page 59). (12-14) As PBA has become better defined and more widely recognized, additional sequelae have been described. PBA's sporadic and unpredictable nature and the potential embarrassment and distress of public outbursts may lead to an agoraphobia-like response. (15) People with PBA report a significantly worse subjective assessment of general health, quality of life, relationships, and work productivity compared with people with similar primary underlying diagnoses without PBA. (16) 2 Pathways: 'Generator' and 'governor' Despite the many and varied injuries and illnesses associated with PBA, Lauterbach et al (10) noted patterns that suggest dysregulation of 2 distinct but interconnected brain pathways: an emotional pathway controlled by a separate volitional pathway. Lesions to the volitional pathway (or its associated feedback or processing circuits) are thought to cause PBA symptoms. To borrow an analogy from engineering, the emotional pathway is the generator of affect, whereas the volitional pathway is the governor of affect. Thus, injury to the governor results in overspill, or overflow, of affect that usually would be suppressed. The emotional pathway, which coordinates the motor aspect of reflex laughing or crying, originates at the frontotemporal cortex, relaying to the amygdala and hypothalamus, then projecting to the dorsal brainstem, which includes the midbrain-pontine periaqueductal gray (PAG), dorsal tegmentum, and related brainstem. The volitional pathway, which regulates the emotional pathway, originates in the dorsal and lateral frontoparietal cortex, projects through the internal capsule and midbrain basis pedunculi, and continues on to the anteroventral basis pontis. The basis ponds then serves as an afferent relay center for cerebellar activity. Projections from the pons then regulate the emotional circuitry primarily at the level of the PAG. (10) Lesions of the volitional pathway have been correlated with conditions of PBA, whereas direct activation of the emotional pathway tended to lead to emotional lability or the crying and laughing behaviors observed in dacrystic or gelastic epilepsy. (10) The pivotal nature of the regulation occurring at the PAG has guided treatment options. …",

The diagnosis is usually straight-forward on clinical grounds, but whereas sleep paralysis is non-specific, it is difficult to sustain a diagnosis without cataplexy (Parkes et al., 1995). ‘Jelly attacks’ with laughter, or in the anticipation of laughter, is how it is often described, and the muscles around the face might jerk.",

      "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, characterized by emotional, behavioral, cognitive and/or social disability, is an important condition to those providing mental health treatment worldwide. With no safe level of alcohol consumption found during pregnancy, symptoms at the severe end of the spectrum can be obvious, easily diagnosed and extremely debilitating; at the mild end of the spectrum the disabilities may be subtle, and often attributed to other causes. Common symptomatology in an individual with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders includes: attention problems, impulsivity, mood disorders, conduct and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms, drug and alcohol problems, impaired executive functioning, memory disturbances, learning disabilities, poor social skills and reduced ability to function independently as an adult. Because of the lack of widespread knowledge of this disorder by mental health providers, especially in the absence of mental retardation or dysmorphic features, individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are often not identified as having an organically based mental health, and/or cognitive disorder; thus reduces their ability to qualify for special support services found to improve long-term outcome. Despite the great need for neuropsychiatric treatment research that could lead to improved fetal alcohol spectrum disorders targeted multilevel mental health, and social support services, there is much the mental health professional can provide at this time to improve the lives of these individuals. Accordingly, the mental health community needs to be prepared, as the disorder becomes more widely recognized by affected patients and their families; they will be requesting formal diagnoses and sensitive, creative options to prenatal alcohol related problems in all areas of neuropsychiatric treatment.",

      "abstract": "En la actualidad los problemas auditivos, los accidentes cerebrovasculares y las enfermedades neurodegenerativas que afectan a la comprensión del lenguaje oral son muy frecuentes, debido principalmente al estilo de vida sedentario y el aumento de la edad de la población. La hipoacusia o daño en el sistema auditivo periférico impide que determinados sonidos verbales alcancen la vía auditiva y sean analizados por la corteza cerebral. Mientras que la ausencia de lenguaje oral puede ser por sordera, afasia o agnosia auditiva verbal. La ausencia total de audición periférica por alteración o ausencia del receptor auditivo y/o neuronas del ganglio espiral se denomina sordera (Bartolomé, 2015). La afasia y la agnosia auditiva verbal son dos trastornos ocasionados por un daño cortical específico. Hasta ahora, en la bibliografía española afasia y la agnosia auditiva verbal son consideradas dos enfermedades diferentes, siendo la segunda muy poco común en la práctica clínica. Aguado (2012) afirma que la agnosia auditiva verbal sucede tras una lesión bilateral de la parte posterior de la circunvolución temporal superior. Sin embargo, los autores Slevc y Shell (2015) han concluido que el 30% de los casos con agnosia auditiva verbal presentan una lesión unilateral, normalmente del hemisferio izquierdo. Por lo tanto, la distinción entre trastorno afásico y trastorno gnósico por la localización de la lesión no sería correcta. Además, los nuevos avances científicos y técnicos han permitido conocer que el procesamiento del lenguaje oral no solo depende de las áreas de asociación y el fascículo arcuato. La comprensión y la producción oral dependen de la vía ventral y la vía dorsal, que están formadas por complejos sistemas y áreas cerebrales de ambos hemisferios izquierdo y derecho (Hickok y Poeppel, 2004; Scott y Wise, 2004). Estos descubrimientos han llevado a la revisión de la clasificación de los síndromes afásicos y se ha creado una nueva clasificación que cambia la nomenclatura de los trastornos. González y Cuetos (2012) incluyen el término sordera dentro de la clasificación de los trastornos de la comprensión oral para referirse a un daño cortical. Barquero y Payno (2007) usan el mismo término para referirse a los trastornos gnósicos auditivos. Ardila y cols. (2016) usan indistintamente las denominaciones sordera verbal pura” y “agnosia auditiva verbal” para referirse a las lesiones en la corteza auditiva primaria.En la presente revisión, se pone en evidencia que el uso en la clínica de los términos sordera y agnosia, se utilizan indistintamente para denominar una lesión cortical, aun siendo dos patologías muy diferentes.",

Here, we are differentiating autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and dyslexia. New readings have revealed a higher rate of comorbidity between the neurodevelopmental and communicative syndromes of autism, ADHD, and dyslexia. Genetics, the environment, or a combination of other neurodevelopmental, mental health, or behavioural disorders may all be contributing factors to autism. Autistic people have a lack of communication, social skills, learning ability, eye contact, concentration, etc. Autism and ADHD might have similar signs. Focusing issues can affect kids with either illness. They might struggle to communicate or be impetuous. There is an overlap between autism and ADHD. Language abilities, conduct, social interaction, and learning capacity can all be impacted by autism spectrum disorders, which are a group of related developmental problems. ADHD is a common disorder that may disturb your ability to concentrate, keep up your self-control, or consider things through before performing. The comorbidity of NDDs with MHDs is very high. Worldwide, the diagnosis of childhood mental illnesses has dramatically increased, with the prevalence of several MHDs in the US increasing by two to three times over the past 20 years. This paper provides an overview of the types and efficacy of AI-assisted tools created by machine learning models and deep learning models used to solve learning issues in children with a variety of NDDs. Our study summarizes the research showing how AI tools can enhance social connection and supportive teaching. We offer suggestions for the creation of new AI tools with an emphasis on individualized learning for people with NDDs, based on the drawbacks of the current AI tools.",

      "abstract": "The clinical features of infantile aphasia include failure or delay in development of speech. When speech develops, it is frequently garbled. Hearing and intelligence may be normal although both are difficult to evaluate. Abnormal behavior may appear in these children simply because they lack normal opportunities to express themselves. It is pointed out that many of the children of 4 to 5 years of age with delayed speech development may not simply be \"deviates from the norm\" but may actually suffer from mild degrees of aphasia. Earlier recognition and proper guidance for milder types of aphasia will depend ultimately on better definition of the pattern and rate of normal speech development. At present, there apparently is little or no agreement either as to frequency or actuality of this syndrome in childhood. Unfortunately, mild cases are apt to be passed over and more severe ones are often tragically mislabeled as mental defectives.",

Deafness is a common problem and no age group is spared. Causes of hearing loss are numerous, and may be multifactorial in an individual. Important causes include trauma, including noise and air pressure changes; genetic hearing loss; infection, including rubella; drug damage, metabolic and neoplasia. Prompt detection and management of hearing loss in children is essential to ensure adequate development of language and associated skills. Untreated hearing loss in adults may cause them to withdraw from social activities. The patient with a hearing loss may represent difficult evaluation and management decisions. While individuals with defective hearing have a wide-ranging choice among absolutely attractive occupations, that choice is likely to be narrowed along with growing severity of the handicap. Hazardous, hearing-related, contact, and noisy occupations are not suitable for them. In handling such persons, due consideration should be given not only to the handicap proper but very much also to psychological aspects.",

      "title": "Contribution de l'analyse du signal vocal à la détection de l'état de somnolence et du niveau de charge mentale",
      "abstract": "Les exigences operationnelles du metier de pilote sont susceptibles d'engendrer de la somnolence et des niveaux de charge mentale inadequats (i.e., trop faible ou trop eleve) au cours des vols. Les dettes de sommeil et les perturbations circadiennes liees a divers facteurs (e.g., longues periodes de services, horaires de travail irregulier, etc.) demandent aux pilotes de repousser sans cesse leurs limites biologiques. Par ailleurs, la charge de travail mental des pilotes presente de fortes variations au cours d'un vol : elevee au cours des phases critiques (i.e., decollage et atterrissage), elle devient tres reduite pendant les phases de croisiere. Lorsque la charge mentale devient trop elevee ou, a l'inverse, trop faible, les performances se degradent et des erreurs de pilotage peuvent apparaitre. La mise en oeuvre de methodes de detection de l'etat de somnolence et du niveau de charge mentale en temps quasi reel est un defi majeur pour le suivi et le controle de l'activite de pilotage. L'objectif de la these est de determiner si la voix humaine peut permettre de detecter d'une part, l'etat de somnolence et d'autre part, le niveau de charge mentale d'un individu. Dans une premiere etude, la voix de participants a ete enregistree lors d'une tâche de lecture avant et apres une nuit de privation totale de sommeil (PTS). Les variations de l'etat de somnolence consecutives a la PTS ont ete evaluees au moyen de mesures auto-evaluatives et electrophysiologiques (ElectroEncephaloGraphie [EEG] et Potentiels Evoques [PEs]). Les resultats ont montre une variation significative apres la PTS de plusieurs parametres acoustiques lies : (a) a l'amplitude des impulsions glottiques (frequence de modulation d'amplitude), (b) a la forme du signal acoustique (longueur euclidienne du signal et ses caracteristiques associees) et (c) au spectre du signal des voyelles (rapport harmonique sur bruit, frequence du second formant, coefficient d'asymetrie, centre de gravite spectral, differences d'energie, pente spectrale et coefficients cepstraux a echelle Mel). La plupart des caracteristiques spectrales ont montre une sensibilite differente a la privation de sommeil en fonction du type de voyelles. Des correlations significatives ont ete mises en evidence entre plusieurs parametres acoustiques et plusieurs indicateurs objectifs (EEG et PEs) de l'etat de somnolence. Dans une seconde etude, le signal vocal a ete enregistre durant une tâche de rappel de listes de mots. La difficulte de la tâche etait manipulee en faisant varier le nombre de mots dans chaque liste (i.e., entre un et sept, correspondant a sept conditions de charge mentale). Le diametre pupillaire - qui est un indicateur objectif pertinent du niveau de charge mentale - a ete mesure simultanement avec l'enregistrement de la voix afin d'attester de la variation du niveau de charge mentale durant la tâche experimentale. Les resultats ont montre que des parametres acoustiques classiques (frequence fondamentale et son ecart type, shimmer, nombre de periodes et rapport harmonique sur bruit) et originaux (frequence de modulation d'amplitude et variations a court-terme de la longueur euclidienne du signal) ont ete particulierement sensibles aux variations de la charge mentale. Les variations de ces parametres acoustiques etaient correlees a celles du diametre pupillaire. L'ensemble des resultats suggere que les parametres acoustiques de la voix humaine identifies lors des experimentations pourraient representer des indicateurs pertinents pour la detection de l'etat de somnolence et du niveau de charge mentale d'un individu. Les resultats ouvrent de nombreuses perspectives de recherche et d'applications dans le domaine de la securite des transports, notamment dans le secteur aeronautique.",

      "title": "Aplicación de tecnologías asistenciales para el aumento de la capacidad de comunicación en personas afectadas de trastorno neuromotor",
      "abstract": "La presente Tesis Doctoral describe una serie de desarrollos de Tecnologia Asistencial enfocados al fomento de la comunicacion de personas afectadas por trastorno neuromotor, en particular de aquellas con afectacion fisica muy severa. El trastorno neuromotor no es una enfermedad, sino un compendio de todas las lesiones cerebrales que afectan a la movilidad y a la postura de las personas, siendo la Paralisis Cerebral (PC) la patologia de mayor incidencia. Una de las caracteristicas del trastorno neuromotor es que una afectacion persistente y no progresiva surgida por un dano o una malformacion del cerebro en el momento del embarazo (trastorno congenito) o bien por una lesion del mismo (trastorno adquirido) producida por infecciones del sistema nervioso central, accidentes, etc. Por anadidura, estos desordenes psicomotrices suelen estar frecuentemente acompanados de trastornos sensitivos, cognitivos, del lenguaje, perceptivos, de conducta, y / o epilepsia. Es evidente que la psicomotricidad esta intimamente relacionada con la comunicacion (en sentido integral, la transmision de un mensaje que sea entendido por el receptor, ya sea este un humano o una maquina), puesto que en ella hay una serie de musculos implicados que se ven afectados. Cuando el acto de transmision se ve entorpecido por las manifestaciones clinicas del trastorno neuromotor, la calidad de la emision disminuye y por lo tanto es mas improbable que el receptor entienda el mensaje, cayendo el emisor (la persona afectada de trastorno neuromotor) en una reclusion social. Afrontar este problema de la incomunicacion en la que se encuentran muchos de los afectados por la paralisis cerebral y por las demas patologias englobadas dentro del termino “trastorno neuromotor” es uno de los grandes retos a los que se enfrentan diariamente tanto los afectados como sus familiares. La ingenieria permite el uso de tecnologia por parte de las personas con necesidades especiales, las cuales mejoraran sin duda alguna su vida diaria. Pero la tecnologia ha de introducirse con la premisa fundamental de que ha de ser accesible, tanto en terminos de diseno de sus interfaces de usuario (hardware y software) como en terminos de coste de adquisicion, operacion y mantenimiento. De todos los desarrollos tecnologicos posibles, esta Tesis Doctoral se centra en aquellos destinados a paliar las manifestaciones fisicas del trastorno neuromotor, las cuales pueden ser muy variadas: distonia (contracciones involuntarias de los musculos), espasticidad (contraccion permanente de algunos musculos), movimientos atetosicos (movimientos lentos y sinuosos)… Estas manifestaciones son de indole cualitativo, siendo complejo realizar una baremacion de las mismas, por lo que se realizan desarrollos diferenciados segun la severidad de la afectacion motora en los usuarios. En aquellos usuarios en los que la afectacion motora de las extremidades de los miembros superiores es moderada, los dispositivos moviles se erigen como la alternativa mas accesible para los usuarios desde el punto de vista de la accesibilidad, entendida esta tanto como la facilidad de operacion como la posibilidad de adquisicion por una amplia variedad de economias familiares. En particular, el SO Android sera el seleccionado por su amplia cuota de mercado y su orientacion Open Source para el diseno e implementacion de Sistemas Alternativos y Aumentativos de Comunicacion (SAAC) que aprovechen tanto las formas de interaccion de las pantallas tactiles como la conexion de pulsadores adaptados, asi como la potencia de las bases de datos SQLite para la creacion y gestion de tableros de comunicacion basados en el uso de pictogramas. En el caso de una mayor severidad de la afectacion del trastorno neuromotor sobre las extremidades, la falta de perifericos externos de los dispositivos moviles (principalmente por la juventud de estos) desaconseja su uso en beneficio de ordenadores personales, y en particular, la implementacion de ratones virtuales que permitan a los usuarios la comunicacion a traves de pictogramas o de teclados virtuales. Puesto que dentro de la severidad de las manifestaciones clinicas, cada afectado presenta deficiencias motrices muy diferentes, los gestos que se han de poder capturar para operar estos ratones virtuales han de ser variados. Los desarrollos software han de ser por tanto transparentes a estos metodos de entrada, ya sean estos gestos basados en movimientos oculares, movimientos cefalicos u otro tipo de senales biomedicas tales como ondas electroencefalograficas (EEG) o Electromiografia (EMG), metodos de entrada todos ellos contemplados en los desarrollos aqui descritos. Se describira el desarrollo de SAAC basados en la interpretacion de gestos, adecuados para afectaciones severas, como aquellos basados en la interpretacion de la actividad cerebral mediante dispositivos procedentes del mundo de los videojuegos, adecuados para aquellas afectaciones que imposibiliten de manera completa la operacion de cualquier otro metodo de seleccion y accesibles por una amplia variedad de economias familiares. Fomentar la capacidad de comunicacion entre personas no es sino el primer objetivo de los trabajos que aqui se describiran. El ser humano ha de ser capaz no solo de desenvolverse en un medio social, sino tambien de interactuar con su entorno mas inmediato. No es el objetivo de estos trabajos la generacion de tecnologia o de adaptaciones destinadas a la mejora de la autonomia personal (tales como ortesis robotizadas, sillas de ruedas electricas o exoesqueletos), es decir, la promocion de la participacion de las personas en las Actividades de la Vida Diaria (AVD), sino que el campo de investigacion se limitara a la comunicacion entre humanos y en particular, a la promocion de las habilidades sociales que se fundamentan en la edad infantil y primaria, edades que coinciden con la etapa de mayor plasticidad cerebral y generacion de sinapsis neuronales. El fomento de la capacidad de comunicacion sera empleado por tanto para la promocion del uso de estas herramientas de Tecnologia Asistencial generadas en un entorno educativo, de modo que las nuevas capacidades desarrolladas puedan ser utilizadas para la realizacion de actividades de entrenamiento cerebral que refuercen esta reestructuracion de las conexiones neuronales. Los resultados obtenidos muestran que es posible el manejo de interfaces de accesos a dispositivos por parte de personas distonicas, pero que es necesario un entrenamiento fuerte. Asi mismo, se describira como una exhaustiva y metodologica recopilacion de requisitos de los usuarios, incluyendo en este concepto tanto a las personas afectadas de trastorno neuromotor como a sus cuidadores formales e informales, conduce a la creacion de herramientas tecnologicas capaces de ser empleadas fuera de los entornos de grupos de investigacion y por lo tanto, capaces de ser operadas y mantenidas sin la intervencion de tecnicos cualificados en instrumentacion y en la interpretacion y adquisicion de senales. Finalmente, se esbozaran lineas futuras de desarrollo que sobrepasen la “simple comunicacion” con humanos, permitiendo la comunicacion con todo tipo de maquinas y abriendo un abanico de mejoras en la autonomia de la vida de las personas que va desde el control de la domotica, al control de sillas de ruedas, ortesis robotizadas o la realizacion de terapias de rehabilitacion cognitivas y/o fisicas.",

      "title": "Post-stroke language disorders.",
      "abstract": "Post-stroke language disorders are frequent and include aphasia, alexia, agraphia and acalculia. There are different definitions of aphasias, but the most widely accepted neurologic and/or neuropsychological definition is that aphasia is a loss or impairment of verbal communication, which occurs as a consequence of brain dysfunction. It manifests as impairment of almost all verbal abilities, e.g., abnormal verbal expression, difficulties in understanding spoken or written language, repetition, naming, reading and writing. During the history, many classifications of aphasia syndromes were established. For practical use, classification of aphasias according to fluency, comprehension and abilities of naming it seems to be most suitable (nonfluent aphasias: Broca's, transcortical motor, global and mixed transcortical aphasia; fluent aphasias: anomic, conduction, Wernicke's, transcortical sensory, subcortical aphasia). Aphasia is a common consequence of left hemispheric lesion and most common neuropsychological consequence of stroke, with a prevalence of one-third of all stroke patients in acute phase, although there are reports on even higher figures. Many speech impairments have a tendency of spontaneous recovery. Spontaneous recovery is most remarkable in the first three months after stroke onset. Recovery of aphasias caused by ischemic stroke occurs earlier and it is most intensive in the first two weeks. In aphasias caused by hemorrhagic stroke, spontaneous recovery is slower and occurs from the fourth to the eighth week after stroke. The course and outcome of aphasia depend greatly on the type of aphasia. Regardless of the fact that a significant number of aphasias spontaneously improve, it is necessary to start treatment as soon as possible. The writing and reading disorders in stroke patients (alexias and agraphias) are more frequent than verified on routine examination, not only in less developed but also in large neurologic departments. Alexia is an acquired type of sensory aphasia where damage to the brain causes the patient to lose the ability to read. It is also called word blindness, text blindness or visual aphasia. Alexia refers to an acquired inability to read due to brain damage and must be distinguished from dyslexia, a developmental abnormality in which the individual is unable to learn to read, and from illiteracy, which reflects a poor educational background. Most aphasics are also alexic, but alexia may occur in the absence of aphasia and may occasionally be the sole disability resulting from specific brain lesions. There are different classifications of alexias. Traditionally, alexias are divided into three categories: pure alexia with agraphia, pure alexia without agraphia, and alexia associated with aphasia ('aphasic alexia'). Agraphia is defined as disruption of previously intact writing skills by brain damage. Writing involves several elements: language processing, spelling, visual perception, visuospatial orientation for graphic symbols, motor planning, and motor control of writing. A disturbance of any of these processes can impair writing. Agraphia may occur by itself or in association with aphasias, alexia, agnosia and apraxia. Agraphia can also result from 'peripheral' involvement of the motor act of writing. Like alexia, agraphia must be distinguished from illiteracy, where writing skills were never developed. Acalculia is a clinical syndrome of acquired deficits in mathematical calculation, either mentally or with paper and pencil. These language disturbances can be classified differently, but there are three principal types of acalculia: acalculia associated with language disturbances, including number paraphasia, number agraphia, or number alexia; acalculia secondary to visuospatial dysfunction with malalignment of numbers and columns, and primary anarithmetria entailing disruption of the computation process.",

Attention encompasses generalized activation of the cognitive processes of orienting, filtering, and selecting inputs; preparing for action; and maintaining thought on a stimulus, mental activity, or goal. Attention, a vital foundation for higher cognitive functions, maintains a coherent stream of thought. The ability to sustain attention, or vigilance, is necessary for complex behaviors, such as understanding and remembering a story. Therefore, attention must be tested first, before other cognitive functions. An inattentive patient’s failure to perform calculations sheds no light on arithmetic skills. Rather, attentional dysfunction is a central feature of syndromes due to diffuse cerebral dysfunction such as delirium, as well as syndromes due to focal cerebral damage such as the neglect syndrome. In addition, attentional dysfunction often accompanies other cognitive impairments in such common neurological.",

It is characterized by persistent antisocial and aggressive behaviors toward other children, adults and even animals, ranging from bullying, lying, theft and running away from home to more serious violations such as forced sexual acts, fire setting, destruction of property and even murder. Boys who receive diagnosis of conduct disorder are frequently involved in alcohol and substance abuse / dependence along with mild intellectual disability. Mild intellectual disability is commonly associated with conduct disorder among children and juveniles in forensic settings, which may masks symptoms of other disorders, makes treatment more difficult and carries worse prognosis overall.

Modern sleep research has opened important views into the structure of sleep and the pathophysiology of sleep disorders. In a narrower sense sleep disorders mean a deficiency of sleep (hyposomnia). This may concern the induction of sleep or its maintenance. Sleep disorders without underlying disease may be differentiated from those caused by different diseases. Hypersomnia may occur as a symptom of various cerebral dysfunctions and processes, as an episodic disorder (Kleine-Levin-syndrome) or as a part of the Pickwick-syndrome. In narcolepsy characteristic symptoms are sleep attacks, kataplexy (emotionally induced loss of muscle tone) and transient pareses during awakening. Disturbances linked with sleep are snoring, somnambulism, speaking and grinding of the teeth during sleep and nocturnal enuresis. They may constitute idiopathic disorders. On the other hand, there may be similarities between epileptic phenomena and these disorders. Some epilepsies demonstrate relations to the rhythm of sleep and wakefulness which become evident in the manifestation of seizures and epileptiform EEG activity at certain stages of vigilance.",

      "abstract": "Objective Ménière’s disease (MD) is a clinical condition defined by spontaneous vertigo attacks (each lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours) with documented low‐ to midfrequency sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear before, during, or after one of the episodes of vertigo. It also presents with fluctuating aural symptoms (hearing loss, tinnitus, or ear fullness) in the affected ear. The underlying etiology of MD is not completely clear, yet it has been associated with inner ear fluid (endolymph) volume increases, culminating in episodic ear symptoms (vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness). Physical examination findings are often unremarkable, and audiometric testing may or may not show low‐ to midfrequency sensorineural hearing loss. Conventional imaging, if performed, is also typically normal. The goals of MD treatment are to prevent or reduce vertigo severity and frequency; relieve or prevent hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness; and improve quality of life. Treatment approaches to MD are many and typically include modifications of lifestyle factors (eg, diet) and medical, surgical, or a combination of therapies. Purpose The primary purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to improve the quality of the diagnostic workup and treatment outcomes of MD. To achieve this purpose, the goals of this guideline are to use the best available published scientific and/or clinical evidence to enhance diagnostic accuracy and appropriate therapeutic interventions (medical and surgical) while reducing unindicated diagnostic testing and/or imaging.",

It is a clinical syndrome most often characterized by progressive deficits in several cognitive domains such as memory, language, and impairments in a person’s behavior and daily functional abilities. Dementia places considerable strain on patients and their relatives, who provide a large share of the required care and support. As the global population is aging, the burden of dementia has become a worldwide concern and will be further increasing over the next two decades. New pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions are urgently needed to address this huge challenge.",

      "title": "States of consciousness: new insights and further questions",
      "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of a severe brain injury survivors are usually in coma, which is characterised as a state of unresponsiveness without any understanding or purposeful functions, although reflex responses can still be elicited. If the injury is severe enough but not fatal, the coma can persist for days or weeks, but it is nonetheless recognised to be a transient condition which evolves into other defined conscious states. Consciousness may be regained, but if not signs of a persistent vegetative state (also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) or a minimally conscious state develop. Both the latter are characterised by spontaneous or induced eye opening and sleep wake cycles, with additional responses such as apparent crying, laughing, or smiling. In the minimally conscious state there are also reproducible if inconsistent visual, verbal, or gestural responses to particular stimuli. In both these states, signs depend on relatively intact brain stem function, contrasting with the locked-in syndrome, a condition in which brain stem dysfunction prevents a conscious person from demonstrating their awareness.1, 2 Recognition of the two states of reduced consciousness has informed treatment and management decisions. Families and others who can see obvious signs of improvement, in that a person is no longer completely unresponsive or comatose, often expect further recovery. Standard advice is that in adults and children the potential for recovery from the persistent vegetative state, and the time to allow, depends on the cause: significant improvement can still occur up to 12 months after traumatic injury, but only up to 3 months after a non-traumatic injury, such as near-drowning. The potential for recovery from a minimally responsive state may be better, but it is not clear by how much, or if the time scales differ. One group reported that in the first 3 months there is a good chance of reasonable recovery but this falls sharply with longer durations, especially after non-traumatic injuries. In the latter groups survivors may continue to improve in terms of responsiveness but most remain severely disabled.1, 3, 4 However, problems remain. Detailed definitions of the clinical features of the two states differ.3 Distinguishing the two states is clinically difficult, although specific scales increase diagnostic precision.2 It seems logical to expect that in some patients with additional brain stem damage a state of reduced consciousness might co-exist with a degree of locked-in syndrome. In addition, from personal experience some patients do not show spontaneous eye opening or sleep-wake cycles despite other responses suggestive of a minimally conscious state. Such cases are not defined or studied in the medical literature. Finally over the last few years functional neuroimaging studies, mostly in adults, have shown that some patients have much more cortical responsiveness than clinically suspected, meaning that some thought to be in a persistent vegetative state may be at least minimally conscious.5 In one study 13 out of 41 patients classified by a standard scale as being in the vegetative state showed activity compatible with a minimally conscious state on neuroimaging between 3 weeks and 8 years after the injury. Twelve months later some clinical improvement in consciousness had occurred in most, usually to a minimally conscious state. One, assessed approximately 5 weeks after a traumatic injury, had recovered fully but the other survivors were still severely disabled.5 Ideally perhaps patients should now all be assessed by functional neuroimaging, but that may be impractical. The predictive value of more accessible modalities such as EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation are still being explored. For all these, it would be clinically helpful if outcome studies followed a standard format to report the state and how it was assessed at fixed times after the injury, such as 3 months and 6 months, and the prognosis at 12 months or thereafter, subdivided into traumatic and non-traumatic groups. In the meantime all patients in such states should be assumed to have some awareness some of the time, which means for example that there must be adequate analgesia for painful conditions or procedures, and that further discussion is needed on the relationship between responsiveness and awareness. In children these difficulties are even more marked. There is limited data on both the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and outcome, especially in the very young age groups.1 Clinical scales have not been validated in children. Some studies of functional imaging have included children or young people but do not always report their data separately. Patient and medical groups should lobby for standardized outcome studies in children, which should be large enough to provide useful data for smaller subgroups.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia occurs in 1% of the world's population, regardless of country and culture. The prevalence of very early-onset schizophrenia (below age 13) is about 2 in a million children in the general population. In adolescence, the prevalence increases and the symptomatology becomes similar to disorders in adults. The clinical presentation comprises cognitive symptoms (distortions of thinking, delusions, hallucinations), emotional symptoms (e.g. blunted affect, mood disturbances, irritability), disturbances of speech and language as well as motor disturbances (motor disharmony, stupor or catatonia). The concept of positive and negative symptoms can also be applied to schizophrenic disorders of this age group. Diagnosis is made according to ICD-10 and DSM-IV criteria, but is more difficult than in adults. At an early age, false-positive diagnoses are frequent. Etiological factors comprise a genetic background, structural abnormalities of the brain, neurodevelopmental anomalies, electrophysiological dysfunctions, biochemical irregularities, and neurocognitive dysfunctions. An interaction of these factors with environmental influences such as distorted communication in the family and trauma is assumed. The etiological concept of the stress-vulnerability hypothesis has been complemented by the neurodevelopmental and the neurodegeneration hypothesis. Treatment is based on four components: antipsychotic medication, psychotherapeutic measures, family-oriented measures, and specific measures of rehabilitation for those patients whose disorder is likely to become chronic. Course and outcome of childhood and adolescentonset schizophrenia are poor and much worse than in adult patients.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Multiple Disorders of Sleep and Wakefulness with excessive movement, sleepiness or insomnia are common, affecting most children at some period of life. Profoundly affect the quality of life and even put it at risk. The aim of this study was to analyze sleep disorders in childhood . Literature Review: A review was made on aspects of normal sleep ontogenesis and management of sleep disorders most prevalent in childhood. Were selected scientific articles in SciELO database, using the keywords sleep disorders and childhood. Second, the literature studied can classify the sleep disorders in four clinical groups: a) are those in which primary sleep disorder is the main or only symptom, eg, nightmares, night terrors, insomnia, hypersomnia, sleep paralysis and narcolepsy b) secondary sleep disorders is only one aspect of a complex clinical change, such as schizophrenia, depression or thyroid dysfunction c) parasomnias activities are not indicative of pathology when awake, but they are certainly not during sleep as sleepwalking, bedwetting, bruxism and nocturnal jactatio capitis d) clinical changes that can be influenced by sleep, but little influence, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. In pediatric clinic the most frequent parasomnias and changes primary sleep. The insomnia generally results from poor educational practice and / or emotional disturbances. Remember that children with obstructive sleep disorders have worse results in the test of learning and memory. Conclusion: Sleep disturbances are very frequent complaints in pediatric outpatient clinics, and a correct diagnosis is essential for the establishment of appropriate therapy. In most cases, clinical history is sufficient for the diagnosis and assuring parents the mercy of the problem, and the best treatment.",

      "title": "PIK3CA-Related Segmental Overgrowth",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth includes disorders of brain (e.g., MCAP [megalencephaly-capillary malformation] syndrome, hemimegalencephaly); and segmental body overgrowth (e.g., CLOVES [congenital lipomatous asymmetric overgrowth of the trunk, lymphatic, capillary, venous, and combined-type vascular malformations, epidermal nevi, skeletal and spinal anomalies] syndrome, fibroadipose hyperplasia [FH]). Heterozygous (usually somatic mosaic) pathogenic variants of PIK3CA are causative. MCAP syndrome is characterized by the major findings of (1) megalencephaly (MEG) or hemimegalencephaly (HMEG) associated with neurologic findings of hypotonia, seizures, and mild to severe intellectual disability; and (2) cutaneous capillary malformations with focal or generalized somatic overgrowth. Additional findings can include digital anomalies (syndactyly, polydactyly), cortical malformations – most distinctively polymicrogyria (PMG); and variable connective tissue dysplasia. CLOVES (or CLOVE) syndrome and fibroadipose hyperplasia (FH) may be associated with (1) MEG or HMEG; and (2) patchy segmental overgrowth associated with skeletal anomalies, lipomatosis, vascular malformations, and epidermal nevi. Diagnosis/testing PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth is confirmed in an individual with a pathogenic variant on one PIK3CA allele, typically in affected tissues. Because the vast majority of PIK3CA pathogenic variants arise postzygotic (and are thus mosaic), more than one tissue may need to be tested. Failure to detect a PIK3CA pathogenic variant does not exclude a clinical diagnosis of the PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth disorders in individuals with suggestive features. Management Treatment of manifestations: Significant or lipomatous segmental overgrowth may require debulking; scoliosis and leg-length discrepancy may require orthopedic care and surgical intervention. Neurologic complications (e.g., obstructive hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure, progressive and/or symptomatic cerebellar tonsillar ectopia or Chiari malformation; epilepsy in those with HMEG) may warrant neurosurgical intervention. Routine treatment of the following, when present, is indicated: cardiac and renal abnormalities; intellectual disabilities and behavior problems; motor difficulties; speech, swallowing, and feeding difficulties. Surveillance: MCAP syndrome: Follow up no less than every six months until age six years and at least yearly thereafter to monitor for neurosurgical complications, breathing or sleep disorders, seizures and orthopedic complications. Provisionally recommended imaging in early childhood includes brain MRI every six months for the first two years, then yearly until age eight years for neurologic complications (e.g., hydrocephalus, cerebellar tonsillar ectopia). Consider screening for Wilms tumor following the protocol suggested for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) (by ultrasound examination every 3 months until age 8 years); however, tumor risk in PIK3CA-related segmental overgrowth is undetermined and appears to be lower than in BWS. CLOVES syndrome and FH: Monitoring for severe scoliosis, infiltrative lipomatous overgrowth, paraspinal high-flow lesions with spinal cord ischemia, lymphatic malformations, cutaneous vesicles, orthopedic problems, central phlebectasias, and thromboembolism. Genetic counseling PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth is not typically inherited. Most affected individuals with MCAP reported to date (21/24) had somatic mosaicism for pathogenic variants in PIK3CA, suggesting that mutation occurred post-fertilization in one cell of the multicellular embryo. Two of 24 affected individuals had a de novo germline pathogenic variant in PIK3CA. All reported individuals with CLOVES and FH had somatic mosaicism for pathogenic variants in PIK3CA. No confirmed instances of vertical transmission or sib recurrence have been reported. Because family members are not known to have an increased risk, prenatal diagnosis is usually not indicated for family members.",

      "title": "A legal study of children with emotional disturbance and mental health needs and implications for practice.",
      "abstract": "I. OVERVIEWAccording to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 5.1% of children aged 4-17 years have parents who identified that their child has an emotional or behavioral difficulty.1 Additionally, almost 2.9 million children have been prescribed medication for such difficulties.2 These emotional or behavioral difficulties may include a variety of mental disorders captured under various umbrella terms such as emotional disturbance (ED), behavioral disorders, or mental illness.3 As National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities indicates, [b]eneath these umbrella terms, there is actually a wide range of specific conditions that differ from one another in their characteristics and treatment.4 These conditions include (but are not limited to): anxiety disorders; bipolar disorder (sometimes called manic-depression); conduct disorders; eating disorders; obsessivecompulsive disorder (OCD); psychotic disorders;5 disruptive behavior; pervasive development; and elimination, affective, schizophrenic, and tic disorders.6 Equally varied is etiology of an ED with origins in adverse childhood experiences, such as child abuse, neglect, growing up in extremely dysfunctional homes, and genetic predisposition.7Mental health problems and symptoms can range from very mild to extremely severe, including instances when hospitalization is necessary to treat most serious cases.8 A child may be suffering from mental illness if they show following general symptons: changes in school performance, drug abuse, inability to cope, changes in sleeping, defying authority, frequent outbursts of anger, and hyperactivity.9 Serious symptoms can include: hearing voices, hallucinating, and aggressive behavior.10Statistics have also highlighted that mental illness in children often remains undiscovered for far too long11 with an estimated one-third of mental illnesses in children being undetected.12 However, mental illnesses can be diagnosed or recognized during childhood as half of all lifetime cases of mental illness begin[] by age 14 and three-quarters by age 24.13Diagnosis is particularly critical because it is a widely held and fundamental principle that early identification14 and detection is key to meeting needs of individuals with disabilities; mental illness is no exception. In a State Legislation Report, National Alliance on Mental Illness states that:[T]he shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn, provided a major impetus for lawmakers to propose legislation which would impact children and adults living with mental illness. Mental illness came to forefront of nation's attention when medical records revealed that shooter's mother was increasingly concerned about his deteriorating mental health and had been dissatisfied with lack of school services dating back to middle school.15The Alliance posits that nature of these tragedies underscores the lack of access to mental health services and barriers that many families and individuals face in light of nation's fragmented and grossly inadequate mental health system.16 In reaction to Newtown tragedy, mental health organizations advocated for policies supporting early identification and intervention; training for school personnel, families, and public; mental health services in schools; and increased access to care.17 Action at state level has seen legislators taking a proactive role in identification process by increasing mental health screening, identifying emerging mental illness in children and adolescents, ensuring adequate access to care, focusing on early intervention, providing school-based services, and providing staff training to prevent future tragedies.18There are varied reasons why early detection of mental illnesses in children has been traditionally problematic.19 According to Yael Zakai Cannon, there are many challenges that families and children with mental health needs experience in an attempt to secure appropriate behavioral and educational services. …",

      "title": "Beyond the motor impairment in dyskinetic cerebral palsy: neuropsychological and connectome-based approach",
      "abstract": "La paralisis cerebral (PC) se define como un grupo de trastornos del movimiento y/o la postura y de la funcion motora debidos a una lesion, interferencia o anomalia no progresiva en un cerebro inmaduro o en desarrollo. Estos trastornos motores a menudo se acompanan de alteraciones sensoriales, de la percepcion, de la cognicion, de la comunicacion, del comportamiento o de epilepsia, y se ha evidenciado que estos deficits pueden tener un mayor impacto sobre la calidad de vida que el propio deficit motor. Teniendo en cuenta la clasificacion de la PC segun el tipo de afectacion motora se identifica que la PC discinetica es un subtipo poco frecuente (entre el 3% y el 15% de todos los casos) que se caracteriza por patrones anormales de postura y/o movimiento, acompanados de movimientos involuntarios, descontrolados, recurrentes y, ocasionalmente, estereotipados. Este tipo de PC se ha asociado principalmente a procesos de hipoxia-isquemia en bebes nacidos a termino o casi a termino, y a la presencia de ictericia grave. Se ha evidenciado como la PC discinetica es mas incapacitante que otros tipos de PC, no solo por su asociacion con una mayor afectacion motriz sino tambien por una mayor presencia y gravedad de deficits asociados, como una mayor afectacion del habla y de la comunicacion.\nCabe destacar que los estudios que han analizado este tipo de PC son todavia escasos, probablemente debido a su menor frecuencia y mayor gravedad. Especialmente escasos son los estudios cognitivos y de neuroimagen, ya que las pruebas neuropsicologicas requieren de una destreza manual y/o de respuestas verbales y los estudios de neuroimagen implican la adquisicion de secuencias de resonancia magnetica en donde la persona debe permanecer quieta. \nLos estudios cognitivos realizados hasta el momento se focalizan principalmente en el rendimiento intelectual general, y evidencian que entre el 52% y el 65% de los casos presenta discapacidad intelectual. No obstante, cabe destacar que no existe un consenso sobre como evaluar el rendimiento intelectual en esta poblacion, con una gran variabilidad entre estudios. La aplicacion de tests psicometricos que requieren habilidades manipulativas y/o respuestas verbales pueden estar emmascarando e infravalorando el rendimiento intelectual real de estas personas. Los estudios que se focalizan en el rendimiento en funciones cognitivas especificas son escasos y se basan en muestras muy reducidas que a menudo no superan los 8 casos. Por otro lado, los estudios cualitativos de neuroimagen han hallado una afectacion de ganglios basales y talamo. Las primeras evidencias de estudios de resonancia magnetica de difusion apuntan a una afectacion mas extensa, con una mayor afectacion de la sustancia blanca. \nEs por ello que esta tesis tiene como objetivos principales: 1) identificar una medida objetiva de inteligencia adecuada para la gran heterogeneidad que existe en la PC, 2) describir el perfil cognitivo de una muestra relativamente amplia de personas con PC discinetica, y 3) analizar el estado de la sustancia blanca cerebral de esta poblacion mediante la tecnica del conectoma. Para ello se incluyeron en el estudio un total de 52 sujetos con PC discinetica y 52 sujetos control, a quienes se les administro una bateria neuropsicologia que evaluaba el rendimiento cognitivo general (mediante las Matrices progresivas de Raven - version color, el Test de vocabulario en imagenes de Peabody - III y la Escala no verbal de aptitud intelectual de Wechsler) y cinco dominios cognitivos especificos (atencion, visuopercepcion, lenguaje, aprendizaje y memoria y funcion ejecutiva) y se les realizo un estudio de resonancia magnetica estructural. \nLos resultados comparando las diferentes pruebas de inteligencia muestran un mayor potencial de las Matrices progresivas de Raven. Esta prueba demuestra una gran aplicabilidad en la PC, incluso en casos con una grave afectacion motora y pocas habilidades comunicativas. Tambien se evidencia que proporciona informacion completa sobre el rendimiento en funciones cognitivas especificas, tanto visuales como verbales, y que es sensible al estado de la estructura cerebral en fibras de asociacion y de proyeccion y estructuras subcorticales como los ganglios basales y el talamo.\nEn relacion al perfil cognitivo de la PC discinetica, los resultados a nivel grupal han evidenciado un rendimiento cognitivo por debajo del grupo control en todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas a excepcion de la memoria de reconocimiento verbal. No obstante, estas alteraciones cognitivas se han relacionado con la alteracion motriz, hallandose una afectacion cognitiva mas generalizada a medida que incrementa la gravedad motora. En los casos mas leves, aquellos en los que existe deambulacion autonoma, se ha evidenciado un rendimiento similar al del grupo control en casi todas las funciones evaluadas a excepcion de las funciones visuoperceptivas, atencionales y de la memoria visual. Los casos moderados, en los que se requiere de ayuda para la deambulacion, han mostrado las mismas alteraciones cognitivas y se anaden dificultades en las areas de lenguaje receptivo. En el grupo mas grave, aquellos casos en que no es posible la deambulacion, se observa el mismo rendimiento que con el grupo general (un rendimiento inferior en todas las funciones cognitivas a excepcion de la memoria de reconocimiento verbal).\n En el estudio de neuroimagen realizado en una submuestra de 25 participantes con PC y 24 sujetos control, se ha demostrado una disrupcion de la conectividad cerebral a diferentes niveles (global, regional y a nivel de conexion). Este patron se caracteriza por una disrupcion generalizada de la sustancia blanca cerebral, pero una afectacion mas localizada de la integridad de esta, que incluye areas mas posteriores (parietal, occipital y temporal) y una relativa preservacion de las areas prefrontales. Tambien se evidencia alteracion en la conectividad hipocampal, asi como de estructuras subcorticales (principalmente en putamen y talamo). Por ultimo, se ha hallado una correlacion entre el estado de la sustancia blanca de la circuiteria sensoriomotora y el nivel de gravedad motriz (tanto gruesa como fina) y se ha evidenciado como la red formada por conexiones fronto-estriatales y fronto-parietales juega un papel relevante en el rendimiento cognitivo general de estos sujetos. \nEn el presente trabajo se discuten estos resultados en relacion a la literatura previa tanto en el ambito de la PC como en otras patologias, asi como teniendo en cuenta el desarrollo normativo.",

      "title": "NEW ADVANCES IN TREATMENT OF CEREBRAL PALSY",
      "abstract": "Objectives: Cerebral palsy is an umbrella term covering a group of non-progressive, but often changing, motor impairment syndromes secondary to lesions or anomalies of the brain arising in the early stages of its development (DM & CN, 1992, 34: 547–55). Cerebral palsy is the most frequent motor impairment in childhood, but, it is more than merely a motor disorder. There can be also problems of development, perceptual- cognitive impairment, social and functional problems of daily living, emotional and behavioural problems, Epilepsy, and many other difficulties. There are an estimated 15 million people with cerebral palsy around the world and more then half of them are mentally retarded and one third have epilepsy How to treat it? Having in mind a broad spectrum of differences in age of persons at which firm diagnosis is made, inclusions and exclusions criteria, denominator for clinical features (topographical or other classification), and especially what was a cause and timing of insult, size and location of lesion, maturational state of system injured, integrity of areas surrounding and contralateral to lesion, genetic and environmental background, gene-gene and geneenvironment interactions, and intervening conditions (timing of start, quality, duration and intensity), it is obvious that there are currently no evidence-based strategies for preventing cerebral palsy and to say which method of treatment is superior. In addition to this fact we should find a balance between physiotherapy (among them nowadays the most used Neurodevelopmental treatment – Bobath, Vojta, Conductive education and Constrain induced therapy), pharmacology, and neurosurgical approaches (Local anaesthetics, Local neurolytics -Alcohol, Phenol-, Botulinum toxin, Baclofen pump, Selective dorsal rhizotomy, Peripheral neurectomy, Deep brain stimulation). Beside this there are many not proven therapies (Biofeedback, Functional Motor Learning, Acupuncture, The “Adeli” suit, Hyperbaric oxygenation, Homeopathy, Bio-energy, and others). Gene and transplantation therapies? Even for genetic causes of early brain lesions (e.g. as is thrombophilias) are only a very small proportion of potential candidate genes have been examined to date, how can we expect that in the near future we will have a gene therapy. Stem cells – to repopulate brain? Indeed, there is now ample evidence that stem cells exist in the central nervous system throughout life, and the progeny of these stem cells may have the ability to assume the functional role of neural cells that have been lost. In addition, once transplanted, stem cells have been shown to survive, migrate, and differentiate. But nevertheless, the clinical utility of stem cell therapy for neurorestoration remains elusive.",

      "title": "Resolution of stuttering during ketamine treatment: a case report",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Stuttering may include repetition of words in whole or part, difficulty saying words, and elongated pauses in speech. Approximately 5% of children stutter for a period lasting 6 months or more. Most of those children stop stuttering as they approach adulthood, but the condition persists in approximately 1% of adults. The cause of stuttering is unknown. Adults who stutter face substantial burdens in many aspects of their lives. Stutterers may choose not to pursue meaningful employment opportunities, may not be hired for positions they seek, or may be denied promotions or positive performance evaluations. Stuttering can cause physical tension from fear of speaking. Social challenges arise when a person who stutters is seen as less capable or of lower intelligence than fluent speakers. Stuttering causes emotional difficulties through the frustration and embarrassment that disfluent speakers feel. Stutterers may experience a general loss of self-esteem and personal satisfaction in life. Speech therapy is the primary intervention for stuttering. Medications have been investigated as treatments for stuttering, but no medication has been identified that has widespread effectiveness. Case presentation A 60-year-old white non-Hispanic woman who had been a near lifelong stutterer was prescribed ketamine for an unrelated condition and experienced an almost immediate resolution of her stuttering. Conclusions Many possible pharmacological treatments for stuttering have been studied. Some medications appear to be effective in some patients; some appear to be more generally effective but have negative side effects. No reporting in relevant literature has addressed a possible role for ketamine in stuttering treatment. On the basis of this case report, research on the effect of ketamine on stuttering would be useful. Any effective treatment for stuttering would have a significant positive effect on quality of life for persons who stutter.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics EED-related overgrowth is characterized by fetal or early childhood overgrowth (tall stature, macrocephaly, large hands and feet, and advanced bone age) and intellectual disability that ranges from mild to severe. To date, EED overgrowth has been reported in eight individuals. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of EED overgrowth is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous germline EED pathogenic variant by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Developmental delay / intellectual disability requires early referral for developmental support and educational interventions tailored to the child's needs. Seizures, cervical spine instability, palatal abnormalities, kyphoscoliosis, congenital heart defects, cryptorchidism, and ophthalmologic findings are treated per standard practice. Surveillance: Routine assessment of the following: development; spine for scoliosis or deformities; joint range of motion for joint contractures; and eyes for refractive errors, myopia, and strabismus. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Activities that involve rapid neck motion and/or possible trauma to the head and neck region (e.g., contact sports or thrill rides at amusement parks) because of the possible increased risk for cervical spine instability. Genetic counseling EED overgrowth is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date all probands whose parents have undergone molecular genetic testing have the disorder as a result of a de novo EED pathogenic variant. The risk to the sibs of the proband depends on the genetic status of the proband's parents: if the EED pathogenic variant found in the proband cannot be detected in the leukocyte DNA of either parent, the recurrence risk to sibs is estimated to be 1% because of the theoretic possibility of parental germline mosaicism. Once a family member has a confirmed molecular diagnosis of EED overgrowth, prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.",

Three different symptoms can be described from the cases reported in the literature: disorder of voluntary lid closing and/or opening, cortical ptosis, and inability to keep the eyes closed for more than a few seconds (,,motor impersistance\"). This last symptom can be considered as an unspecific sign of brain-damage. For the disturbance of voluntary lid opening/closure, the term ,,cortical palsy\" of lid movements is proposed. Thus this symptom can be differentiated from other supranuclear disorders of lid movements where reflectory and/or spontaneous lid movements are also impaired. As in all cases reported, the elementary motility of the eyelids (opening and closure) is impaired, it is not possible to ascertain whether a lid-apraxia is present.",

On average, 20% of people over 70 years of age need help in at least one of the 6 basic activities of daily living. The ability to cope in everyday life is affected by the reduction of physical fitness, sensory impairment and the effects of chronic conditions, falls and injuries. Deterioration of physical fitness is a consequence of muscle mass and strength reduction, impaired neuromuscular function resulted in slowing nerve conduction and reaction time, deterioration of balance, coordination and central transmission. Vision and hearing disorders are a consequence of aging and diseases. Cognition impairment, important for an independence, may be a consequence of degenerative changes in the CNS or dementia. Numerous studies have confirmed the relationship of involutional changes, accompanying diseases, falls and injures with limitations in daily functioning, and maintaining physical activity and implementation of a comprehensive geriatric assessment into geriatric care with an early diagnosis of deficits and implementation of intervention can prevent or delay the disclosure of disability.",

      "title": "Orthorexia nervosa – a different lifestyle or a specific eating disorder?",
      "abstract": "Orthorexia nervosa (ON) is considered an obsession with healthy eating, a phenomenon that includes excessive dietary restrictions, which in turn can lead to metabolic dysfunctions. Although the nosological status of this pathology is currently insufficiently determined, ON attracts the interest of mental health specialists due to the possible harmful psychological and biological consequences, its high prevalence in the general population and the difficulty of adequate therapeutic management (low level of insight and lack of evidence-based treatments). Orthorexia nervosa should be distinguished from other mental disorders with which it has a high degree of clinical overlap (obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa, restrictive/avoidant eating disorder etc.), but also from “healthy orthorexia” (this being considered part of a lifestyle focused on eliminating foods labeled as “impure”, “toxic” or “artificial”). The analysis of risk factors for ON highlights the importance of several obsessive-compulsive personality traits (perfectionism, rigidity, self-control), executive dysfunctions, internalization of social models (thinness or perfect health, for example), media pressure, parental and social group influences, belonging to certain professional categories (nutritionists, medical students, athletes) or practicing yoga. Several psychometric instruments for measuring the severity of ON have been developed over the last two decades, but they should be used with caution because not all of them have well-established validity. Also, several sets of diagnostic criteria have been proposed in order to identify the clinical features of orthorexia nervosa and to differentiate these patients from those diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, obsessive-compulsive disorder, somatoform disorders or nonpathological orthorexic behaviors. Finally, some therapeutic suggestions are presented, mainly psychotherapies, but it should be mentioned that they are based on case studies or on the extrapolation of data from trials dedicated to pathologies considered to be related to orthorexia nervosa. In conclusion, because ON is a nosological entity that has only recently been cornered, there is an urgent need to explore psychometric tools with higher specificity and to find more widely accepted diagnostic criteria. Also, no clear, evidence-based therapeutic recommendations could yet be formulated, because no clinical trial focused on the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in patients with orthorexia nervosa has been conducted.",

      "title": "The challenge of sleep management in military operations.",
      "abstract": "It has long been known that short-term (days) insufficient sleep causes decrements in mental effectiveness that put individuals at increased risk of committing errors and causing accidents. More recently, it has been discovered that chronic poor sleep (over years) is associated with a variety of negative health outcomes (metabolic syndrome, obesity, degraded behavioral health). Implementing an effective sleep health program is, therefore, in the best interests of active duty personnel and their families both in the short- and long-term. Like managing physical activity or nutrition, effectively managing sleep health comes with its unique set of challenges arising from the fact that individuals who routinely do not obtain sufficient sleep are generally desensitized to feeling sleepy and are poor at judging their own performance capabilities--and individuals cannot be compelled to sleep. For these reasons, an optimally effective sleep health program requires 3 components: (1) a rigorous, evidence-based sleep education component to impart actionable knowledge about optimal sleep amounts, healthy sleep behaviors, the known benefits of sleep, the short- and long-term consequences of insufficient sleep, and to dispel myths about sleep; (2) a nonintrusive device that objectively and accurately measures sleep to empower the individual to track his/her own sleep/wake habits; and (3) a meaningful, actionable metric reflecting sleep/wake impact on daily effectiveness so that the individual sees the consequences of his/her sleep behavior and, therefore, can make informed sleep health choices.",

      "title": "The frailty process: update of the phenotype and preventive strategies",
      "abstract": "Frailty has long been considered synonymous with disability and co-morbidity, to be highly prevalent in old age and to confer high risk for falls, hospitalization, and mortality. However it is becoming recognized that frailty may be a distinct clinical syndrome with a biologic basis. The frailty process appears as a transitional state in the dynamic progression from robustness through to functional decline. During this process, total physiological reserves decrease, and become less likely to be sufficient to maintain and repair the ageing body. The lack of consensus on the definition of frailty is partially related to the widespread use of the expression for different aspects of the condition. Longitudinal studies have demonstrated that slow gait, fatigue, exhaustion, anorexia, unintentional weight loss and reduced muscle strength should all be considered as major symptoms of frailty. At the stage of frailty, clinicians can easily distinguish frail from non-frail older adults using factors such as appearance (consistent or not with age), nutritional status (thin, weight loss), subjective health rating (health perception), performance (cognition, fatigue), sensory/physical impairments (vision, hearing, strength), and current care (medication, hospital). The process of “becoming frail” is silent and insidious. A better understanding of these clinical changes and their underlying mechanisms, beginning with the pre-frail state, may confirm the impression held by many geriatricians, that increasing frailty is distinguishable from ageing, and in consequence is potentially reversible. We therefore provide an update of the physiopathology and clinical, and biological characteristics of the frailty process, and speculate on possible preventive approaches.",

      "abstract": "Cerebral palsy (CP) is defined as non-progressive damage to the brain at or around birth, which leads to varying symptoms depending on the extent and location of damage. The leading symptom is sensory-motor impairment of varying expression, but additional perceptual, cognitive, and socio-emotional symptoms are common. CP can be divided into four types, with bilateral spastic being by far the most frequent, followed by the unilateral spastic, the dyskinetic, and the ataxic variants. The intellectual, linguistic, and cognitive profile of CP is extremely variant, but all qualities correlate more or less with CP type and motor impairment. Early diagnosis is important since early intervention may promote all developmental dimensions. Generally, individuals with unilateral spastic CP have the best (almost normal) intellectual, linguistic, and cognitive outcomes, while those with bilateral spastic CP fare the worst. Language perception is often an individual strength, while language expression, and particularly speech, may be heavily impaired. Attention and executive functions are often impaired as compared to typically developing controls, even in those children with normal intellectual functioning. The same holds true for visual perceptual functions, which are impaired in almost half of all children and adolescents with CP. The potential neuropsychological dysfunctions are a risk factor for arithmetic functions and literacy. Obstacles to participate in society are high for individuals with CP and heavily dependent on their motor, language, intellectual, and cognitive functions. However, quality of life is good for most children and adolescents, and they develop a sound self-concept. On the other side, bully experience is more common than amongst typically developing children and is associated with behavior problems and executive dysfunction. The development of children and adolescents with CP is determined by a complex interplay between physical, intellectual, and neuropsychological functions.",

Puede generar déficit notables en funciones psicológicas importantes como la ejecutiva, la atención o la memoria y evolucionar hasta un cuadro de pseudodemencia susceptible de mejorar con tratamiento antidepresivo.Objetivo: describir el funcionamiento de la memoria explícita en el trastorno depresivo mayor. Materiales y métodos: se hizo una búsqueda en la base de datos PUBMED con las palabras clave “major depression” (depresión mayor), “explicit memory” (memoria explícita) y “recollection memory” (memoria de recolección); se tomaron los artículos publicados después del año 2000; adicionalmente se incluyó bibliografía científica relevante para el cumplimiento del objetivo. Desarrollo: en la neuroanatomía del trastorno depresivo mayor se encuentran implicadas redes fronto-subcorticales (como las áreas prefrontales, tálamo, ganglios basales, hipocampo, entre otras). Estas estructuras pueden presentar atrofias que explicarían la persistencia o cronicidad de algunos de los síntomas cognitivos de la depresión. Las alteraciones en la memoria explícita, declarativa o de recolección, son de particular importancia por ser las más frecuentemente encontradas en sujetos con uno o más episodios depresivos mayores, y la estructura cerebral que se ha correlacionado más directamente con alteraciones en el almacenamiento de la memoria explícita es el hipocampo. Se ha observado actividad continua de neurogénesis en el hipocampo de animales adultos, la cual es especialmente susceptible cuando hay exposición prolongada a situaciones de estrés grave. Esto se evidencia en estudios que han encontrado reducido su volumen en sujetos con trastorno depresivo mayor, en comparación con individuos sanos. De todas maneras, aunque no se encuentre una reducción marcada del volumen, se sugiere que hay una alteración de su funcionamiento.Conclusiones: la memoria explícita es un proceso psicológico con base biológica precisa, cuya estructura y funcionamiento se alteran en presencia de una condición menos precisa como la depresión mayor.",

Examination revealed neurologic and neuropsychological signs consistent with right-hemisphere dysfunction. Most of the patients avoided eye contact and lacked the gestures and prosody that normally accompany and accentuate speech. Although many of them could not convey their feelings, there was no evidence that they were unable to experience affect. Eight of them reported a family history of similar symptoms.

Although diagnosis and classification rely heavily on the patient's report of subjectively experienced symptoms, the assessment of the underlying psychopathological process can be impaired by the patient's distorted self-image, his cognitive abnormalities, and his limited capacity to express himself verbally. Non-verbal behaviour, however, lends itself to objective and generalisable assessments: it can be reliably and accurately observed and measured, and although subject to cultural influence, it is the infant's most elementary form of self-expression (Gaebel, 1990). In addition, it plays a major role in interpersonal communication, which is disturbed in all psychiatric disorders. Therefore, the analysis of non-verbal behavioural dysfunction offers an important approach to the complex biopsychosocial framework of mental disorders.",

      "title": "Neuropsychologic functioning in autism: Profile of a complex information processing disorder",
      "abstract": "Neurobehavioral theories of autism have hypothesized core deficits in sensory input or perception, basic attentional abilities or generalized attention to extrapersonal space, anterograde memory, auditory information processing, higher order memory abilities, conceptual reasoning abilities, executive function, control mechanisms of attention, and higher order abilities across domains. A neuropsychologic battery designed to investigate these hypotheses was administered to 33 rigorously diagnosed autistic individuals with IQ scores greater than 80, and 33 individually matched normal controls. Stepwise discriminant function was used to define the profile of neuropsychologic functioning across domains. The neuropsychologic profile in these autistic individuals was defined by impairments in skilled motor, complex memory, complex language, and reasoning domains, and by intact or superior performance in the attention, simple memory, simple language, and visual-spatial domains. This profile is not consistent with mental retardation or with a general deficit syndrome, but rather with a selective impairment in complex information processing that does not involve visual-spatial processing. This profile is not consistent with a single primary deficit, but with a multiple primary deficit model in which the deficit pattern within and across domains is reflective of the complexity of the information processing demands. This neuropsychologic profile is furthermore consistent with the neurophysiologic characterization of autism as a late information processing disorder with sparing of early information processing.",

Su evolucion natural sin tratamiento puede derivar en serias repercusiones negativas en el funcionamiento academico, social y familiar de los ninos, interfiriendo de forma importante en el desarrollo. Su identificacion puede ser dificil pues, en ocasiones, son expresiones exageradas o temporalmente inadecuadas de lo que se consideran reacciones normales y adaptativas: el miedo y la ansiedad. Los TA incluyen trastornos de inicio especifico en la infancia y adolescencia (ej. el trastorno de separacion) y otros cuya expresion sindromica es semejante a los TA del adulto (ej. trastorno de panico). Las manifestaciones de los TA son polimorfas y desconcertantes en ocasiones (quejas fisicas variadas, rechazo a ir al colegio, comportamientos de apego excesivo a los padres o a los principales cuidadores, resistencia a ir a dormir, hiperactividad y oposicionismo, etc.). La consulta del pediatra es el lugar idoneo para establecer un diagnostico de presuncion y proceder a la indagacion y posterior confirmacion de aquel. El pediatra debe estar familiarizado con el diagnostico, las herramientas basicas de tratamiento y los procedimientos de derivacion a salud mental. Las principales modalidades de tratamiento en la practica clinica son la terapia cognitivo-comportamental (TCC), las intervenciones informativas para familiares y el tratamiento farmacologico. Aunque se han producido importantes avances en el desarrollo y aplicacion de tratamientos para los TA, aun existe un numero limitado de estudios que prueben la eficacia de los mismos.",

The etiology of these symptoms is complex; there may be autonomic and pelvic nerve dysfunction (with attenuation of voluntary motor function and impaired anorectal sensation and anorectal reflexes), or generalized systemic factors (e.g., altered diet and behavior, impaired mobility, psychological disturbances or drug adverse effects). The mainstay of current treatment is adapting a conservative approach towards reversing the systemic effects and optimizing the mechanics of defecation through the use of laxatives and irrigation approaches. When successful, this approach improves both evacuation and incontinence symptoms, with associated improvements in quality of life and independence. Future therapies may be directed at modulating pelvic innervation through electrical stimulation. Stoma formation remains an option for patients refractory to other approaches.",

Dysphagia is thought to affect up to 20% of people older than 50, greater numbers of patients admitted to hospitals and even greater numbers admitted to nursing homes. Impairment of swallowing decreases quality of life and can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Dysphagia may arise from the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx or along the length of the oesophagus. It is not to be confused with other associated symptoms such as odynophagia (pain on swallowing) or globus sensation (a sensation in the throat, commonly of a 'lump'). Dysphonia is a disorder of voice, dysarthria a disorder of speech and dysphasia one of language. It is important to understand these definitions to tease out a collection of frequently overlapping presenting symptoms, of which dysphagia is commonly the most important to the patient. Moreover, the association of dysphagia with other symptoms can aid in the identification of its cause (e.g. association of dysphagia, odynophagia and ipsilateral reflected otalgia is suspicious of an underlying pharyngeal carcinoma).",

      "abstract": "Autistic symptoms begin in the first years of life, and recent magnetic resonance imaging studies have discovered brain growth abnormalities that precede and overlap with the onset of these symptoms. Recent postmortem studies of the autistic brain provide evidence of cellular abnormalities and processes that may underlie the recently discovered early brain overgrowth and arrest of growth that marks the first years of life in autism. Alternative origins and time tables for these cellular defects and processes are discussed. These cellular and growth abnormalities are most pronounced in frontal, cerebellar, and temporal structures that normally mediate the development of those same higher order social, emotional, speech, language, speech, attention, and cognitive functions that characterize autism. Cellular and growth pathologies are milder and perhaps nonexistent in other structures (e.g., occipital cortex), which are known to mediate functions that are often either mildly affected or entirely unaffected in autistic patients. It is argued that in autism, higher order functions largely fail to develop normally in the first place because frontal, cerebellar, and temporal cellular and growth pathologies occur prior to and during the critical period when these higher order neural systems first begin to form their circuitry. It is hypothesized that microstructural maldevelopment results in local and short distance overconnectivity in frontal cortex that is largely ineffective and in a failure of long-distance cortical-cortical coupling, and thus a reduction in frontal-posterior reciprocal connectivity. This altered circuitry impairs the essential role of frontal cortex in integrating information from diverse functional systems (emotional, sensory, autonomic, memory, etc.) and providing context-based and goal-directed feedback to lower level systems.",

If they are kept beyond their normal age of integration they can disturb some or all the functions of the higher brain centers which includes behavior; such as learning and integration of large or fine movements and more neurological disorders. Initial stem reflexes use a program based on the theory of repetition which enables alliteration of specific stages of development through paraphrasing movement patterns based on early brain development. The brain is given a \"second chance\" to pass through the stages which have been missing or have been incomplete movements in the first year of life, so therefor, nerves and nerve development pass in the proper time.

      "title": "Análisis evolutivo y valoración neuropsicológica integral de pacientes con deterioro cognitivo leve o enfermedad de Alzheimer.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION \nEl envejecimiento de la poblacion esta causando un aumento en la aparicion de patologias asociadas a la edad, como es el caso de las demencias. Afortunadamente los avances de las Ciencias de la Salud como la Medicina, la Psicologia y, en particular, la Neuropsicologia estan aportando herramientas de gran utilidad para la evaluacion, el diagnostico y el tratamiento de procesos como el Deterioro Cognitivo Leve (DCL) y la Enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA).\nEl Deterioro Cognitivo Leve es definido como un sindrome clinico caracterizado por la alteracion adquirida en una o mas areas cognitivas (atencion, funciones ejecutivas, lenguaje, memoria o area visuoespacial) con una duracion de meses a anos, que sin cumplir los criterios para el diagnostico de demencia excede a lo esperado por la edad. La afectacion es referida por el propio paciente o por un informador y debe ser objetivada en la exploracion neuropsicologica, pudiendo provocar una interferencia minima en el desarrollo de las actividades habituales. El DCL es frecuentemente ubicado en un continuo que transcurre desde el envejecimiento normal hasta la enfermedad de Alzheimer, considerando a las personas con DCL como un grupo poblacional con alto riesgo de padecer posteriormente demencia (predominantemente Enfermedad de Alzheimer).\nLa Enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA) ha sido la demencia mas estudiada y aunque su evolucion es heterogenea, la afectacion cognoscitiva mas grave en los primeros estadios es la alteracion de la memoria. La EA se caracteriza por un comienzo insidioso, dificultando la discriminacion y la realizacion de un diagnostico temprano. Conforme avanza la enfermedad otras areas cognitivas se ven gravemente afectadas.\n Por tanto, la definicion del perfil clinico y neuropsicologico asociado a las primeras etapas de las enfermedades neurodegenerativas es crucial para facilitar la deteccion temprana de la enfermedad, establecer el punto de partida para una intervencion adecuada y poder llevar a cabo un seguimiento de la evolucion de manera controlada.\nOBJETIVO\nEn la presente Tesis Doctoral se analiza el perfil neuropsicologico integral y el curso evolutivo de pacientes con Deterioro Cognitivo Leve y Enfermedad de Alzheimer en dos estadios, leve y moderado, atendiendo a la capacidad funcional y cognitiva en tres momentos diferentes de su evolucion, al inicio y a los seis y doce meses.\nMATERIAL Y METODOS\nSe han llevado a cabo cinco estudios basados en una metodologia descriptiva transversal (Estudios I-IV) y longitudinal (Estudio V), mediante la exploracion neuropsicologica integral y clinica de una muestra inicial de 116 pacientes de los cuales 72 se han ajustado a los criterios de inclusion en la fase de valoracion basal y 44 en la fase de evolucion. El protocolo de evaluacion ha estado conformado por los siguientes tests de screening, de funcionalidad y de dominio cognitivo especifico: Examen Cognoscitivo MiniMental, Test de los 7 Minutos, Escala de Deterioro Global (GDS), Escala para las Actividades Basicas de la Vida diaria BARTHEL, Escala de sobrecarga del cuidador de ZARIT, Cuestionario de Actividad Funcional (FAQ) de Pfeiffer y diferentes subtests del Programa Integrado de Exploracion Neuropsicologica-Test Barcelona.\nRESULTADOS\nA nivel funcional, el grupo con DCL inicialmente era independiente en el desarrollo de las ABVDs pero conforme ha transcurrido el tiempo han comenzado a requerir cierta supervision en sus actividades. A nivel cognitivo inicialmente han presentado afectacion principal de las funciones ejecutivas, la memoria diferida y la velocidad de procesamiento, manteniendo preservadas a los doce meses de investigacion el resto de las funciones evaluadas aunque con un descenso en la ejecucion a los seis meses en orientacion temporal y fluencia verbal.\nLos pacientes con EAL han presentado dependencia funcional desde el inicio incrementada a los doce meses. A nivel cognitivo, en la valoracion inicial se han encontrado resultados sugerentes de afectacion en las funciones ejecutivas (planificacion y secuenciacion), memoria verbal (inmediata y diferida) y velocidad de procesamiento. A los seis meses han comenzado a verse afectadas las funciones de span atencional, coordinacion motora, denominacion y comprension lectora y a los doce meses la orientacion temporal tambien se ha visto afectada. Los sujetos han preservado algunas funciones como la orientacion espacial, lenguaje (automatico, repeticion de palabras, comprension auditiva), praxias ideomotoras y abstraccion verbal.\nPor ultimo, los sujetos con EAM han mostrado alteracion funcional inicial y afectacion de casi todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas (orientacion temporal y espacial, abstraccion, planificacion y secuenciacion, control mental, span atencional, repeticion de material verbal extenso, fluencia verbal semantica y fonetica, comprension verbal auditiva y lectora, praxias ideomotoras, memoria y velocidad de procesamiento). A los seis meses se ha afectado tambien la orientacion en persona y la denominacion de imagenes. En la ultima evaluacion todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas han estado afectadas a excepcion de la capacidad para repetir palabras conocidas y logatomos y para emitir series automaticas del lenguaje cuando son requeridas en orden directo.\nCONCLUSION\nLos sujetos con DCL han comenzado a presentar alteraciones clinicas que les conducen a sentir limitaciones clinicas considerables y que son percibidas por el propio paciente y por las personas de su entorno. En el caso de la Enfermedad de Alzheimer, la evolucion de la misma termina por causar afectacion de todas las funciones mentales superiores y conduce al paciente a un estado de dependencia donde requieren una ayuda continua cada dia. Ademas las areas que en estadios mas temprano comienzan a alterarse son las que se han observado dramaticamente mas afectadas en estadios mas avanzados (memoria, funciones ejecutivas y velocidad de procesamiento).\nLa evaluacion realizada en esta investigacion ha contibuido a la definicion del perfil neuropsicologico de los pacientes con Deterioro Cognitivo Leve, Enfermedad de Alzheimer en estadio leve y moderado, facilitando la labor de discriminar la afectacion funcional y cognitiva inicial en los tres grupos de estudio.\nPALABRAS CLAVE: Deterioro Cognitivo Leve, Enfermedad de Alzheimer, Perfil Neuropsicologico, Evaluacion Neuropsicologica",

This approach is rational, systematic, logical and knowledge-based and encompasses four phases: identification of needs, planning and implementation of health care and evaluation of health care. Basic features of the healthcare process are systematics, dynamism and flexibility. It is necessary to focus on the patient, to consider the patient as a subject and the integrity of the patient's care. Pervasive developmental disorder is a group of disorders characterized by: severe impairment of skills related to social interaction, communication deviations and limited stereotypical patterns of behavior . In the group of pervasive developmental disorders are Autistic Disorder, Rett Syndrome, Disintegrative Disorder in Childhood and Asperger Syndrome. The basic symptoms of autistic disorder are the lack of emotional response, lack of verbal and nonverbal communication, speech disorders, behavior and stereotypes. Rett syndrome is a major developmental disorder characterized by the development of multiple deficits after a period of neat functioning. Rett's syndrome is developing between birth and 5 months of age. A child loses motor skills and replaces them with stereotypical movements. Lose interest in the social environment and with increasing age characteristics increasingly come to the fore. Disintegrative childhood disorder has been characterized by regression in several areas after at least 2 years of apparent normal growth and development. The child ceases to communicate and talk, to follow events in the area and to forget the learned skills. Asperger's syndrome is a serious chronic neurasthenic disorder that is defined by social deficits and limited interests, similar to autism, but with welldeveloped speech and good cognitive abilities, which differentiates it from autism and other developmental disorders. There is a lot of treatments for this disorder.",

      "abstract": "Misophonia is characterized by decreased tolerance of ordinary human-generated trigger sounds and associated visual stimuli (e.g., chewing, sniffing, lip smacking), coupled with intense affective reactions. The disorder often begins during childhood or adolescence and is associated with impairment and distress in numerous life domains. Research has begun to examine the underlying psychological mechanisms of misophonia in adults, but studies in youth are limited. Trait mindfulness (i.e., nonjudgmental and nonavoidant present-moment awareness) and cognitive emotion regulation (i.e., cognitive processing, or responding to, emotionally arousing situations) are two proposed mechanisms that may underpin pediatric misophonia and associated functional impairment. In the present exploratory cross-sectional study, we examined trait mindfulness and cognitive emotion regulation and their relations with misophonia features and adaptive functioning in 102 youth with misophonia (Mage = 13.7; SD = 2.5; range = 8 – 17). More severe misophonia was significantly associated with decreased levels of trait mindfulness and adaptive functioning across domains, in addition to deficits in certain facets of cognitive emotion regulation, particularly self-blame. Neither trait mindfulness nor facets of cognitive emotion regulation moderated the association between misophonia severity and adaptive functioning across domains, with the notable exception that difficulties with adaptive functioning in peer relationships was attenuated in those high in mindfulness. Findings suggest that trait mindfulness– and to a lesser extent cognitive emotion regulation– may be potentially relevant processes in pediatric misophonia. However, more research is needed to uncover the precise nature of these processes to aid future characterization and intervention efforts, especially in light of equivocal findings in the present study.",

      "title": "A Changing Landscape: Traumatic Brain Injury in Military Combat and Civilian Athletics",
      "abstract": "Combat scene, a wounded or dead hoplite lies on the ground, black-figured hydria, Cleimachos (potter), 560-550 BCE. Louvre, (Museum), Paris, France. Photo credit: Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY. Diagnosing concussion has posed a special challenge in current military conflicts, as some symptoms and clinical findings are similar to acute stress reaction and other conditions. The Department of Defense (DoD) currently defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as: a traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force that is indicated by new onset or worsening of at least one of the following clinical signs, immediately following the event: 1) any period of loss of a decreased level of consciousness (LOC), 2) any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury, 3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking, etc.), 4) neurological deficits (weakness, loss of balance, change in vision, praxis, paresis/plegia, sensory loss, aphasia, etc.) that may or may not be transient, or 5) the presence of an intracranial lesion (1). Diagnosing TBI currently depends on a thorough history and the patient's status at the time of injury, and there is currently no single objective test or diagnostic biomarker for concussion/mild TBI (mTBI). Advancing diagnostic efforts, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command is funding biomarker studies to identify the unique biological effects of TBI and leverage knowledge to develop more objective diagnostic tools to determine the severity of brain injury. TBI severity within the DoD are currently classified as mild/moderate/severe (1). Concussion/mTBI involves normal structural imaging, LOC for up to 30 min, alteration of consciousness up to 24 h, and post-traumatic amnesia up to 24 h. If a patient meets criteria in more than one category of severity, the provider assigns the higher severity level. Definition standardization remains a problem as concussion grading systems and definitions published by various organizations make comparing findings from various research studies extremely difficult. A collaborative effort among the DoD, Veterans Health Administration, Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Brain Trauma Foundation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is developing a medically useful definition and staging criteria for mTBI/concussion. We live in a sport-crazed society, and although injury is usually an accepted consequence of “playing the game,” there is a heightened awareness about sport concussions. Pick up a newspaper, or watch the evening news or “Sports Center,” and you're bound to read or hear something about sport concussions. The media are obsessed with this topic, particularly with the negative news that makes headlines and ultimately sells newspapers. Even so, there is good news to report, and progress is being made. Forty-nine states have passed concussion laws in the past 4 years, aimed at educating athletes, parents, and coaches about the symptoms of concussion and the dangers of continuing to play while still symptomatic. According to the CDC, Emergency Department diagnosis of youth sport concussions has increased by an estimated 60% over the past decade (2). Surprisingly, this is good news, as it speaks to the increased public awareness and better recognition of concussion, as opposed to an increase in actual concussions. Concussion remains a major military concern given the short- and long-term impacts to our service members; recent conflicts have sparked an increase in TBI research funding designed to accelerate medical innovation. There were 266,810 service members in the DoD from 2000 to 2012 who were diagnosed with TBI—81.7% of these injuries concussions (3). Although the risk for TBI is certainly higher in the combat environment, the majority of these injuries (83.4%) is actually nondeployment-associated (3). In parallel to sport-concussion awareness, military medicine has also taken significant policy steps to promote early identification and concussion treatment (4). In 2010, the DoD published a policy mandating that any deployed service member involved in a potentially concussive event (such as 50 m from a blast, vehicle collision or rollover, blow to the head, etc.) receive a medical evaluation using the Military Acute Concussion Evaluation; receive a minimum 24 h of downtime, even if he was not diagnosed with a concussion; and must be re-evaluated prior to returning to duty (5). Since then, the DoD has screened over 14,950 deployed service members for concussion and has staffed 11 Concussion Care Centers in Afghanistan that promote concussion recovery and medical oversight (internal DoD data; personal communication). The U.S. Army is implementing this concept worldwide to ensure one standard of concussion care, whether the injury occurs on the battlefield or in garrison. The Veterans Administration-DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines (6) were rated as the highest concussion-management guideline in a 2011 edition of Brain Injury (7). Beginning in 2009, the DoD has published numerous TBI clinical recommendations in collaboration with civilian experts in the areas of cognitive rehabilitation, driving assessment, postinjury neurocognitive testing in the deployed environment, management of neuroendocrine dysfunction, assessment and treatment of dizziness, and management of visual dysfunction (8), and an additional three clinical recommendations will be published this year to include graded return to activity, sleep disturbances, and use of neuroimaging. The tests for detecting concussion and tracking recovery are becoming more sensitive, especially when used in combination with other tools to create a multimodal approach to concussion assessment. Despite all that has been accomplished, caring for service members and athletes at risk for sustaining cerebral concussion has always been a challenging task and never more so than in today's litigious society. Concussion is different from other injuries, in that we still rely heavily on an athlete's or a service member's subjective reporting of symptoms for decisionmaking, and we lack the neuroimaging protocols that might allow us to identify the damage and understand its severity. The cause-and-effect relationships, or lack of same, between repetitive head trauma and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are the subject of significant debate. Several published case reports have described tau deposits in the brains of deceased contact-sport athletes, but most of the neuroscience community does not believe that controlled experimental research has yet identified a causal relationship linking repetitive head trauma in sports and CTE(9–12). Innovative neuroimaging techniques are on the horizon and will eventually permit tau and other proteins to be traced in vivo. This should allow for prospective investigations comparing head-impact exposure with tau accumulation, leading to earlier detection and interventions for these chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In the meantime, our responsibility is to safely care for our service members and athletes, to educate them about what is known and unknown regarding the long-term effects of repetitive head trauma, and to ensure that family members, coaches, and military unit leaders implement supportive recovery practices. Unfortunately, the large amount of misinformation on this topic sometimes results in hysteria rather than rational thinking. Concussions are like snowflakes: no two are alike, and no cookbook or calendar can specify exactly how they should be treated. Therefore, we need to go the extra mile. In many cases, it's a matter of counseling our service members and our athletes about the short- and long-term risks of not reporting symptoms, returning to play or duty while still experiencing symptoms, or not modifying risky behaviors that can predispose them to future concussions. We need individualized and sport-specific return-to-play progressions that ensure that service members and athletes are physically and cognitively prepared to return to activity. No checkbox system can be applied to every concussion, and as concussions are diverse and unique injuries that affect each athlete differently, we must learn how to treat them individually. Likewise, concussed service members and athletes are unique, and we must work to understand what makes them different. Sports medicine clinicians must play the important role of counselor to our athletes. Getting to know each athlete's mindset and reaction to injuries allows us to build trust and forge honest lines of communications, thus enabling us to develop an appropriate and individualized plan for managing concussion, which is just as vital as knowing how to interpret the results of a cognitive or balance test. Within a 6-month period, four major consensus or evidence-based documents focused on concussion management will have been released, including the new “Zurich International Guidelines” or the Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport: the 4th International Conference on Concussion in Sport (13–16). This, along with other manuscripts published or soon to be published by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, the American Academy of Neurology, and the National Athletic Trainers' Association, should all be mandatory reading for sports medicine clinicians, as they will define the standard of care for sports medicine clinicians for at least the next 4–5 years. These documents are well-prepared and will make significant contributions to the sports medicine community. The landscape is changing, and these evidence-based guidelines are leading us in a better direction. Although the neuroscience community has learned much about concussion in the last two decades, we admittedly have much more to investigate and to understand.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that represents the most common form of dementia. The most prominent feature of AD is the decline in cognitive function, with an early impairment of episodic memory. The memory deficit of an AD patient is characterized by the amnestic syndrome of the medial temporal type. As the disease progresses, the condition often manifests in language disorders, visuospatial deficits and executive dysfunctions. Patients often have neuropsychiatric disturbances, as apathy and psychotic symptoms. Loss of autonomy follows cognitive impairment. The clinical diagnosis of AD is based on a complete medical examination with a neuropsychological evaluation. The FCSRT (free and cued selective reminding test) is recommended for the identification of the amnestic syndrome of the medial temporal type, which is defined by: (1) a very poor free recall and (2) a decreased total recall due to an insufficient effect of cueing. The neuropsychological tests should also assess other cognitive functions that may be perturbed in AD, such as executive functions, praxis, visuospatial capacities and language. Neuroimaging and biological exams (genetics, biomarkers) are of great utility in the evaluation. Other medical, neurological, or psychiatric disorders which could account for the impairment in memory and related symptoms must be always investigated.",

Asperger syndrome (AS)4 is a subgroup on the autistic spectrum. People with AS share many of the same features as are seen in autism, but with no history of language delay and with an IQ in the average range or above. In this editorial, the main cognitive theories of autism are summarised. These are then followed by a summary of the key neurobiological findings.\n\nThe mind blindness theory of autism5 proposed that in autism spectrum conditions there are deficits in the normal process of empathy, relative to mental age. These deficits can occur by degrees. The term “empathising” encompasses a range of other terms: “theory of mind”, “mind reading”, “empathy”, and taking the “intentional stance”.6 Empathy involves two major elements: (1) the ability to attribute mental states to oneself and others, as a natural way to make sense of agents,7–9 and (2) having an emotional reaction that is appropriate to the other person’s mental state (such as sympathy).\n\nSince the first test of mind blindness in children with autism,10 there have been more than 30 experimental tests. The vast majority of these have revealed profound impairments in the development of their empathising ability. These are reviewed elsewhere.5,11 Some children and adults with AS only show their empathising deficits on age appropriate adult tests.12–14 This deficit in their empathising is thought to underlie …",

      "title": "Approach to History Taking and Examination of the Movement Disorder Patient",
      "abstract": "Abstract Movement disorders can be classified into akinetic–rigid and hyperkinetic categories. The value of a systematic approach to history taking and examination cannot be overstated. For example, taking a detailed family and drug history, or paying close attention to the saccadic eye movements, often produces important information. Cognitive and neuropsychiatric features commonly accompany movement disorders, are often not spontaneously volunteered, and therefore should always be screened for. Sadly, there appears to be an increasing over-reliance on ordering tests indiscriminately in the diagnostic quest, often at the expense of a thorough clinical evaluation. Such an approach is likely to have a low yield, to be potentially misleading, and also to be costly. The key to accurate diagnosis lies in identifying the phenomenology of the movement disorder, set in the context of the historical information obtained (e.g. rate of onset, progression, use of offending drugs), and whether there are additional physical signs to be elicited from the general medical or neurological examination that further narrow down the differential (e.g. organomegaly, eye movement disorder, reflex changes). For intermittent, situational, or task-specific movement disorders, asking the patient to make a video recording on their mobile phone or other device can be invaluable. Alternatively, bringing the relevant piece of equipment to the consulting room (such as a golf club, guitar, etc.) can be illuminating. The implications for other family members should always be borne in mind when undertaking genetic testing. Management should be incremental, engaging the patient in therapeutic decisions wherever possible.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major public health problem. Cognitive deficits are common with DM which range from subclinical or subtle to severe deficits such as dementia. Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia are causes of cognitive impairment with DM. In patients with DM, not only severe hypoglycaemia but also recurrent mild or moderate hypoglyacemia have deleterious effect on the brain. Recurrent mild/moderate hypoglycaemia is associated with intellectual decline, reduced attention, impaired mental abilities and memory deficits. Hypoglycaemia may result in abnormalities of neuronal plasticity, synaptic weakening and scattered neuronal death in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Chronic hyperglycaemia in type 1 and type 2 DM is associated with low IQ (verbal, performance and total) and abnormalities in testing for different domains of cognitive function such as verbal relations, comprehension, visual reasoning, pattern analysis, quantitation, memory, learning, mental control, psychomotor efficiency, mental and motor processing speed and executive function. The suggested mechanisms incriminated in the pathogenesis of hyperglycaemia-related cognitive dysfunction include, macro- and microvascular disease or vasculopathy, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia, stress response, direct toxic effect of chronic hyperglycaemia on the brain, advanced glycation end-products, inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. Hyperglycaemia causes oxidative stress, amyloidosis, angiopathy, abnormal lipid peroxidation, accumulation of β-amyloid and tau phosphorylation, neuro-inflammation, mitochondrial pathology, apoptosis and neuronal degeneration in the cortex and hippocampus. Depression has been identified as a risk for accelerated cognitive decline with DM. The knowledge that diagnosis at an early age, frequency of hypoglycaemia, poor glycaemic control and presence of risk factors negatively affect cognitive functions in DM will have important implications for treatment and research purposes.",

As the field of aging and dementia moves toward early identification of cognitive symptoms, MCI has become an area of active research. Most clinicians believe that neurodegenerative processes evolve over years and perhaps decades. Thus, the concept of an intermediate stage of impairment between normal aging and early dementia needs to be clarified. MCI has evolved to represent this transitional zone (Figure). According to recent research, MCI can be classified into three subtypes: 1) amnestic MCI, in which the person has a memory impairment out of proportion to performance in other cognitive areas; 2) multidomain MCI, in which the person has a slight impairment in several cognitive domains, for example, language, attention, executive function, and visuospatial skills with or without a memory impairment, although these deficits are mild and not sufficient to constitute dementia; and 3) single non-memory domain MCI, in which the person is impaired in a non-memory area in relative isolation to the other cognitive domains.",

The prevalence of LD in the general population has been found to be 2–10% and reading disorders are the most frequent subtype. Epilepsy is one of the commonest neurological disorders in childhood with an estimated prevalence in 4–5/1,000. Epilepsy is considered to be idiopathic or cryptogenic in approximately two‐thirds of cases. LD are more common in people with epilepsy than in the general population: about 25% of patients with epilepsy are said to have LD. Various psychosocial, medication‐related, and epilepsy‐related factors may be associated with LD in epilepsy. LD can be either permanent or state‐dependent. Permanent LD are caused by a brain lesion and/or a stable brain dysfunction. In contrast, state‐dependent LD are potentially reversible and treatable; they are caused by epilepsy‐related factors. If allowed to persist for a long period, a state‐dependent LD may become permanent.",

Dicho trastorno se caracteriza por un patron persistente de hiperactividad/impulsividad y/o inatencion superior a lo esperado de acuerdo con el nivel de desarrollo del individuo, apareciendo antes de los doce anos y alterando el funcionamiento normalizado del sujeto a nivel academico, familiar y social (Barkley, 2006; Lavigne y Romero, 2010; Miranda, 2000, 2004; Perez, 2009; Servera, 2005). El problema del que se parte para llevar a cabo nuestro estudio gira en torno a la escasa cantidad de investigaciones que existen con el objetivo de analizar los deficit que van mas alla de estos tres sintomas categoriales y que se producen a nivel social y emocional en los sujetos con Trastorno por Deficit de Atencion con Hiperactividad; especialmente en comparacion con el robusto cuerpo de estudios que se han llevado a cabo para profundizar en el origen y desarrollo de las alteraciones de corte cognitivo y conductual, asi como en las diferentes opciones que se ocupan de su diagnostico y tratamiento. Por tanto, la tesis que a continuacion se presenta, surge con dos objetivos fundamentales: en primer lugar, con el de proporcionar un modelo de comprension y explicacion del TDAH que, ademas de abordar los deficit de origen cognitivo y conductual, atienda al papel que las emociones desempenan en el comportamiento de las personas que padecen el trastorno, como influyen en su desarrollo y dominio social, asi como que relacion establecen con el resto de procesos neuropsicologicos implicados. Para ello, se llevara a cabo en la Parte Primera del estudio (capitulos 1o, 2o, 3o, 4o y 5o), una revision del concepto, las caracteristicas y los modelos explicativos mas extendidos en torno al origen y desarrollo del trastorno, particularmente en relacion con sus dificultades emocionales y sociales. En la Segunda Parte (capitulos 6o, 7o y 8o), se exponen los resultados de la investigacion llevada a cabo con una amplia muestra de personas con TDAH y sus familias, con el objeto de comprobar y analizar los beneficios de una intervencion especifica Emocional, Social y Cognitiva; disenada para potenciar procesos emocionales de identificacion, expresion y regulacion emocional, y consecuentemente: reducir problemas emocionales, mejorar sus habilidades socio-comunicativas y pragmaticas, potenciar sus habilidades mentalistas, sociales y de resolucion de conflictos. Ademas, se analiza la relacion que otras variables pueden tener sobre dichas competencias: como la edad de los participantes y el tipo de tratamiento recibido; asi como se comparan dichos resultados con los de un grupo control. Para poder llevar a cabo este tratamiento psicoeducativo, se ha elaborado y aplicado un Programa de Intervencion Emocional, Social y Cognitivo, destinado a ninos con TDAH de edades comprendidas entre los 7 y los 14 anos, y a sus padres.",

      "title": "Part III: Insomnia and Circadian Dysrhythmias",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is deﬁned as difﬁculty with the initiation, maintenance, duration, or quality of sleep resulting in the impairment of daytime functioning despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep (1,2). Although research studies sometimes require a speciﬁc quantitative deﬁnition, a patient’s subjective judgment that sleep is insufﬁcient, inadequate, or nonrestorative is the most important factor in clinical practice. Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint. Transient insomnia lasts less than one week, and short-term insomnia one to four weeks. Chronic insomnia, insomnia lasting more than one month, affects between 10% and 35% of the population in the western world (3,4). The number of chronic insomniacs rises with age, and women of all ages complain of insomnia more often thanmen (3,5). Insomnia is frequently associatedwith othermedical complaints and psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety, worry, and depression. Stressful life events (difﬁculties in interpersonal relationships, family discord, problems at work, and ﬁnancial troubles) may also generate a nonrestorative sleep complaint. Insomnia is not a speciﬁc illness or disease, but rather a symptom or consequence of other primary disorders. “Poor quality of sleep” is a common complaint in the family members of chronic insomniacs. However, it is difﬁcult to gauge the extent to which the emotional problems favouring the onset of a sleep disorder in adulthood are due to a genetic predisposition or the result of having lived in a family burdened by affective problems and/or interpersonal conﬂicts.",

      "title": "Genetic and Environmental Factors in Autism",
      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, and verbal and nonverbal communication as well as limited and repetitive behaviours. Although symptomatology of autism may be noticed around early months, diagnosis generally occurs around 24-36 months, however in some cases diagnosis may be delayed to adulthood [1]. Since behavioural symptoms and the degree of functional impairment are variable, the au‐ tistic disorder is described as a heterogenous symptom cluster of varying etiological and pathological basis [2]. Described as a multifactorial disorder created by interaction of neuro‐ logic, immunologic, environmental, and genetic factors, autistic disorder has no definite cause [3, 4]. In many cases in whom the etiology remains unclear are diagnosed as idiopath‐ ic autism or non-syndromic autism [5, 6]. Seventy percent of cases with idiopathic autism have basic symptoms without physical abnormalities whereas 30% have complex autism in which dysmorphic features are detected such as microcephaly and/or structural brain mal‐ formations [7]. Autism is associated with other syndromes such as Fragile X syndrome, Down Syndrome, and tuberosclerosis in 5-25% of the cases ([8, 9]. Although phenotypic het‐ erogeneity is the biggest challenge for research efforts directed to identify autism etiology [10], currently it is widely accepted that environmental and genetic factors play essential role in genesis of autistic disorder thanks to a recent advance in research techniques related to biological factors and widespread studies in this field [11, 12].",

Like dyslexia, many of the other specific learning difficulties can be seen within a continuum. The term ‘comorbidity’ is commonly used to describe the overlap between the different specific learning difficulties. Developmental coordination disorders (DCD) is, however, essentially a motor coordination difficulty, but it can be seen within a continuum from mild to severe and can affect fine motor activities, such as pencil grip, and gross motor activities, such as movement and balance. Handwriting difficulties can often be experienced by children with dyspraxia and coordination difficulties. The learning environment is very important for children with auditory processing difficulties (APD), and many of the environmental factors that can help with attention deficit disorder can also be used for APD, such as quiet or soft music background.",

This article summarizes several symptoms or syndromes that significantly interfere with adjustment and functioning, and reviews current treatment evidence, as well as potential future interventions. These symptoms or syndromes are impairments outside of the core diagnostic features — impaired communication, impaired social skills and restricted interests / repetitive movements — that may significantly impede the implementation of behavioral or other non-medical interventions. Early identification of these comorbidities could aide in the development of successful targeted treatments.",

However, the diagnosis of dementia does not mean an immediate or complete cessation of sexuality in the person, or a loss of the ability to consent to sexual activity with a partner. A discussion of sexuality in dementia occurs infrequently in clinical care for several reasons. These include (a) a discomfort in discussing sexuality in older adults, (b) the fear of causing social or cultural offense, and (c) the assumption that the cessation of the reproductive period implies the end of sexual life in older adults. There is also a tendency to focus on the preservation of cognition and independence, with relative neglect of the need for physical and emotional intimacy or quality of life. Patients with dementia are more likely to be sexually active than not. The most common change is a lack or loss or sexual desire. Inappropriate sexual behaviors occur in a minority of patients (28%) and can be usually managed with behavioral measures, with the use of pharmacotherapy for symptomatic management in refractory cases. Other clinical and ethical concerns in dementia include the capacity to consent to sexual intimacy, the formation of new relationships, sexuality in long-term residential facilities, and vulnerability to sexual abuse. Dementia care guidelines recommend a low threshold of suspicion for abuse, with a focus on patient safety. These must, however, be counterweighed by respect for patient autonomy and wishes.",

Children with DDs just like normally developing children have health issues that need to be addressed. This special group of children especially those having autism frequently suffer from associated conditions such as gastrointestinal disorders, eating and feeding challenges, seizures, sleep disturbances, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, and anxiety among others. These health problems affect the health of these children in different ways and extent. Thus, children with DDs need to access healthcare services and receive quality medical care just like their normally developing peers. However, the health needs of children with DDs particularly autism are not being met as required even though this special population are more likely to seek medical care due to their disabilities and associated conditions. Children with autism and other DDs experience disparities in health and healthcare service utilization. Autism is linked to many health conditions such as epilepsy, gastrointestinal problems and other mental disorders. These health problems affect each individual with autism in a unique way negatively affecting his/her existing social interaction and communication impairments. Again, health facilities and medical equipment are not disability-friendly making it difficult for this special group to effectively have access to quality care. In addition, most healthcare providers do not possess adequate knowledge and skills required to make critical decisions regarding this very special group of persons. Furthermore, due to cultural differences certain diagnosis and treatment regarding autism and other developmental disabilities may not be welcomed. The public health sector of all nations has the duty to promote health and prevent diseases for all including persons with disabilities.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. In most individuals, the symptoms of the disease begin with mild memory difficulties after the sixth decade of life. Symptoms progress slowly, leading to significant impairment in memory, language, executive function, and other domains of cognition. Eventually, impaired cognitive abilities interfere with complex activities of daily life and ultimately result in the loss of independent function. The diagnosis is typically made in this context on the basis of clinical evidence of dementia with progressive impairment in multiple domains of cognition. Structural neuroimaging is often used in the clinical setting to evaluate for the presence of other pathologies (e.g. cerebrovascular or neoplastic disease). Functional neuroimaging, such as PET or SPECT, may be employed clinically to assist in the discrimination of different types of dementia (e.g. frontotemporal vs. Alzheimer’s dementia). Current treatments are primarily symptomatic, in that clinical trials demonstrate short-term stabilization of cognitive function but not a slowing of the rate of decline. Increasing emphasis is being placed on the development of disease-modifying therapies — drugs that impede the underlying pathophysiologic process of neurodegeneration in AD and, thereby, slow the rate of cognitive decline.",

      "abstract": "Many studies have now shown that both physical and cognitive factors are important in fall risk. In accordance with the common-cause theory of cognitive ageing, which states that age-related declines in cognitive, sensory, and motor functioning are attributed to a common neurobiological mechanism, there is evidence of shared variance between sensorimotor and cognitive age-related changes. Indeed, cognitive, sensory, and motor inter-relationships strengthen with age [1]. It is, therefore, of little surprise that parameters of the postural control system are influenced by the cognitive demand of a task, particularly in older people. Undertaking daily tasks, such as maintaining upright posture and safely navigating complex environments, requires adequate sensory perception, cognitive integration, and subsequent motor adjustments [2], with increased cognitive processing required with aging [3]. Furthermore, many daily activities require the handling of two or more simultaneous tasks, such as walking while talking, carrying a basket with laundry while navigating the stairs, or crossing a busy road safely [4]. Older people appear not to be able to process multiple tasks as quickly and/or as well as younger adults and such impairments have been linked to falls in older people [5]. Figure 18.1 displays a hypothetical model of how the sensory, cognitive, and motor domains are inter-linked and how these factors and interactions might contribute to falls.",

In neonatal presentation, death occurs in days if untreated. Survivors may evolve with neurocognitive dysfunction.Two 10 years old, non-identical, twin sisters (S1; S2) with CTLN1 were born after a 36W gestation: S1 by eutocic delivery and S2 by cesarean section with nuchal cord (Apgar score 5/10). On day four, S2 presented hyperammonemia with coma. S1 had no complications. Diagnosis followed that of S2. Neurocognitive development was monitored at 3 months - 4 years of age with Griffiths Scales: global development quotient kept within the average, but S2 had a deficit in language and eye and hand coordination. At 5 years, the neurocognitive abilities were evaluated using Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence - Revised (WPPSI-R). S2 revealed difficulties in verbal area (vocabulary, comprehension and memorizing sentences), with a lower average verbal intelligence quotient (IQ). S1 had high average IQ. Due to learning difficulties, S2 was reassessment at 8 years old with Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Third edition (WISC-III): full-scale IQ -\"extremely low\".These non-identical twin sisters share the same citrullinemia type 1 causing variants in the ASS1 gene. Nevertheless, their clinical presentation and neurocognitive evolution are diverse. Other factors, like the different genetic background and perinatal issues such as the type of delivery and its circumstances and the neonatal coma episode of S2 may explain the dissimilar evolution.

Such developmental deviation is likely to be accompanied by certain psychic and pathologic disturbances. Mental deficiency, perhaps thyrogenous, in an infant under 10 months of age, is usually betrayed by such signs and symptoms as lack of the sucking reflex, delayed aptitude for holding the head erect, fixing the eyes, recognizing parents and relatives, grasping and playing with objects, turning over, sitting unaided and standing with aid. Subsequently, the most reliable evidences of mental development will depend on the as similation of language, walking, control of the sphincters, school progress and mental tests. It should be added here that results of the latter are by no means absolute, much being contingent on personal interpretation and ruling out of all possible misleading factors.",

      "abstract": "Motor neurone disease is a rapidly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative condition which causes progressive weakness, with normal sensation. It can occur at any age but is more frequent with increasing age. Key clinical presentations include bulbar (slurred or difficult speech, problems swallowing, tongue fasciculation), limb (typically in one limb with weakness and muscle wasting), respiratory (breathlessness, chest muscle fasciculation) and cognitive features (behavioural change, emotional lability, features of frontotemporal dementia). Although survival is typically three to five years from symptom onset, there is significant individual variation. Rarely, survival may be 20 years or longer. Favourable features include a limb rather than a bulbar presentation, preserved weight and respiratory function, younger age of onset and longer time from fist symptom to diagnosis. The patient should be linked to a multidisciplinary team able to provide support from the start with a designated individual as the point of contact, with regular, coordinated assessments, as the patient's needs change and their condition progresses. Gastrostomy is an important supportive intervention which maximizes nutrition, and minimizes aspiration and chest infection. Adequate nutrition and hydration is key to maximizing health and survival. It is possible for a patient to control a computer and speech by eye. movement alone. An important consideration is voice banking where the patient may store their voice before there is difficulty with speech so that it can be used at a later stage if they need a communication aid. Impaired cough and retention of respiratory secretions is frequent in the later stages, and may be managed with physiotherapy. The patient should be referred for expert respiratory assessment if needed.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget disease of bone (PDB) and/or frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) is characterized by adult-onset proximal and distal muscle weakness (clinically resembling a limb-girdle muscular dystrophy syndrome), early-onset PDB, and premature frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Muscle weakness progresses to involve other limb and respiratory muscles. PDB involves focal areas of increased bone turnover that typically lead to spine and/or hip pain and localized enlargement and deformity of the long bones; pathologic fractures occur on occasion. Early stages of FTD are characterized by dysnomia, dyscalculia, comprehension deficits, and paraphasic errors, with minimal impairment of episodic memory; later stages are characterized by inability to speak, auditory comprehension deficits for even one-step commands, alexia, and agraphia. Mean age at diagnosis for muscle disease and PDB is 42 years; for FTD, 56 years. Dilated cardiomyopathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson disease are now known to be part of the spectrum of findings associated with IBMPFD. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of IBMPFD is established in a proband with typical clinical findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in HNRNPA1, HNRNPA2B1, or VCP identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Weight control to avoid obesity; physical therapy and stretching exercises to promote mobility and prevent contractures; mechanical aids (canes, walkers, orthotics, wheelchairs) for ambulation/mobility; surgical intervention for foot deformity and scoliosis; respiratory aids when indicated; social and emotional support; assisted living arrangements for muscle weakness and/or dementia; bisphosphonates to relieve pain and disability from PDB. Surveillance: At periodic intervals: echocardiogram and ECG to monitor for evidence of cardiomyopathy; pulmonary function studies; sleep study; alkaline phosphatase, skeletal x-rays and bone scans to monitor for PDB onset and effectiveness of therapy; assessment of behavior and mental status. Genetic counseling IBMPFD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. An estimated 80% of affected individuals have an affected parent; approximately 20% have the disorder as a result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Each child of an individual with IBMPFD has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once the IBMPFD-causing pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

About 5% of children in primary schools are affected. Dyscalculia does not improve without treatment.In this article, we selectively review publications on dyscalculia from multiple disciplines (medicine, psychology, neuroscience, education/special education).Many children and adolescents with dyscalculia have associated cognitive dysfunction (e.g., impairment of working memory and visuospatial skills), and 20% to 60% of those affected have comorbid disorders such as dyslexia or attention deficit disorder. The few interventional studies that have been published to date document the efficacy of pedagogic-therapeutic interventions directed toward specific problem areas. The treatment is tailored to the individual patient's cognitive functional profile and severity of manifestations. Psychotherapy and/or medication are sometimes necessary as well.The early identification and treatment of dyscalculia are very important in view of its frequent association with mental disorders.

It is primarily characterized by language impairments that become accentuated over time, often leading to isolation and social exclusion. There are three main subtypes, the semantic (svPPA), non-fluent (nfvPPA), and logopenic (lvPPA) variants, each presenting distinct language deficits, as captured by standard assessment batteries. However, such assessments often fail to adequately identify functional communication (dis)abilities in everyday life, which is crucial for effective diagnosis and treatment. One understudied aspect of communication is informativeness, the conveyance of an appropriate amount of information in an efficient fashion.",

      "abstract": "Changes in cognitive function and disturbances in behavior are commonly seen in parkinsonian patients and they are inherent features of the disease. Estimates on the prevalence of dementia in this disorder are quite variable, ranging from 15 to 25%. Advanced age, depression, severity of akinesia, and the presence of dopaminomimetic psychosis, are considered as risk factors in the development of cognitive deterioration within this patient population. Cognitive dysfunction may manifest as relatively circumscribed deficits or overt dementia. The finding of mild cognitive deficits is common in Parkinson's disease, such as reduced flexibility, psychomotor slowing, reduction in learning capacity and information retrieval, and disturbances in visuospatial tasks. The most prevalent cognitive disturbance is an impairment in visuospatial tasks, not necessarily related to the degree of motor disability. Dementia, when present early on in the course of the disease may suggest alternative diagnoses (Diffuse Lewy body dementia, Alzheimer's disease with extrapyramidal features, Fronto-temporal dementia, etc.), while in those cases in whom the dementing disorder develops at a later stage, it is assumed to be an integral part of the disease, albeit corresponding to variable pathogenetic mechanisms.",

      "title": "Early Symptomatic Syndromes Eliciting Neurodevelopmental Clinical Examinations",
      "abstract": "This special issue is devoted to the concept of ESSENCE (Early Symptomatic Syndromes Eliciting Neurodevelopmental Clinical Examinations). It is an acronym that one of us coined some years ago [1] with a view to highlighting the clinical reality of children (and their parents) presenting in first, second, or third tier clinical settings with, usually complex, impairing developmental symptoms already in early childhood. The children are reported to have problems in the fields of (a) general development, (b) communication and language, (c) social interrelatedness, (d) motor coordination, (e) attention/“listening,” (f) activity, (g) behavior, (h) mood, and/or (i) sleep. Children with major difficulties in one or more (usually several) of these fields will be seen by health visitors, nurses, social workers, education (including preschool) specialists, pediatricians, GPs, speech and language therapists, child neurologists, child psychiatrists, psychologists, neurophysiologists, dentists, clinical geneticists, occupational therapists, and physiotherapists, but, in the vast majority of cases they will be seen only by one of these specialists, when, in fact, they would have needed the input of two or more (occasionally even all) of the “experts” referred to.\r\n\r\nCategorical diagnosis is an integral part of everyday clinical and research practice. We are so insistent on the distinction between disorder and not disorder (normalcy) that clinics and clinicians become more and more specialized and cater to the needs of children with “Autism Spectrum Disorder/ASD only,” “Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder/ADHD only,” “Language Disorder only,” “Reactive Attachment Disorder/RAD only,” or “Tourette syndrome only.” This has led to a situation in which the typical clinical diffuseness of disorder has come to be underestimated.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, there is growing acceptance that coexistence of disorders and sharing of symptoms across disorders (so-called comorbidity, a misnomer if ever there was one, seeing as we are usually not dealing with completely separate coexisting disorders) are the rule rather than the exception (e.g., [2]). This was pointed out more than a quarter of a century ago [3], but, in clinical practice, this insight has not led to new approaches when trying to address the needs of children and families with “complex needs.” Instead, diversification has boomed.\r\n\r\nThere are legislational, scientific, and clinical attempts to separate out children with certain disorders/diagnosis; for example, ASD from those who do not meet criteria for the disorder/diagnosis. The goal is usually provide better societal guidelines, more focused attempts at finding the causes, and more specific services. Children with ADHD are targeted in similar ways, even though legislation has yet to catch up with them. The same holds for children with Language Disorder, visual impairments, and hearing deficits (children who may, or may not, have additional impairments as regard to general cognition, motor performance, ADHD, or ASD).\r\n\r\nASD and ADHD, long treated and, believed to be, completely separate and recognizable “disorders,” are now increasingly often diagnosed “together” within the same individual, and there is growing awareness that they sometimes overlap, constitute amalgams of problems, and that in some families they separate together and probably represent different aspects of the same underlying disorder [4].\r\n\r\nThe overlap, shared and nonshared symptoms and etiologies of these named disorders are in focus in this special issue.\r\n\r\nThere are 14 papers altogether in the volume. They deal with a variety of ESSENCE-related issues ranging from maltreatment and RAD (and the difficult issue of how to study the effects of early intervention aiming to stop maltreatment and provide safe and nurturing care), through autism from preschool to adult life (including a study showing that autism diagnosed early in life is always comorbid with other disorders, and a literature review indicating that pain sensitivity is, in fact, not decreased in autism), language delay (which can only be screened for by face-to-face assessment), eating problems (that are shown to be comorbid with ASD and ADHD symptomatology in a very high proportion of cases), and cerebral palsy (in which the prevalence of mental health problems, including ADHD, appears to currently be grossly underestimated) to more general mental health problems (and the use of child psychiatric and school psychology services that is associated with such problems). Methodologies covered in the special issue range from longitudinal population-based screening and clinical assessment studies, through randomized controlled trials and large-scale epidemiological twin research, to position and PRISMA-guideline systematic review papers. There is a wealth of information for clinicians and researchers alike, and it is expected that the issue on ESSENCE will prove to be a landmark in the development of new approaches to screening and intervention for children and adults affected by neurodevelopmental disorders. ESSENCE affect about one in ten individuals across the planet, and we are dealing with a huge public health problem. ESSENCE, from now on, must be given highest priority both in clinical research and practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nChristopher Gillberg\r\n\r\nElisabeth Fernell\r\n\r\nHelen Minnis",

Advances in medical technology, obstetric management, and intensive neonatal care have led to an improvement in survival rates of preterm infants. Very preterm children who lack attentional control have difficulty focusing and sustaining their attention. Compared with term-born controls, studies have reported deficits in very preterm children's ability to selectively attend to stimuli while ignoring distracting stimuli, and to maintain their concentration and performance during long, monotonous tasks. Very preterm children are often characterised by slower reaction times, longer time required to interpret and respond to stimuli, and reduced output. These deficits may be present in the 1st year of life, and continue through school-age into adulthood.",

      "title": "Evaluación de la interacción entre atención visual y memoria de trabajo: un estudio basado en técnicas de eye-tracking",
      "abstract": "Introducción: La memoria de trabajo (MT) es la función cognitiva que nos permite mantener y manipular información cuando ya no está presente para los sentidos. Esta función cognitiva es básica para el desarrollo de otras funciones cognitivas superiores, como la inteligencia, el lenguaje o la memoria. La MT muestra un deterioro con la edad y la presencia de patologías neurodegenerativas relacionadas con la edad. Este trabajo constituye un avance en la caracterización de perfiles cognitivos y la identificación de cambios sútiles en los mismos con valor diagnóstico. Esto es particularmente crítico en enfermedades como el Alzheimer, con fases preclínicas muy largas, ya que es precisamente en estas fases en que las terapias pueden ser más efectivas. Una característica distintiva de MT es su capacidad limitada (3-4 elementos para estímulos visuales). Cuando los estímulos se muestran secuencialmente emergen efectos seriales. En particular, el efecto de recencia (i.e. es más probable que se recuerden los estímulos presentados en últimas posiciones en la secuencia) se ha observado en MT visual. Por el contrario, el efecto de primacía (i.e. es más probable que se recuerden los estímulos presentados al principio de la secuencia) no se ha encontrado en MT visual, aunque sí se ha observado en MT verbal.Objetivo: El objetivo de este trabajo es estudiar la relación entre la atención visual y MT. Con este fin, se ha diseñado un protocolo experimental de coincidencia con una muestra diferida (Delayed Match-to-Sample, DMS), monitorizado mediante técnicas de eye-tracking. Por un lado, se investiga cómo varía la MT con la edad y con el número de objetos presentes en la fase de estimulación. Posteriormente, se analiza hasta qué punto la atención visual modula la codificación de la información durante la fase de estimulación, lo que determina qué estímulos acceden y se mantienen en MT.Metodología: Un total de 54 sujetos divididos en 2 cohortes, adultos jóvenes (J) (Edad: 24.10土2.10 años; 13 hombres, 17 mujeres) y adultos de mediana edad (M) (Edad: 51.63土5.03 años; 10 hombres, 14 mujeres), participaron en la tarea DMS en que estímulos cuadrados de colores se presentaron simultáneamente en matrices de 2, 4 o 6 elementos durante 500 ms. Todos los estímulos estaban a la misma distancia del centro de la pantalla (5,5 grados visuales) y, en cada ensayo, había la misma cantidad de estímulos en cada hemiespacio. Tras 2 s sin estimulación, se presentó un estímulo de prueba en el centro de la pantalla para su posterior reconocimiento. Cada experimento consta de 252 ensayos presentados al azar en un diseño equilibrado en el número de estímulos, el color, la ubicación espacial y el estímulo de reconocimiento. Durante el experimento, la mirada de los sujetos fue monitorizada por medio de un eye-tracker (Tobii X120). Resultados: Los adultos jóvenes obtuvieron más respuestas correctas que los adultos de mediana edad. Se produjeron diferencias significativas entre las dos cohortes para 4 estímulos (t = -2.044, p &amp;lt;0.05) y 6 estímulos (t = -2.811, p &amp;lt;0.05) pero no para 2 estímulos. En relación a los efectos seriales, el estudio se centró en aquellos ensayos en que se mostraron 6 estímulos. De éstos, en el 26% de los 84 ensayos/persona en que tuvieron lugar búsquedas exhaustivas (las secuencias de fijaciones están totalmente contenidas en ROIs de 3x3 grados visuales centrados en los estímulos), los 2 últimos estímulos que recibieron atención abierta durante la búsqueda fueron reconocidos significativamente mejor que los estímulos visitados con anterioridad durante la fase de codificación (desde la posición final, 1º vs 2º 𝛸2=0.713 p=0.3983; 2º vs 3º 𝛸2=112,081, p&amp;lt;0.05; 3º vs 4º 𝛸2=61,727, p&amp;lt;0.05), poniendo de relieve la aparición de un efecto de recencia.Conclusiones: Nuestros resultados confirman que la capacidad de MT disminuye con la edad y el tamaño del conjunto de memorización. Además, respaldan la hipótesis de que la atención visual modula la codificación de los elementos en MT. En particular, el efecto de recencia surge como consecuencia de la asignación de atención visual a los diferentes elementos durante la fase de estimulación de la tarea DMS, lo que ilustra el papel tan importante que tiene la interacción entre la atención visual y MT.",

      "abstract": "What is autism?\r\nHigh-functioning autism (HFA) and Asperger syndrome (AS) are autism spectrum\r\ndisorders (ASDs) characterised by disturbances in social interaction, both verbal and\r\nnon-verbal communication and repetitive and/or restrictive behaviour since early\r\nchildhood. As the name suggests, it is a spectrum condition and therefore the range\r\nof symptoms and their severity is very wide; the symptoms which appear (generally\r\nduring early childhood and adolescence1) will differ significantly from person to\r\nperson. The main difference between autism and AS is thought to be in language\r\ndevelopment, in that those with AS will not have had delayed language development\r\nwhen younger. However, trying to fit a person into a particular sub-group is not\r\nhelpful, and all persons with ASD should be assessed for their abilities and\r\ndifficulties rather than being overly concerned with whether they have autism or AS.\r\nAutism is a lifelong developmental disability that affects how a person communicates\r\nwith, and relates to, other people. It also affects how they make sense of the world\r\naround them. For reasons not yet fully understood, ASD affects approximately four\r\ntimes as many males as females.2",

      "title": "Paediatric Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is a prevalent sleep problem, affecting approximately one-third of the children in the general population. Despite its high prevalence, paediatric insomnia is often unrecognized and untreated in clinical practice. It is commonly associated with other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric comorbidities, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). If left untreated, paediatric insomnia may be linked to a constellation of negative impacts in the affected child, including an increased risk of health-related problems (e.g., obesity/overweight, pain, fatigue), psychological issues (e.g., anxiety, depression), interpersonal problems (e.g., poor family relationships, peer problems) and impaired daytime functioning (e.g., poor alertness, impaired school performance), as well as elevated levels of family stress and impaired parental mental health and quality of life. Several factors may contribute to paediatric insomnia, including genetic influence, hyperarousal and hypersensitivity, circadian issues, poor sleep hygiene, comorbid medical conditions, and psychosocial and behavioural factors. A thorough assessment is essential to inform the treatment of insomnia in children and adolescents. Actigraphy can provide a continuous and objective estimation of sleep-wake patterns, and is a useful tool in the assessment of paediatric insomnia. Behavioural interventions are usually recommended as the first-line treatment and there has been limited evidence to support the efficacy and safety of medications for treating paediatric insomnia. The current chapter provides an overview of paediatric insomnia, including the classification and diagnostic criteria, prevalence, consequences, and factors associated with childhood insomnia, as well as its assessment and management.",

      "abstract": "The psychopathology of stroke encompasses several psychiatric and behavioral disorders that have high prevalence in the geriatric population, reduce the patient autonomy and increase the caregiver's burden. These disorders are usually associated with other cognitive and neurological deficits, and are labelled as neuropsychiatric when the whole clinical picture is consistent with the specific dysfunction of a neural system or brain region. Thus the neuropsychiatry of stroke comprises disorders of the perception/identification of the self and the environment (anosognosia of hemiplegia, misidentification syndromes, confabulations, visual hallucinations, delirium and acute confusional state), amotivational syndromes (apathy and athymhormia), disorders of emotional reactivity (blunted affect, emotional incontinence, irritability, catastrophic reactions), poor impulse or ideation control (mania) and personality changes. The clinical profile of the subcortical vascular dementia also points to specific brain dysfunction (frontal-subcortical pathways) that manifests with behavioral (depression, emotionalism, irritability) and cognitive symptoms (psychomotor retardation, attention, executive and memory deficits). However, post-stroke depression and anxiety, which have a more variable clinical presentation and might be assimilated, for several aspects, to post-traumatic or adaptive disorders, are disorders less characterized in their neural correlates.",

      "abstract": "Background: The Stroop effect is a simple phenomenon that reveals a lot about the brain processes information. The Stroop effect is our tendency to experience difficulty naming a physical color when it is used to spell the name of a different color. It is a neuropsychological test extensively used to assess the ability to inhibit cognitive interference that occurs when the processing of a specific stimulus feature impedes the simultaneous processing of a second stimulus attribute, well-known as the Stroop Effect. The childhood disorder is an any illness, impairment, or abnormal condition that affects primarily infants and children. Some of the childhood disorders like Mild Mental Retardation, Learning Disorders, Motor Skills Disorders, Pervasive Developmental Disorders, Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorders, Eating disorders of infancy or early childhood, Tic disorders. Visual perceptual discrimination is the brainÂ’s ability to accurately perceive information in a complex, fluid and confusing situation and, even more importantly, to accurately differentiate amongst confusable types of information and ability to identify detail seeing Items like differences in shape, color and orientation. Objectives: The main purpose of this study is to assess the level of visual perceptual discrimination among various childhood disorders. To evaluate the level of visual perceptual discrimination before and after administration of Stroop task performance among various childhood disorders. To associate the level of visual perceptual discrimination among various childhood disorders with their selected demographic variables. Materials and Methods: The research approach used in the study was Quantitative in nature. Pre Â–Experimental One group Pre- test Post test design was used. Purposive Sampling technique was used to select the samples. A total of 30 ChildrenÂ’s with various childhood disorders were selected for this study. Visual Perceptual Discrimination checklist was used to assess the Visual Perceptual Discrimination Problems among children with childhood disorder and administering stroop task performance using Flashcard was used for intervention and Post test was conducted by using same tool in same manner. Results and Conclusion: The result showed that majority of the childhood disorders at selected home 26(86.7%) had low and 4(13.3%) had moderate level of visual perceptual discrimination during Pre test. The Calculated pairedÂ‘tÂ’ value was t= -8.55 and was found to be statistically significant at -P=&lt;0.001 level. After Intervention majority of childhood disorders at selected home 16(53.3%) had low and 14(46.7%) had moderate level of visual perceptual discrimination. There was area of residence and type of childhood disorders had shown statistically significant association between post testlevel of visual perceptual discrimination among various childhood disorders with their selected demographic variables. The other demographic variable had not shown statistically significant association between the post-test level of visual Perceptual discrimination among various childhood disorders with their selected demographic variables .The researcher concluded that by administering Stroop task performance shows that the intervention helps in improving the level of visual perceptual discrimination in good range and found to be one of the helpful interventions in improving the level of visual perceptual discrimination among children with various childhood disorders. The study had proved that Effectiveness and excellent changes in improvement of visual perceptual discrimination among Children\\s with various childhood disorders.",

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is characterized by food restriction leading to low body weight or lack of appropriate weight milestones, disturbance in body image, and poor insight regarding the seriousness of their low body weight. Bulimia nervosa (BN) is characterized by binge-eating followed by compensatory behavior to prevent weight gain. Binge-eating disorder (BED) is characterized by binge eating behavior but with an absence of compensatory behaviors. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is characterized by eating or feeding disturbance leading to consequences including significant weight loss, poor growth, nutritional deficiency, psychosocial dysfunction, or the need for supplemental nutrition.

Barkley claims that these ADHD symptoms represent deficits in executive function (EF) or metacognition. Barkley's EF framework has six components involved with reflective EF. The first three EF components—self-directed attention, self-restraint, and nonverbal working memory create the base for the next three EFs such as verbal working memory, emotional/motivation to self, and self-play reconstitution. Comorbid language impairment occurs most frequently with ADHD-predominantly inattentive type.

      "abstract": "The problems experienced by people with neurological disabilities create barriers to participation in leisure activities. Particular common features include cognitive deficits (attention, executive functioning, language and memory), functional difficulties (in activities of daily living), psychomotor impairment (dyspraxia and poor co-ordination), and behavioural difficulties (aggression, agitation, and wandering). The Multi-sensory environment (MSE) has the potential to accommodate some of these problems experienced by people with neurological disabilities and, as such, is a valuable leisure resource. Multi-sensory activity can address individual sensory needs, such as offering a stronger stimulus if initial attempts are unnoticed, and be offered alongside familiar activities and routines to enhance sensory awareness. If the complexity of the activity, individual needs, and MSE demands are matched, engagement in this activity may be achieved. The Pool Activity Level Occupational Profiling Tool can provide a protocol from which MSE activity may be facilitated. By using this tool the MSE fits well within the World Health Organisation International Classification of functioning, Disability and Health by facilitating participation and reducing environmental barriers.",

The syndrome was first described by Kinnier Wilson, but further progress in development of the concept has occurred only within the past ten years. Subcortical dementia occurs in degenerative extrapyramidal disorders and has also been identified in inflammatory, infectious, and vascular conditions. Histologic, metabolic, and neurochemical investigations implicate dysfunction primarily of subcortical neurotransmitter systems and subcortical structures or subcortical-frontal connections in the genesis of the syndrome. Subcortical dementia contrasts neuropsychologically and anatomically with disorders such as dementia of the Alzheimer type that affect primarily the cerebral cortex. The clinical characteristics of subcortical dementia reflect the interruption of fundamental functions (motivation, mood, timing, arousal) mediated by phylogenetically and ontogenetically early maturing structures.",

People with ADHD usually experience the following types of symptoms: (1) Attention means a person may have difficulty staying on task, sustaining focus, and staying organized, and appear not to listen, even when spoken to directly. (2) Hyperactivity means a person may seem to move about constantly, including in situations when it is not appropriate or excessively fidgets, taps, or talks. They may often be on the go, in constant motion, and have trouble playing or doing an activity quietly. (3) Impulsivity means a person may act without thinking or have difficulty with self-control. Impulsive behavior also occurs when their desire for reward is not satisfied or temporarily put on hold. An impulsive person may interrupt others or make important decisions without considering long-term consequences. Those people’s behaviors are more severe, occur more often, and interfere with or reduce the quality of how they function socially at school or in professional life.",

      "title": "Síndrome de sobreentrenamiento",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder is a form of anxiety disorder which is poorly known in children and manifests as a series of symptoms occurring after an extraordinary event outside the range of usual human experiences and responsible for a feeling of terror. Virtually pathogmonic symptoms include re-experiencing the event through play and ceaselessly repeated behaviors (re-enactments), cognitive distortions when relating the facts (chronological errors, belief in omens), changes in attitudes towards others and life in general, and neurovegetative hyperactivity (hypervigilance, startle responses, difficulties controlling impulses). Although adequate follow-up data are lacking, the disorder can probably become chronic in children, as in adults. This nosographic entity raises the theoretical issue of the roles of life events and individual vulnerability. A number of factors may either \"predispose\" or \"protect\" the child: degree and duration of exposure to the trauma, nature of the event, preexistence of psychiatric disorders, level of cognitive development, sex, degree of social support, and containing or noncontaining attitude of the family. Treatments advocated in adults (pharmacotherapy, cognitive and behavioral therapies, group therapy) remain to be used and evaluated in children.",

The clinical manifestation of epilepsy is synapse, drying of mouth, nausea, blurring of vision. The basic mechanism of epilepsy is due to many cellular changes in membrane conductance and neurotransmitter alterations affecting the neuronal interaction.Cognitive deficits are seen in areas of attention, memory and executive functioning. Behavioural and personality disturbances are also present.(Benett, 1992). Circumstantialities are seen in both spoken and written language. Slowness in thinking, poor abstraction and calculation ability are other cognitive deficits seen in epileptic patients. The nature and extent of cognitive deficits depend on seizure type, frequency, age of onset, duration of disorder and the etiology (Benett, 1992).Restoration and reestablishment are the techniques employed for cognitive remediation. Along with it compensatory techniques are also employed. Neuropsychological remediation is used for correcting different facets of cognitive deficits like attention, memory, executive functioning. They have been attempted at hyperactive children, alcoholics and people with psychiatric decomposition.AIMThe aim of the study was to develop and test the efficacy of cognitive remedial measures.HYPOTHESISThere will be significant difference in the pre and post therapy cognitive scores in the various tests.METHODOLOGYDesign and StudySampling: The purposive sampling method was taken to collect the sample. Patients fulfilling the criteria of the study were contacted. The sample size was 46 out of which after the elimination of the drop outs the sample size remained 30. The inclusion and exclusion for the sample size is as under:Inclusion criteria.Age between 18 and 45.Subjects having primary education.Persons having normal vision and hearing.On regular medication.Exclusion criteria:Subjects with any psychiatric and neurological illness.Mental retardation as assessed clinically.History of alcohol abuse.Symptomatic epilepsy.PROCEDUREThe sample was taken from two major hospitals and the criteria of local was kept in mind so that commuting won't be a problem for the patients especially the treatment group. The patients who had consented for the cognitive remediation programme were included in the treatment group and the patients who were ready to come for 2-3 times were in the control group.The patients were psycho educated about the research and the benefits after their participation in the study.Pre therapy assessment:The number of tests administered were -1. Socio demographic data sheet.2. Digit Vigilance Test: (Lezak, 1995)3. Digit Symbol Substitution Test: (Wechsler, 1981)4. The 1 back and 2 back versions of N back test (Smith and Jonides, 1999)5. Tower of London Test: (Shallice, 1982)6. Wisconsin card sorting test -(Milner, 1963)TASKS FOR GENERAL COGNITIVE IMPROVEMENTCertain tasks were formulated for improving general cognitive functions like... financial planning in the house, simple maths, problem solving, puzzles and board games, tasks for creative thinking.TASKS FOR SPECIFIC COGNITIVE FUNCTIONSTasks were developed to improve the cognitive functions outlined above in a graded fashion.1.

      "abstract": "Background FOXP1 syndrome is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder associated with complex clinical presentations including global developmental delay, mild to profound intellectual disability, speech and language impairment, autism traits, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and a range of behavioral challenges.. To date, much of the literature focuses on childhood symptoms and little is known about the FOXP1 syndrome phenotype in adolescence or adulthood. Methods A series of caregiver interviews and standardized questionnaires assessed psychiatric and behavioral features of 20 adolescents and adults with FOXP1 syndrome. Interviews captured change in various psychiatric manifestations over time. Medication, social, educational, and vocational history was collected and visual analog scales measured top caregiver concerns during childhood and adolescence/adulthood. Results Anxiety and externalizing behaviors were common in this cohort and psychiatric features, such as psychosis or bipolar symptoms, were present in two participants. There was no reported regression or loss of skills, early in development or during adolescence/adulthood. Caregivers reported continued development in adaptive skills even into adolescence/adulthood. Medication use was common particularly for features of ADHD, although multiple trials were required for some participants to achieve benefit. Standardized assessments accurately picked up on externalizing symptoms and were less sensitive to internalizing symptoms. Educational setting varied up until late elementary school and gradually shifted to special education. Cognitive and developmental concerns were reported as primary during childhood and independence/safety and housing concerns became top concerns by adolescence/adulthood. Caregivers reported continued development in adaptive skills even into adulthood. Conclusions Taken together, results are reassuring, with many families reporting their adolescent and adult children continued to gain skills over time, particularly related to increased independence in communication and personal care. There were no reports of developmental regression, neuropsychiatric decompensation or catatonia.",

      "title": "Cognitive impairment and depression",
      "abstract": "The commonality of cognitive impairment and depression is discussed. Cognitive symptoms are the main symptoms of depressive disorder and, most often, it is cognitive impairment that reduces the performance and quality of life of depressed patients. The most common cognitive disorders in depressed patients are: attention deficit (both visual and auditory), decrease in the level of short-term and operative memory, difficulties in processing information of any modality, a decrease in the speed of information processing, as well as difficulties in building an activity program and monitoring her execution. A cognitive symptom that requires further discussion is the so-called cognitive distortion – a shift in focus from positive to negative stimuli, as well as incorrect reactions to negative feedback and decision making. A depressive episode develops against the background of dysmetabolic and dysfunctional cerebral changes in the amygdala, cingulate cortex, hippocampus, orbitofrontal and mediobasal frontal cortex. Cognitive impairment in patients who have had depression persists after recovery from depression; according to the figurative expression adopted in the scientific community of specialists studying cognitive impairment in depression, each depressive episode forms permanent “cognitive scars”. Presumably, cognitive dysfunction may be one of the risk factors for the development of a depressive disorder; depression, in turn, is a risk factor for the development of dementia, including in Alzheimer’s disease and cerebrovascular disease: studies have shown that the transformation of severe cognitive impairment associated with depression into dementia in elderly patients can reach 70% in five years. The undoubted commonality of depression and cognitive dysfunction is emphasized by the frequency of depression in patients with cognitive impairment.",

      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of rapidly growing disabilities. They are characterized by repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities, problems in social interactions. ASD is a complicated neurological disorder that is characterized by behavioral and psychological problems in children. These children become distressed when their surrounding environment is changed because their adaptive capabilities are minimal. The symptoms are present from early childhood and affect daily functioning. Children with ASD have co-occurring language problems, intellectual disabilities, and epilepsy at higher rates than the general population.Childhood disintegrative disorder, also called disintegrative psychosis and Heller syndrome, is a rare disorder that is categorized under ASD. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), childhood disintegrative disorder, along with other types of autism, are merged into a single spectrum called autism spectrum disorder. Childhood disintegrative disorder has a relatively late onset and is characterized by regression of previously acquired skills in the areas of social, language, and motor functioning. It is not known what causes this disease, and it is often seen that children who have this disorder have achieved normal developmental milestones before the regression of skills. The age at which this disease manifests is variable, but it is typically seen after three years of reaching normal milestones. The regression can be so fast that the child may be mindful of it, and in the beginning, may even ask what is going on with them. Some children may appear to be responding to hallucinations, but the most common and distinct feature of this disease is that the attained skills are gone.Many children are already delayed when the disorder becomes apparent, but these delays are not always evident in young children. This condition has been described as a devastating disease that affects both the individual's life and the family.",

      "title": "Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease: What We Know Now",
      "abstract": "Small delays in onset of Alzheimer's Disease are predicted to reduce its global burden, but we need to better understand factors that increase the risk-and methods to reduce it. The clinical syndrome of dementia refers to a pattern of cognitive deficits characterized by impairment in memory and at least one other cognitive domain (e.g., language, executive functions, visuospatial abilities) that is sufficiently severe to impact behavior and interfere with social or occupational functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Dementia may be progressive, static, or remitting, and its onset and course of symptoms are a function of underlying neuropathology from various causes. For example, dementia because of a neurodegenerative process tends to involve an insidious onset with gradual progressive cognitive impairment. In contrast, dementia from vascular or acquired brain injury tends to involve an abrupt onset of clinical symptoms that may remain static or show stepwise cognitive decline that corresponds to episodes of cerebrovascular accidents. The most common causes of dementia are neuropathologically distinguished on the basis of the presence of beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (e.g., Alzheimer's Disease); multiple or strategically placed infarctions, ischemic injury, or hemorrhagic lesions (e.g., vascular dementia); cell loss and the deposition of Lewy bodies in sub-cortical, limbic, and neocortical regions (e.g., dementia with Lewy bodies); and prominent frontal and temporal lobar atrophy (frontotemporal dementia). Dementia can also be found in the context of other neurological, infectious, or metabolic conditions, such as Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, human immunodeficiency virus, or traumatic brain injury. Despite recent advances in amyloid imaging and cerebral spinal fluid analysis, neuropathological changes are often only accurately assessed at autopsy. This makes definitive diagnosis during an individual's lifetime difficult. Effectively differentiating between forms of dementia or normal aging requires reliance on the neuropsychological definition of a specific pattern of cognitive deficits. Epidemiology and Neurobiology of Alzheimer's Disease Alzheimer's Disease is the leading cause of dementia in elders and accounts for 60 percent to 80 percent of all dementia cases. An estimated 5.3 million Americans have Alzheimer's Disease. Reports indicate the disease is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, and deaths because of Alzheimer's Disease are on the rise, with an increase of 46 percent between 2000 and 2006. Given the advancing age of the baby boom generation, by 2050, 14 million older Americans and 81 million adults worldwide are expected to have the disease (Alzheimer's Association, 2010a). Alzheimer's Disease is an age-related degenerative brain disorder characterized by the abnormal accumulation of extracellular fibrillar amyloid deposits and intra-neuronal neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. These characteristics lead to neuronal atrophy and synapse loss in medial temporal lobe limbic structures that are critical for episodic memory and extend to the association cortices of the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes with disease progression (Braak and Braak, 1991). Consistent with these widespread neuropathological changes, the primary clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive global dementia syndrome that usually begins in later life. It is generally agreed that the pathological cascade of brain changes occurs gradually in Alzheimer's Disease, beginning with the very early accrual of Aβ plaques in the brain, and is followed by a variable lag time after which neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration become the leading pathological process (Jack et al., 2010). Although Aβ neuropathology is thought to be causal, clinical symptoms are more closely related to neurofibrillary tangles than amyloid deposition. …",

We show that candidates for bipolar disorder significantly overlap with candidates for clinical conditions resulting from a deficit in the phonological loop of working memory, particularly, developmental dyslexia and specific language impairment. The overlapping genes are involved in aspects of brain development and function (particularly, brain oscillations) potentially underlying phonological processing and accordingly, emerge as promising candidates for auditory-verbal deficits in bipolar disorder.",

While developmental milestones are usually normal in young children, older children have variable levels of intellectual disability. Neurologic examination is usually normal except for mild spasticity. Seizures are not common. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ASPM-MCPH is established in a proband with biallelic pathogenic variants in ASPM identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and focused on interventions to address developmental delay / intellectual disability, speech delay, and behavior issues. The management of epilepsy and spasticity is as per standard care. Surveillance: Routine monitoring of: growth; response of seizures to treatment or new-onset seizures; management of spasticity; developmental progress, including speech and language development; educational needs; and behavior for anxiety, attention, and aggressive or self-injurious behavior. Assess family need for social work support (e.g., respite care, other local resources) Agents/circumstances to avoid: Limit the use of methylphenidate, which exacerbates hyperactivity. Genetic counseling ASPM-MCPH is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being a heterozygote (carrier), and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Heterozygotes may have mild microcephaly (-2 to -3 SDs) but do not have other clinical findings associated with ASPM-MCPH. Once the ASPM pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "abstract": "Down syndrome is the most common genetic disorder that results from the excess of one chromosome or part of a chromosome in the nucleus of each cell of the body. This disorder significantly characterizes the development of the child in all areas. It affects all racial groups and can occur in any family, regardless of parental health, economic situation or lifestyle. Because it limits a child's mental development, intellectual disabilities are primary in people with Down Syndrome.\r\n Intellectual disabilities are a complex occurrence of a condition that is defined as a significant limitation in an individual's development, and is determined before the age of 18. It is characterized by below-average intellectual functioning and a reduced level of adaptive skills. Difficulties can manifest as different deviations on the motor, cognitive, emotional and social plan. In this context, there is a need to implement various therapeutic interventions within which expressive arts therapies may represent one of the appropriate complementary therapeutic methods.\r\n Expressive arts-therapies refer to the application of various art-media such as music, visual arts, movement and dance, drama, poetry, and related approaches such as psychodrama, guided imagination, relaxation, etc., with the aim of stimulating emotional, cognitive, social and the physical integration of the individual. The use of expressive arts-therapies may be useful as complementary therapy in conditions where certain physical, intellectual or sensory limitations inhibit the realization of emotional or social needs. Given that this type of therapeutic approach works to improve functional abilities, gain new insights into one's emotional experience, needs, goals and strategies, and to encourage social interactions, it can contribute to subjective, emotional, spiritual and psychosocial well-being and thus improving the quality of life of people with intellectual disabilities.\r\n 7\r\n In this regard, the aim of this paper is defined to review the current findings on the impact of expressive arts-therapies on various aspects of functioning in individuals with Down syndrome. Considering the lack of available literature in the defined problem area, this paper also covers related research on the impact of expressive arts-therapies in people with intellectual disabilities caused by different etiology.\r\n Although the results of the some researches indicated positive effects in the field of psychomotor, emotional and social functioning, there is also a need for further research focused on the conceptualization of therapeutic programs as well as on the development of an evaluation system, where particular emphasis should be placed on defining appropriate assessment instruments and parameters. This would have a positive impact on the prospect of future use of expressive arts-therapies, as part of a holistic and interdisciplinary approach, in the rehabilitation of persons with Down syndrome.",

The presence of these symptoms could be observed in the first years of the diseases. We describe the status of the patient at the admission, the evolution during the stay, with the increase of symptoms in several areas (cognitive, motor, neurologic), and the current status, after hospitalization, where the patient begun receiving enteral nutrition by gastrostomie, due to the limitations to receive the treatment and /or nutrition by oral way. This case is also interesting due to the use of Metformine, an antidiabetic agent, whose use has been suggested as therapeutic alternative for this syndrome.",

      "title": "STXBP1 Encephalopathy with Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is characterized by early-onset encephalopathy with epilepsy (i.e., moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, refractory seizures, and ongoing epileptiform activity). The median age of onset of seizures is six weeks (range 1 day to 13 years). Seizure types can include infantile spasms; generalized tonic-clonic, clonic, or tonic seizures; and myoclonic, focal, atonic, and absence seizures. Epilepsy syndromes can include Ohtahara syndrome, West syndrome, Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome, and Dravet syndrome (not SCN1A-related), classic Rett syndrome (not MECP2-related), and atypical Rett syndrome (not CDKL5-related). The EEG is characterized by focal epileptic activity, burst suppression, hypsarrhythmia, or generalized spike-and-slow waves. Other findings can include abnormal tone, movement disorders (especially ataxia and dystonia), and behavior disorders (including autism spectrum disorder). Feeding difficulties are common. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous intragenic pathogenic variant in STXBP1 or a contiguous gene deletion that includes STXBP1 and adjacent genes on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Developmental delay, cognitive dysfunction, and intellectual disability are managed in the usual manner. The most commonly used anti-seizure medications (ASMs) are phenobarbital, valproic acid, and vigabatrin; an estimated 20% of individuals require more than one ASM and approximately 25% are refractory to ASM therapy. Severe dystonia, dyskinesia, and choreoathetosis can be treated with monoamine depleters or dopaminergic agents. Behavior disorders and feeding difficulties are managed symptomatically in the usual manner. Surveillance: Neuropsychological assessment and EEG are performed as needed. Genetic counseling STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, most probands represent simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) and have the disorder as a result of a de novo STXBP1 pathogenic variant. Individuals with STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy are not known to reproduce. Once the STXBP1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

Deficits such as aphasia, dyspraxia, dementia, unravelling and other neuropsychological disorders are conditions that necessarily require a multidisciplinary intervention. Rehabilitation, with whole culture of disability related to it, is configured as the central aspect of doing rehabilitation that is related to the activity of the “person” in its entirety and complexity. The concept of “quality of care” presents the citizen as the center of interest for operators called to carry out an increasingly effective, timely, continuous, secure, appropriate practice( with respect to interpersonal communication centralizing the assisted ).\r\n\r\nThe competence of the speech therapist consists of three components: the knowledge, the skills, the behavior; that “knowing how to act “on the whole that guarantees quality, that allows the identification of the best practice through the use of multidisciplinary and professional operational tools, that amends and aligns the behavior of professionals.

Delirij se prema DSM-5 dijagnosticira na temelju smetnje pažnje i svijesti (smetnje svijesti u DSM-IV) uz prisutnost neke dodatne smetnje kognicije, nastaje tijekom kratkog vremenskog razdoblja radi intoksikacije psihoaktivnom tvari/lijekom, zbog sindroma sustezanja od psihoaktivne tvari/lijeka ili zbog drugog, zdravstvenog stanja i ove se smetnje ne mogu objasniti nekim drugim neurorazvojnim poremecajem koji je od ranije prisutan ili je u razvoju.

      "title": "Degenerative ataxic disorders",
      "abstract": "Ataxia refers to instability of posture or lack of coordination of movement occurring independently of motor weakness. Characteristic manifestations of ataxia include postural and gait abnormalities, incoordination of limb movements, dysarthria and oculomotor disturbances. Postural changes are typified by swaying instability of the trunk while standing or even sitting. A wide-based stance is assumed, but patients may still have difficulty maintaining balance. Gait is irregular, wide-based and staggering, with loss of the ability to tandem walk. Limb abnormalities include dysmetria, an inability to perform movements with proper timing and trajectory. Intention tremor, loss of fluidity of movement, inability to control force of movement and a reduced ability to perform rapid alternating movements, dysdiadochokinesia, are features of dysmetria. Dysarthria is defined by abnormalities of rhythm, fluency and clarity of speech. Oculomotor changes may consist of disorders of ocular fixation, ocular alignment, visual pursuit, saccadic movements, and nystagmus. Several clinical assessment scales have been developed, the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS)107,111 and the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA),94 to evaluate the degree of clinical involvement in ataxic patients. A guideline for the use of these scales in the management of ataxias has been published by the Movement Disorders Society.82 Although ataxic conditions can be separated into two groups, primary and secondary (Table 22.1), the primary group is the focus of this chapter, with particular emphasis on inherited forms (Table 22.2). The secondary ataxias and congenital ataxias are summarised in Box 22.1.",

Seizures are of various types and can be difficult to manage. Developmental delay / intellectual disability (ID) is severe in nearly a half, moderate in a third, and mild in the remainder. Nearly a third never develop speech or language skills. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of NCBRS is established in a proband with suggestive clinical findings and the identification of a heterozygous SMARCA2 pathogenic variant by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for seizures under the care of a neurologist or epileptologist; occupational, physical, and/or speech therapy; routine management of refractive errors and hearing loss. Surveillance: At least yearly evaluation by a neurologist to assess for and/or manage seizures; yearly evaluation by a developmental pediatrician to assess developmental progress and therapeutic and educational interventions; regular follow up of ophthalmologic and/or audiologic abnormalities. Genetic counseling NCBRS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. All affected individuals reported to date have NCBRS as the result of a de novo SMARCA2 pathogenic variant. Although no affected sibs have been reported, the risk to sibs is presumed to be greater than in the general population because of the possibility of germline mosaicism in a parent. If the SMARCA2 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for pregnancies at theoretic increased risk is possible.",

Speech is significantly delayed and most individuals are nonverbal with receptive language often stronger than expressive language. Other common findings are autism spectrum disorder symptoms, sleep disturbance, stereotypic hand movements, seizures, constipation, and severe myopia. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is suspected on clinical findings and confirmed by identification on molecular genetic testing of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in TCF4 or a deletion of the chromosome region in which TCF4 is located (18q21.2). Management Treatment of manifestations: Developmental services for infants (physical, occupational, and speech therapies); individualized education plan for older children with strong consideration for early training in alternative means of communication; behavioral management strategies; possible treatment of abnormal respiratory pattern. Routine management of seizures, myopia, constipation, scoliosis, and ankle instability. Surveillance: Ongoing developmental assessments to tailor educational services to individual needs; regular follow up with an ophthalmologist to monitor for high myopia and strabismus; periodic reevaluation with a clinical genetics professional regarding current information and recommendations. Genetic counseling PTHS is caused by haploinsufficiency of TCF4 resulting from either a pathogenic variant in TCF4 or a deletion of the chromosome region in which TCF4 is located (18q21.2). Most affected individuals have been simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) resulting from a de novo pathogenic variant or deletion. The risk to sibs of a proband is low, but higher than that of the general population because of the possibility of parental germline mosaicism.

Neglect may be spatial or personal. Spatial neglect may occur in three reference frames: body centered, environmentally centered, and object centered. One may be inattentive to stimuli in space or on the person (attentional or sensory neglect) and one may fail to act in a portion of space, in a spatial direction, or to use a portion of one’s body (intentional or motor neglect). Many specific disorders have been described, distinguished by their presumed underlying mechanisms, the distribution of the abnormal behavior, and the means of eliciting the behavior. Different behavioral manifestations may occur at different times, and in some patients certain manifestations are never seen. The major behavioral manifestations that we will discuss in this chapter include (1) inattention or sensory neglect, (2) extinction to simultaneous stimuli, (3) motor neglect, (4) spatial neglect, (5) personal neglect, (6) allesthesia and allokinesia, and (7) anosognosia (unawareness of illness). The first section of this chapter will define specific disorders and describe clinical tests that may be used to assess them.",

      "abstract": "Stress can be defined as the brain response to any demand. Maternal exposure to stress during pregnancy may have negative effects on fetal and infant neurodevelopment, including delayed mental and motor development, difficult temperament, and impaired cognitive performance. Some of these effects are seen on brain structure and function and in the risk for later depression and posttraumatic stress disorder. Stress in adolescence appears to have lasting effects on brain regions such as the hippocampus and alters mood and anxiety-related behaviors in animal models, as well as cognitive function. The brain is the key organ of the response to stress because it determines what is threatening and, therefore, potentially stressful, as well as the physiological and behavioral responses which can be either adaptive or damaging. Stressors in adult life alter neuronal morphology in brain regions such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex and influence learning, anxiety, executive function, and somatic-visceral functions. Exposure to stress and stress hormones during the prenatal period, infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood or aging, has an impact on brain structures involved in cognition and mental health. As demonstrated in the above, generally stress can have wide ranging effects on emotions, mood and behavior.",

This review shows that: (1) SD patients have apraxia of tool use because of semantic tool knowledge deficits, but normal performance in tests of physical understanding; (2) AD and CBS patients show impaired performance in mechanical problem-solving tests, probably not because of intrinsic deficits of physical understanding, but rather because of additional cognitive (AD) or motor impairments (CBS); (3) As a result, the performance in mechanical problem-solving tests is not a good predictor of familiar tool use in dementia; (4) Actual deficits of physical understanding are probably observed only in late stages of neurodegenerative diseases, and associated with functional loss.",

      "abstract": "Сочетание дисфагии с нарушениями речи и других высших психических функций у лиц с последствиями инсульта делает их зависимыми от окружающих. Обезвоживание и недоедание достаточно распространены у этой категории пациентов, что требует применения методик модификация диеты. Данная категория больных находится в группе риска летального исхода вследствие развития аспирационной пневмонии, обусловленной дисфагией, а невозможность или недостатки общения не позволяют им сообщить о потребностях в питье и еде, что приводит к снижению потребления пищи, активизации катаболических процессов, обезвоживанию, появлению постинсультной усталости, депрессии и снижению качества жизни. Сочетание дисфагии и афазии у пациентов в постинсультном периоде является осложняющим фактором реабилитации функции глотания из-за нарушения речи. Без специальных логопедических занятий восстановление нарушенных речевых функций, как и глотания, затруднено или невозможно. Пациентам с дисфагией и афазией с целью стимулирования понимания речи в процессе выполнения ими инструкций по преодолению дисфагии, с одной стороны, и восстановления речи – с другой, необходим персонифицированный подход к подбору коммуникативных моделей. Соблюдение рекомендаций логопеда по восстановлению речевых функций пациента с использованием методик нутритивной поддержки (загустителей пищи и продуктов специализированного питания) позволяет минимизировать осложнения дисфагии, уменьшить выраженность речевых нарушений и повысить реабилитационный потенциал больных. В статье описан опыт применения персонифицированных коммуникативных моделей у 128 пациентов с постинсультной афазией и дисфагией. Учет структуры и выраженности речевого дефекта, правильная организация ухода за пациентами и использование коммуникативных моделей во время кормления позволили перевести больных на пероральное питание. Таким образом, использование персонифицированных видов коммуникативных моделей для пациентов с сочетанием афазии и дисфагии позволяет уменьшить или полностью нивелировать нарушения глотания, значительно улучшить состояние речи, сократить сроки реабилитации и повысить качество жизни больных. The combination of dysphagia with speech disorders and other higher mental functions in people with the consequences of a stroke makes them dependent on others. Dehydration and malnutrition are quite common in this category of patients, which requires the use of diet modification techniques. This category of patients are at risk of death due to the development of aspiration pneumonia caused by dysphagia, and the impossibility or lack of communication does not allow them to report their needs for drinking and eating, which leads to a decrease in food intake, activation of catabolic processes, dehydration, and the appearance of «post-stroke fatigue», depression and a decrease in the quality of life. The combination of dysphagia and aphasia in patients in the post-stroke period is a complicating factor in the rehabilitation of swallowing function due to the presence of speech impairment. Without special speech therapy classes, the restoration of impaired speech functions, as well as swallowing, is difficult or impossible. For patients with dysphagia and aphasia, in order to stimulate speech understanding in the process of fulfilling instructions for overcoming dysphagia, on the one hand, and restoring speech, on the other hand, a personalized approach to the selection of communication models is needed. Compliance with the recommendations of a speech therapist can minimize the complications of dysphagia, reduce the severity of speech disorders. The use of thickeners and specialized food products when feeding patients can minimize the complications of dysphagia and increase the rehabilitation potential of patients. The article describes the experience of using personalized communication models for 128 patients with post-stroke aphasia and dysphagia. Taking into account the structure and severity of the speech defect, the correct organization of patient care and the use of communication models during feeding made it possible to transfer patients to oral nutrition. Thus, the use of personalized types of communication models for patients with a combination of aphasia and dysphagia can reduce or completely eliminate swallowing disorders, significantly improve the state of speech, shorten the rehabilitation period and improve the quality of life of patients.",

      "abstract": "Work-related mental problems can be defined as behaviors, emotions and cognitions that impede the successful completion of a task in a given time frame, i. e., the difficulty or inability to achieve important work-related goals. They are highly prevalent but have been neglected in psychology in general and as a target of psychotherapy in particular. Although work-related problems do not represent a mental disorder per se , they are associated with severe distress and high psychosocial costs. In this article, the prevalence of work-related problems, associated burden, diagnostic assessment and treatment are reviewed. So far, research has primarily focused on procrastination, i.e., the act of postponing or delaying tasks until the last minute or past the deadline. However, procrastination represents just one type of work-related problems among several others. Further forms of work-related problems are presented (e.g., perfectionism, or work-related problems in the context of specific personality types). The relation of work-related problems to specific mental disorders is discussed. Psychosocial interventions are the treatment of choice for work-related mental problems. However, response rates for the treatment of procrastination are limited, which calls for further research into which treatments work for whom. No evidence-based treatments are currently available for other types of work-related problems, with the exception of perfectionism, a personality trait that is also linked to problems in the field of work. Thus, there is a need to further improve the treatment of work-related problems including procrastination. For other types of work-related problems, effective treatments need to be developed and validated. They may be based on existing manualized treatments and extended by specific aspects or modules focusing on work-related problems.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nCognitive functioning in individuals changes with aging. The\r\nextent and pattern of decline varies among various cognitive do mainsand also among individuals. Certain cognitive domains tend to decline as a person ages in comparison to his younger counterpart. Some elderly individuals may not show a decline in cognitive functioning. High intelligence, well organized work habits and sound judgment\r\ncompensate for many of the progressive shortcomings of old age.\r\nCognitive decline is thought to start after the age of 30 years. Little that is new and original is learned after the age of forty. A ttention, language, and memory are the basic processes that serve as building blocks for the development of higher intellectual functions. The higher cognitive functions include manipulation of well learned material, abstract thinking, problem solving, judgment,\r\narithmetic computations. These complex functions are predicated on the integrity and interaction of more basic processes. Because they represent the most advanced stages of intellectual development, the higher cognitive functions are more susceptible to neurological diseases. The\r\nevaluation of these higher functions may demonstrate the early effects of cortical damage before the more basic processes of attention, language and memory are affected.\r\nAIM OF STUDY\r\n1.To study the pattern of decline of various cognitive\r\nfunctioning with aging.\r\n2. To compare with healthy controls in the community.\r\n3. To identify the differences in cognitive status based on the educational level and IQ of the patient.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\nSTUDY CENTRE:\r\nDepartment of Geriatric Medicine, Madras Medical College &\r\nRajiv Gandhi General Hospital Chennai.\r\nSTUDY DESIGN:\r\nCase control study.\r\nSAMPLE SIZE:\r\nOne hundred and twenty six: seventy six cases above the age of 65 and 50 controls from 20-30 age group.\r\nSTUDY DURATION:\r\nDecember 2011 –November 2012.\r\nSELECTION OF PARTICIPANTS:\r\nINCLUSION CRITERIA:\r\n1. Patients above 65 yrs of age attending the geriatric\r\noutpatient department.\r\n2. Healthy controls between 20 and 30 years of age from the\r\ncommunity.\r\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\r\n1. Acutely toxic patients.\r\n2. Patients with diabetes, hypertension, stroke and primary\r\nneurologic disease like alzhemier’s.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nCognitive changes show a positive correlation with both aging and educational status.\r\nVerbal fluency shows a decline with age ,but shows a stronger association to the level of education. Higher the level of education, better performance on verbal fluency .\r\nRecent memory, episodic memory, Executive functions,\r\nVisuospatial skills, and psychomotor functions also decline as age advances.\r\nPerformance on tests of executive functions, visuospatial skills, verbal fluency show a positive correlation to the level of education.\r\nPerformance on tests of Recent memory, episodic memory and\r\npsychomotor function a decline with aging irrespective of the educational status.",

      "title": "Leukodystrophy Overview – ARCHIVED CHAPTER, FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY",
      "abstract": "NOTE: THIS PUBLICATION IS ARCHIVED. IT IS FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY, AND THE INFORMATION MAY BE OUT OF DATE. Clinical characteristics Leukodystrophies are heritable myelin disorders affecting the white matter of the central nervous system with or without peripheral nervous system myelin involvement. Involvement of the white matter tracts almost universally leads to motor involvement that manifests as hypotonia in early childhood and progresses to spasticity over time. This may lead to variable motor impairment, from mild spastic diplegia to severe spastic quadriplegia that limits purposeful movement. In addition, motor dysfunction is likely to significantly impair vital functions including swallowing, chewing, and (in some cases) respiration. Other findings that vary by disorder include extrapyramidal movement disorders (e.g., dystonia and/or dyskinesias), ataxia, seizures, and delay in cognitive development or change in cognitive function over time. Diagnosis/testing Establishing the specific leukodystrophy present in a given individual usually involves: Genetic counseling Leukodystrophies with an identified genetic cause may be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, an autosomal recessive manner, or an X-linked recessive manner. Genetic counseling regarding risk to family members depends on accurate diagnosis, determination of the mode of inheritance in each family, and results of molecular genetic testing. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible for some types of leukodystrophy if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known. Many leukodystrophies are still without an identified genetic cause; once a genetic cause is identified, other inheritance patterns may emerge. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and ideally occurs in a multidisciplinary setting by specialists experienced in the care of persons with a leukodystrophy. Pharmacologic agents are used to manage muscle tone and block neuronal signaling to muscle (chemodenervation). Intensive physical therapy is used to improve mobility and function. Pharmacologic treatment of dystonia and dyskinesias may result in significant functional improvement. Treatment of ataxia, seizures, and cognitive issues is provided in the usual manner, depending on the needs of the individual. Prevention of primary manifestations: In a few leukodystrophies primary disease manifestations can be prevented by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) early in the disease course. Surveillance: Routine assessment of growth and nutritional status; physical examination and/or serial x-rays of the hips and spine to monitor for orthopedic complications; and routine history regarding signs and symptoms of seizures. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Mild head injuries and infection as these may exacerbate disease manifestations. Evaluation of relatives at risk: When primary prevention of a leukodystrophy is possible (e.g., by HSCT or BMT), it is appropriate to offer testing to asymptomatic at-risk relatives who would benefit from early diagnosis and consideration of early treatment.",

Poor sleep can inhibit rapid growth and development in early childhood.\r\n\r\nAnd it’s not just about sleep duration; the time one goes to bed also plays an important role in the physical, emotional, and cognitive development of children.\r\n\r\nA consistent early bedtime is especially important for young children transitioning from biphasic sleep (where children still nap during the day) to monophasic sleep (where sleep happens at night).\r\n\r\nLate sleepers don’t always get the recommended amount of sleep but evidence also suggests late bedtime is associated with sleep quality problems and difficulty falling asleep.\r\n\r\nAll this can add up to concentration, memory, and behaviour issues in children.",

      "abstract": "JAAKKO MONONEN University of Eastem Finland Department of Biology P.O. Box 1627, 70211 Kuopio, Finland jaakko.mononen@uef.fi & MTT Agrifood Research Finland Animal Production Research Halolantie 31A, 71750 Maaninka, Finland jaakko.mononen@mtt.fi 5 Animal welfare can be defined as an individual animal's subjective experience of its mental and physical state as regards its attempt to cope with its environment. The mental state (feelings and emotions) of an animal cannot be measured directly, but has to be inferred from the behaviour, physiology, health and productivity of an animal. Various choice tests can be used to assess the behavioural priorities of animals. These tests provide insight into what animals regard as preferable or aversive. Unsuitable housing environments and management may lead to movement difficulties, abnormal responsiveness and abnonnal behaviour. Also, a variety of responses of the neuroendocrine, autonomic nervous and immune systems can indicate coping difficulties and stress experienced by animals. Long-term stress may finally result in health problems and reduced productivity. Diseases and injuries themselves are naturally often coupled with suffering. Good productivity does not necessarily equal with good welfare while genetic selection for productivity, for example, may have negative welfare effects. Animal welfare is not only the absence of suffering, but also the animals' possibility to have positive mental states should be considered. Positive mental states can be interpreted from the behaviour and physiology of animals. Since the welfare state results from the complicated interaction of an animal with its environment, it is highly recommended that a diverse range of measures are used in animal welfare studies.",

      "abstract": "Anlass für eine Beurteilung der Fahreignung (FE) ist entweder die Selbstprüfungspflicht des Patienten, die Aufklärungspflicht des Arztes oder die Anforderung eines Gutachtens durch die Fahrerlaubnisbehörden. Zu beurteilen sind die körperlichen Voraussetzungen, nämlich die Gebrauchsfähigkeit von Armen und Beinen, das Sehvermögen und das Gleichgewicht sowie geistige (psychische) Voraussetzungen, nämlich die (visuelle) Wahrnehmungsfähigkeit, die Aufmerksamkeit und die Belastbarkeit. Zu deren Überprüfung werden in der Regel geeignete, objektivierbare psychologische Testverfahren verlangt. Festgestellte Eignungsmängel können unter Umständen durch entsprechende Hilfsmittel, Kfz-Umbauten oder durch eine besonders erfahrene, vorausschauende und sicherheitsbewusste Fahrweise kompensiert werden. Nicht kompensiert werden können homonyme Hemianopsie, persistierende Doppelbilder bei Geradeausblick, unvorhersehbar attackenförmig auftretender Schwindel, visuelles Hemineglektsyndrom sowie charakterliche Mängel. In der Beurteilung bei speziellen Krankheitsbildern ist immer vom Einzelfall auszugehen. Von einer Einschränkung der FE ist auszugehen, wenn eine Verkehrsgefährdung durch die Erkrankung/Symptomatik in konkreten Fahrsituationen anzunehmen ist, sodass ein Unfall mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit eintreten kann. Derartige Gefährdungssituationen entstehen durch Einschränkungen der körperlichen oder geistigen Leistungsfähigkeit, unvorhersehbar auftretende Störungen der Leistungsfähigkeit oder mangelnde Einsicht in Gefahren und Risiken. Die Bedingungen bei verschiedenen Krankheitsbildern/Syndromen werden diskutiert. Für das praktische Vorgehen werden neben der aktuellen klinischen Untersuchung ggf. ein EEG, Doppler-Sonographie der hirnversorgenden Gefäße und eine neuropsychologische Untersuchung empfohlen.",

      "abstract": "La afasia de conduccion es un sindrome caracterizado por la alteracion de la repeticion en el contexto de una comprension auditiva relativamente conservada y un habla fluida. De acuerdo con los actuales marcos cognitivos neuropsicologicos, una alteracion en la planificacion fonologica para la produccion del habla es la disfuncion cognitiva subyacente comun en la mayoria de los casos. Sin embargo, hay diferentes explicaciones en cuanto a su naturaleza explicativa. Estos se dividen en dos amplias clases: “lexicas” y “postlexicas”. Otras caracteristicas comunes, como los problemas de repeticion de la oracion y la reduccion del span de memoria a corto plazo, pueden ser una consecuencia secundaria del deterioro fonologico primario. El objetivo de este trabajo es realizar un analisis del perfil neuropsicologico de una persona con afasia de conduccion, para establecer si las dificultades observadas se pueden explicar a traves de procesos lexicos o postlexicos y determinar la repercusion en otros dominios cognitivos. Se presenta el caso de un hombre de 80 anos quien fue diagnosticado con afasia de conduccion tras haber sufrido un evento cerebrovascular isquemico en territorio de la arteria cerebral media izquierda, el cual fue evaluado con el Programa Integrado de Exploracion Neuropsicologica “Test Barcelona” (perfil de afasias) y la Figura Compleja de Rey-Osterreith. Los resultados observados mostraron dificultades para recuperar informacion del lexico mental sobre la composicion fonologica de las palabras, aunado a deterioro de otros procesos contribuyentes, como los implicados en el procesamiento auditivo-fonologico. Por lo que el deficit en el procesamiento lexico-fonologico compromete la capacidad verbal de memoria a corto plazo.  Se concluye que el diagnostico de afasia de conduccion puede ser un primer paso util para comprender las dificultades del lenguaje de una persona y planificar intervenciones de tratamiento efectivas, comprendiendo la naturaleza de la disfuncionalidad a partir del procesamiento lexico-fonologico.",

I.Hearing Loss Sensitivity and AcuityHearing loss comes in many forms and degrees of severity.Auditory disorders can result in decreased sensitivity, decreased acuity (clarity), or both.With decreased sensitivity, sounds are simply too soft.If sounds are made louder, the listener is able to understand speech with little difficulty.Generally, the degree of hearing loss in cases of decreased sensitivity is not extreme.Conductive hearing loss, which involves disorders of the outer and/or middle ear, most often results in reduced sensitivity, with acuity remaining good.Hearing aids work quite well for patients with conductive hearing losses.Often, conductive hearing losses are medically or surgically correctable.Auditory disorders also can occur in either sensory or neural portions of the auditory system.Disorders in these areas typically result in loss of acuity as well as loss of sensitivity.Sensory receptors of the cochlea may be damaged or destroyed.when damage to the nerve or loss of sensory cells becomes too great, portions of the signal may be lost completely.Consequently, no matter how loud the sound is made through a hearing aid, the listener is unable to understand the words.This situation is analogous to a radio station that is not tuned properly.No matter how loud the volume, clarity is not improved; indeed, increasing the volume may decrease some patients ability to understand.Losses in both sensitivity and acuity may range from mild to total.Some people with less severe sensorineural hearing loss are able to derive adequate benefit from hearing aids.For both adults and children whose sensorineural damage is too great, however, coping with deafness and learning to communicate visually were for many years the only options.",

      "title": "REM sleep and emotion regulation",
      "abstract": "Despite substantial research focusing on the interaction between sleep and cognition, especially memory, the impact of sleep and sleep loss on affective and emotional regulation has comparatively attracted much less attention. This might be surprising considering that nearly all psychiatric and neurological disorders with impaired mood express co-occurring abnormalities of sleep, and that many sleep disorders are accompanied by mood disturbances, thus suggesting an intimate relationship between sleep and emotion. Yet, recent studies evaluating subjective as well as objective measures of mood and affect, combined with insights from clinical observations and neuroimaging research, offer new evidence for the emerging role of sleep in regulating emotional brain function. In this chapter, we review clinical and neuroimaging data that support the existence of such complex interactions between sleep and emotion regulation. We report that (1) sleep disorders are frequently associated with affective symptoms; (2) patients with mood disorders often present with sleep disturbances; (3) sleep deprivation may transitorily alleviate depressive symptoms; (4) dream experiences may be highly emotional; (5) brain regions involved in emotion processing and regulation, such as the limbic (e.g., amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex) and ventromedial prefrontal regions, are strongly activated during REM sleep; (6) subjective mood assessments exhibit a circadian modulation. New data also show that some hypothalamic neuropeptides (hypocretin/orexin) play a dual role in the stabilization of sleep–wake states and on mesolimbic dopamine activity, with significant effects on neural plasticity related to emotional learning, reward processing, and addiction. Together, these seemingly disparate observations converge to indicate a physiological interplay between sleep–wake and emotional brain functions serving the modulation, the preparation, and the optimization of waking behavior.",

The neurological findings indicate that non-meaningful recurring utterances/automatisms, palilalia, tics and, possibly, acquired stuttering are symptoms of basal ganglia dysfunction. Echolalia seems to be related to dysfunction of the frontal lobe system. Production of verbal stereotypies and emotionally charged real word recurring utterances is viewed to indicate the activity of right hemisphere language mechanisms. The neurolinguistic data suggest that echolalia is generated quite high in the linguistic processes of formulation, non-meaningful recurring utterances close to the bottom of the formulation apparatus and palilalia downstream. Verbal perseveration remains an elusive symptom, both neurologically and neurolinguistically.",

La AS resulta en un deterioro psicosocial, financiero y familiar, ademas de medico como las lesiones en organos sexuales y contagio de infecciones de transmision sexual. La evidencia neurocientifica describe similitudes entre sexo adictos y adictos a substancias. Demostrando deterioro anatomicofuncional y neuropsicologico en las vias cerebrales implicadas en los procesos de recompensa, motivacion, afecto, inhibicion y cognicion. Este padecimiento no siempre es visto como una enfermedad por lo que los individuos que lo padecen no reciben siempre el tratamiento adecuado, de ahi la importancia para divulgar informacion en comunidades dedicadas a la atencion de la salud. EnglishSexual addiction (SA) formally called compulsive sexual behavior or hypersexuality disorder, is a condition in which exacerbated and inappropriate sexual behaviors and cognitions occur that generate discomfort and impairment in the function of one or more domains of life; with failure to control such behavior. SA results in psychosocial, financial and family deterioration, in addition to medical impairment such as injuries to sexual organs and the spread of sexually transmitted infections. Neuroscientific evidence describes similarities between sex addicts and substance addicts. Demonstrating anatomical-functional and neuropsychological deterioration in the brain pathways involved in the processes of reward, motivation, affect, inhibition and cognition. This condition is not always seen as a disease, so individuals who suffer from it do not always receive adequate treatment, hence the importance of disseminating information in communities dedicated to health care.",

Ces difficultés concernent, en premier lieu, la gestion des imprévus (mise à jour), l'interruption des tâches routinières (inhibition), la capacité de passer d'une chose à une autre (flexibilité) et la situation à gérer des doubles tâches. Cela correspond à la modification conjuguée des fonctions exécutives, de la mémoire de travail et de l'attention. À celle-ci s'ajoute un abaissement de la vitesse de traitement. Son exploration pourrait permettre de repérer les sujets mal adaptés et susceptibles de présenter un déclin cognitif. De plus, des phénomènes autres que le vieillissement cognitif, tels que des facteurs psychologiques, sensoriels ou généraux, peuvent intervenir de façon concomitante à celui-ci et avoir des effets confondants. Enfin, lors du vieillissement réussi, on assiste à des compensations cognitives (et à un recrutement bilatéral des réseaux neuronaux hémisphériques) visant à maintenir un bon niveau de performances (ressources cognitives), en lien avec le niveau exécutif.",

      "title": "Stuttering: an overview.",
      "abstract": "Speech dysfluency (stuttering) is common in children. Although stuttering often resolves before adulthood, it can cause significant anxiety for children and their families. Stuttering speech patterns are often easily identifiable; when a child is learning to talk, repetition of sounds or words, prolonged pauses, or excessively long sounds in words usually occur. Secondary behaviors (e.g., eye blinking, jaw jerking, involuntary head or other movements) that accompany stuttering can further embarrass the child, leading to a fear of speaking. The etiology of stuttering is controversial, but contributing factors may include cognitive abilities, genetics, sex of the child, and environmental influences. Research has shown that more than 80 percent of stuttering cases are classified as developmental problems, although stuttering can also be classified as a neurologic or, less commonly, psychogenic problem. The initial assessment of patients who stutter addresses the severity of dysfluency; secondary behaviors; and the impact of stuttering, such as patient distress. Further testing is useful in assessing the need for therapy. Pharmacologic therapy has not been shown to improve stuttering. Encouraging patients to talk slowly and the use of fluency-shaping mechanisms such as delayed auditory feedback devices to slow the speech rate can help minimize or eliminate stuttering. For patients with persistent stuttering, controlled fluency or stuttering modification therapy may be effective.",

      "title": "Cognitive deficit in schizophrenia: an overview.",
      "abstract": "Depressive mood, anxiety, delusions, hallucinations and behavioral disturbances have been traditionally recognized as leading symptoms of mental disorders. However, cognitive symptoms went under-recognized or declined. Today there is robust evidence that cognitive dysfunction is present in the majority of mental disorders and is also related to impairments in the functioning of the persons with mental illness. It is proposed that aberrant brain neuronal network connectivity, arising from interplay of genetic, epigenetic, developmental and environmental factors, is responsible for cognitive decline. In schizophrenia, dysfunctions in working memory, attention, processing speed, visual and verbal learning with substantial deficit in reasoning, planning, abstract thinking and problem solving have been extensively documented. Social cognition - the ability to correctly process information and use it to generate appropriate response in situations, is also impaired. The correlation of cognitive impairment with functional outcome and employment, independent living and social functioning has emphasized the need for development of the treatments specific to cognition. It is considered that brain neuroplasticity allows for re-modulating and compensating the impairment process which could give opportunity to improve cognitive functions. Therefore, there is a need for comprehensive clinical assessment and follow-up of cognitive decline in mental illness. Implementation of specific treatment strategies addressing cognitive decline in mental illness, like new drugs, distinct cognitive-behavioural therapy, psychoeducation, social skills training and remediation strategies should be strongly indorsed targeting recovery and reduction of disability due to mental illness.",

B. ausdünnendes Haar, Falten, Größe oder Form der Nase), was zu signifikanten Beeinträchtigungen in sozialen oder beruflichen Lebensbereichen führt. Besteht eine leichte körperliche Anomalie, ist die Beschäftigung mit dem Defekt deutlich übertrieben und für andere Personen nicht nachvollziehbar. Assoziierte Merkmale der KDS sind unter anderem eine starke Angst vor negativer Bewertung aufgrund der äußeren Erscheinung sowie Vorstellungen, dass andere Personen negativ über den wahrgenommen Defekt sprechen. Ritualisierte Verhaltensweisen wie das Überprüfen des Aussehens in Spiegeln oder das Vergleichen mit anderen sind ebenso häufig vorzufinden. Studien zur Prävalenz in der Allgemeinbevölkerungen ergeben Schätzwerte von ca. 2 % mit einem ausgewogenen Geschlechterverhältnis. Für die Erklärung der KDS wurden bisher eine Reihe kognitiv-behavioraler Modelle entwickelt, die davon ausgehen, dass sowohl psychologische, biologische, soziokulturelle sowie Konditionierungsprozesse eine Rolle bei der Entstehung und Aufrechterhaltung der KDS spielen. In der Behandlung haben sich vor allem kognitiv-behaviorale Psychotherapieansätze und Psychopharmaka wie selektive Serotonin-Wiederaufnahmehemmer bewährt.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Stuttering is a speech disorder characterized by involuntary repetition, prolongation or cessation of a sound. This dysfluency may be developmental or acquired. Acquired dysfluency can be classified as neurogenic or psychogenic. Objectives This case report aims to describe and discuss a case of psychogenic stuttering, providing an updated review on this disorder. Methods In and outpatient interviews were performed by Neurology and Psychiatry. Investigation to exclude organic causes included lab exams, electrocardiogram, electroencephalography, computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging. A literature review in Science Direct database, with the keywords “psychogenic stuttering”, was also conducted. Results A 63-year-old man was admitted to the Beatriz Ângelo Hospital with an acute stuttering. Speech was characterized by the repetition of initial or stressed syllables, little affected by reading out loud or singing. Comprehension, syntaxes and semantic were not compromised, as weren’t sensory and motor abilities. During admission, stuttering characteristics changed. Multiple somatic complaints and stress prior to the onset and bizarre secondary behaviors were also detected. Work-up didn’t show an organic etiology for that sudden change. An iatrogenic etiology was considered, as sertraline and topiramate were started for depression 1 month before. However, the stuttering pattern, the negative results, the psychological and the social life events suggested a psychogenic etiology. Conclusions Psychogenic stuttering finds its origin in psychological or emotional problems. It is best classified as a conversion reaction. The differential diagnosis between psychogenic and neurological stuttering can be challenging. Disclosure of interest The authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.",

      "title": "Prevalence and characterization of the insomnia syndrome in an outpatient oncology clinic",
      "abstract": "18612 Background: Insomnia is an often overlooked symptom. One potential reason for this neglect is that insomnia is viewed as a normal and temporary reaction to the cancer diagnosis or treatment. Patients themselves may fail to report their sleep difficulties to their physicians for similar reasons. Previous work in understanding insomnia has been limited by the lack of an operational definition of the insomnia syndrome, small sample size and varied instruments for symptom detection. Hence, the proportion of cancer patients meeting diagnostic criteria for the insomnia syndrome is not well known. Recently the diagnosis of the insomnia syndrome has been redefined using a combination of criteria derived from the International Classification of Sleep Disorders and the DSM-IV. The criteria includes)difficulty in initiating and/or maintaining sleep, whereby sleep-onset latency and/or wake after sleep onset is greater than 30 minutes; sleep efficiency (ratio of total sleep time to total time spent in bed) lower than 85%; difficulties occurring at least 3 nights per week; difficulties occurring for at least 6 months; and difficulties causing marked distress or significant impairment in daytime functioning (eg, fatigue, disturbed mood, performance deficits). Methods: 100 consecutive oncology patients were surveyed using the above criteria for the insomnia syndrome. Symptom assessment was also included. Results: The incidence of the insomnia syndrome seems to correspond to previously reported incidences.Patient have more problems staying asleep than going to sleep. Patients may have dramatic inversions of their sleep/wake cycle yet feel that they do not have insomnia. Pain is the most commonly associated symptom associated with insomnia. Conclusions: There is a great need for better tools to asssess the symptom of insomnia. Focusing on specific characteristics of insomnia and distinguishing the insomnia syndrome versus the symptom of insomnia is an effective way establish if there is a need for specific therapy. The addition of symptom assessment further improves the characterisation insomnia. Characteristics of insomnia experienced by the patient may help direct specific treatment modalities. Pain is a frequently associated symptom with insomnia. No significant financial relationships to disclose.",

      "abstract": "Brain damage is underestimated as a public health and personal problem. The common belief in a good prognosis for childhood brain damage is unsubstantiated. It is based on lack of rigorous study and examiner satisfaction with a low response level. Occult brain trauma plagues victims into maturity. Above a rather low threshold of injury (even without focal neurologic findings), cognitive, personality, and adaptive dysfunctions are common and impairing. Child abuse signals were described. Brain lesions impair both matured functions and those expressed later. Dysfunctions were discussed for these neurobehavioral systems: consciousness, attention and tonic motor level; sensorimotor and body schema; neurophysiologic; cerebral personality; intelligence; memory; language; information processing; posttraumatic stress and mood; identity and insight; adaptivity in the community. Outcome evolves from complex pathologic, neurologic, anatomic, and personality parameters, the postinjury interval and child's age, the maturity and developmental trajectory of the function, social support, and emotional reaction to impairment. Assessment should study the entire range of functions, utilizing records, collaterals, observation, and qualitative and psychometric measurement. Complex, challenging, and ecologically relevant tasks are appropriate. There are several patterns of outcome: immediate permanent deficits; improvement through compensatory mechanisms, but with subclinical deficits; and initial progress with delayed expression (premature plateau of cognitive and personality maturity; physiologic developmental deficits). Confirmation of mild TBI may require several years of observation to determine late dysfunctions and deviation from preinjury or postinjury performance or expected level of development.",

Neurodevelopmental disorder can be explained in children with autism spectrum disorder down, intellectual disability, learning disability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), cerebral palsy. Children with ncan be affected in many dimensions developmentally, experientially and environmentally. It is known that children show special conditions in various subjects from their peers due to their physical, mental, social development and brain activities being affected. It is revealed that these special conditions affect peer relations in children's social lives, cognitive issues such as problem solving, analytical thinking, language development issues such as understanding and expression, as well as the child's balance and physical activity. By processing the information coming from visual, vestibular and proprioceptive systems together, the symptoms and characteristics of physical activities in body movements with the energy available by using the muscles in the balance and skeletal system are determined to a great extent. The characteristics of children with neurodevelopmental disorders, their assessment, the balance context and the level of physical activity are described.",

      "title": "The Forgotten Child.",
      "abstract": "About 10% to 20% of children and adolescents suffer from some kind of mental health disorder. Many adult psychiatric disorders have their origin in childhood and adolescence. (1) Inadequate or delayed treatment is associated not only with personal suffering, compromised normal emotional and social development, and impairment in multiple domains including education, occupation, interpersonal relationships and self-esteem, but also family and carer stress. Yu et al (2) draw our attention to the mental health of mothers whose preschool children are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Provision of a child mental health service in Hong Kong is shared by the Hospital Authority, Department of Health, the educational system, Social Welfare Department, non-governmental organisations, and private sectors. The worldwide trend of rising service demand, increasing public expectations and resource limitations is also noted in Hong Kong. Only some of those in need receive proper mental health treatment and care. (3,4) The underlying reasons vary in different settings. Examples include underdiagnosis, misdiagnosis, inaccessibility of service, poorly coordinated and fragmented services, lack of expertise, lack of public (or professional) awareness, and other obstacles to service seeking, such as stigmatisation towards mental problems and mental health care. (5) Different strategies have been proposed and initiatives implemented in an attempt to tackle these challenges. Fung et al (6) describe and discuss the results of a knowledge contact--based anti-stigma campaign in a Chinese society. While mental health problems in some patients are more eye-catching, such as the patient described by Che (7) who readily caught the attention of mental health professionals, others may present with more subtle symptoms. There is always an important but forgotten group of children and adolescents who are in need of more attention and proper mental health assessment and/or intervention but sadly have little access to the existing system. Some are 'at risk' of future development of psychopathology and are simply not being recognised or ignored. Some are hesitant or reluctant to seek help because they fear being stigmatised. Some fail to reach the service 'threshold' for referral. Others simply fall through the cracks because they fulfil nobody's criteria for help. If we agree that we should identify this group of children who are being 'forgotten', where should we invest our effort? It is well documented that mental disorders run in families. Genetic factors play a significant aetiological role in many mental health problems. (8) Siblings of an affected child are at increased risk of psychopathology due to a complex interplay of gene-environmental factors. (9) Chan and Lai (10) explore the psychological adjustment of siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder in Hong Kong. Children of parents who had psychopathologies are another vulnerable group. (11) Peers of suicide completers and attempters are at risk of psychiatric disturbance and suicidal behaviour. (12) Those who have been referred to the mental health service, but subsequently disappear from the system may be a group who deserve extra attention. There is always a group who (the affected child and/or parents) are inadequately motivated to seek intervention or help, and this could be due to multiple different reasons. How much additional effort, given the limited resources (e.g. long waiting list for initial child psychiatric outpatient assessment and long waiting list for psychosocial intervention), are we willing to make to reach out to and engage this group? The dilemma is more obvious for non-priority cases who previously received 'conventional intervention' (e.g. no imminent risk of aggression, suicide, or child abuse). CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service) traditionally offers service for those at the severe end of the spectrum, through referral from primary and secondary mental health workers. …",

      "abstract": "Subtle alterations in brain development caused by genes or early environmental hazards, such as obstetric complications, play a role in projecting some individuals on a trajectory toward schizophrenia. High-risk and cohort studies demonstrate that children destined to develop schizophrenia tend to have delayed milestones and subtle neuromotor and cognitive impairments (particularly in coordination and language). These neurocognitive problems lead to difficulties in interpersonal relations, and their progressive alienation makes these at-risk children more likely to harbor odd or paranoid ideas. This cascade of increasingly deviant development may then be compounded by brain maturational changes during adolescence with a resultant lability of the dopaminergic response to stress. As a result, the individual is more susceptible to the effects of the abuse of dopamine-releasing drugs, and to other risk factors such as migration or stressful life events; social isolation may be a common pathway underlying several of the social risk factors.",

      "abstract": "The general aim of a clinical neuropsychological examination is to assess language, memory, attention, adaptive behavior, motivation, and emotion impairments that result from a brain dysfunction. This behavioral and cognitive evaluation can be performed during the first hours following cerebral damage either in a classical bedside approach or by means of standardized tests and may thus help establish a precise diagnostic. In the hyperacute or acute phase of stroke, neuropsychological intervention may also be necessary to establish communication with the patient (e.g. in the case of aphasia) or to set up adequate strategies to be used by healthcare providers (e.g. in the case of spatial neglect). In this context, the patient is most often tested while lying in bed and in the presence of other patients in the same room. Due to this context, as well as other disturbing factors, the evaluation of cognitive–behavioral deficits in the stroke unit is generally difficult, of relatively short duration, and must thus be repeated in order to correctly track the clinical evolution and to advise when the symptoms become more stable. Moreover, effective rehabilitation of cognitive deficits often relies on modular neuropsychological models (e.g. Pilgrim and Humphreys, 1994), which are often incompatible with clinical fluctuations and global dysfunction such as confusional states, frequently found in the acute phase. So, actual neuropsychological rehabilitation does not rely on acute evaluation.",

      "title": "ANÁLISIS DEL LLANTO EN NIÑOS HIPOACÚSICOS Y NORMOYENTES DE 0 A 2 AÑOS DE EDAD",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Infant crying is a complex phenomenon that implies several functions: breathing, action of laryngeal and supra-laryngeal muscles under the control of the neurovegetative systems of the brainstem, and the limbic system, and the association of cortical areas and the cerebellum. Although it is a communication system different to babbling and language, it is related with the future development of phonation. Cry analysis provides information about the neurophysiologic and psychological states of newborns and the identification of perinatal abnormalities. It is necessary to discuss the subject extensively because there are new data on situations such as laringomalacia, congenital hypothyroidism, deafness and sleep apnea that seem to be associated to infantile crying behaviors. Infant cries can be analyzed as behavioral conditions (hunger, anger and pain cries) allows knowing of mother-child relationship or the effect under diverse cultural conditions, such as stress, emotional deprivation or illness. A spectrographic analysis of the cries may identify several characteristics: threshold, latency, duration of phonation, maximum and minimum of the fundamental frequency (F0), occurrence and maximum pitch of shift, gliding, melody, biphonation, bifurcation, noise concentration, quality of the voice, double harmonic break, glottal plosives, vibratos, melody types, F0 stability and inspiratory stridor. To date, it has not been possible to establish alteration patterns. The best studied variables are F0, its harmonics and the duration of each emission; it is accepted that F0 varies between 400 and 600 Hz, during 1.4 ± 0.6 s. Under such approaches, diverse alterations and risk factors have been studied: congenital alterations, malnutrition, sudden death, maternal exposition to drugs, prematurely born babies or perinatal asphyxia and disturbances of the central nervous system. Authors have reported F0 equal or less than 300 Hz in cases of sudden death or with high frequencies, near the 1000 Hz in the Cri du chat syndrome, perinatal asphyxia and other cases who died suddenly. During the cry, there is an increase of intra-abdominal pressure, heart rate and blood pressure, reduction of oxygen saturation, increase of the intra cranial-pressure, beginning of stress reactions, depletion of the energy anf oxygen reserves, such as the found in the Valsalva’s maneuver. Every event of prolonged cries implies alteration of the breathing control like a Hering-Breuer reflex. Considering that some authors have proposed early vocalizations are a good predictor of deafness, in a previous paper we reported the characteristics of the cry of 20 deaf neonates. However, we were not able to demonstrate differences when comparing them with normal hearing neonates and infants, using only parametric methods. Still, we decided to go further and investigate the quality of infant cries of deaf neonates and infants. Material and methods. Twenty zero-to two-year old cases were studied; they were deaf children of both sexes; all cases were included in a follow-up program on the Human Communication Department of the National Institute of Perinatology of Mexico and were compared with 20 normal hearing children. We recorded Brain Stem Evoked Auditory Responses (BEAR) and cry recording using a digital Sony recorder during the physical exploration. We analyzed the frequency (Hz) and duration of the espiratory cries, the duration of inspiration between two cry emissions and the characteristics of the spectrogram. Quantitative analysis. The usual estimates of means and standard variation were obtained and they were compared with one way analysis of variance. We organized typologies of frequency by means of cluster techniques (Ward method). The distribution of the duration of the periods of crying and silence was explored with a contingency tables. Qualitative analysis. Two standardized observers visually analyzed all the cries to determine any variation of F0 and of harmonic frequencies. Whenever a variation of F0 was observed, we obtained maximum and minimum frequencies, as well as average duration of each cry emission. The procedure was validated by means of the graphic comparison with a Fourier’s analysis. Results. Mean duration of cries in the deaf group was 0.5845 ± 0.6150 s (range 0.08-5.2 s), while in the group of normal hearing cases was 0.5387 ± 0.2631 (range 0.06-1.75 s). From the deaf group, five cases had very prolonged duration of cries, without statistical significance. The mean duration of the inspiration was 0.3962 ± 0.2326, with a range of 0.06 to 1.75 in the deaf group and of 0.4083 ± 0.1854, with a range of 0.21 at 0.96, in the controls, without difference among groups. There was no correlation between the time of espiratory cry and that of the inspira",

      "abstract": "The overarching concept of cerebral palsy involves several different definitions; it is as group of unprogressive and often changing motor disturbance syndromes caused by brain injury or developmental disorder in early stages of development as a result of premature or severe birth, neonatal complications such as infection or hypoxia, and brain trauma. Cerebral palsy affects two to three children per 1,000 live-born. Typological characteristics of the clinical image of cerebral palsy are the modified muscle tone characterized by muscular tension, altered body posture and disturbed motion. Cerebral palsy is a disorder of the central nervous system, so it affects the whole development and functioning of the physical psychomotor development of a child. It is accompanied by developmental disorders, sensomotor disorders, perceptual cognitive developmental disorders, socioemocional disorders and difficulties in functioning of everyday life, auditory - visual and other perceptual disorders, intellectual deficit, etc., and may be accompanied by epilepsy. Cerebral palsy, although a permanetn diagnosys, depending on the degree of damage, can be treated using different treatment methods and therapies such as kinesitherapy can which can significantly influence the overall functioning of the affected person. The key precondition is early detection and propercorrective and therapeutic or curative action. Kinesitheraphy as a motion treatment method can have a significant effect on treating a person, raising the body's psychomotor status and the quality of everyday life. Methods used, based on clinical kinesiology, and appropriate exercise and modification, kinesitherapy has positive effects in treating the condition of people with cerebral palsy",

Repeated seizure activity is associated with cognitive regression, behavioral disturbance, social disability, and sleep disorders—conditions that may be difficult to recognize in children with epilepsy and other developmental disorders (eg, mental retardation, cerebral palsy, autism) and that coexist in a high proportion of cases. Prompt recognition and treatment of these coexisting disorders is critical to achieving the best seizure control and overall quality of life for patients and their families. The potential for treatment-related disorders must also be carefully considered in this population. Clinicians should be aware of the range of adverse effects of AEDs (eg, behavioral, gastrointestinal, hematologic, neurologic, and renal) and be prepared to reevaluate treatment options as necessary.

      "abstract": "Background: Intellectual Disability “ID” is a genetic disorder, which lead to arrested or incomplete development of the brain. It is the limitation of cognitive skills impairment and decline ability of a person in learning process. ID is the most common health problem in worldwide. These patients have decline intellectual functions and at least limitation in their two or more adoptive skills such as reading, writing abilities, social interactions, Behavioral habits, self-care, communication ability etc. The time period for the diagnosis of ID is the onset of disease before the eighteen years of age. Spastic Paraplegia and short stature is a general terminology using for a group of an uncommon inherited diseases that cause stiffness and weakness in the lower limbs muscles. Gradually its symptoms get worse with the passing of time. It's also called as familial spastic paraparesis or Strümpell-Lorrain syndrome. SP is classified clinically as “complicated\" (syndromic) or \"uncomplicated\" (nonsyndromic) Spastic Paraplegia. Methods: This study was started in March 2014 to Aug 2015. The criteria for the selection of families were consanguineous families with two or more than two ID patients. The patients were examined, interviewed one by one in friendly atmosphere. Then the blood samples were taken by aseptic method. Blood samples were processed in laboratory. DNA extraction and PCR was done. After that Exome sequencing was used to find the pathogenic variants. The data was analyzed by CATCH. Sanger Sequencing was applied to see the segregation. Results: In ID-family1 the variant of AP4B1 was segregated with the disease phenotype. These ID patients have short stature and Spastic Paraplegia. Mutation in AP4B1 is known to cause intellectual disability. In ID-family2 the variants of WDR62, EML2 and KCNK6 were co-segregated with disease phenotype. But only mutations in WDR62 are known to cause intellectual disability. ID family2 also identified as short stature. In ID-family3 Exome sequencing data reveal no putative variants. Conclusion: The present study was conducted in three consanguineous families for the determination of the responsible genes for intellectual disability. Exome sequencing revealed putative mutations in AP4B1 and WDR62 in two out of three families. In third family we could not locate any putative mutation.

      "abstract": "Disordered sleep affects daytime health and behavioral functioning in a variety of neurologic and psychiatric conditions. Sleep disorders lead to a multitude of secondary behavioral effects that affect both the individual and the family (1). Daytime sleepiness resulting from disrupted sleep often manifests itself in typically developing children as hyperactivity, inattention, and aggression (2). Those with autism, a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by difficulties in language and social communication with restricted and repetitive behaviors, may be at even higher risk for sleep disorders given the overlap of autism with sleep. In turn, behaviors inherent to autism, such as impairments in communication and stereotypies, may be exacerbated by sleepiness and interfere with the child's ability to function optimally, thereby affecting quality of life in autism. Aggression and hyperactivity, two problematic behaviors frequently associated with autism, may be further exacerbated by lack of sleep in the child with autism. This chapter will review our current understanding of the neurobiology of autism, especially in reference to sleep-related aspects of this disorder. Sleep disorders in autism, including prevalence, etiology, evaluation, and treatment, will then be characterized. The impact of sleep disorders on daytime behavior and on quality of life in individuals affected with autism and their families will then be discussed. Our chapter will conclude with future research directions for advancing our knowledge in this field.",

      "title": "Autism Spectrum Disorder and Epilepsy: Pathogenetic Mechanisms and Therapeutic Implications",
      "abstract": "The co-occurrence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and epilepsy is a complex neurological condition that presents significant challenges for both patients and clinicians. ASD is a group of complex developmental disorders characterized by the following: (1) Social communication difficulties: challenges in understanding and responding to social cues, initiating and maintaining conversations, and developing and maintaining relationships. (2) Repetitive behaviors: engaging in repetitive actions, such as hand-flapping, rocking, or lining up objects. (3) Restricted interests: focusing intensely on specific topics or activities, often to the exclusion of other interests. (4) Sensory sensitivities: over- or under-sensitivity to sensory input, such as sounds, touch, tastes, smells, or sights. These challenges can significantly impact individuals' daily lives and require specialized support and interventions. Early diagnosis and intervention can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with ASD and their families. Epilepsy is a chronic brain disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked (≥2) seizures that occur >24 h apart. Single seizures are not considered epileptic seizures. Epilepsy is often idiopathic, but various brain disorders, such as malformations, strokes, and tumors, can cause symptomatic epilepsy. While these two conditions were once considered distinct, growing evidence suggests a substantial overlap in their underlying neurobiology. The prevalence of epilepsy in individuals with ASD is significantly higher than in the general population. This review will explore the epidemiology of this comorbidity, delve into the potential mechanisms linking ASD and epilepsy, and discuss the implications for diagnosis, treatment, and management.",

      "abstract": "Late preterm infants (LPI) represent a growing population with own peculiar vulnerabilities; only recently attention has been focused on the impact of late preterm birth on child health, in order to define short and long-term outcomes [1,2]. LPI are physiologically and metabolically immature; they are at higher risk than term infants of developing medical complications, resulting in greater rate of mortality and morbidity not only in the neonatal period, but also during infancy, childhood, adolescence, and through adulthood [2,3]. Increasing evidence shows the association between late-preterm birth and various long-term medical and behavioral morbidities, including cerebral palsy, attention problems and antisocial behavior, as well as lower IQ, impaired cognitive and academic performance at school age. Fetal brain undergoes a dramatic growth and maturation during last four weeks of gestation, and this is probably the most important reason of LPI worse neurodevelopmental outcomes compared to full-term infants [3-5]. Physical development is an other important outcome for LPI; in addition to intrauterine growth restriction, LPI may be susceptible to feeding difficulty resulting in poor weight gain and underweight. Since failure to thrive in early infancy may be also associated with adverse cognitive and developmental outcomes, close monitoring of LPI growth pattern is needed [6]. Moreover, late-preterm birth has a negative effect also on maturation of the lungs, interrupting evolution from alveolar saccules to mature alveoli. LPI have been shown to develop early respiratory morbidities more frequently than infants born at term. However, the risk for long-term respiratory problems, such as asthma, has not yet been established in this group of patients [3,7]. Therefore LPI need a multidisciplinary, personalized and effective follow–up care that begins at birth and continues, with varying degrees of surveillance and reflecting individual needs, throughout the lifespan. Pediatricians must play a crucial role by ensuring that appropriate screening and assessments are completed, referrals are made and continuity of care is coordinated. They have to be aware of the major problems that LPI may encounter, providing anticipatory guidance when needed. Pediatricians together with parents, child development specialists, and education professionals need to know the possible school underachievement and behavioral problems so that prompt referrals to early intervention services are made [8,9]. Up to now, standardized short and long term followup schedule for LPI has not been developed yet; therefore, further research should focus on systematic evaluation of outcomes of LPI, in order to optimize follow-up monitoring of this population of children.",

      "abstract": "Saher (Insomnia) or sleeplessness is a sleep disorder in which there is an inability to fall asleep or to stay asleep or both, as long as desire. According to current researches, it has been noted that many people all over the world are suffering from one or more symptoms of insomnia. Depending on duration of problem, it may be classified as transient insomnia, short term insomnia and chronic insomnia. Insomnia is described as saher in ancient classical Unani literature. The causes of insomnia are stress, depression, anxiety, medical conditions, drugs, irregular schedule, caffeine, etc. According to Unani system of medicine, health is attributed to the equilibrium of Akhlat (Humors), beside this, there is Asbab sitta zarooriya (Six essential factors) there are air, food and drinks, bodily movement and repose (Harkat sukoon badni), mental activity and repose, (Harkat wa sukoon nafsani), sleep and wakefulness (Naumwayaqza) and retention and excretion (Ahtabas wa Istefrag); any imbalance any of the above factors is likely to cause the disease. Normal sleep is thought to be because of rutubat wa broodat i.e., wetness and cold in our body, and if there is derailment of balance in sleep and wakefulness, it implies the predominance of yaboosat wa hararat i.e. dryness and hotness extensive in the brain. Dalak (Massage) is a systematic manipulation of body tissues with the hand. Several varieties of dalak have been recommended in Unani system of medicine, e.g., Dalak e sulb (hard) Dalak e layyan (soft), etc. Keywords: Dalak, sahar, insomnia, regimental therapy Cite this Article Moteseem Ahemad, Patel Mohd.

      "abstract": "Abstract Anomic aphasia is a very disabling disorder that results from acquired brain dysfunction (typically stroke, traumatic brain injury, or temporal lobe resection). Patients with anomic aphasia manifest an isolated deficit in their ability to name things like concrete entities (named by nouns), actions (named by verbs), or spatial relationships (named by prepositions). Defective naming, also known as anomia, is a frequent part of the symptom complex that characterizes patients with aphasia (Goodglass &amp; Wingfield, 1997; Tranel &amp; Anderson, 1999), where aphasia refers to disturbances of the comprehension and formulation of verbal messages caused by acquired damage to language‐related brain structures (typically in the left hemisphere).",

A general definition of dyspraxia is a disturbance in the programming and execution of learned volitional, purposeful movements in the presence of normal primary motor and sensory function and in the absence of any visual-perceptual, dysphasic, attentional, motivational or intellectual dysfunction. As well as diagnosis by exclusion, characteristic error patterns (see Miller 1986 for non-speech dyspraxias; Square-Storer 1989, for speech) help identify dyspraxia by inclusion. Although the label apraxia of speech is retained here in keeping with general usage the term dyspraxia is preferred as being more accurate, since most patients retain some action capability, which is partially disordered, rather than have total loss of capability.",

This chapter reviews the classic symptoms of speech and voice disorders in PD and their assessment. The complex origin of these disorders is described in relation to motor problems (hypokinesia/bradykinesia reflecting reduced muscle activation and abnormal scaling or maintenance of the gain of movement amplitude), sensory processing problems (abnormal gating of the somatosensory cortex, abnormal gating of the auditory cortex via feed-forward mechanisms, and abnormal perception of one's own voice), cueing problems (reflecting deficits in internal/implicit cueing), and neuropsychological problems (impaired attention to action, vocal vigilance, and self-regulation of vocal output). The impact of medical treatment (neuropharmacological, neurosurgical) on speech and voice is reviewed. Speech treatment is described with special emphasis on LSVT® LOUD, a scientifically tested, efficacious treatment consistent with principles that drive activity-dependent neural plasticity. The recommendation is made for early referral to a speech clinician for optimum management of speech and voice disorders in PD.",

This is a result of their poor social skills and the inappropriate stimuli they receive (e.g., bullying by classmates, severe rebuke from parents or teachers), which are based on an improper understanding of their condition and its features. Their stressful environments may result in secondary disabilities such as depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders (e.g., adjustment disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, reactive attachment disorder, or disinhibited social engagement disorder). In individuals with mild features of developmental disorders, these symptoms are often overlooked in childhood, and are pointed out to them only in adulthood, when secondary disabilities are already fixed. To enable early detection and to support individuals with developmental disorders, efforts should be made to impart a proper understanding of these disabilities to the general population.",

      "abstract": "Various forms of confabulation, including denial of illness (e.g., paralysis, blindness), and conditions that often give rise to these disorders, such as cerebral disconnection, disinhibitory states, incomplete information reception, and \"gap filling\" are discussed. On the basis of clinical observation and a review of a number of studies, it appears that confabulatory states frequently are associated with cerebral damage that involves the right hemisphere, notably, the frontal (often bilaterally) and parietal lobes — areas intimately involved in arousal, attention, information regulation, and integration. With certain forms of injury, initially there appear disturbances in the organization, integration, and assimilation of ideas and associations, such that large gaps appear in the information transmitted to and received by the language axis of the left hemisphere. It is argued that in these instances, the language areas act so as to fill these \"gaps\" with information that, although inappropriate, is linked in some manner to the fragments received. In contrast, frontal lobe damage sometimes results in gross disinhibition and cortical overresponsiveness and, thus, speech release due to the flooding of the language axis (and other cortical regions) with tangential, fantastical, and grandiose associations. Other forms of confabulation also are reviewed briefly.",

      "title": "Acquired Aphasia, Dementia, and Behavior Disorder with Epilepsy and Continuous Spike and Waves During Sleep in a Child",
      "abstract": "Summary: Severe persistent neuropsychological disorders sometimes develop in the course of a focal epilepsy of unknown origin in previously normal children. Very frequent bilateral focal or generalized discharges are often noted on the sleep EEG records of these patients with no evidence of clinical seizures. The relation between these paroxysms and the observed deterioration remains unclear. We report a child with a partial complex epilepsy and severe disturbances of language, cognition, and behavior acquired in the early years of development who was followed for 15 years. A correlation between the evolution of the striking EEG abnormalities during sleep and the neuropsychological disorders could be established retrospectively. The observed sequence of onset and recovery of the aphasia, the dementia, and the “psychotic” behavior makes a direct causal relation between these deficits quite unlikely. Rather it suggests an association of independent symptoms with a specific language disorder becoming manifest in the course of the evolution. This child shows many of the main characteristics of the syndromes of “acquired aphasia with convulsive disorder” (Landau‐Kleffner syndrome) and “epilepsy with continuous spike and waves during sleep.” Both syndromes describe probably different facets of a similar underlying, still unexplained cerebral dysfunction. RÉSUMÉ Des troubles neuropsychologiques séverès et persistants peuvent survenir au cours ďune épilepsie focale ďétiologie inconnue chez des enfants auparavant normaux. Chez ces patients, on trouve souvent de très nombreuses décharges focales bilatéiales ou généralisées àľEEG de sommeil, sans crise clinique. La relation entre ces paroxysmes et la détérioration observée reste peu claire. Nous rapportons en détail le cas ďun enfant présentant une épilepsie partielle complexe et des troubles séverès du langage, des fonctions cognitives et du comportement acquis précocément au cours du développement, que nous avons suivi durant 15 ans. Une correlation entre ľévolution des anomalies EEG bilatérales durant le sommeil et des déficits neuropsychologiques a pûêtre établie rétrospectivement. Le mode de survenue et de récupération de ľaphasie, de la démence et du comportement “psychotique” rendent peu probable une relation causale entre ces déficits. II suggère plutôt une association de symptômes indepéndants avec un trouble spécifique du langage devenu prédominant au cours de ľévolution. Cet enfant présente la plupart des caractéristiques principales des syndromes ď“aphasie acquise avec épilepsie” et ď“épilepsie avec pointes‐ondes continues du sommeil.” Ces deux syndromes décrivent probablement des facettes différentes ďune même dysfonction cérébrale sous‐jacente dont la nature reste inexpliquée. RESUMEN En ocasiones, trastornos neuropsicológicos severos y persistentes surgen en el curso de una epilepsía focal de causa desconocida, en niños previamente normales. En estos pacientes, sin ataques clínicos, muy frecuentemente se registran descargas focales generalizadas que aparecen en los EEGs registrados durante el sueño. La relación entre estos paroxismos y el deterioro clínico permanece oscura. Se presenta un caso de un niño con epilepsía parcial compleja y severa alteración cognitiva, del lenguaje y del comportamiento que aparecieron en los años iniciales del desarrollo. Este nino ha sido seguido durante 15 afios. De modo retrospectivo fue posible establecer una correlación entra la evolución de las llamativas anomalías del EEG durante el sueño y los trastornos neuropsicológicos. La secuen‐ciaobservada entre el comienzo y la recuperación de la afasia, la dementia y el comportamiento “psicótico”, hace que una relción directa causal entre estos problemas sea muy improbable. Más bien sugiere una asociacíon de síntomas independientes con un trastorno específico del lenguaje que aparece en primer piano en el curso de la evolución. Este niño mostró muchas de las características principales de los síndromes “afasia adquirida con trastornos convulsivos (síndrome de Landau‐Kleffner)” y “epilepsía con continuas complejos punta‐onda durante el sueño”. Ambos síndromes probablemente describen diferentes facetas de una disfunción cerebral subyacente todavía inexplicada. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Gelegentlich entwickeln sich bei vormals normalen Kindern im Verlauf einer fokalen Epilepsie unklarer Ätiologie schwere persistierende neuropsychologische Störungen. Bei solchen Patienten werden häufig zahlreiche bilateral fokale oder generalisierte Entladungen im Schlaf‐EEG ohne klinische Anfälle gefunden. Die Beziehung zwischen den Paroxysmen und der beobachteten mentalen Verschlechterung bleibt unklar, Wir berichten über ein Kind mit einer partiell komplexen Epilepsie und schweren Störungen der Sprache, der kognitiven Fähigkeiten und des Verhaltens, die in frühen Jahren erworben wurden. Das Kind wurde über 15 Jahre lang weiter verfolgt. Rückblickend kann eine Korrelation zwischen der Entwicklung den EEG‐Auffälligkeiten wahrend des Schlafs und den neuropsychologischen Störungen hergestellt werden. Die beobachtete Folge im Auftreten und Wiederrückbildung der Aphasie, der Demenz und der “psychotischen” Verhaltensstörungen macht eine direkte kausale Beziehung zwischen diesen Defiziten unwahrscheinlich. Sie legt vielmehr eine Assoziation unabhängiger Symptome mit einer spezifischen Sprachstörung nahe, die im Laufe der Entwicklung in den Vordergrund tritt. Das Kind zeigt viele der Hauptcharakteristika des Syndroms der “erworbenen Aphasie mit Anfallserkrankung” (Landau‐Kleffner‐Syndrom) und der “Epilepsie mit kontinuierlichen Spike Wave Entladungen während des Schlafs”. Beide Syndrome beschreiben wahrscheinlich verschiedene Facetten einer ähnlichen bis jetzt ungeklärten zerebralen Stöning.",

      "abstract": "Neglect of a person at any age is a global complex social problem which can lead to grave medical consequences. It has been present throughout human evolution and manifests variably in different culture and countries. Neglect is not a simple outcome of the breach of caregiver or care provider and care receiver equation. There is overlap in definitions of neglect, abuse and maltreatment. The terms are often used interchangeably. The practitioner should be aware of local definitions and the context in which they are used. The clinical or pathologic assessment of neglect in any setting may be considered incomplete unless it also makes some reference and identifies the causes perceived to contribute to it. Neglect is frequently associated with vulnerabilities such as poor physical and mental health or intellectual (learning) disability. It may also be associated with social status and related to criminal activity, such as trafficking and modern-day slavery. Where pre-existing disease or illness are present, neglect may contribute to a fatal outcome by exacerbating those conditions. The victims of neglect commonly encountered in healthcare settings generally represent extremes of age. They may present with acute traumatic condition or exacerbation of a long-standing illness or complications of trauma. A thorough clinical or pathologic assessment of such patients must be supplemented by a careful analysis of circumstances. As \"neglect\" can apply to all sectors of modern society, solutions for it require the concern and cooperation of communities and professions such as policy making, education, health, law, economics and social work, all of which have the primary responsibility for reporting, assessing and making decisions to maintain appropriate standards of life.",

Successful management involves excluding reversible causes of delirium and balancing drugs that may provoke or maintain delirium while appreciating that most patients want to retain clear cognition at the end of life. #### Sources and selection criteria We searched Medline, Clinical Evidence, and the Cochrane Library using the terms delirium, terminal, terminal care, palliative care, palliative medicine, and end of life. Where possible we used systematic reviews and referenced these rather than the individual trials. Our search was limited to citations from 1990 to December 2015. We also searched the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. Delirium is the abrupt onset of fluctuating confusion, inattention, and reduced awareness of the environment. Symptoms can affect different areas of cognition (memory, orientation, language, visuospatial ability, or perception) and may include hallucinations and disturbances in the sleep-wake cycle (box 1).2 Delirium can therefore be distressing to people who experience it and those around them.3 Delirium is classified into hyperactive (restlessness and agitated behaviour predominate), hypoactive (drowsiness and inactivity predominate), and mixed subtypes. The more subtle changes associated with the hypoactive form are often missed.4 #### Box 1: What are the symptoms?",

However, giving that ADHD is a neuro-developmental disorder consisting of impaired attention and working memory skills, poor impulse control and different behavioral problems, neuropsychological assessment might be useful for a more comprehensive understanding of the child’s difficulties (language processing, learning disorders, sensory problems, social and emotional difficulties etc).Neuropsychological studies conducted in children with ADHD offered a comprehensive view of neurocognitive development and have shown poor executive functioning, visual and selective attention problems, poor performance in terms of language and motor processing, poor planning, deficits in visuospatial processing and visuomotor integration, set shifting and working memory difficulties, deficits in inhibiting impulsive reactions.",

      "title": "Prodromal stage of disease (dementia) with Lewy bodies, how to diagnose in practice?",
      "abstract": "Disease with Lewy bodies or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), particularly at the prodromal stage, is a complex disease to diagnose because of different clinical beginnings and variable paths in terms of clinical expression. Thus DLB can be entcountered in different input modes: mild cognitive impairment, depression, acute behavioral disorders, confusion and delirium, or sleep disorders. In the aim to better diagnose the disease, should be sought obviously to search for the key symptoms: fluctuations, hallucinations, extra-pyramidal syndrome, and REM sleep behavior disorder. These symptoms are more subtle at the prodromal stage (mild neurocognitive disorder) than at the major stage. Thus fluctuations can be cognitive, simply as attentionnal fluctuations, or of alertness, such as sleepiness or more frequent nap; the visual phenomena can begin by sensation of passage, sensation of presence, or illusions; the extra-pyramidal syndrome can be really subtle such as isolated amimia or rigidity detected only with Froment's manœuvre. The frequent accompagnying symptoms are autonomic symptoms such as rhinorrhea or constipation, or sensorial symptoms such as olfactory impairment. The clinician has to be aware of the frequent presence of geriatric syndroms, also at the prodromal stage and including: falls, orthostatic hypotension, syncopa, urinary troubles, depression, delirium (after surgery, during infection...). On neuropsychological tests, sub-cortical frontal syndrome is frequent, visual memory impairment, visuospatial impairment and visuo-constructive difficulties are also characteristics. On brain MRI, isolated diminished insula is to look for. CSF analysis is usually normal but sometimes with low Abeta-42. Dat-Scan and MIBG scintigraphy were not enough explored in this context. Thus, with every patient presenting a compatible input mode, the search for symptoms of DLB has to be systematic, in the aim to have an etiological diagnosis of prodromal DLB, to avoid adverse drug events (neuroleptics) and to optimize care for patients.",

Research in social cognition in schizophrenia has tended to cluster around four types of social cognitive processes: emotion processing, social perception, attributional style, and mental state attribution. Neurocognitive and social cognitive tasks often share cognitive demands, such as working memory and perception. Negative symptoms reflect a decrease or absence of normal functions within two broad domains: internal experience-related impairments, including diminished emotional experience, motivation to engage in productive activities, and desire for social affiliation; expressive or communicative impairments, including diminished facial expressivity, gestures, prosody, and speech production. It has been known for a long time that, neurocognition, negative symptoms are consistent predictors of daily functioning.",

      "title": "Djinnati Syndrome in Baluchistan: The Role of Traumatic and Abuse Experiences on Individual Vulnerability",
      "abstract": "is a culture-bound syndrome in Baluchestan, Iran. Experts believe that dissociation theory is more suitable for providing a psychopathological description of this syndrome in this region. In addition, they highlight need for investigating its pathology, particularly role of factors such as traumatic and abuse experiences during childhood.\r\n\r\nAccording to 4th edition of diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-IV-TR) (1), the essential feature of dissociative disorders is a disruption in usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, or perception of environment. The disturbance may be sudden or gradual, transient or chronic. According to DSM-IV-TR, dissociative disorders include: dissociative identity disorder, depersonalization disorder, dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue and unspecified dissociative disorder. A dissociate disorder not otherwise specified (NOS) is a disorder that includes a dissociative symptom (i.e. disturbance in usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity or perception of environment), that does not meet criteria for any specific dissociative disorder.\r\n\r\nIn addition, according to DSM a dissociative state may be defined as a dissociative trance disorder that includes a possession or trance state. Dissociative trance disorder is a single or episodic disturbance in state of consciousness, identity, or memory that are indigenous to particular locations and cultures. Dissociative trance involves narrowing of awareness of immediate surroundings or stereotyped behaviors or movements that are experienced as being beyond one’s control. Possession trance involves replacement of customary sense of personal identity or a new identity, attributed to influence of a spirit, power, deity, or other person, and is associated with stereotyped “involuntary” movements or amnesia. It is probably most prevalent dissociative disorder in Asia. The dissociative or trance disorder is not a normal part of a broadly accepted collective cultural or religious practice.\r\n\r\nMany culture-related syndromes, such as amok, bebainan, latah, pibloktoq, ataque de nervios and possession, shin-byung, enchantment, lack of spirit, Zar and djinnati (2, 3), are considered as dissociative disorders. Culture-bound syndromes include a set of psychological phenomena that are of interest to psychologists and psychiatrists. The eclectic nature of this syndrome has made it difficult to have a precise definition. Thus, deciding on a specific definition has been controversial. According to DSM, term culture-bound syndrome denotes a locality-specific pattern and repetition of an aberrant behavior and troubling experience that may or may not be linked to a particular DSM-IV diagnostic category. Many of these patterns are indigenously considered to be illnesses, or at least afflictions that mostly have local names. Culture-bound syndromes do not one-by-one match routine diagnostic system diseases. Most of these syndromes were initially reported as an issue specific to a certain culture or a relevant set, or geographically-related to original culture (4).\r\n\r\nThe term Djinnati is a culture-bound syndrome, widely known by that name in Iranian and Pakistani Baluchestan (3, 5). Based on clinical observations, this syndrome was introduced by Bakhshani and Kianpoor in Baluchestan, Iran (6). A new study by Bakhshani et al. (3) on a rural population in Baluchestan showed total prevalence of 0.5% and 1.03% among rural population and women of that population, respectively. Common symptoms of this disorder include disruption in consciousness, memory and stereotyped behaviors such as laughing, crying, speaking incomprehensibly, which are attributed to a new identity known as Djinn. Attacks usually begin with pain, irritation and sometimes limb paralysis. In some groups, loss of speech and in some other cases, speaking in different languages and change in speaking rhythm and tone of voice have been reported. In addition, there was a partial and rarely complete amnesia during attack. Some patients were far beyond their physical strength. In addition, lack of control and harming themselves and others, during attack, have been reported; although, injuries were not serious. Sometimes during attack, The patients express some demands and possessor (Djinn) requests for satisfying these demands. Attacks usually last from 30 minutes to two hours (3). \r\n\r\nIt seems that traumatic and abuse experiences have an essential role in initiation and maintenance of dissociative disorders (7, 8). Results from Bakhshani et al. (3) study showed that 43% of patients experienced their first attack after a traumatic accident (5). After civil war of Mozambique, based on results of a study reported by Igreja et al. (9) on 941 subjects (255 males and 686 females), trauma and civil war resulted damages, which explain high prevalence of this disorder.\r\n\r\nCastillo (10), believes that biological and psychoanalytic perspectives are not capable of explaining spirit possession. Etiologically, he suggested that spirit possession, similar to multiple personality disorder (MPD), is a spontaneous trance reaction to severe and negative events in environment (particularly child abuse). On other hand, Naring and Nijenhuis observed a significant correlation between traumatic events and possession experiences (11). In addition, Naring and Nijenhuis (11) considered dissociative identity disorder to be a consequence of childhood abuse or other traumatic events, thus support post-trauma model. In this regard, a study by Pasquini et al. (12), showed a relationship between traumatic experience in childhood and development of dissociative disorders. Kaplan et al. (13) found that those with higher score in dissociative experience scale had been more sexually abused during their childhood. They have been reported to commit further suicide and aggressive behaviors (13).\r\n\r\nIn general, it can be concluded that traumatic experiences, specifically childhood maltreatment and abuse, are related to possession and dissociative experiences. Therefore, in future studies, it is required to investigate type of cultural beliefs abuse and other environmental factors with onset of clinical signs of Djinatti, and then develop and practice preventive and therapeutic approaches, based on findings.",

However, the clinical presentation of most of the circadian rhythm sleep disorders is influenced by a combination of physiological, behavioral, and environmental factors. These disorders lead to complaints of insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness, with impairment in important areas of functioning and quality of life.

These same methods may also afford cognitive enhancement in people of otherwise normal cognitive abilities. 'Cosmetic', or supranormal, cognitive enhancement offers opportunities to enrich our social or financial status, our interactions with others, and the common wealth of our community. It is common to focus on the potential benefits of cognitive enhancement, while being less than clear about the possible drawbacks. Here I examine the harms or side-effects associated with a range of cognitive enhancement interventions. I propose a taxonomy of harms in cognitive enhancement, with harms classified as (neuro)biological, ethical, or societal. Biological harms are those that directly affect the person's biological functioning, such as when a drug affects a person's mood or autonomic function. Ethical harms are those that touch on issues such as fairness and cheating, or on erosion of autonomy and coercion. Societal harms are harms that affect whole populations, and which are normally the province of governments, such as the use of enhancement in military contexts. This taxonomy of harms will help to focus the debate around the use and regulation of cognitive enhancement. In particular it will help to clarify the appropriate network of stakeholders who should take an interest in each potential harm, and in minimising the impact of these harms.",

      "title": "Mental health disorders: prevalent but widely ignored in academia?",
      "abstract": "Considering that up to one in six persons worldwide has experienced a mental disorder within the past 12 months, and bearing in mind that about one-third of adults suffer from a clinically manifest mental disorder during their lifetime (Steel et al. 2014), every one of us is likely to regularly be in contact with people who have mental health problems. Does the same hold true for the academic population? Is it possible that mental disorders such as anxiety, depressive or substance use related disorders are even more common among scientists than in the general population, but still widely ignored? And if the answer to these questions is ‘Yes’, what implications should be taken into consideration? A mental disorder is a behavioural or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual, characterized by the following facts: it causes clinically significant distress and/or impairments in one or more important areas of functioning; is not merely an expectable response to common stressors and losses; reflects an underlying psychobiological dysfunction; is not solely a result of social deviance or conflicts with society; has diagnostic validity using one or more sets of diagnostic validators; and has clinical utility (Stein et al. 2010; APA, 2013; WHO, 2019). World Mental Health (WMH) representative community surveys provide information regarding the prevalence of common mental disorders. Those surveys are carried out by the World Health Organization (WHO) in many countries throughout the world, using the same fully-structured research diagnostic interview to generate diagnoses of mental disorders based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (WHO, 2019) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (APA, 2013). According to those surveys, in the general population the most frequent mental disorders are anxiety and mood disorders (such as depression), with lifetime prevalence rates averaging approximately 16% (12-months prevalence 11%) for anxiety disorders, and 12% (12-months prevalence 6%) for mood disorders (Kessler et al. 2009). A meta-analysis suggests population-based lifetime and 12-month prevalence estimates for having at least one mental disorder of 29% and 18%, respectively (Steel et al. 2014). Some authors argue that mental health problems in academia are widespread and constitute an ‘invisible crisis’ (Price et al. 2017; Bira et al. 2019). This point of view may reflect anecdotal evidence of life experiences, but to our knowledge there is limited systematic empirical research concerning mental health issues in postdoctoral researchers, research and teaching fellows, or professors. However, studies involving college, university or graduate students have brought heightened awareness of and attention to the topic (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005). Findings from large-scale WMH surveys with 1572 college students across 21 countries indicated that one-fifth of the sample suffered from at least one mental disorder during the year prior to assessment (assessed were mood disorders, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, disruptive behaviour disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and substance use disorders) (Auerbach et al. 2016). It is noteworthy that these prevalence rates did not exceed those reported in two control groups of non-students in the same age range, specifically in participants who recently left college without graduating (n = 702; prevalence 25.0%) and in other non-students (n = 3476; prevalence 21.4%) (Auerbach et al. 2016). Across all groups, anxiety disorders were the most prevalent mental illnesses, followed by mood and substance use disorders. Findings from the WMH International College Student project indicate somewhat higher prevalence estimates among first year students (n = 13,984) from 19 colleges across eight countries. One-third screened positive for at least one 12-month mental disorder, most commonly depression, which was found in 18.5% of participants (Auerbach et al. 2018). Depression is characterized by a variety of symptoms that reduce the ability to meet study or work commitments, involving feelings of sadness, guilt, hopelessness, or worthlessness; lack of interest in activities once enjoyed; fatigue; diminished ability to think or concentrate; and/or indecisiveness (APA, 2013). According to the WMH College Student project, only one in three students with depression received mental health treatment (Bruffaerts et al. 2019). This is worrisome, given that – apart from the symptoms mentioned above – thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts are common during episodes of depression (APA, 2013). In terms of university students and junior researchers, there is accumulating evidence for a relatively high prevalence of mental disorders in this population, including medical students (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005; Levecque et al. 2017; Pacheco et al. 2017; Zeng et al. 2019). A Flemish study investigated 3659 graduate students enrolled in a PhD programme, using validated self-rating questionnaires. Roughly one-third of participants were identified as being at risk of having or developing a mental disorder, especially depression (Levecque et al. 2017). This estimate was 2.4 times higher in PhD students compared to highly educated individuals in the general population, 2.8 times higher compared to highly educated employees, and 1.8 times higher compared to higher education students (Levecque et al. 2017). A recent questionnaire-based online survey of 2279 graduate students (90% PhD students, 10% Master's students) from 26 countries and 234 institutions suggests an increased propensity towards anxiety (41%) and depressive disorders (39%) in the graduate trainee community that would be higher than in the general population (Evans et al. 2018). The study further showed that those participants who scored above the questionnaire thresholds for anxiety and/or depressive disorder more often disagreed with such statements as ‘I have a good work–life balance’ or evaluated their relationship with and support by their principal investigators or supervisors more harshly than participants with low anxiety/depression scores (Evans et al. 2018). It is worth noting that the findings should be interpreted with caution because of the convenience (non-representative) sample, the potential selection bias, the lack of a control group, and the use of self-ratings instead of structured clinical interviews conducted by mental health experts (Duffy et al. 2019). The findings reported above point to the need for a better understanding of mental health problems among academics. The usually high workload, often associated with externally prescribed deadlines, competition for research resources, and uncertain job prospects can have an adverse impact on mental health. Problems may be aggravated by poor management practice as well as insufficient recognition and reward (Gillespie et al. 2001). Besides possibly disadvantageous academic conditions, other variables might contribute to mental health problems among certain sub-populations. For example, we cannot exclude the possibility that people who seek an academic career are particularly vulnerable to developing mental health problems. Vice versa, scientists may possess certain personality features (e.g. openness, self-directedness) that may increase their resilience and protect them from mental health conditions (Sato, 2016). Unfortunately, there is a relative dearth of research on mental health among senior researchers. Knowing that graduate students appear to be at increased risk for poor mental health, one could assume that senior researchers are affected in a similar manner. However, it could also be that scientists at later career stages are less affected than junior researchers, due to the benefits of their positions such as a higher level of independence, job security, etc. Maybe the more resilient one is, the more likely one is to reach the level of senior researcher. However, such reasoning remains speculative, due to the lack of empirical data. The relationships between mental health and both favourable and unfavourable academic conditions are still understudied. A major problem is that most people with mental disorders suffer in silence. They may conceal or hide their mental health problems from others because of anticipated stigma, discrimination, potential damage of their careers, and concerns about confidentiality. This is a consequence of persisting negative attitudes towards persons with mental disorders, including inappropriate beliefs about the causes of mental illnesses (Wynaden et al. 2014). Negative attitudes are often related to insufficient literacy in a topic. Thanks to greater public awareness, the stigma surrounding mental disorders such as depression has been gradually decreasing in recent decades. Despite that progress, mental health problems are still frequently seen as a ‘weakness’ or ‘lack of willpower’, rather than as what they are: an illness. It is odd that mental disorders are not regarded in the same manner as somatic disorders, and that it would appear to be easier to openly talk about cancer than about depression. For the person afflicted, self-stigma hampers early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, which can result in terrible consequences. It is essential that we become more open and reflect more honestly about ourselves, regardless of whether we self-identify as being affected by mental health problems, or not. We should combat the stigma around psychiatric disorders in academic settings by paying more attention to possible mental health problems. There might be several reasons for the uncharacteristically poor work performance of a student or colleague, his or her cyclic lack in responses to emails, unexplained non-attendance, sudden indecisiveness and unreliability, etc. Mental health problems may constitute a potential reason, and while they should not be overestimated, they should be taken into account. Perpetuating negative attitudes towards poor mental health by making derogatory comments, spreading rumours about suspected mental issues of a colleague, or by maintaining a ‘don't ask, don't tell’ culture, are not appropriate. Instead, we should raise awareness, increase our mental health literacy, listen, speak out, seek or offer/point out help, and reduce attitudinal barriers on campus to better recognize and deal with mental health problems in academics.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics WDR26-related intellectual disability (ID) is characterized by developmental delay / intellectual disability, characteristic facial features, hypotonia, epilepsy, and infant feeding difficulties. To date 15 individuals, ages 24 months to 34 years, have been reported. Developmental delay is present in all individuals and ranges from mild to severe. All individuals have delayed speech. Although some begin to develop speech in the second year, others have remained nonverbal. Seizures, present in all affected individuals reported to date, can be febrile or non-febrile (tonic-clonic, absence, rolandic seizures); most seizures are self limited or respond well to standard treatment. Affected individuals are generally described as happy and socially engaging; several have stereotypies / autistic features (repetitive or rocking behavior, abnormal hand movements or posturing, and at times self-stimulation). Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of WDR26-related ID is established in a proband with suggestive clinical features and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in WDR26 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment of developmental delay / intellectual disability, seizures, infant feeding problems, and behavioral issues. Surveillance: In infancy: regular assessment of swallowing, feeding, and nutritional status to determine safety of oral vs gastrostomy feeding. For all age groups: routine monitoring of developmental progress, educational needs, and behavioral issues. Genetic counseling WDR26-related ID is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. All individuals reported to date have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. If the WDR26 pathogenic variant found in the proband cannot be detected in the leukocyte DNA of either parent, the recurrence risk to sibs is estimated to be 1% because of the theoretic possibility of parental germline mosaicism. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "abstract": "The ability to communicate and make oneself understood is integral to a person's quality of life. It affects social interaction, educational and vocational opportunities, and ultimately independence and sense of self. Unfortunately, speech production is often impaired as a result of neurological damage (e.g., traumatic brain injury, stroke) or disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease). There are many similarities and shared neural mechanisms between speech and singing. For example, both singing and speech utilize rhythm, pitch variation, tempo, dynamics, articulation, and respiratory support. Music therapists manipulate these elements of music when addressing therapeutic goals for people with neurogenic speech disorders. Many clinical protocols to address speech disorders in adults have now been published to guide clinical practice in music therapy. This paper summarizes existing music therapy and singing-based protocols used to address commonly occurring acquired or degenerative speech disorders, namely dysarthria, dysphonia, dysprosody, and apraxia of speech. We examine individual and group therapy protocols used in medical and community settings for people with neurogenic speech disorders caused by traumatic brain injury, stroke, spinal cord injury, and Parkinson's disease. We highlight the strengths and limitations of these protocols and make recommendations for clinical practice.",

The incidence is 1.5 (95% CI 1.3 to 1.7) but it ranges from 1-8 and 25 out of every 1000 born in developed and developing countries, respectively. The most frequent causes are detachment of the placenta, prolapse of the umbilical cord and uterine rupture. The diagnostic criteria include partial or total incapacity for the newborn to cry and breath at birth even when stimulated, requiring assisted ventilation in the delivery room, Apgar < 5 in 5 and 10 minutes, acidemia (pH ≤ 7 and / or bases deficit ≥ 12 mmol/l), alterations of the conscience and the reflexes of Moro, grasping and suction, muscular stretching and muscle tone. The clinical forms are mild, moderate and severe. In the mild forms, the recovery is total in three days without, or with minimal, neurodevelopmental alterations. The moderate and severe forms cause permanent neurological deficits and neurodevelopmental alterations (48%) or death (27%). The regular or amplitude integrated EEG and the magnetic and spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging performed between 24 and 96 hours and 7 and 21 days after birth, respectively, have a high diagnostic and prognostic value. Induced hypothermia (33.5° C for 72 hours) is recommended before 6 hours old. The result is a decrease in mortality (from 35% to 27%) and morbidity (from 48% to 27%).",

      "abstract": "Lower dyspeptic syndrome is a bowel disease manifesting namely with pain or sensation of abdominal discomfort and bowel movement problems (changes in the frequency and stool consistency). Symptoms include sensation of intraabdominal pressure and fullness, diarrhoea (with or without pain), sensation of incomplete defecation, constipation or bowel movement problems (with or without pain), irregular stool, collywobbles and bowel content flow (borborygia with spasms), meteorism, flatulency. Prevalence of the Irritable Bowel Syndrome in the European population is estimated to be 5 to 25 %. In the Czech Republic the total prevalence of dyspepsias is about 13 %. To the pathogenesis of the lower dyspeptic syndrome contribute: 1. abnormal motility, 2. abnormal visceral perception, 3. psychosocial factors, 4. luminal factors, 5. imbalance of neurotransmitters and/or intestinal bacteria and 6. possible inflammatory changes of the intestinal mucosa. Infectious diarrhoea is one of the causes. Functional bowel defects represent various combinations of chronic and recurrent symptoms from the digestive tract which cannot be explained by structural or biochemical abnormalities. Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional defect manifesting with abdominal pain, intestinal dyspepsia and compulsive defecations. Subtypes with typical symptomatology are characterized by circumstances which bring about pain and compulsive defecations (morning fractional defecation, postprandial defecation, debacles). Functional diarrhoea manifests with diarrhoea without intensive pain. Spastic obstipation manifests by abdominal pain, obstipation, compulsive defecations are absent, stool is cloddish, fragmented by spastic haustration, or it has a ribbon-form. Changes in the intestinal chemism include fermentative and putrefactive dyspepsia. Among the incomplete and atypical forms the isolated meteorism, irregular defecation, flatulency, abdominal pain--syndrome of the left or right epigastium or the syndrome of the right hypogastrium can be included. In patients with typical set of symptoms the working diagnose of the lower dyspeptic syndrome can be done by general practitioner. Complete history of the disease can reveal possible extra abdominal cause of dyspepsia, recognise alarming symptoms and consider circumstances elevating or lowering the probability of functional problems. Functional bowel problems have usually long-term character and represent clinically demanding challenge. Only few therapeutic regimens are successful and the therapy aimed at the abolishment of one symptom need not bring general improvement. For the clinical studies of the therapy of functional bowel problems significant placebo effect is typical. Quoad vitam prognosis is good, quoad sanationem it is rather doubtful.",

Widespread, low-grade corruption of circuitry (brain damage) occurs, resulting in enduring deficits in cognitive, social, and motor functioning and motivation.

Expectations of patients’ functioning must be modified (reduced); interactions and environments must be accommodated to support best residual functioning, and prostheses (mechanical or actions of others) must replace functions no longer available. One of the deficits—anosognosia—interferes with treatment efforts. When the circuits managing dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area are corrupted, storms of dopamine imbue random items of sensory experience and intrapsychic life with salience—psychosis appears. Early and uninterrupted dopamine antagonist medication results in sustained remission of psychosis but is rarely achieved because of the inadequacies of standard care.

In addition to existing investigations on vegetative functional disturbances, the role of noise as a risk factor has to be determined and its effects have to be quantified. The significance of noise‐induced sleep disturbances in relation to health and well‐being, is also controversial. The hypothesized causal connection between acoustical stimulation and the occurrence of disorders, includes primary‐effects (e.g. awakenings) and after‐effects (e.g. changes in mood or performance). To date, it has not been feasible to determine late after‐effects, such as health disorders. The most often reported sociopsychological effect of noise is general annoyance, whereby annoyance is defined as disturbance of communication, rest, recreation or concentration. Some results indicate a higher sensitivity of critical groups (e.g. old people, the sick, children, pregnant women).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizophrenia is one of several disruptive psychotic disorders characterized by a broad mix of symptoms such as perceptual anomalies like hallucinations, thought distortions like delusions, disorganized speech and behaviors, and various negative symptoms such as muted expressiveness. The illness affects approximately 1% of the population. It usually begins in late adolescence or early adulthood and causes significant difficulties in cognition and affect at work, in social relationships, and in self-care. Its course varies across individuals, with many patients’ symptoms responding to medicine. There are many theories of the disorder’s pathophysiology, with several mechanisms invoked to account for evidence ranging from impaired performance on neuropsychological tests to brain structure, function, and neurotransmitter alterations such as in the dopamine, glutamate, and GABA systems. The etiology of schizophrenia is complex, with both genetic and environmental risk factors. While there exist other psychotic syndromes with a number of similarities, schizophrenia can be understood as a severe, persistent, and debilitating mental illness that still requires a more thorough investigation of its causal mechanisms to improve patients’ lives.",

This may include direct exposure, witnessing events, or learning about distressing experiences that happened to a loved one. Trauma can have deleterious consequences for children including increased risk for psychopathology, physical health problems, and impairment in several domains of functioning including emotion regulation, academic abilities, and social relationships. Examples of acute or short-lived traumatic experiences include natural disasters, sudden death of a loved one, a terrorist attack, or a number of other one-time occurring distressing events. Children also may experience trauma that is chronic in nature, such as witnessing frequent community violence or exposure to daily war-related violence.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Eating disorders are often associated with neuropsychological traits of rigid and inflexible cognition and behavior. Cognitive flexibility refers to the ability to effectively adapt to changes in the environment and/or changing task demands by selectively altering one’s thoughts, responses and/or behaviors. It can be assessed using several different neurocognitive tasks, including those that measure set-shifting and task-switching. This chapter will summarize the state of the science of cognitive flexibility deficits in individuals with eating disorders. Cognitive flexibility deficits in neuropsychological tasks appear to be most pronounced among individuals with anorexia nervosa and may be less characteristic of other eating disorders. Implications for a discrepancy in findings between objective and subjective measures of cognitive flexibility are also provided, as well implications for therapeutic interventions.",

The symptoms begin early in development but may not become apparent until social demands exceed abilities. The diagnostic assessment should include a medical assessment; evaluation by a clinician familiar with the signs/symptoms of ASD such as a developmental pediatrician, child psychiatrist, or child neurologist; neuropsychological testing to assess for comorbid intellectual disability; a speech and language evaluation; and an occupational therapy evaluation. There is no cure for ASD, but early diagnosis and intervention are associated with better functional outcomes. The treatment approach should be multidisciplinary and may include behavioral therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and educational interventions. Pharmacologic treatment may be used to manage psychiatric comorbidities and maladaptive behaviors.",

Data about neuropsychological dysfunctions or psychiatric symptoms are not available as yet. Investigating the possible psychopathological phenotype of PMD. Diagnostic evaluation of one geriatric female and two male adult patients. Detailed neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological examination of 3 patients with genetically proven PMD. In an adult male with a history of mood and behaviour fluctuations, psychiatric examination at the age of 24 disclosed symptoms of a severe major depression with irritability, loss of initiative, and marked sleep disturbances. Severe ID and marked deficits in expressive and receptive language were established. After addition of nortriptyline to valproic acid, depressive symptoms gradually remitted. His older brother has a similar history but with less severe symptomatology. The 70- years-old institutionalized female patient, had a history of affective and behavioural imbalance over many decades. Monotherapy with carbamazepine led to acceptable stabilization. Genetic evaluation in the two brothers and the female patient demonstated an identical loss of 2.15Mb and a 610kb deletion in 22q13.3, respectively, all including SHANK3 gene.

Estas se definen como un grupo de padecimientos de origen en muchos casos desconocido y que tienen como atributo común el curso progresivo de los síntomas derivados del daño estructural y funcional de diferentes zonas del sistema nervioso. La Demencia o Trastorno Cognitivo, ocurre cuando el cerebro se afecta por una enfermedad o afección específica que causa deterioro cognitivo. La secuencia en el espectro de la demencia puede terminar en la forma más grave de la enfermedad. El deterioro cognitivo en muchos casos transita desde el leve, referido a una disminución de la función cognitiva mayor de lo esperado por la edad y al nivel de educación del individuo, pero sin interferir con sus actividades cotidianas. El diagnóstico temprano de la enfermedad y la asunción de tratamientos y sobre todo estilos de vida saludables, puede evitar o enlentecer el tránsito hacia la gravedad de la enfermedad y por ende mejorar la calidad de vida. Con el objetivo de contribuir a este propósito se diseñó una herramienta de software denominada Neuromap que permite obtener patrones de conectividad a partir de señales de EEG y realizar una prueba de profundidad de la demencia. De esta forma se enriquecen los instrumentos con que cuentan en la actualidad los especialistas de las ciencias médicas para obtener un mejor y más eficaz diagnóstico.

      "abstract": "Many disorders may result in delay of language development. There is on the one hand a large group of children with bilateral peripheral deafness, most of whom will be amenable to appropriate treatment, and on the other a group, possibly more numerous, who have a variety of disorders of speech and language, varying from lack of speech associated with severe mental retardation to more specific defects, such as congenital dyslexia and developmental articulatory dyspraxia. These disorders are probably due to a defect of cerebral function at the highest level and in these children no-one will have suspected deafness or have suggested that there is an abnormal response to auditory stimuli. Some children will start life with such an abnormal response but as they grow older will cease to show the characteristics of deafness. This group is analysed and it is suggested that some may be diagnosed as suffering from central deafness. The E. E. G./Audiogram is useful in the differenciation of these children from those with perpheral deafness, especially at an early age when co-operation is limited, or when these are severe emotional disturbances or infantile psychoses. This technique will be briefly discusses. Children with central deafness may be included among those with disorders of language development, but it is possible that this disability may sometimes result from a failure of integration at a cortical level. The reason for suggesting this diagnostic category is to stress that these children do initially behave in a similar way to those who are perpherally deaf.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Se presenta comorbilidad con dificultades en la repeticion, imitacion o nominacion. No se dan problemas con la pronunciacion, como ocurre en el trastorno fonologico, puede presentarse antes de los 3 anos y es clave entre 4 y 7 anos. El electroencefalograma (EEG) se ha venido practicando no solo en el TLE, sino tambien en cuadros donde el trastorno del lenguaje era el sintoma principal o asociado a otra patologia del neurodesarrollo. Pacientes y metodos. Estudio retrospectivo con revision de 100 historias clinicas, con pacientes (25 ninas y 75 ninos) en edades entre 2 y 6 anos, a los cuales se les diagnostico TLE (segun el Manual diagnostico y estadistico de los trastornos mentales, cuarta edicion, texto revisado), libres de crisis convulsivas y sin tratamiento. Se les realizo EEG y recibieron tratamiento con acido valproico, si aquel era positivo. Resultados. Solo 6 pacientes (varones) presentaron en el EEG actividad paroxistica de punta-onda localizada en la region frontotemporal. Este 6% es un porcentaje superior al encontrado en la poblacion infantil normal (2%), pero inferior al senalado en la bibliografia para trastornos del lenguaje, que oscila entre el 20 y el 50%. Estos mejoraron el lenguaje expresivo y el EEG en respuesta positiva al tratamiento. Conclusiones. Posiblemente en el TLE sin paroxismos puede existir una disfuncion del circuito cortex motor-neoestriado previo al aprendizaje gramatical, mientras que con paroxismos senala una hiperactividad neuronal, asociada o no a dicha disfuncion, de zonas corticales. En nuestros casos el acido valproico, junto con la intervencion logopedica, contribuyo a la recuperacion del lenguaje.",

Neonatal or infantile feeding difficulties including poor suck, impaired bottle feeding, and failure to thrive are common and are often the presenting finding. Other findings can include microcephaly, variable hand and dental abnormalities, and suggestive facial features. Only ten of the 20 individuals with a TRIO pathogenic variant reported to date had sufficient information to make preliminary generalizations about clinical manifestations; it is anticipated that the phenotype of this newly described disorder will continue to evolve. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of TRIO-related ID is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous TRIO pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and includes routine management of developmental delays / ID, social and behavior problems, feeding difficulty, and dental abnormalities. Surveillance: Regular dietary evaluation in infancy to ensure optimal nutritional status; monitoring of developmental progress and educational needs; behavioral assessment for attention, aggression, and/or social communication difficulties; regular dental evaluations. Genetic counseling TRIO-related ID is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The majority of affected individuals have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant; between 20% and 40% have inherited the TRIO pathogenic variant from a similarly affected parent. Each child of an individual with TRIO-related ID has a 50% chance of inheriting the TRIO pathogenic variant. Once the TRIO pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "abstract": "The psychology of hearing loss brings together many different subdisciplines of psychology, including neurophysiology, perception, cognition, and mental health. Hearing loss is defined clinically in terms of pure-tone audiometric thresholds: the lowest sound pressure levels that an individual can detect when listening for pure tones at various frequencies. Audiometric thresholds can be elevated by damage to the sensitive hair cells of the cochlea (the hearing part of the inner ear) caused by aging, ototoxic drugs, noise exposure, or disease. This damage can also cause reductions in frequency selectivity (the ability of the ear to separate out the different frequency components of sounds) and abnormally rapid growth of loudness with sound level. However, hearing loss is a heterogeneous condition and audiometric thresholds are relatively insensitive to many of the disorders that affect real-world listening ability. Hair cell loss and damage to the auditory nerve can occur before audiometric thresholds are affected. Dysfunction of neurons in the auditory brainstem as a consequence of aging is associated with deficits in processing the rapid temporal fluctuations in sounds, causing difficulties in sound localization and in speech and music perception. The impact of hearing loss on an individual can be profound and includes problems in communication (particularly in noisy environments), social isolation, and depression. Hearing loss may also be an important contributor to age-related cognitive decline and dementia.",

These deficits can interfere, at different levels, with prosody, the semantic processing of words and discourse and pragmatic abilities. In spite of the incapability that they produce, communicational impairments in right brain damaged are usually neglected. Probably, the sub-diagnostic is due to the lack of an appropriate classification or to the absent of adequate assessment tools. In fact, patients with right brain damages might present harsh communicational deficits but perform correctly on aphasia tests because the last ones are not designed to detect this kind of deficit but left brain damaged impairments. Increasing our knowledge about the role of the right-hemisphere in verbal communication will have major theoretical and clinical impacts; it could",

      "title": "Rethinking the experiences and entitlements of people with dementia: Taking vision into account",
      "abstract": "A large proportion of people with dementia will have some kind of problem with their vision. Such problems may be the result of disturbances to low-level visual functions such as contrast sensitivity, colour vision, or visual acuity, for example. In addition, dementia can have detrimental effects on higher cognitive aspects of visual function such as visual attention, spatial localization, object recognition, facial recognition, and visual memory. The underlying cause of these visual problems is likely to be a result of a combination of a number of different factors (it is recognized that medication can also affect vision, but this will not be discussed here): (1) the direct patho-physiological effects of dementia on the brain and visual system, (2) the losses in visual function that occur as part and parcel of the normal ageing process, and (3) the losses in visual function that are a consequence of ocular diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, or cataracts, which are more common in older people.In this article, the likely prevalence of visual problems among people with dementia is highlighted and the ways in which dementia, ageing, and common eye conditions affect a person's vision are briefly described. The main aim of this article is to increase knowledge of visual issues and, in particular, eye health, and to argue that people with dementia are entitled to have their visual experiences and sight problems fully recognized and eye sight routinely tested.A second aim of this article is to report on the findings of a small-scale scoping study commissioned by Thomas Pocklington Trust – a charity for people with sight loss. Drawing on work completed for this study, the article explores the extent to which existing models of dementia care, such as Kitwood's enriched model, and best practice guidelines take account of the visual experiences and problems that people with dementia have. Some of the shortcomings of these models are identified and the general lack of awareness in the best practice literature is highlighted. Reporting on this study provides further context for arguing that vision must be taken into account when working with people with dementia. Finally, the article concludes with some recommendations for practice development, including a call for the development of an online practice development network.",

      "abstract": "Memory plays an essential role in the educational process and developing the abilities and skills of children in general and children with special abilities in particular, as it is the store responsible for preserving information and experiences responsible for developing their social, communication and cognitive skills.The division of memory into short-term and long-term memory goes back to the nineteenth century, where it was assumed that memories move from the store of short-term memories to the store of long-term memories after a short period, with different mechanisms of this transfer and about whether all memories or only some of them.Short-term memory is also called primary or active memory, and it means the ability to keep a small amount of information in the mind in an active and accessible state for a short period of time, that is, the short-term storage of information without including processing or organizing the material stored in the memory.A large percentage of children with special abilities appear to have a problem of limited short-term memory, which is known as \"spontaneous decay\" and in order to overcome this and retain information for a longer period, the information must be repeated or reviewed periodically, either by uttering it or repeating it in the mind, or by finding more attractive ways to focus the information.And the research deals with the role of the illustrations in the treatment of short-term memory responsible for the completion of the learning process.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by the breakdown of thought processes and emotional disorders. This disease is characterized by a combination of disorders: cognitive (impaired attention, memory, thinking) and behavioral, productive (hallucinatory, delusional, affective, etc.) and negative (apathy, abulia, emotional and social detachment, etc.) symptoms. Schizophrenia causes psychosis, can be accompanied by disability and negatively affect all areas of life, including personal, social life, family and work activities. This disease is also characterized by changes in emotions, loss of concentration, autism, asociality (\"immersion in oneself\", unusual thoughts and fantasies), a drop in energy state and a violation of the will. The sick person does not understand that he is ill, and this complicates treatment. Psychoses become more frequent over time and this leads to frequent hallucinations, and they can affect all the senses. The most common are auditory hallucinations in the form of voices and a person's subordination to voices, which can make the situation dangerous. The absence of treatment for schizophrenia leads to an absolute loss of one's own \"I\", loss of a person's personality, and during an exacerbation of the disease, a person can harm first of all himself and then others. The following research article examines all the factors that can influence the onset and progression of the disease.",

There have been few reported cases. The language switch typically occurs postoperatively and spontaneously resolves after a short period of time. The primary cause of this switching remains unclear. There is speculation about the involvement of anesthesia, but its specific influence remains unclear. Case presentation A 17-year-old Dutch Caucasian male lost the ability to understand and speak Dutch for 24 hours after an orthopedic surgery, combined with a brief confused state including disorientation of place and the inability to recognize his parents. During the period, he communicated in English, which he had learned during school classes but had never spoken outside of school. Further follow-up, including neuropsychological examination, revealed no indication of cognitive impairment. Conclusions The exact pathophysiology of foreign language syndrome remains unclear, most specifically whether it is a syndrome of its own or a phenotype of emergence delirium. There is still much to be learned, and further research is needed.",

      "abstract": "Examples have been presented of children's behaviors that demonstrate the trauma-learning pattern of re-enactment, repetition, and displacement. They become persistent parts of the symptom complex of PTSD. The encapsulation phase occurs when the trauma event occurs and symptoms present themselves, but the events as yet are undisclosed. The trauma-specific behavior patterns, the general hyper-arousal symptoms, and the avoidant, numbing symptoms persist; the emerging disruptive behaviors are not linked to the traumatic event and reactions to the trauma. The response of the child's social and interpersonal context to the internalizing or externalizing behaviors post-trauma, continue shaping the internal cognitive schema of the child. When the child is unable to link ongoing, self-defeating, disruptive behavior to trauma experience, the underlying fear persists. This interferes with the child's ability to modulate emotions either through altering the persistence of refractory, self-limiting cognitive schema or the inability to use new experience to develop and grow. The flexibility of children to discriminate new information may be lost; the children are either numb to new information or hyperalert and perceive danger. Issues for treatment include children's distress over memories of the trauma and the lack of capacity to learn and develop from new interpersonal experiences. It has been our experience that nurses first must help the child relearn flexibility through self-observation, the element of self-soothing and calming behaviors, processing of new information, and strengthening of social relationships. With new and strengthened personal resources, the child then is able to begin to process the traumatic memories.",

      "abstract": "Epidemiological, clinical and neurobiological studies of the last 30 years suggest that traumatic attachments during the early years of life (developmental trauma) cause a specific vulnerability to psychopathological developments based on dissociative pathogenic processes that interferes … Dissociative processes are manifested in various symptoms: arousal dysregulation, dissociative detachment (dissociation of consciousness: e.g. depersonalization), dissociative compartmentalization (dissociation among ego states), somatoform symptoms (somatoform dissociation), emotional and behavioral regulation difficulties and severe interpersonal problems. In adult clinical populations dissociative processes and the related symptoms may either contribute to the genesis of well-defined disorders such as dissociative, borderline and complex post-traumatic, or variably occur in many other DSM or ICD diagnostic categories complicating their clinical pictures and worsening the prognosis. The clinical complexity of developmental trauma requires specific training to enable mental health professionals to recognize the signs of traumatic developments and to implement specific treatment strategies. Besides an introductory overview of the literature on clinical problems and treatment strategies for the sequels in adulthood of developmental trauma, this paper offers an outline on three issues on the adult outcome of developmental trauma and its therapy: the role of disorganized attachment, the need to distinguish disintegrative and dissociative pathogenic processes and the usefulness of traumatic-dissociative psychopathological dimension for clinical reasoning of the contributions of attachment theory and research to the developmental psychopathology of adult disorders related to cumulative traumas in childhood.",

In particular, disturbances in auditory comprehension, with reference to receptive aphasia, have been minutely investigated. Likewise, a vast amount of literature is available pertaining to the expressive and mixed forms of the disorder.<sup>16,17,21</sup> Aphasia has been defined as a symbolic language impairment resulting from an organic disturbance of cortical tissue.<sup>32</sup>Since the overt manifestations of the cortical insult are primarily observable as symbolic disruptions in either expressive or receptive language patterns, or both, the question arises as to whether or not a concomitant reduction in auditory sensitivity may accompany the condition. Another form of cerebral injury, not specifically associated with symbolic language disturbance, is encountered in cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy may be defined as a neuromuscular and sensory handicap, caused by damaged or absent brain structures.",

      "abstract": "A demência pode ser caracterizada por uma deterioração adquirida na capacidade cognitiva, prejudicando o desempenho adequado de atividades cotidianas. Dentre as capacidades afetadas, a memória é a principal vítima desta condição. Outras capacidades também podem ser acometidas, tais como a linguagem, habilidade visuespacial, o cálculo, o discernimento e a resolução de problemas. Uma das causas da síndrome demêncial é a hidrocefalia normobárica (HNB), a qual afeta principalmente pessoas idosas, sendo possivelmente resultado de algum trauma ou doença, ainda que as causas exatas não estejam totalmentes claras. Esta pode ser apresentada com a clássica tríade: distúrbio de marcha (atáxica ou apráxica), demência e incontinência urinária e, é definida pelo acúmulo do líquido cefalorraquidiano (LCR ou líquor) nas cavidades ventriculares cranianas. O LCR banha o cérebro e a medula espinhal tendo como uma de suas finalidades a de evitar que possíveis traumas atinjam e comprometam o funcionamento adequado do sistema nervoso central (SNC). O diagnóstico dessa doença pode ser difícil e, muitas vezes ser confundido com outras patologias como o mal de Parkinson e o Alzheimer, além disso, o quadro clínico destas doenças podem estar sobrepostos e, muitas vezes, pacientes tratados para HNB podem estar sofrendo também de outra condição. O presente trabalho visa discutir o caso clínico de uma paciente de 73 anos diagnosticada e tratada cirurgicamente para hidrocefalia, abordando os sinais e sintomas, diagnósticos diferenciais e as melhorias na qualidade de vida após realização do adequado tratamento cirúrgico.",

      "abstract": "Residential programs are designed to provide 24-hour care for youth who are unable to be maintained in the community due to the severity of emotional and behav-ioral difficulties, or as a result of incarceration for criminal behaviors. Typically, \nthese children are at risk for being a danger to themselves or others, and require a safe, \nfully-staffed setting to ensure the stabilization of dysfunction. Placement of children \nand adolescents in residential treatment occurs for a variety of reasons, ranging from \nsevere psychopathology or extreme behavior problems (including legal involvement) \nto significant family dysfunction that interferes with healthy and successful academic, \nsocial, and community functioning. Many young people referred for residential treatment have a long history of family dysfunction that may include experiences of abuse, \ndomestic violence, substance abuse in the home, or neglect, and often school failure \nand aggressive and self-destructive behaviors. Typical diagnoses include Major Depression, Borderline Personality Disorder, Psychotic Disorders, Conduct Disorder, Substance \nAbuse Disorders, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, and other severe personality and \npsychological disorders. They often present with symptoms of oppositional/defiant \nbehavior, anger outbursts, severe mood disturbance, anxiety, self-injurious behaviors, \nsubstance abuse, and poor social skills. It is widely accepted that placing children in the \nleast restrictive placement possible is the goal; however, a child’s referral for this level \nof care often results from the need for more intensive treatment than can be obtained \nthrough outpatient means.",

      "title": "Study on Neurological Soft Signs in patients with ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nIn the era of expanding recent advancements and progress made in\r\nThe field of neuro psychiatry , a relatively neglected aspect is complete\r\nNeurological examination which is non invasive, easy to administer and\r\nProvides wealth of information regarding the various aspects of the\r\nDisease. Impaired neurological performance has been documented in\r\nVarious psychiatric conditions and the concept of neurological\r\nExamination in psychiatry ,a time old concept whose significance has\r\nGained importance with blurring of the thin line between neurology and\r\nPsychiatry leading to the concept of neuropsychiatry. Neuro biological\r\nUnderpinnings of psychiatric conditions further propelled the significance\r\nOf neurological examination in psychiatry.\r\nNeurological examination in psychiatry, particularly has two\r\nGeneral aspects\r\n1] Examination for ‘hard signs’ or ‘major signs’ or ‘localizable\r\nSigns’ such as cranial nerve lesion, motor deficit, sensory impairment,\r\nReflex asymmetry which reflects presence or absence of neuropathology\r\nAnd a localizing lesion.\r\n2] Evaluation of performance decrements in neurological domains\r\nWithout any identifiable neurological lesion or disorder (Sanders &\r\nKeshavan, 1998).\r\nAs mentioned above these decrements in neurological domains\r\nMainly includes the concept of our focus “NEUROLOGICAL SOFT\r\nSIGNS” or “SOFT NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS”.(Sanders & Keshavan,\r\n1998)\r\nNEUROLOGICAL SOFT SIGNS\r\nDr. Loretta Bender ,a pioneer in neuro psychiatric aspects of\r\nChildhood disorders introduced the concept of neurological soft signs in\r\n1947 in reference to non diagnostic neurological abnormalities seen in\r\nChildren with schizophrenia .(Sadock, Benjamin James., Sadock, 2007)\r\nDEFINITION\r\nNSS are defined by Shaffer and o’connor as\r\n“ Non normative performance (s) on a motor or sensory test(s)\r\nWhich would be identical or akin to test(s) of traditional neurological\r\nExamination, but elicited from an individual who shows none of the\r\nFeatures of fixed or transient neurological disorder ”\r\nShaffer et al also proposed that to consider a sign as an NSS it should\r\nHave following features\r\n1] No association should exist between an observed behaviour and\r\nA positive history of neurological disease or trauma\r\n2] It should not be a pathognomonic sign of any neurologic disease\r\nOr encephalopathy\r\n3] It should not be indicate any specific CNS pathology\r\nThus the NSS are minor neurological deviation in motor and sensory\r\nFunction that are not localized to any specific area of the brain and not\r\nCharacteristic of any specific neurological condition ,mostly indicating\r\nDiffuse cerebral dysfunction.\r\nEver since they have been introduced they were termed as ‘soft\r\nSigns’, ‘non focal signs’, ‘diffuse signs’, ‘minimal brain damage\r\nSyndrome’ due to their lack of specificity ,validity or localization at that\r\nTime. The term ‘soft’ also signifies the nature of wide but blurred\r\nBoundaries of varying domains like EEG findings ,behaviour disturbance,\r\nLearning disorders, neurological functions that were considered under the\r\nUmbrella of soft signs.(Sanders & Keshavan, 1998)\r\nThe initial focus of these NSS remained mainly in the field of child\r\nPsychiatry with description of concepts of ‘Minimal Brain Damage’ in\r\nChildren with hyperactivity, impulsivity and with no demonstrable\r\nNeurological lesion. Later from 1990 with quantification of validated and\r\nStandardised instruments for assessment of these signs, the focus shifted\r\nTo major psychiatric conditions leading to exhaustive research in the\r\nSubject which provided significant understanding of the neurobiology,\r\nNeuro anatomical correlates, genetic underpinnings , neuro developmental\r\nBasis, endophenotypic markers and predictors of neuropsychological\r\nDysfunction in certain psychiatric conditions.\r\nWith this brief introduction about the neurological soft signs ,we\r\nNow focus on existing documented literature that has changed the concept\r\nOf these NSS, their significance in psychiatric conditions and the various\r\nAspects of their relation to Obsessive compulsive disorder which is the\r\nMain focus of our study.",

The language impairment can be fluent or nonfluent and may or may not interfere with word comprehension. Memory for recent events is preserved, although memory scores obtained in verbally mediated tests may be abnormal. Minor changes in personality and behavior may be present but are not the leading factors that bring the patient to medical attention or that limit daily living activities. This distinctive clinical pattern is most conspicuous in the initial stages of the disease and reflects a relatively selective atrophy of the language network, usually located in the left hemisphere.",

      "abstract": "Dissociative disorders are heterogeneous group of mental disorders with dissociation as dominant symptoms. Dissociation is often defined as partial or total disconnection between memories of the past, awareness of identity and of immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements, often resulting from traumatic experiences, intolerable problems, or disturbed relationships. Etiopatogenezis of dissociative disorders have not exactly known yet. The process of dissociation is independently associated with several distressing conditions such as psychiatric diagnoses, somatization, current psychological distress, and past sexual and physical victimization. The disturbance may have a sudden or gradual onset and may be temporary or chronic in its course. Dissociation has a negative impact on treatment oucome. Additionaly, dissociative patients may have an insecure attachment pattern negatively affecting the therapeutic relationship. Conceptually, the course of treatment is to improve coping, maintain reality, and establish normal integrative functions. Goals: 1. improve thought processes; 2. maintain a sense of reality; 3. improve coping skills; 4. develop stress management abilities; 5. increase identity integration. The treatment is possible with psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy or both. We will introduce the CBT approach. Participants will learn: • pharmacological possibilities in the treatment of dissociative disorders; • CBT model of dissociative disorders; • motivational interviewing with dissociative patient; • how to develope therapeutic relationship with dissociative patient; • conceptualization of dissociative disorder with the patient; • Socratic questioning; • working with cognitive, emotional and behavioral avoidance; • exposure technique with dissociative problems; • problem solving.

Many etiologies were proposed for selective mutism including psychodynamic, behavioral and familial etc. A developmental etiology that includes insights from all the above is gaining support. Accordingly, mild language impairment in a child with an anxiety trait may be at the root of developing selective mutism. The behavior will be reinforced by an avoidant pattern in the family. Early treatment and followup for children with selective mutism is important. The treatment includes non-pharmacological therapy (psychodynamic, behavioral and familial) and pharmacologic therapy--mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI).",

When the articulation defect is specifically due to a neuromuscular dysfunction resulting from an organic lesion of the central nervous system, the condition is referred to as dysarthria. If the phonological error is more widespread involving several phonemes or phonemic clusters with distorsion, replacement and/or omission the condition is not considered as an articulation problem. It is rather considered as an element of a symbolic language problem which might involve evident syntactic and semantic defects as well. During the first few years of phoniatric practice in Egypt certain tendencies–pathological, social and therapeutic–were found to be characteristic of dyslalia, in the activity area of the phoniatric Unit of Ain Shams University.

      "title": "Alteraciones cognitivas y lingüísticas en la enfermedad de Parkison",
      "abstract": "La Enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) es una enfermedad neurodegenerativa caracterizada principalmente por sintomas motores (rigidez, bradicinesia, temblor en reposo) que aparece por una perdida de dopamina en el circuito que conecta los ganglios basales con la corteza cerebral y por la aparicion de depositos de Lewy en diferentes regiones cerebrales. Aunque el origen de la EP es parcialmente desconocido, han sido descubiertos algunos genes que estan involucrados en su aparicion, pero que explican solamente un pequeno porcentaje de los casos. En las ultimas decadas, el interes por los sintomas no motores (SNM) de la enfermedad ha ido creciendo progresivamente. El deterioro cognitivo leve (DCL) es uno de estos sintomas que puede aparecer incluso desde los inicios de la enfermedad y en algunos casos, evolucionar hasta la demencia. El perfil cognitivo de estos pacientes suele caracterizarse por dificultades ejecutivas, aunque tambien es frecuente encontrar deficits de memoria, de habilidades visuoespaciales, de procesamiento emocional y del lenguaje.En el caso del lenguaje, las alteraciones pueden afectar tanto al procesamiento de mas alto nivel como la pragmatica o la comprension de oraciones, hasta el procesamiento lexico-semantico. Sin embargo, aun hay controversia acerca del origen de estos deficits. Diferentes estudios han tratado de conocer si el deficit es puramente linguistico o si por el contrario es secundario a las alteraciones cognitivas presentes en los pacientes, o incluso si existe relacion con el trastorno motor y/o los niveles de dopamina cerebral.El objetivo principal de esta Tesis es conocer el perfil cognitivo de un grupo de pacientes con EP sin demencia asi como las alteraciones linguisticas que pueden presentar, principalmente de los verbos.La hipotesis de partida es que los pacientes con EP muestran deficits cognitivos y en el reconocimiento de expresiones faciales en ausencia de demencia objetivados con pruebas neuropsicologicas. En cuanto a los trastornos del lenguaje, la hipotesis principal de este trabajo es que los pacientes con EP sin demencia presentan deficits linguisticos en el procesamiento de los verbos que aumentan con la retirada de la medicacion dopaminergica. Para poner a prueba estas hipotesis, llevamos a cabo 5 estudios distintos. En el primer trabajo participaron 50 pacientes con EP y 42 controles sanos. En el segundo, 40 pacientes con EP y 19 controles, en ambos, los pacientes fueron evaluados con una extensa bateria neuropsicologica y en el segundo se incluyeron mas tareas linguisticas y una de reconocimiento de expresiones faciales. En el tercer estudio, una muestra de 49 pacientes con EP y 19 controles realizaron una tarea de denominacion de acciones en la que se controlo el contenido motor de los dibujos que tenian que denominar. En los experimentos cuatro y cinco, 20 pacientes fueron evaluados con la misma tarea de denominacion de acciones (estudio cuatro) y con cuatro tareas de fluidez verbal (estudio cinco), mientras estaban con y sin los efectos de la medicacion dopaminergica.Los resultados encontrados han sido publicados en cinco articulos y pueden resumirse de la siguiente manera:En el primer articulo (Rodriguez-Ferreiro, Cuetos, Herrera, Menendez & Ribacoba, 2010) se encontro que la muestra con EP sin demencia presentaba dificultades en tareas que evaluaban funciones ejecutivas, atencion, orientacion temporal, memoria inmediata, fluidez semantica, denominacion de personajes famosos y denominacion de acciones. En el segundo articulo (Herrera, Cuetos & Rodriguez-Ferreiro, 2011), encontramos diferencias significativas en la fluidez semantica, la fluidez de acciones, la denominacion de acciones, la denominacion de personajes famosos, la atencion y el reconocimiento de expresiones faciales. Los analisis de regresion mostraron que la tarea de reconocimiento de expresiones era la que mejor diferenciaba entre el grupo de EP y el grupo control. Ademas la distribucion de este deficit era similar tanto para los pacientes con DCL como para los pacientes con funciones cognitivas normales. Centrandonos en las alteraciones del lenguaje, en el tercer articulo (Herrera, Rodriguez-Ferreiro & Cuetos, 2012) se observo que los pacientes cometen mas errores a la hora de denominar dibujos que tienen un alto contenido motor en comparacion con aquellos de bajo contenido motor, mientras que los controles tenian un rendimiento similar en ambas categorias. Los resultados del cuarto articulo con pacientes con y sin medicacion (Herrera & Cuetos, 2012), mostraron que mientras en los pacientes con medicacion, los tiempos de reaccion (TR) eran similares para ambos tipos de dibujos, en los EP off, los TR eran significativamente mas lentos para los dibujos con un alto contenido motor. Por ultimo, los resultados obtenidos en el quinto estudio (Herrera, Cuetos & Ribacoba, 2012) muestran que los pacientes off medicacion generan significativamente menos palabras en las tareas que dependen de las zonas frontales (fluidez fonologica y de acciones). Y lo mas interesante es que en el caso de la fluidez de acciones, los pacientes off medicacion generaron verbos significativamente mas frecuentes que en on o que los generados por el grupo control.Los resultados sugieren que es posible encontrar deficits cognitivos en pacientes con EP sin demencia o quejas subjetivas de deterioro en los estadios iniciales de la enfermedad. Ademas estas dificultades no solo se relacionan con las tareas ejecutivas, sino que tambien aparecen problemas semanticos. Aparte de los deficits cognitivos, es posible encontrar problemas relacionados con el reconocimiento de expresiones faciales, independientes a la presencia de DCL.En cuanto a los trastornos linguisticos, los EP muestran un deficit especifico en el procesamiento de los verbos evaluado tanto con tareas de denominacion de acciones como de fluidez verbal. En el caso de la denominacion de acciones, el deficit parece tener un origen semantico, pues las dificultades aumentan al denominar acciones con mayor contenido motor que es mas acusado en los pacientes en los que el trastorno motor es mas severo (cuando estan sin medicacion). Estos datos sugieren que las mismas areas encargadas de planificar y ejecutar los movimientos estan implicadas, al menos en parte, en el procesamiento de los verbos de accion. Ademas la dopamina tambien parece jugar un papel importante en la activacion del sistema lexico-semantico de los verbos, pues cuando los pacientes se encuentran sin los efectos de la medicacion, solo pueden acceder a aquellos verbos que tienen mayor frecuencia lexica y por tanto estan mas accesibles.En definitiva, los resultados presentados muestran que los pacientes con EP sin demencia, presentan deficits cognitivos, de reconocimiento de expresiones faciales y dificultades relacionadas con el procesamiento de los verbos.",

      "abstract": "Chairman Yannet: Mental deficiency may be defined as an interference with the development of intellectual capacity resulting in social inadequacy. This may be so severe as to necessitate complete custodial care indefinitely; it may be so slight, that a simple change in environment or program may allow for relatively normal community activity with minimal to no supervision. For these different degrees of disability a wide variety of terms have been used. In decreasing order of disability, the terms most frequently employed including their definitions in terms of intelligence quotients are as follows: 1. Borderline: I.Q. 70-80 2. Moron or high grade: I.Q. 50-70 3. Imbecile or middle grade: I.Q. 20-49 4. Idiot or low grade: I.Q. 0-19 Such terms as feeblemindedness and mental retardation are generally used interchangeably for mental deficiency. Obviously, not all children failing to adjust socially or follow normal paths of development are so because of basic mental deficiency. Certain other conditions, either superficially or strikingly resembling mental deficiency states, must be differentiated. These latter conditions require a different and sometimes highly specialized therapeutic approach and any considerable delay in their recognition may adversely affect subsequent adjustment. The most common of these conditions include the following which are briefly described: 1. Delay in Educational Maturation: There is considerable variation in the time at which children of normal intellectual capacity reach the stage at which they properly react to the usual educational procedures, normally introduced at about 6 years of age. This so-called period of \"educational readiness\", for want of a better term, includes many aspects such as attention span, personal relations and socialization status, and may occasionally be delayed 2 or 3 years.",

This chapter briefly reviews the main issues in the treatment of aphasia and summarize some approaches to treatment. Research shows that recovery and response to treatment are significantly influenced by emotional and psychosocial factors. Developments in cognitive neuroscience and neurophysiology have the potential to improve the understanding of the mechanisms underlying recovery and the response to treatment in aphasia.

      "abstract": "This review of the literature focuses on facial expression as a significant aspect of communication. Many basic expressions of emotion such as fear, anger, sadness, disgust, and happiness are universal. Some more subtle expressions are learned and may be culture-specific or idiosyncratic but the basic ones are found in all humans. Infants around the world follow a similar timetable based on neurologic maturation in development of production and recognition of facial expression. Babies who are blind spontaneously develop the same expressions even without the ability to view them in others. As speech-language pathologists, we encounter individuals who cannot produce normal facial expressions of emotion. These might include people with Mobius syndrome and others with facial paralysis, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, poststroke paresis, and Parkinson's disease. Children in our caseloads with autism, Williams and velocardiofacial syndromes, and learning disabilities have problems in recognition, rather than production, which often leads to pragmatic difficulties. Adults poststroke, with traumatic brain injury, or progressive dementia may also show an inability to recognize expression, which may result in misinterpretation of everyday situations. Traditional methods and computerized training programs attempt to improve production and interpretation of expression.",

      "abstract": "Parmi les problématiques psychiques susceptibles d’entraver ou de soutenir le traitement des conflits engagés par l’expérience du vieillissement et/ou du handicap, la question des identifications sexuelles se révèle nodale. En effet, outre la question identitaire, des assises narcissiques et de la différenciation moi/non moi, la question des identifications secondaires mobilisées par les différences des sexes et des générations se révèle être une dynamique majeure du rapport que toute personne peut entretenir avec son corps. Le vécu des limitations liées à l’expérience du handicap, et de celles, plus communes, liées à la traversée du vieillissement et de la vieillesse – qu’elles soient brutales ou insidieuses, aiguës ou chroniques –, entretient des rapports complexes avec les fantasmes de castration et de passivité. L’expérience de psychothérapies analytiques d’hommes qui, pour cause accidentelle traumatique (chute, accident de la voie publique), ou pour cause de fragilité somatique (accident vasculaire cérébral), se retrouvent en situation de handicap (avec des séquelles plus ou moins invalidantes) et vieillissent ainsi, permet de discerner combien la question des identifications féminines joue un rôle capital dans l’élaboration des conflits psychiques inhérents à cette rencontre entre vieillissement et handicap. L’auteur propose d’illustrer cette question clinique par l’exposé des grandes étapes de la psychothérapie d’un homme de 75 ans qui permet de saisir comment la rigidité puis la souplesse des identifications sexuelles, de la revendication de la puissance à la possibilité d’y renoncer au profit de l’acceptation d’une certaine passivité-jouissance, organisent, gênent ou élaborent le conflit psychique et, partant, les relations aux proches, aux enfants, aux femmes et aux hommes.",

It arises as a result of organizational change such as implementation of change process or downsizing which is the reflection of response to external changes such as changing dynamics of economies like recession, intense competition; political situations and adaptability. Not only the victims of lay-off suffer from Lay-off Survivor Sickness but also the survivors who remain within the organization go through the same feelings. These conditions sometimes last for months or even years and demographic characteristics of survivors can also influence the duration of lay-off survivor sickness  which do not only affect the employees (Survivors) and their families but also the organizations which sometimes fail to achieve their desirable objectives through downsizing or change process.",

      "abstract": "The idea that superior cognitive function acts as a protective factor against dementia and the consequences of head injury is well established. Here we suggest the hypothesis that cognitive reserve is also important in neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression.We review the history of passive and active models of reserve, and apply the concept to neuropsychiatric disorders. Schizophrenia is used as an exemplar because the effects of premorbid IQ and cognitive function in this disorder have been extensively studied.Cognitive reserve may impact on neuropsychiatric disorders in three ways: by affecting the risk for developing the disorder, in the expression of symptoms within disorders, and in patients' functional outcome. Cognitive failure below a certain threshold may alone, or in combination with common psychiatric symptoms, produce neuropsychiatric syndromes.Consideration of cognitive reserve may considerably improve our understanding of individual differences in the causes and consequences of neuropsychiatric disorders. For these reasons, the concept of cognitive reserve should be incorporated in future studies of neuropsychiatric disorder. It may be possible to enhance cognitive reserve through pharmacological or non-pharmacological means, such as education, neurocognitive activation or other treatment programmes.",

      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, central nervous system, disabling disease. International Classification of Functioning and relevant generic and specific outcome measures are reported. Problems perceived by people with MS (PwMS) affect mobility, sight, continence, feeding, or cognitive impairment, depending on whether acute, chronic, or long-term disability was involved. The most common body function and structure impairments leading to disability and reported by health care professionals are fatigue, weakness, decreased fitness, sensory disorders, pain, upper motor neuron syndromes, ataxia and tremor, balance and postural control problems, gait pattern disorders, visual problems, and neurogenic lower urinary tract and bowel dysfunction; sexual, autonomic, neuropsychological, and neuropsychiatric impairment; dysarthrophonia, dysphagia, and respiratory and sleep disorders. The most frequently affected activities and relationships include mobility, domestic life, community and social activities, remunerative employment, interpersonal relationships, self-care, learning and applying knowledge, and economic life. Limitations in activities of daily life because of fatigue, pain, visual problems, incontinence, sexual and cognitive impairment, depressive disorders, sleep disorders, economic pressure, employment status, and lack of information have an impact on quality of life (QoL). Increased caregiving tasks, psychological burden, limitation in activities and participation, and reduced QoL have a profound influence on caregivers. This paper summarizes the perception of problems and needs, the disease's impact on functioning and QoL of PwMS, and the impact on their significant others and caregivers, according to health and social research.",

Long-term suffering can result in somatic symptoms and the development of diseases. It can even induce diseases with a mental dimension. Insomnia causes indications of poor health. No systematic analysis of insomnia has been performed, however. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to describe the concept of insomnia. In accordance with Walker and Avant's (2005) methodology of concept analysis, this paper presents a review of the conceptual definitions, characteristics, antecedents and consequences, constructing examples, and empirical references of insomnia. The results indicate that: (1) Insomnia's defining attributes are recognized as an insufficient of quality and quantity for sleep for more than one month. (2) Antecedents of insomnia include changes in life habits, physiological demands caused by sleep time changes, and the experience of uncomfortable sensations. (3) Consequences of insomnia include a poor condition, with physical, psychological, social, and global dimensions. (4) There are many instruments that can be used to inspect insomnia, including questionnaires and tools for physiological measurement. Insomnia is a serious problem with various facets. An understanding of the concept of insomnia will help nurses to perceive this problem in caring for subjects.",

This condition is common, with a lifetime prevalence of up to 13%, and one third of affected persons have major dysfunction. <i>Methods:</i> The English-language literature on social anxiety disorder indexed on MEDLINE was searched using the phrases \"social phobia\" or \"social anxiety disorder;\" this search was supplemented with other data sources, such as recent textbooks, to determine common clinical symptoms, differential diagnosis, and management in the primary care setting. <i>Results:</i> Recognition and treatment of social anxiety disorder is poor; only a small minority of patients with this condition have it appropriately diagnosed or treated. Primary care physicians should suspect social anxiety disorder in patients who have specific symptoms and signs (such as hyperhidrosis, flushing, tremor, and white-coat hypertension), in patients who have symptoms of anxiety (such as chest pain, palpitations, or dizziness), or in patients who have another known anxiety disorder, depression, or substance abuse. Drug treatment consists of serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or high-potency benzodiazepines. A specific type of psychotherapy called cognitive behavioral therapy is another effective treatment, but it is not acceptable or accessible to most patients. <i>Conclusions:</i> Because social anxiety disorder is common, disabling, and treatable, primary care physicians should intensify their efforts to recognize it.",

      "title": "A - 110 Characterization of Mild Cognitive Impairment in Multiple System Atrophy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Objective Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder that primarily impacts movement and balance, as well as the autonomic nervous system. While traditionally not associated with cognitive decline, recent evidence indicates cognitive impairment is part of the disease process, typically manifesting as attentional and executive function deficits, alongside learning/memory impairments. This case contributes to MSA literature by describing mild cognitive changes in a patient with predominant autonomic dysfunction. Method A 68-year-old Caucasian man exhibited progressive cognitive changes over 2–3 years, with concerns emerging 5–10 years prior to neurological consultation (e.g., forgetfulness, word-finding difficulties, decline in ability to follow complex instructions). Predominant sensorimotor/physiological changes included chronic constipation, vasovagal episodes, hearing loss, orthostatic hypotension, transient vision loss, and mild dysphagia. Neuroimaging showed nonspecific mild pontine T2/FLAIR hyperintensity. Significant family history of dementia. Results Evaluation showed mostly normal cognitive function with some decline in executive functioning (slowed processing, reduced problem-solving, set loss, task rigidity) and mild memory decline. Despite scores within normal limits, performance likely reflects cognitive change consistent with his subjective experience, possibly masked by strong cognitive reserve (high educational and occupational attainment, research interests, social engagement). Conclusions Although lacking frank impairment, the patient’s history suggests a neurological process (i.e., synucleinopathy such as MSA) including history of REM sleep behavior disorder, autonomic symptoms/conditions, and neuroimaging findings suggestive of brain stem involvement. Neuropsychological evaluation is critical in differentiating MSA from other Parkinsons’s plus syndromes, as it typically presents with fewer cognitive impairments.",

A comprehensive bladder-retraining program that incorporates appropriate education, training, medication, and surgical interventions can mitigate the adverse consequences of neurogenic bladder dysfunction and improve both quantity and quality of life. The goals of bladder retraining for neurogenic bladder dysfunction are prevention of urinary incontinence, urinary tract infections, detrusor overdistension, and progressive upper urinary tract damage due to chronic, excessive detrusor pressures. Understanding the physiology and pathophysiology of micturition is essential to select appropriate pharmacologic and surgical interventions to achieve these goals.

      "title": "Sleep-Related Problems in Childhood and Adolescence",
      "abstract": "Abstract Pediatric sleep problems are very common and may negatively impact various aspects of child development, spanning physical, socio-emotional, behavioral, cognitive, and academic domains. Moreover, sleep problems in children often have a major impact on family relationships and functioning and may lead to significant parental fatigue, stress, and low mood. Numerous intrinsic and extrinsic factors may influence the development of sleep problems and their maintenance, ranging from genetic vulnerability, prematurity, medical problems, and neurodevelopmental disorders to behavioral and socio-environmental factors, such as poor sleep hygiene, ineffective parental sleep-related behaviors, and exposure to academic, social, or family stressors. Given the high prevalence of pediatric sleep problems and associated harmful consequences, assessment of these problems by primary child healthcare providers should be included in any medical or mental health evaluation. Fortunately, there are various evidenced-based effective behavioral and medical interventions that are used to treat specific pediatric sleep disturbances. This chapter describes common sleep disorders in infants, children, and adolescents, including insomnia, parasomnias, circadian problems, sleep-related movement disorders, and obstructive sleep apnea. Current evidence regarding the phenomenology, etiology, assessment, and evidence-based treatment options is addressed pertaining to each disorder. Finally, open questions in the field of pediatric sleep problems are presented, highlighting areas warranting future research.",

      "title": "Headache and Psychological Functioning in Children and Adolescents",
      "abstract": "Headache can affect all aspects of a child's functioning, leading to negative affective states (eg, anxiety, depression, anger) and increased psychosocial problems (for instance, school absences, problematic social interactions). For children and adolescents who experience frequent headache problems, comorbid psychological issues are a well‐recognized, but poorly understood, clinical phenomenon. The confusion surrounding the relationship between pediatric headache and psychopathology exists for several reasons. First, in some cases, headache has been inappropriately attributed to psychological or personality features based on anecdotal observations or interpretations that go beyond the available data. Additionally, measures of psychopathology have not always adhered to the American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic criteria, thus reducing the reliability of diagnostic judgments. Furthermore, the diagnosis of headache has not always followed standard criteria, and has been complicated by the emergence of new terms and evolving measures. Finally, methodological shortcomings, such as incomplete descriptions of the procedures and criteria used for the study, inadequate descriptions of headache severity, lack of a control group for comparison with individuals without headaches, reliance primarily on cross‐sectional research designs that are often discussed with inferences to causal hypotheses, and the use of unstandardized assessment measures, have significantly limited the validity of research findings. The goal of the current review is to examine the extant literature to provide the most up‐to‐date picture on what the research has made available about the magnitude, specificity, and causes of psychopathology in children and adolescents with headache, in an effort to further elucidate their relationship and prompt a more methodologically rigorous study of these issues.",

      "abstract": "In the modern world, anxiety is an important part of life. Physiological anxiety is a normal emotional response to stress, a biological response to a threat. Anxiety allows you to protect yourself and your loved ones from harm and prepare for significant events, and also serves as an important signal to take strong action in a stressful situation. The study and understanding of the specifics of the clinical structure, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of stress-related disorders in persons who have suffered as a result of hostilities is indeed the main concern for social and medical issues of our society. As the results of the study showed, patients most often complain of the following symptoms: the affect of longing (boredom, despondency, sadness, sorrow), depressed mood, a feeling of tension, danger and tightness, difficulties in adapting to new surroundings, anxiety over small things, irritability and impatience, lack of hope and prospects, internal tension with the inability to relax, a sense of loss of control over one's life, obsessive fears, sleep disorders, psycho-traumatic memories, fears and fixation on subjectively significant negative information about events in the occupied territories. In the clinical structure of post-traumatic stress disorders in the examined patients, it was found: post-traumatic stress disorder (F43.1), adjustment disorders (prolonged anxiety-depressive reaction) (F43.21), anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1) and panic disorder (F41.0). The data obtained became the basis for the development of a comprehensive personalized program for the correction of anxiety disorders and rehabilitation of persons with forced displacement. The personalized program was with differentiated use of methods of psychopharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and psychoeducation. Keywords: biosugestive therapy, anxiety, depression, correction programs.",

      "title": "Aging, Cognitive Load, Dementia and Hearing Loss",
      "abstract": "Sensorineural systems play a crucial role in the diagnosis, treatment and management of several neurological disorders. The function of the eye and ear represents a unique window for testing various conditions in cognitive decline or dementia. Touch and smell have also been found to be strongly involved in neurodegenerative conditions, and their decline has been significantly associated with the progression of the disease; hence, the idea that restoring sensory function in cognitively impaired adults might enable a significant improvement in their cognitive status, reducing the worldwide incidence and prevalence of dementia. Not all sensorineural ‘windows' can benefit equally from the same procedures; however, hearing and vision can certainly gain the most from dependable therapeutic and other diagnostic options. The ear, including the vestibular system, deserves an honored place among the sensory organs in this context due mainly to the sophisticated electrical devices available that have amply demonstrated their effectiveness in treating hearing loss. Restoring an individual's hearing can reduce the cognitive ‘load', i.e. the neural activity needed to understand/recognize the spoken word - an activity that becomes more demanding if the brain is obliged to recruit different neural populations to achieve the same performance, as happens in older adults with sensory impairments. The sensory interfaces may also facilitate the early diagnosis of conditions characterized by a lengthy preclinical phase, as well as enabling noninvasive, follow-up procedures to assess the outcome of rehabilitation measures and distinguish physiological brain aging from neurodegenerative disorders. The present study is a brief literature review on the issues and prospects relating to the unique relationship between hearing and cognitive decline, with a general introduction to the main topics before focusing on rehabilitation training with hearing aids and cochlear implants to combat cognitive decline.",

      "abstract": "The sensory disturbance in schizophrenia is often described as an inability to filter out extraneous noise from meaningful sensory inputs. The neurobiological basis of this inability to filter has been examined using auditory evoked potentials, which are computerized averages of the brain's electrical response to sound. The sounds are presented in pairs to test the ability of the brain to inhibit, or gate, its response to a repeated stimulus. Schizophrenic patients lack the ability to gate the neuronal response shown by a particular wave, the P50 wave. The measurement of this deficit in human subjects and the exploration of its neurobiology in animals has produced evidence about several issues in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia: (1) the role of dopamine in improvement of sensory function in schizophrenic patients treated with neuroleptic drugs, (2) the interaction between familial or genetic deficits in sensory functioning in schizophrenic patients and possible abnormalities in dopamine metabolism, and (3) a mechanism by which noradrenergic hyperactivity in mania and other psychiatric illnesses might mimic some pathophysiological deficits in schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Backward chaining used to teach a woman with aphasia to read compound words: A single case study.",
      "abstract": "Introduction Broca's aphasia is an adult language disorder that is often acquired following a cerebral vascular accident (stroke) affecting the inferior gyrus of the left frontal lobe known as Broca's area (Doesborgh et al., 2004). The condition is characterized by a diminished vocabulary and by the slow, broken, and labored formation of sentences. Nouns are prominent in the speech of Broca's patients but other word types such as prepositions and adverbs seem harder for the patients to use (Carlson, 2001). By preserving content words and losing function words, persons with Broca's aphasia often produce speech that sounds labored and telegraphic (e.g., I.... glasses.... mall). Various approaches have been used to treat patients with Broca's aphasia including speech therapy, cognitive therapy, behavioral therapy, relaxation therapy, and others (Code, C., 2001). Most studies show improvements after treatment. Still, the development of an efficacious, effective and efficient treatment, one that reliably works better than others for specific patients with specific symptoms, remains to be established (Sigurdardottir & Sighvatsson, 2003, 2006b; Greener, Enderby & Whurr, 2000). When developing treatments to support patients with Broca's aphasia, it is important to consider the different features of the condition and to focus on how a treatment may affect a particular feature. For example, one patient may have special difficulties naming things while another may have problems reading. In fact the symptom profiles of patients are often quite unique, and, therefore, it is important to have an array of treatments to tackle an array of problems. Furthermore, when a treatment is being developed it is important that all treatment variables be clearly defined so that the same treatment can be assessed for its effectiveness across different patients with different symptoms. The existing research does not permit a clear analysis of intervention effects. Most individual treatment studies have included poorly defined independent variables, thereby obscuring internal validity and rendering replications impossible (Greener et al., 2000; Jordan & Hillis, 2006). Group studies have yielded an unclear picture of the effects of treatment for different individuals because they only provide pooled group averages and no specific information at the individual level. Single-subject design studies have rarely been replicated making it impossible to assess generality of results (Basso & Caporali, 2004; Sigurdardottir & Sighvatsson, 2003, 2005, 2006b). Single subject designs may be the most feasible strategy for studying treatment effects. These designs offer good control over participant variables such as age, gender, type of disability, and others. They also allow the researcher to carefully observe any changes that may occur in a participant's performance during the treatment phase. If indicated by the data, the treatment variables can then be adapted to enhance the participant's performance (Sigurdardottir & Sighvatsson, 2003, 2006b). For these reasons, single subject designs offer a unique way to carefully monitor any improvements made by a participant during the treatment. By using well defined treatment variables, this approach also allows for systematic replications (Barlow & Hersen, 1984; Sidman. 1960). Single subject research design has been widely used in the field of applied behavior analysis, particularly for evaluating the effects of treatments based on operant learning principles. Treatment based on these principles have been used with efficiency, effectiveness, and efficacy for teaching skills to people with learning disabilities, brain damage, psychiatric disorders and other impairments. Within this framework, symptoms of impairment are viewed as behavioral deficits that can be ameliorated by teaching behaviors that a person is lacking. This framework offers a parsimonious approach to the treatment of aphasia (Austin & Carr, 2000). …",

But failures to orient toward stimuli can result from several different types of difficulty. most crudely to organise a response towards the contralesional side (“output” or “intentional” neglect (Valenstein & Heilman, 1981) or from problems of detecting stimuli in contralesional space (“input” neglect).

There should be a low threshold for consideration of this family of disorders in individuals that present with the above symptoms, present with a sepsis-like picture, have developmental delay or intellectual disability, or develop disease-specific long term complications (e.g., cardiomyopathy seen in propionic acidemia, renal failure seen in the methylmalonic acidemias). Late diagnosis with intellectual disabilities or disease-specific complications are thought to becoming less common in areas with universal newborn screening since it includes many of these disorders and allows for early treatment and avoidance of severe presentations. In general, treatment in the acute setting focuses on decreasing toxin production by reversal of catabolism, removal of toxin precursors, use of toxin scavengers (e.g., levocarnitine to bind propionic acid in propionic acidemia) and attempting to improve enzyme function by using supra-physiologic doses of cofactors. Long term therapy has similar approaches.",

      "abstract": "Almost 10 years ago at the age of 40, I was turned into a premature invalid. Stroke had manifested itself both in my body and mind. My disabilities after the strokes lay not only in the mechanical execution of commands and the ability of contraction of muscles, but also in mental processes like perception, attention, memory, and thought. These impediments have meant drastic changes in my living conditions and social status. My disability was multifaceted and involved my whole person. Its expression was somatic, psychic, and behavioural. I suffered from loss of appetite, disturbance of sleep, psychic anxiety, depression, anguish, aggressive reactions, communication difficulties, disorganization of conduct, and so on. My personality no longer matched up to my own expectations. I was trapped in a situation of impossibility of living, despair, and hopelessness. I was confronted with a problem I could not circumvent, and I had insufficient skills available to solve it. I had fallen into a state of nothingness. My life was in crisis.",

      "abstract": "Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or crib or cot death are synonyms for the sudden, unexpected and unexplained death of an infant. The incidence of SIDS has been estimated to be from 1-2% to 3%. Protracted intrauterine hypoxia or recurrent hypoxic insults during fetal life undoubtedly influence the development of the central nervous structures as a tissue most susceptible to hypoxia, although well developed mechanisms of defense against hypoxia exist during the fetal life. The mechanisms underlying SIDS include neurologically compromised infants who are deprived of compensatory mechanisms during sleep, sustaining a hypoxic insult with alterations in neurotransmitter receptors within the regions involved in chemoreception and cardiovascular control. Changes in the brain result from perinatal prolonged hypoxia (persistent reticular pathways in the pons and medulla, astroglia in the brainstem, gliosis of brain nerve nuclei, defects in neurotransmitter receptors, neuronal apoptosis, microthrombosis, and hypoxic ischemic lesion). Hypoxic perinatal risk factors for SIDS included passive and active exposure to cigarette smoking in pregnancy, abuse of drugs, alcohol, coffee and medication in pregnancy, intrauterine growth retardation, perinatal hypoxia with or without resuscitation, preeclampsia, anemia in pregnancy, prematurity, multiparity, multiple pregnancy, pregnant women aged < 20 years and > 35 years, cardiocirculatory, pulmonary and endocrine diseases in pregnancy, and short time interval between two pregnancies. As cigarette smoking has been demonstrated to lead to fetoplacental insufficiency, which result in fetal hypoxia, it is concluded that hypoxia is a precondition for the occurrence of SIDS. Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke decreases maternal red blood cell count, and concentrations of tyrosine and selenium, reduces fetal and neonatal cerebral blood flow, and increases maternal MCV, leukocytosis, especially neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes, maternal and fetal heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, resistance index in umbilical artery, fetal hemoglobin, cytokine, serotonine, dopamine, catecholamine, hypoxanthine, endorphin and interleukin-6. Pregnancy at a risk of hypoxia, especially in heavy smokers, is a major risk factor for SIDS, and such pregnancy requires close and intensive antenatal monitoring.",

A common condition impacting not only the teeth but gumjawbone complex, temporal mandibular joint, muscles, tendons, ligaments and softtissues of the oral cavity is that of “gnashing of teeth.” We in the honorable art and science of dentistry call this condition bruxism, tapping, jiggling or extra-oral movements (parafunctional habits) that may impede breathing, influence headache, or other super-pectoral painful conditions such as neuropathies. After 55 years of practice I have observed a huge rise in these condition in the past ten to fifteen years. Oral Bruxism condition is associated with snoring, clapping of teeth, airway compromise, and their attending effects—loss of sleep, quality of sleep as well as emotional implications. Upper Airway Resistance Syndrome (UARS) is the condition identified from a medical view and, related to snoring, grinding of teeth, tapping, jiggling and has led many to devices such as an electrical stimulator called “Inspire” (figure 2.) which is alleged as an alternative to Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP—see figure 1.) that works inside your body while you sleep. It’s a small electrical device placed during a same-day, outpatient procedure below the collar bone that monitors breathing and stimulates the tongue to reposition for better breathing, hopefully. Obstructive sleep apnea is the most common form of sleep apnea and occurs when the throat muscles relax and block the airway during sleep. Of course, this is theory with some facts in logic, in my humble opinion. About 18 million American adults have moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea.Another approach in resolution of these condition are oral positioners as shown below, Figure 3 below. All of these devices are made of hard plastics that may cause more harm than good in my experience and estimation. They are often of novel colors to encourage acceptance of their many designs.

      "title": "L'IRM cérébrale: un outil pour la compréhension de la dyslexie de développement",
      "abstract": "Developmental dyslexia is a frequently diagnosed reading disorder, found in 4-10% of the population, characterised by reading difficulty despite normal intelligence and educational opportunities. A large and methodologically diverse body of literature suggests that the origins of developmental dyslexia are biological, but the exact nature of the underlying mechanisms remains under debate. Several neurobehavioural studies support the view that an in phonological processing, namely in segmenting and manipulating the language constituents, is the core deficit of dyslexia. Other studies focus on possible visual deficits in dyslexia, particularly on a subsystem of the visual pathways (magnocellular theory of dyslexia). Finally, it has been found that dyslexics present difficulties in processing brief stimuli in rapid sequences. This temporal processing impairment theory of dyslexia encompasses several systems (visual, auditive, motor) and could account for the phonological deficits, the visual deficits as well as other symptoms often associated with dyslexia. The relative contribution of the deficits underlined by these three principal hypotheses in the aetiology of dyslexia remains unknown and needs further investigation. This paper reviews, in light of these cognitive hypotheses, the neurobiological results provided by selected structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. MRI offers a high spatial resolution and contrast, without the risk of radiation exposure. It has therefore become the preferred imaging technique for children and adolescents. The two goals of this review are (1) to demonstrate how MRI studies contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying developmental dyslexia and (2) to update clinicians on the methodological issues pertaining to image acquisition and analysis, promoting critical reading of future MRI studies. Historically, neuropathological studies were the first to lay claim for a neurological basis of dyslexia. These postmortem analyses on a small number of dyslexic subjects revealed microscopic cortical anomalies as well as abnormal patterns of hemispheric asymmetry. Their results, even if controversial, suggested a possible abnormality in dyslexics' prenatal brain development and inspired the subsequent in vivo imaging studies. Though initial studies pointed to a pathological rightward asymmetry or symmetry of the planum temporale (superior surface of the lobe, related to language functions), recent findings suggest more subtle differences regarding the tissue composition of the lobe as well as a more widespread variation in neuroanatomy. Several functional imaging studies provide converging evidence that a disruption in multiple cortical regions impairs the dyslexics during reading. Specifically, underactivation of a left posterior cortical region (temporo-parieto-occipital cortex) has been observed among different dyslexic populations during phonological tasks. Moreover, an overactivation of the homologous regions in the right hemisphere and the inferior frontal gyrus was attributed to a compensating strategy in the dyslexic group. It has been hypothesised that a deficit of connectivity between these cortical regions could be an additional neural basis for dyslexia.",

This chapter provides a discussion of assessment and intervention for disorders of consciousness. Assessment of severe arousal disorders includes behavioral assessment that is guided by structured instruments, such as neurobehavioral rating scales and individualized quantitative behavioral assessment (IQBA). Treatment strategies may vary based on the level of acuity of injury, duration of symptoms of arousal disorders, and availability of institutional resources. Brain trauma, infections, metabolic disturbances, and/or exposure to anesthesia or certain types of medications often results in persistent impairments in ability to focus, sustain attention, and consciously access information about oneself and the environment. These disorders are characterized by intact arousal periods punctuated by confusion secondary to impairments in the ability to attend, process, and encode information.",

Diagnostic procedure for insomnia should include evaluation of sleep–wake behaviour and sleep history, as well as questions about somatic and mental disorders, anamnesis of medication and other substances used, physical examination, sleep questionnaires and sleep diaries, and additional measures. Sleep diaries or actigraphy can be used to evaluate sleep–wake schedules or circadian rhythm disorders. Polysomnography is recommended when other sleep disorders (periodic limb movement disorder, sleep apnea or narcolepsy) are suspected, also for treatment-resistant insomnia. Cognitive behavioural therapy is recommended as the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia in adults of any age. A pharmacological intervention can be offered if cognitive behavioural therapy is not effective or not available. Benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists are effective for short-term treatment of insomnia. Long-term treatment of insomnia with benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists is not recommended. Sedating antidepressants are effective for short-term insomnia treatment. Antihistaminics and antipsychotics are not recommended for insomnia treatment because of insufficient evidence. Melatonin is not recommended for the treatment of insomnia because of low efficacy.

      "abstract": "textabstractBij kinderen met een verstandelijke beperking verwacht je een verhoogd risico op visuele verwerkingsproblemen door hun hersenschade of hersenontwikkelingsstoornis. Hierbij hoeft er op oogheelkundig niveau geen pathologie aanwezig te zijn, wat in de huidige kliniek cerebrale visuele inperking (CVI) wordt genoemd. CVI kan tot uiting komen in stoornissen van de visuele functies die leiden tot perceptie, de zogenoemde hogere visuele functies. Voorbeelden van hogere visuele functies zijn het detecteren van beweging, het herkennen van vormen en ruimtelijke orientatie. Huidige diagnostiek van hogere visuele dysfuncties, en dus CVI, vindt plaats door middel van neuropsychologische testmethodes. Het nadeel van deze testmethodes is dat zij alleen inzetbaar zijn bij kinderen met een ontwikkelingsleeftijd >4 jaar. Dit betekent dat hogere visuele functies bij kinderen met een verstandelijke beperking, maar ook bij gezonde kinderen <4 jaar met een typische ontwikkeling, tot op heden niet of moeilijk getest kunnen worden. Het gevolg is dat de prevalentie van CVI in deze groepen waarschijnlijk onderschat wordt en dat kinderen mogelijk niet de juiste visuele ondersteuning en stimulatie krijgen.\nIn de huidige praktijk is het bestuderen van oogbewegingen en kijkgedrag een directe manier om visuele verwerking en oogmotoriek te beoordelen. Een vertraagde visuele verwerking wordt als een verhoogd risico op CVI gezien en het beoordelen van oogbewegingen kan dus worden gebruikt als een screeningsmethode voor CVI. Het nadeel is echter dat dit is gebaseerd op observaties zonder kwantitatieve uitkomstmaat. Voor dit proefschrift wordt er daarom voor het eerst gebruik gemaakt van een geautomatiseerde methode, waarbij oogbewegingen objectief worden gemeten. Op een tv scherm worden visuele stimuli gepresenteerd, terwijl infrarood camera’s de oogbewegingen detecteren. Instructies en feedback van de deelnemer zijn niet nodig, waardoor ook kinderen met een verstandelijke beperking kunnen worden onderzocht. Op basis van oogbewegingreacties kan er onderscheid worden gemaakt tussen normale visuele verwerking, vertraagde visuele verwerking en stoornissen in de oogmotoriek.\nDe resultaten van deze studie laten zien dat er een verhoogd risico bestaat van visuele verwerkingsproblematiek bij kinderen met een verstandelijke beperking, waarvan de ernst toeneemt met de mate van de verstandelijke beperking. Daarbij bestaat er een verscheidenheid aan visuele dysfuncties binnen deze groep. Kinderen met een ontwikkelingsstoornis en/of verstandelijke beperking zouden op jonge leeftijd al moeten worden gescreend en zo nodig naar onderzoekcentra voor slechtzienden worden verwezen voor verder onderzoek.",

These features occur whether or not the individual has an intellectual disability and are typically present in early childhood, though they may be masked by parental support or compensations. Intellectual disability, language impairment, academic deficits, and movement disorders are common,4 and mental and behavioural disorders are found in up to 70%.5 The presence of all these factors, as well as sensory sensitivities, constipation, sleep and eating problems, and behaviour that challenges, add considerably to the impact on the child or young person, their family, and professionals in health and social care and education. This article summarises the most recent joint recommendations from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Social Care Institute for Excellence (SCIE) on managing autism in children and young people.6 NICE recommendations are based on systematic reviews of the best available evidence and explicit consideration of cost effectiveness.

Communication impairment is the initial and dominant symptom of the primary progressive aphasias (PPA), or so-called language-led dementias. There are three currently recognised PPA syndromes (Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011), which are characterized by different profiles: fluent speech with semantic breakdown, non-fluent speech with agrammatism, and impaired repetition with phonologic errors. However, non-primary progressive communication difficulties also arise in many neurodegenerative diseases, occurring in conditions such as early-onset typical Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD)(Imamura et al., 1998), Parkinson’s disease (PD)(Liu et al., 2015), Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (Teichman et al., 2013), Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA)(Crutch et al., 2013), and the atypical parkinsonism Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) (Burrell et al., 2018) and Cortico-basal Syndrome (CBS) (McMonagle et al., 2006). Although clinically significant for patients and families, these symptoms are often overlooked in favour of more prominent non-language cognitive or motor deficits. Language impairments in these conditions arise to a variable degree and severity but present an overlapping continuum of profiles with the three classic PPA types. In recognising these commonalities arises the potential to use knowledge gained from the treatment and support of people with PPA to assist those living with secondary communication disorders. Methods. This paper aims to put forward the contemporary evidence in the field of language impairment in non-PPA neurodegenerative conditions and encourage further research into the current gaps in knowledge. Databases will be systematically searched and studies identified. Data will be collated and charted according to a methodological framework to conduct scoping reviews. Results will be presented on the progressive communication decline in EOAD, PD, DLB, PCA, PSP and CBS, identifying and mapping current evidence. Particular focus will be placed on the cognitive and linguistic characteristics of the communication impairment of these patient groups, to isolate the language-led communication elements from non-language ones, like voice and motor speech. In a second section, this piece of work will review the value of analysing speech errors, in the context of connected speech production, to characterize and adequately describe the heterogeneity of language deficits across phenotypes. We will discuss its value for research and clinical purposes, in advancing the understanding of these communication impairments, leading to improvements in the current provision of care. Lastly, this paper will elaborate on why recent developments in the non-pharmacological treatment and psychosocial management of PPA may potentially benefit people living with non-primary progressive language deficits. We will draw on the evidence produced in recent years on the effectiveness of interventions for PPA including lexical retrieval and motor speech production strategies, script training, training on the use of AAC, communication partner training and psychosocial interventions that have the potential of being delivered online.

      "title": "Sensory Processing Phenotypes in Fragile X Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that causes intellectual disability. It is a leading known genetic cause of autism. In addition to cognitive, social, and communication deficits, humans with FXS demonstrate abnormal sensory processing including sensory hypersensitivity. Sensory hypersensitivity commonly manifests as auditory, tactile, or visual defensiveness or avoidance. Clinical, behavioral, and electrophysiological studies consistently show auditory hypersensitivity, impaired habituation to repeated sounds, and reduced auditory attention in humans with FXS. Children with FXS also exhibit significant visuospatial impairments. Studies in infants and toddlers with FXS have documented impairments in processing texture-defined motion stimuli, temporal flicker, perceiving ordinal numerical sequence, and the ability to maintain the identity of dynamic object information during occlusion. Consistent with the observations in humans with FXS, fragile X mental retardation 1 ( Fmr1) gene knockout (KO) rodent models of FXS also show seizures, abnormal visual-evoked responses, auditory hypersensitivity, and abnormal processing at multiple levels of the auditory system, including altered acoustic startle responses. Among other sensory symptoms, individuals with FXS exhibit tactile defensiveness. Fmr1 KO mice also show impaired encoding of tactile stimulation frequency and larger size of receptive fields in the somatosensory cortex. Since sensory deficits are relatively more tractable from circuit mechanisms and developmental perspectives than more complex social behaviors, the focus of this review is on clinical, functional, and structural studies that outline the auditory, visual, and somatosensory processing deficits in FXS. The similarities in sensory phenotypes between humans with FXS and animal models suggest a likely conservation of basic sensory processing circuits across species and may provide a translational platform to not just develop biomarkers but also to understand underlying mechanisms. We argue that preclinical studies in animal models of FXS can facilitate the ongoing search for new therapeutic approaches in FXS by understanding mechanisms of basic sensory processing circuits and behaviors that are conserved across species.",

Uma disfuncao invisivel e que passa despercebida para o paciente e, por vezes, para os profissionais que o acompanham, e a perda da sensibilidade. A referida perda tem consequencias no desempenho motor pois sem o feed-back sensorial torna-se dificil realizar movimentos delicados ou coordenados. E a disfuncao sensorial pode agravar os problemas de negligencia do lado afetado, uma vez que o paciente nao sente o lado acometido, “abandonando” o uso da mao comprometida. Uma das grandes dificuldades da familia e cuidadores e com relacao as disfuncoes apresentadas pelo paciente e como realizar as atividades para que o mesmo alcance independencia nas tarefas cotidianas. As orientacoes dadas pela Terapia Ocupacional no momento da alta hospitalar quanto as atividades da vida diaria, para recuperacao sensorial e adequacao das atividades em geral, sao bem recebidas pelos familiares. Um acompanhamento sistematico, com novas orientacoes e demonstracoes e de grande valia para reduzir as dificuldades para desempenho das atividades da vida diaria por parte dos pacientes e para minimizar as demandas junto aos cuidadores. Os beneficiarios diretos sao os familiares e mais especificamente os cuidadores dos pacientes que, em geral, sao as esposas/companheiras dos pacientes que ja tem tarefas de cuidados domesticos. Foram beneficiados aproximadamente 30 pessoas e a reducao das demandas por parte dos pacientes foi crucial para qualidade de vida.",

Posture and gait may be compromised by cardiovascular, arthritic, and orthopedic disorders, but are most commonly impaired by neurologic dysfunction. The neurologic disturbances that produce postural and gait abnormalities can be categorized under three headings: (1) afferent or sensory dysfunction, (2) efferent or motor dysfunction, and (3) central or integrative dysfunction.",

Sleep may be disturbed by the aging process, age-related medical conditions or psychiatric conditions. There are two common sleep disorders in this population: obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and restless legs syndrome. Obesity or anatomic changes with aging affecting the upper airway may cause obstructive sleep apneas, which are associated with the development of cardiovascular or neuropsychiatric disorders. Symptoms of restless legs are also prevalent in the elderly, resulting in sleep-onset insomnia or frequent nocturnal awakenings. Since sleep pathology can negatively impact cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric functions, assessment and treatment of the underlying sleep disorders may positively impact a patient's health and quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Summary Sleepwalking and related parasomnias are thought to result from incomplete awakenings out of non‐rapid eye movement (non‐REM) sleep. Non‐REM parasomnia behaviours have been described as unconscious and automatic, or related to vivid, dream‐like conscious experiences. Similarly, some observations have suggested that patients are unresponsive during episodes, while others that they can interact with their surroundings. To better grasp and characterise the full spectrum of consciousness and environmental (dis)connection associated with behavioural episodes, 35 adult patients with non‐REM sleep parasomnias were interviewed in‐depth about their experiences. The level of consciousness during parasomnia episodes was reported to be variable both within and between individuals, ranging from minimal or absent consciousness and largely automatic behaviours (frequently/always present in 36% of patients) to preserved conscious experiences characterised by delusional thinking to varying degrees of specificity (65%), often about impending danger, variably formed, uni‐ or multisensory hallucinations (53%), impaired insight (77%), negative emotions (75%), and variable, but often pronounced, amnesia (30%). Patients described their experiences as a dream scene during which they felt awake (“awake dreaming”). The surroundings were either realistically perceived, misinterpreted (in the form of perceptual illusions or misidentifications of people), or entirely hallucinated as a function of the prevailing delusion. These observations suggest that the level of consciousness, amnesia and sensory disconnection during non‐REM parasomnia episodes is variable and graded. In their full‐fledged expression, non‐REM parasomnia experiences feature several core features of dreams. They therefore represent a valuable model for the study of consciousness, sleep‐related sensory disconnection and dreaming.",

      "title": "Underrated and Underestimated – Deprivation in Dementia. A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Introduction Deprivation is widely known in children and adolescents and means a lack of social, emotional, or sensory stimuli, due to disabilities such as deafness, but also social isolation and reduced parental care. It may cause developmental disorders such as impaired language, motoric and social development. Little is known of the impact of social deprivation in demented patients.Stimulus shielding, which is a widespread option for psychiatric symptoms of dementia such as agitation, vocalization and aggressive behavior may – if frequently used- have similar effects on demented patients. Objectives We report the case of a 71-year-old patient with dementia caused by PSP (Progressive Supranuclear Palsy), who was in inpatient treatment due to continuous undirected vocalizations. She presented with inability to walk, dysarthria, aphasia, and hearing difficulties beside major mnestic impairment. In a prior hospitalization and in her residency, she was frequently isolated from other patients due to loud screaming and vocalizations in terms of stimulus shielding by suspected overstimulation. In order to that, for four months, she developed progressive difficulties to speak, hear, understand, as well as gait disorders. In addition, the vocalizations increased. Methods We rated the symptoms due to deprivation, triggered by lack of mobilization, social experiences, visual, tactile and acoustic stimuli following a vicious circle of anxiety, vocalizations and recurrent isolations. Therefore, a multimodal therapy assessment was implemented, including daily physical therapy, mobilization, basal stimulation, social reintegration and basal conversation training. Results After a few days of high intensity treatment, speech reappeared in form of one- word sentences and proceeded to the ability to have short conversations. Mobility increased, starting from severe gait disorder, including the use of a wheelchair and emerged to the ability of walking up to 50 metres. Additionally, the undirected vocalizations improved and were reduced. In addition, hearing ability improved during the four-week treatment. Conclusions This case highlights the impact of deprivation in demented patients. Especially it shows that these symptoms can be reversible under a high intensity multimodal and multi- professional treatment within a few weeks. Therefore, stimulus shielding, should be carefully evaluated in order to prevent deprivation – and thus deterioration of the symptoms – in demented patients. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "title": "Communication of persons with mental disorders",
      "abstract": "Mental disorders cover a wide spectrum of various diseases, including organic, symptomatic, neurotic, affective diseases, schizophrenic and craziness diseases, mental backwardness and other mental disorders as well as mental disorders and behavioural diseases caused by the use of psychoactive substances, including alcohol, tobacco, drugs and other, traditionally called diseases of addiction. The problems in communication with the persons with mental disorders are often connected with the nature of their disabilities. The psychotic patients have quite developed and saved senses, but they have difficulties in the processing and interpretation of what they hear, see and touch. The speech of the persons with mental disabilities is poor and with a limited vocabulary. it reflects with a disability in the mental processes, emotions and motivation. The face expression of the persons with acute mental disabilities does not match the verbal message, and is usually expressed as illogical thinking processes in the form of illusions an hallucinations. To be able to enable persons with mental disabilities to communicate, we should do the following: • in the communication with the users we have to be patient, with a high level of tolerance and respect towards the personality of the user; • a shorter transfer of communication is better, a shorter exchange, use of simple, short sentences, giving different shapes of social support e.g. organizing different games, walks in nature, collation of the psychical appearance with the purpose to encourage a certain type of interaction; • it is not good to interfere with the hallucinogenic contents of the user and • it’s necessary to understand, accept and support their feelings with the purpose to develop a mutual trust. With the users who have a certain type of communication limitations regarding their abilities it is necessary: • to talk loud and clearly with a certain normal speed with the purpose, the user to understand the content of the message easily; • if we notice that the user has not understood the message we are sending towards him, it is necessary to repeat the message, but use different words; • it is desirable to accept a certain member of the user’s family that would aid as a mediator in the communication of the user and as a source for gaining information; • to check if the user has understood what we’ve told him by the repetition or via short summarizing of the conversational content; • Using other forms of communication (sign language, written messages or pictures); • not to make fast conclusions of what the user is saying, but change of the type of communication (use of additional questions of a closed type - yes or no) and • to motivate the user’s memory, to remind him/her of a certain therapy or a certain event that occurred recently.",

Luria. However, its nature and the mechansim of speech disorders in this form of aphasia are still not clear, despite the theortical and practical significance of this problem. The convened experiments have demonstrated that disorders of such forms of speech as nominating, repeating and understanding in acoustico-mnestic aphasia emerges from visual and acoustical perception and its complicated connections with speech. Disorders of nominative functions of speech are related mainly to defects in the visual sphere, disorders of repeating and partially understanding speech - with the narrowing of the volume of acoustical perception. A possible pathophysiological mechanism of such speech disorders may be a decrease in the brain activity which leads to a substitution of simultaneous processes of perception by successional ones.",

Indications of diminished appetite incorporate not having any desire to eat, inadvertent weight reduction, and not inclination hungry. Eating food may cause you to feel queasy, as though you may upchuck subsequent to eating. Long haul loss of appetite is otherwise called anorexia, which can have a clinical or mental reason. A diminished appetite happens when you want to eat. It might likewise be known as a helpless appetite or loss of appetite. The clinical term for this is anorexia. A wide assortment of conditions can make your appetite decline. These reach among mental and actual diseases. Long haul ailments can cause a deficiency of appetite for a scope of reasons that differ contingent upon the reason. Loss of appetite can be identified with brought down insusceptible framework work, feeling unwell, and having a disturbed stomach",

      "title": "Pharmacological Interventions for Cognitive Dysfunction in Major Depressive Disorder",
      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe, chronic, and recurring mental disorder, which is frequently accompanied by co-occurring mental and somatic illnesses. Compelling evidence indicates that patients with MDD exhibit cognitive impairment encompassing several domains, including but not limited to, executive function, verbal memory, and attention. In addition, cognitive impairment may be evident even during remission and appears to play a major role in the persistence of psychosocial dysfunction (including impairment in workforce). Therefore, several compounds have been tested as putative cognitive enhancers for MDD. Although antidepressant treatment may be associated with modest improvements in some cognitive domains (namely psychomotor speed and delayed recall), evidence thus far remains unclear owing to methodological limitations across clinical trials. These methodological limitations include: (i) lack of adequate screening for cognitive dysfunction at baseline; (ii) the inclusion of samples that were not in remission at baseline; pseudospecificity (i.e. observed effects on cognition could be due to secondary improvement in mood); (iii) cognitive function was not the primary outcome in some trials; and (iv) lack of standardization of cognitive measures employed across studies. Replicated evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicates that vortioxetine and duloxetine may have procognitive effects. Furthermore, data from RCTs suggest that lisdexamfetamine, modafinil, metformin, and erythropoietin may also have beneficial cognitive effects. In conclusion, the achievement of cognitive remission remains an unmet goal in the treatment of MDD. Future research directions, including methodological improvements in the conduct of RCTs targeting MDD-related cognitive dysfunction, are discussed.",

      "title": "Dyslexia: Conceptualization, Assessment, and Intervention",
      "abstract": "Scholars, teachers, clinicians, and the general public have puzzled over the nature and consequences of severe reading (decoding) problems for more than a century. With the advances of genetics, neuroscience, and psychology, we know much about the underlying nature of reading disability. However, we still have much to learn, and fierce debate continues about whether there is a subgroup of poor readers who can, or should, be called dyslexic. This issue has become highly contentious, as gaining the label can bring significant benefits in terms of resourcing, various forms of test and classroom accommodation, and more positive and understanding responses from others. Many clinicians argue that special cognitive tests are needed to identify and diagnose those with dyslexia. These may take the form of general tests of IQ, or measures of more specific cognitive or executive functioning. Despite their popularity, the evidence for the utility of such measures is low, and many of the processes examined are often problematic for all poor readers, not merely the subgroup deemed to have dyslexia. A further difficulty concerns intervention. There is no strong scientific support for the notion that intervention programs designed to improve underlying cognitive processes (e.g., memory processes) can successfully improve the reading accuracy of those who struggle to acquire literacy. Similarly, interventions geared to improve visual or motor functioning have not proven successful, despite often vociferous support from adherents. The only approach that has strong scientific support takes the form of an educational program that utilizes systematic, structured phonics teaching as part of a broader literacy curriculum. This finding applies equally to those who have been diagnosed as dyslexic and those poor readers who haven’t. For this reason, it is unclear how a dyslexia diagnosis helps to inform the nature of subsequent intervention. In establishing effective forms of intervention that can cater for any child who struggles with their reading, it would appear most efficacious to utilize what is known as a “response to intervention” approach. This requires early identification of, and intervention with, all those who are making limited progress. Intervention should only utilize those approaches that have strong scientific support. The nature and extent of additional educational support should be determined on the basis of the progress that is made when additional help is given. If insufficient progress has resulted, it may well be necessary to increase and intensify the intervention. Such an approach helps to ensure that all struggling children are helped at an early stage, and no one is missed because of an absence of parental advocacy or a lack of family resource that can cover the cost of diagnostic assessment.",

El diagnóstico de Trastorno de Evitación y Restricción de la Ingesta de Alimentos, (ARFID, de sus siglas en inglés) fue incluido en el Manual Diagnóstico y Estadístico de Trastornos Mentales, 5ta Edición (DSM-5) el año 2013, como un nuevo diagnóstico dentro de los Trastornos Alimentarios y de Ingesta (TAI) para describir un grupo de pacientes que tienen conductas alimentarias evitativas o restrictivas que no están motivadas por una alteración de la imagen corporal o un deseo de adelgazar. Este trastorno puede manifestarse en una pérdida de peso significativa y/o deficiencia nutricional y/o una marcada interferencia en el funcionamiento psicosocial. Se describen tres formas de presentación que pueden ocurrir en conjunto o de manera independiente: (i) Niños con aversiones sensoriales (selectivos), que rechazan algunas comidas por sus sabores, texturas, olores o formas; (ii) otros que presentan inapetencia, baja ingesta o poco interés en alimentarse (ingesta limitada); (iii) y los que rechazan algunos alimentos o dejan de comer después de un evento traumático asociado (aversivos). Debido a la incorporación reciente del diagnóstico al DSM-5, existe aún escasa evidencia respecto a su enfrentamiento. El propósito de esta revisión es clarificar criterios diagnósticos, y exponer un manejo progresivo de enfrentamiento y tratamiento, con un enfoque multidisciplinario, sin ahondar en la resolución de las causas médicas orgánicas.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Neurogenic stuttering is a subtype of acquired stuttering characterized by speech disfluencies following acquired brain damage. Despite advances, research on neurogenic stuttering remains limited, particularly concerning its pathophysiology and therapy. This study aimed to explore the clinical profile of neurogenic stuttering post cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and document the outcomes of speech-language intervention. The participant, a 51-year-old Malayalam-speaking male sales manager from Calicut, experienced speech difficulties after a left parieto-temporal infarct, presenting with right-sided weakness and heart failure, alongside a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Assessment revealed reduced verbal output, poor clarity, disfluencies, articulatory errors, intact comprehension, but mild deficits in naming and morphosyntax; standardized tests indicated a non-aphasic profile with mild dysarthria and mild stuttering (SSI-4: 23). The therapeutic intervention comprised three phases: Establishment (including gentle onset, continuous phonation, Melodic Intonation Therapy, voluntary stuttering, language/vocal modulation, and relaxation), Transfer (generalization via role-play and self-monitoring), and Maintenance (long-term support). Therapy resulted in reduced disfluencies, enhanced intelligibility, and improved communication attitude, with the client maintaining fluency strategies despite setbacks following a seizure. This case underscores the efficacy of individualized, evidence-based intervention incorporating fluency shaping, prosodic training, counseling, and family involvement in managing neurogenic stuttering post-CVA, while highlighting the need for further holistic research to advance clinical practice and evidence-based care.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Dysphagia refers to the feeling of difficulty in passing food or liquid from the mouth to the stomach and requires rapid neuromuscular coordination not only of the esophagus but also structures in the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx during a brief cessation of respiration. The swallowing mechanism can be separated into three stages: oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal. Disabilities resulting directly from dysphagia may arise secondary to aspiration, and the ongoing risk of aspiration has several consequences: limited oral intake of solid food and liquids, restriction of the diet (eg, to foods of a certain consistency), need for assistance when eating, and discomfort associated with eating. Evaluation usually includes assessment by a speech-language pathologist and often is supplemented by a modified barium swallow or a fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing. The AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment describes the process for evaluating impairment for dysphagia in Chapter 4, The Nervous System, Chapter 9, Ear, Nose, Throat, and Related Structures, and Chapter 10, The Digestive System. Section 9.3b, Mastication and Deglutition, includes information about the relationship of dietary restrictions to permanent impairment. Impairment for dysphagia is determined by considering the underlying cause for the dysphagia, dietary restrictions, feeding requirements, and complications.",

Sociological definitions of chronic illness start with the experience of disruption and impairment. Social definitions of disability start from the lack of societal accommodation to certain individuals’ needs, thereby disadvantaging them and discriminating against them.

      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases progress over three distinct stages: (1) the preclinical stage, at which individuals can be placed on a continuum ranging from completely asymptomatic to a very subtle decline; (2) mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is the symptomatic predementia stage of dementia, characterized by impairment in memory or other domains of cognition; and (3) dementia itself. Dementia is a common condition that mainly occurs in older people. It is characterized by a significant decline of cognitive functioning severe enough to impact activities of daily living and social functioning. The loss of cognitive functioning in dementia may affect long-term and short-term memory, attention, visual perception, executive functions, motor planning and execution, problem-solving, and language. Dementia can be caused by a wide range of pathological entities, among which Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common. Other dementia types include vascular dementia (VaD), dementia in atypical parkinsonian syndromes such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). While these are commonly associated with an impairment of episodic memory, the major forms of dementia are also characterized by deficits of language affecting comprehension and production abilities of words and sentences. Clinical linguistic profiles usually associated with common forms of dementia have been described, some more detailed than others. Neurolinguistic studies also went further than the mere description of symptoms and identified the functional localization of impaired and preserved processing components of the linguistic processing system in dementias. The initial evaluation is the first significant step toward the clinical management of dementia and is based on consensual diagnostic criteria. In some dementia syndromes, such as primary progressive aphasia (PPA), the characterization of language deficits is of major importance for the differential diagnosis of dementia. This article focuses on bibliographic resources related to language and communication disorders in mild cognitive disorders as well as in the most frequent primary progressive syndromes of dementia.",

Furthermore, EDS has been considered a core symptom of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as well as being the main symptom of primary hypersomnias such as narcolepsy types 1 and 2, and idiopathic hypersomnia. Moreover, it can be considered secondary to other sleep disorders (Restless Legs Syndrome, Chronic insomnia, Periodic Limb Movements), psychiatric conditions (Depression, Bipolar Disorder) or a consequence of the intake/abuse of drugs and/or substances.

L’analyse cognitive du fonctionnement des différentes composantes de la mémoire verbale chez des sujets guéris d’un SLK montre des dissociations plaidant en faveur de l’existence de deux composantes de la MCT verbale et d’une mémoire phonologique à long terme. La présence d’une hypoactivation de la partie postérieure du gyrus temporal supérieur chez les sujets ayant les performances de MCT les plus faibles suggère que cette région cérébrale joue un rôle spécifique dans le stockage temporaire de l’information phonologique.",

[2]Also, types of abuse are related to specific psychiatric comorbidity.Sexual abuse is more associated with posttraumatic stress disorder than other kinds of abuse. [3,4]otional intelligence is the ability to recognize the meanings of emotions and their relationships and to use them as a basis for reasoning, problem-solving, and enhancing cognitive activities.Emotional intelligence is comprised of four skills: emotion regulation, emotion recognition in self and others (e.g.reading mind and alexithymia), understanding of emotion, and utilization of emotion to facilitate thinking. [5]Evidence in studies suggests that traumatic experience can rapidly alter brain activation associated with emotional intelligence such as emotion processing. [6]Children with early-life trauma exposure show altered connectivity in brain systems relevant for detecting and processing emotional information and early-life adversity is associated with reorganization of neural circuits in ways that enhance processing of salient emotional stimuli.Altered processing of emotional Objectives: The aim was to investigate the effects of child sexual abuse on emotional intelligence in children with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Also, there is no study assessing the effects of incest on emotional intelligence in children with PTSD after sexual abuse.The current study aimed to assess the effects of incest on emotional intelligence.Methods: This study included 30 female children with sexual abuse, 20 female traffic accident victims with PTSD, and 25 female healthy volunteers as controls.All participants in the study were assessed with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and the reading mind from eyes test (RMET) for children.Results: It was found that the TAS-20 total score was significantly higher in the CSA victims than in controls.Difficulty identifying feelings and difficulty describing feelings subscales scores were higher in the incest group.When the groups were compared regarding total DERS scores, it was found that it was found that the DERS total scale was significantly higher in the CSA victims than in controls while no difference was detected between the CSA victims without incest and the incest group.RMET score was significantly lower in the incest group than in the CSA victims without incest.Conclusion: Sexual abuse disrupts emotional processing in female children.It is important to consider the clinical features of emotion processing that could contribute to PTSD treatment in children with sexual abuse.",

      "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 resulting in COVID-19 has caused a lethal pandemic. Surviving patients can be affected by deficits in various body organs and systems (e.g., lungs, heart, blood circulation) including the brain. Beyond neurological dysfunctions (e.g., stroke, encephalitis, encephalopathy, peripheral nervous system disorders), patients with COVID-19 can be affected by neuropsychological deficits. These deficits can involve (psycho)linguistic processes (i.e., neurolinguistic disorders) or other cognitive processes (i.e., non-neurolinguistic disorders), such as attention, executive functions, and memory. Regarding non-neurolinguistic disorders, most findings suggest the presence of attention and executive deficits. With respect to neurolinguistic disorders, patients can show deficits in spoken language processing (i.e., aphasia) or written language processing (i.e., alexia, agraphia). Nonetheless, many diagnostic and methodological issues should be addressed to explore further the epidemiology (prevalence, incidence, and demography), underpinning neurological causes (stroke, encephalitis/encephalopathy), and types and subtypes of neuropsychological disorders in patients with COVID-19. This chapter examines these issues as part of a wider review of what is currently known about neuropsychological disorders in adults who develop severe COVID-19 infection.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Frontal lobe dysfunction is often invoked as a contributing factor in developmental disorders characterized by chronic maladaptive behavior, but interpretation of relevant neuropsychological findings has been hampered by the limited information available regarding the consequences of focal prefrontal damage early in life. We describe here the long-term behavioral and cognitive sequelae of damage to prefrontal cortex in two young adult patients who had sustained their brain damage prior to 16 months of age. In the context of normal neurological examinations, both cases had remarkable histories of impaired decision making, behavioral dyscontrol, social defects, and abnormal emotion. Performances were primarily normal on a broad range of neuropsychological measures (intellect, memory, language, academic achievement, visual perception, and visuoconstruction), but selective impairments of executive function were evident. Early dysfunction in the prefrontal region may result in severe and chronic social maladjustment despite largely normal cognitive abilities. These findings can help inform neuropsychological evaluation of patients with possible prefrontal dysfunction in the setting of developmental disabilities or early brain trauma.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), alone or in combination with other pathology, is the most common cause of dementia in people over age 65. The defining features of Alzheimer's dementia are progressive deficits in memory and other aspects of cognition, typically including language, praxis, visual and spatial processing, and executive function at some point during the course of the illness. Noncognitive phenomena, including apathy and unawareness, are important contributors to the burden of disease. At the same time, elemental neurological function, and therefore the general neurological exam, is usually normal, although paratonia and/or myoclonus may be present. These deficits result in reduced ability to perform daily activities, and most Alzheimer's dementia patients will become totally dependent on others unless they die of other causes first. The clinical presentation of Alzheimer's dementia is the result of synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss that follow a predictable distribution in the brain. The hippocampus, limbic cortex, and polymodal association cortex sustain the greatest damage. Dysfunction in these regions results in the characteristic clinical pattern of Alzheimer's dementia and assists in its clinical differentiation from other dementing illnesses, which follow different anatomical patterns of neuronal dysfunction.",

It is the most frequent reason for referring children to mental health services. Core symptoms of AD/HD (inattention, impulsivity, hyperactivity) present behaviors that parents may rate in standardized questionnaires (e.g., does not study, memory problems, cannot concentrate, cannot stay still, has no motives, etc.), are also present in other developmental or psychiatric disorders (e.g., specific learning difficulties, sensory modulation disorder, mood or anxiety disorders, autistic spectrum disorders). This may cause errors in the differential diagnosis if clinicians do not add objective measures of cognitive deficits associated with each disorder. AD/HD presents neuropsychological deficits (compared to non-clinical populations) that are also present in other disorders, like deficient working memory, whereas other neuropsychological deficits are unique characteristics of AD/HD, such as sustained attention, response inhibition, and variability of response time. Likewise, anxiety disorders present neuropsychological deficits in autobiographical memory, mood disorders present neuropsychological deficits in processing speed and verbal memory. Neuropsychological tests such as the Continuous Performance Test, tests of reading phonetic decoding, and others, may improve the accuracy of differential diagnosis, differentiating AD/HD from other disorders, or revealing the comorbidity of AD/HD with other disorders.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are sleep-related abnormal behaviors. They are frequent and overlooked causes of nocturnal disruptive behavior in the elderly, especially when patients are cognitively impaired. Confusion and violence can result in sleep disruption, injuries for the patients or their bed partners, caregivers distress, and they can be a motive for institutionalization. Parasomnias include the NonREM sleep disorders of arousal (sleepwalking, sleep terrors, confusional arousals and sleep-related eating disorder), the REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and more rarely the parasomnia overlap syndrome, which associates both NREM and REM parasomnias. Patients with NREM sleep parasomnias are confused, eyes open, with a glazed look during their nocturnal behaviors, and they have a post-episode amnesia. They shout and bolt from the bed (night terrors), look about in a confused manner, walk and speak (sleepwalking), and eat peculiar or inedible food (sleep-related eating disorders). These behaviors, which are frequent in young adults, may be triggered by short-half live hypnotics in elderly. During the parasomnia, the brain is partially awake (enough to perform complex motor and verbal action), and partially asleep (without conscious awareness or responsibility). RBD is characterized by a loss of the normal muscle atonia that accompanies REM sleep. Patients have excessive motor activity such as punching, kicking, or crying out in association with dream content. RBD are frequent in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies and may precede the cognitive or motor symptoms of these diseases by 5 to 10 years. RBD can also be promoted by antidepressants. When combined with thorough clinical interviews, the video-polysomnography is a powerful tool, especially for discriminating the parasomnia from nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, sleep apneas and periodic leg movements. Ensuring safety and withdrawing deleterious treatments are useful in patients with violent activities, potential injurious or bothersome to other household members. Clonazepam and melatonin (3-12 mg) are highly effective for treating RBD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: - Fatigue can be defined as an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained exhaustion that makes it harder to carry out activities and function Fatigue describes a state of tiredness or exhaustion. Fatigue is an important symptom in academics due to its association with physical, psychological and social problems and the employee health, performance, safety and general workability continues to grow. Research has shown that fatigue may result from some health and work-related factors, particularly a poor health status, long work hours and extended-duration work shifts. INTRODUCTION: - Fatigue is a state of physical or mental weariness, often accompanied by a reduced capacity to perform tasks effectively. It is characterized by a sensation of tiredness, exhaustion, and a lack of energy, which can result from various factors, including prolonged physical or mental exertion, insufficient rest or sleep, illness, stress, and other physical or psychological conditions. The need for a study aimed to investigate the prevalence of fatigue in female academicians by using a reliable self-completion tool that can measure subjective condition, either in extreme clinical cases or in routine day-to-day functioning, has never been greater. METHODOLOGY: - An observational study was conducted in Ahmadabad city. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee. The Chalder Fatigue Scale was used to assess symptoms of fatigue. Questioner method was used to collect data. Each question was scored by female academicians. Sample size of hundred participants including the female academicians. RESULT: - The result was carried out by using Microsoft excel 2016. Out of hundred sample size 38% middle aged female academicians had fatigue. The mean age was 34.43 years. CONCLUSION: - This study concludes that there is need to reduce fatigue among the female academicians. Clinical implementation: - There is a need to plan a proper treatment protocol and advice for female academicians to reduce the fatigue. Key words: Chadler Fatigue Scale, Female Academicians, Fatigue.",

A correspondence is often found between the personality of the child, (a conscientious attitude) and family relations. The families seem quite normal, but often have high expectations of their children, are sensitive to social stigmatization and have an underlying anxiety for health problems. A model is often found for the child's symptoms. Symptoms may be precipitated by an infection or a physical trauma. Sexual abuse is sometimes discovered.

Influencing surgical patients in all age bunches over the short term, cognitive dysfunction shows days or weeks after surgery and shows quicker determination in more youthful populations, in spite of the fact that it might be perpetual. Generally, communicated by patients as another powerlessness to finish once effectively feasible tasks, signs include trouble staying concentrated on an errand, failure to multitask, trouble discovering words and reviewing information recently obtained. In more extreme cases, post-operative cognitive dysfunction can bring about a calamitous loss of cognitive capacity, with related expanded mortality, danger of rashly leaving work, and reliance on social welfare.",

      "abstract": "Le vieillissement de la population est en constante augmentation, ce qui va indeniablement avoir un impact sur les besoins de soins de la population, notament les besoins en lien avec l'audition. Le phenomene de perte de l'audition, nomme presbyacousie, se caracterise par une chute selective dans les frequences aigues. Il prive ceux qui en sont atteints de la comprehension de la parole, influe sur la qualite de la communication et par consequent contribue au phenomene de desocialisation. Les maladies de la memoire, telles la maladie d'Alzheimer sont frequentes dans le grand âge et ont egalement des consequences prejudiciables sur les liens sociaux. Ces maladies sont moins frequentes chez les personnes âgees dont la memoire est stimulee grâce aux capteurs sensoriels, fournisseurs privilegies d'informations au cerveau. C'est pourquoi la stimulation et le maintien de l'audition en eveil sont tres importants chez les personnes âgees, afin de conserver les fonctions intellectuelles en etat d'activite. Car on vit de plus en plus vieux, et nos contemporains âges veulent vivre cette periode de la vie de mieux en mieux, et avec le plus de bonheur possible. Ils expriment une exigence de maintien de qualite de vie. Dans une premiere partie, nous avons traite du vieillissement de l'individu dans sa dimension globale : physiologique, psychique, sociale, ainsi que du vieillissement cerebral, tout en soutenant l'idee qu'il est possible a l'individu de vieillir en maintenant ses capacites plus longtemps. En informant sur l'importance de l'appareillage precoce, en apportant des soins adaptes pour stimuler les fonctions auditives et pour conserver les sens, l'Audioprothesiste est un acteur privilegie d'un meilleur vieillissement. La seconde partie porte sur le coeur du sujet : connaissances theoriques sur la presbyacousie, son diagnostic, sa prise en charge, ses consequences. Elle decrit egalement la memoire. En s'appuyant sur des etudes de reference, elle fait le lien entre la perte auditive et les troubles mnesiques. Enfin la troisieme partie, constituee de notre enquete, menee au sein de dix maisons de retraite et aupres de 36 personnes âgees, analyse les resultats des tests mesurant : la fonction auditive grâce a un audiogramme tonal liminaire, les fonctions mnesiques grâce aux tests des Cinq Mots de Dubois, de l'Empan chiffre et du Mini-Mental State (MMS), le niveau de socialisation des personnes testees a travers un questionnaire. Nous avons cherche a confirmer (ou a infirmer) l'hypothese suivante : Les pertes mnesiques sont-elles plus frequemment retrouvees chez les personnes âgees souffrant de presbyacousie avec gene sociale et de facon corollaire, entrainent-elles un risque de desocialisation ? Notre etude, de par les resultats statistiques et les scores obtenus a la quasi-totalite des tests mnesiques et au questionnaire, a permis de repondre oui. Elle a mis en evidence le lien entre pertes de l'audition, pertes mnesiques et une coupure avec le monde et converge vers l'interet de l'appareillage precoce.",

Patients may present predominantly with problems in naming and understanding words, or in face and object recognition, the verbal or nonverbal predominance reflecting the accent of atrophy on the left or right temporal lobe. Behavioural changes may occur, although these have a more obsessional quality than is typically seen in frontotemporal dementia (FTD). However, overlap in clinical symptomatology of semantic dementia and FTD may occur with disease progression reinforcing the link between these clinical syndromes. Semantic dysfunction is poorly recognized and may be mistaken for the amnesia of Alzheimer’s disease, yet may be important in explaining some of the behavioural characteristics seen in focal cerebral degeneration.",

      "abstract": "Executive function is a higher order cognitive capacity that involves memory, perception and performance of complex tasks. Disorders of the executive functions are sign of lesions in the prefrontal cortex, involving the prefrontal-striatal-thalamic networks and the parietal association areas. According to signs and localization, five basic prefrontal syndromes are recognised. 1. Damage in posterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and subcortical nuclei causes the dorsolateral syndrome with impaired decision making, working memory and planning. 2. The ventromedial-orbitofrontal syndrome: if lesion spares the basal forebrain, memory can be preserved, but poor social decision making develops. 3. The dorsomedial syndrome consists of attention disorder, akinesia, mutism and apathy. 4. The bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal regions serve perception of self and environment. 5. The ventral lateral (verbalizer) area of the dominant hemisphere coordinates language. Executive impairments can be found in cerebrovascular, Parkinson's and other diseases of basal ganglia, and in frontotemporal lobar degeneration. The dorsolateral syndrome can be examined by the use of Wisconsin card sorting test, self ordered pointing task and the delayed response task. Prefrontal-basal function can be assessed by Gambling-, Faux Pas-, and Emotion identification tasks.1. A dysexecutive syndrome does not fulfil the criteria of dementia. 2. A \"frontal syndrome\" is an indefinite eponym. Focal lesions in prefrontal systems lead to localization-specific symptoms, which can be defined by psychometric tests. 3. In neurological diseases associated with multifocal damage of the brain neuropsychologic tests may help to determine strategic lesions, which are responsible for the actual syndromes.",

      "title": "Intelligence and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder",
      "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder abbreviated as ADHD is a neurobehavioural, chronic and developmental disorder which starts in infancy and continues upto adulthood. Main symptoms of ADHD-described in ICD 10 & DSM IV-TR are difficulty in staying focused and in paying attention i.e. inattention, difficulty in controlling behaviour i.e. impulsivity and hyperactivity or overactivity. Other observed behaviours in ADHD which leads to impairment in social, emotional and behavioural skills are social clumsiness, poor co-ordination, mood swings, distractibility, impaired responses, excessive restlessness and specific learning disabilities such as dyslexia, language problems, difficulties with handwriting/written work. Perceived negative effect on ADHD child's life would be noticed very well at home, in schools, in relationship, at work and within community.Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan of the brain of ADHD children show that certain brain areas have less blood flow and less activity and certain brain regions viz. prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, temporal grey matter, caudate nucleus and cerebellum are 3 percent to 4 percent smaller than the brain regions of children without ADHD. Due to difference in brain activity and brain structure, child suffering with ADHD finds difficulty in execution of problemsolving, reasoning etc. and minor abnormalities are perceived in their planning, attention and concentration, motor activity, impulse control and inhibition (Castellanos and Swanson, 2002; Hill, et al., 2003). PET and MRI scanning prove that right brain of ADHD child is active and controls left brain. The left brain is the thinking side (i.e. inhibitory) while the right brain is the doing side (i.e. activating). Due to right brain excess, the unusual pattern of behaviour is displayed by ADHD children and due to left brain immaturity, lack of learning is found in ADHD children (Levin, 2009).As long as prevalence rate of ADHD in India is considered, latest survey conducted by Associated Chambers of Commerce & Industry (ASSOCHAM) for the years 2005 to 2011 in 10 major cities of India namely Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Chandigarh, Jaipur and Lucknow revealed that there has been over 175 percent increase in ADHD between the age group of 3 to 17 years. Prevalence of children diagnosed with ADHD has gone up from 4 percent to 11 percent in the last six years. The survey also revealed that ADHD in children with symptoms of absent-mindedness and extra-activeness is on the rise especially in cities and metros. The survey has further revealed that ADHD prevalence has increased among boys from 6 percent to 11 percent, while among girls it rose to 5.5 percent from 2 percent over the last six years. ADHD was seen more among boys than girls (report published in Daiji World, 2012). The reason might be the male hormone testosterone which boosts the right brain hemisphere, which is why boys with ADHD with dominated right brain tend to do rather than think (Garcia, et al., 1997; Levin, 2009). The male-female ratio of ADHD children ranged from 2:1 to 9:1 (Lee, et al., 2008; Verma & Kushwaha, 2014).Early identification of ADHD is very important for healthy personality development and excellence in life. Hence present study was an attempt to identify children with ADHD among school-going children of Kanpur city. Greater incidence of the disorder among boys than girls would be found and may need to be taken into account.There are several misconceptions and misinterpretations about ADHD regarding intelligence. Many researchers have found that a child suffering with ADHD were having a lower IQ or below average IQ (Kaplan, et. al., 2000; Kuntsi, et al., 2003; Poonima, 2011). On the contrary, a report by Yale University (2008) revealed that three out of four ADHD invididuals with an IQ higher than 120 were found to be placed in top 9 percent individuals in the United States, though significant impairments in their memory and cognitive functioning have been perceived when compared to people with similar IQ who do not suffer from the disorder. …",

Assessment of a child with failure to thrive includes a comprehensive history and a thorough physical examination. Some basic laboratory screening tests may be helpful in the evaluation.

Based on twenty‐two cases, 2.5–48 years old, we describe the neurological features and evolution. In the neonatal and infantile age there was hypotonia, muscular weakness, developmental retardation, diminishing tendon reflexes and alternating esotropia. Preschool and early school age was characteristized by progressive polyneuropathy with muscular weakness and contractures, extrapyramidal signs (ataxia, dyskinesia, dysequilibrium), psychomotor retardation (I.Q. level of 40–60), transient stroke‐like episodes and retinitis pigmentosa. In puberty and adulthood the condition was rather stationary. They learned at best to walk with support, understand the spoken word well, and a few developed a fairly good linguistic skill.

      "title": "Language Processing in Parkinson's Disease Patients Without Dementia",
      "abstract": "One of the major pathophysiological features in Parkinson’s disease, from now on referred to as PD, is the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, which in turn results in dysfunction of the cortico-striato-cortical circuits (Bartels & Leenders, 2009). In PD the components of the cortico-striato-cortical circuits are not in an optimal interaction, leading to insufficient engagement of for example the frontal and prefrontal lobes. Motor symptoms of tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity are the clinical hallmark of PD (Wolters & Bosboom, 2007), however, non-motor symptoms are often present (Dubois & Pillon, 1995, 1997). In particular cognitive impairments in the domain of executive functioning have frequently been observed, both in late and also in very early stages of PD (Muslimovic et al., 2005). The term ‘executive functioning’ is used as a blanket term referring to a set of abilities that allow individuals to achieve goal-oriented behavior. These aspects of behavior can be regarded as top-down processes, in contrast to bottom-up processes that only represent stimulus-driven processing. Strauss et al. (2006) defined executive functioning as a collection of processes that are responsible for guiding, directing, and managing cognitive, emotional and behavioral functions, particularly during active, novel problem solving. As PD progresses, more severe cognitive impairments or dementia can occur (Aarsland et al., 2003). The dementia in PD exhibits normal or only slightly decreased performance in gnosis and praxis functions, and is typically characterized by a progressive dysexecutive syndrome with disturbed memory functions and attention (Dubois & Pillon, 1997). In addition, it has repeatedly been shown that language functions in PD patients with dementia are affected. Demented PD patients show reduced verbal fluency, poor confrontation naming abilities, decreased word list generation, and difficulties in wordfinding (Dubois & Pillon, 1997; Pahwa et al., 1998). However, prior to dementia, PD patients also evidence subtle language impairments. The question whether the language system itself is impaired, as for example in aphasia, or whether language performance is disrupted because of non-linguistic executive function disorders in PD is still unanswered. We assume that, intact executive functioning is a prerequisite for normal language functioning. Therefore, language processing deficits in PD will always be associated with executive function deficits. Under this view, the language faculty is not considered to be totally modular in nature, but thought to depend on other cognitive functions, since, for example, comprehending a sentence demands that a listener flexibly guides his/her attention to relevant linguistic information, maintains information in working memory during the",

Such forces disrupt normal cellular processes in the brain. Concussions are seen in all age, gender and ethnic groups but, because they are commonly sustained during sports and recreational activities, they have frequently been described in children. The estimated incidence of sports-related concussions in the USA ranges from 300000 to 3.8 million annually. 2 Estimating incidence is difficult because sports-related concussions frequently go undetected due to a lack of recognition of symptoms or intentional underreporting of symptoms. 34 Symptoms include physical complaints (eg, headache, fatigue, dizziness, noise intolerance), behavioural changes (eg, mood swings, depression, anxiety, irritability) and cognitive impairment (eg, inability to concentrate, decreased memory). While initial symptoms typically resolve in several days to occasionally several months after the injury, 5e8 in 10e15% these symptoms can persist much longer. Because of the heterogeneity of these injuries and their recovery, as well as the recognition that the length of time until symptoms resolve is more important clinically than the type of symptoms, grading scales and classification schemes have been abandoned.

Such activities mayincludemorephysicallystrenuousgameplayforathletes,but also simply the cognitive exercise of classwork for students or work for adults.

Yet, oral health is in a two-way relationship with overall health-a weakened status triggering a decline in the quality of life. Here, we aim at giving a comprehensive overview of oral health disorders in PD, while identifying their etiologies and consequences. The physical (abnormal posture, muscle tone, tremor, and dyskinesia), behavioral (cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders), and iatrogenic patterns associated with PD have an overall detrimental effect on patients' oral health, putting them at risk for other disorders (infections, aspiration, pain, malnutrition), reducing their quality of life and increasing their isolation (anxiety, depression, communication issues). Interdisciplinary cooperation for prevention, management and follow-up strategies need to be implemented at an early stage to maintain and improve patients' overall comfort and condition. Recommendations for practice, including (non-)pharmacological management strategies are discussed, with an emphasis on the neurologists' role. Of interest, the oral cavity may become a valuable tool for diagnosis and prognosis in the near future (biomarkers).

      "title": "On the pleasurable, motivational and cognitive aspects of social play behavior: pharmacological studies in rats",
      "abstract": "In comparison to naturally rewarding behaviors such as feeding and sex, relatively little is known about the neurobiological underpinnings of the positive emotional properties of social behavior. In the period between weaning and sexual maturity (i.e. childhood and adolescence in humans, roughly equivalent to the juvenile and adolescent stages in rodents) substantial changes occur in brain and behavior that are important for behavioral development. In particular, the social repertoire becomes increasingly complex and social interest shifts from the mother towards peers, mostly in the form of social play behavior. Social play behavior serves to facilitate social, physical, emotional and cognitive development. Understanding how social play behavior is generated and which brain areas and neurotransmitter systems modulate this behavior increases our knowledge about normal social behavior. Furthermore, several neuropsychiatric disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs) and autism are characterized by impairments in social (play) behaviors. In addition, drugs of abuse, such alcohol and cocaine are often used in a social setting and this can influence social (play) behavior to a great extent. Furthermore, social disorders such as DBDs and ADHD are an important risk factor for alcohol and drug addiction. Therefore, understanding how drugs of abuse affect social (play) behavior is an important issue. Using operant and place conditioning as well as behavioral analysis of social play behavior in young rats, we aimed to elucidate the neurotransmitter systems and neural substrates underlying the pleasurable, motivational and cognitive aspects of social play behavior. We found that the psychostimulant amphetamine, like methylphenidate, exerts its play suppressant effects via α2-adrenoceptors. In contrast, the psychostimulant cocaine reduces social play by simultaneous increases in dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin neurotransmission. We subsequently found that prefrontal (anterior cingulate and infralimbic cortex) and limbic subcortical (amygdala and habenula) regions are implicated in the effects of methylphenidate on social play, through noradrenergic neurotransmission. Using place conditioning and operant set-ups, we further elucidate the role of monoamines, opioids and cannabinoids in several aspects of social play behavior. With regard to monoamines, noradrenaline seems to modulate the motivation for social play behavior as well as its expression. For dopamine, clear but opposite roles were found on motivational and pleasurable aspects of social play. We found that the endogenous opioid system is involved in pleasurable and motivational aspects of social play, whereas endocannabinoid neurotransmission does not play a primary role in the motivational and pleasurable aspects of social play behavior. By analyzing the dynamics of social reward-related memories in place conditioning experiments, we found that this type of memories undergoes reconsolidation that depends on β-noradrenergic as well as glucocorticoid receptors, whereas mineralocorticoid, NMDA glutamatergic and CB1 cannabinoid receptors do not seem to be involved. Collectively, the studies in this thesis advance our understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in several aspects of social play behavior in rats. These studies provide important information on the neurobiology of normal, adaptive social behavior and may also give directions for the development of pharmacotherapies for social dysfunctions in psychiatric diseases.",

      "abstract": "Las hipoacusias neurosensoriales a pesar de no ser las mas frecuentes son las mas temidas por su repercusion en el desarrollo psicosocial. La entidad clinica conocida como neuropatia auditiva o audicion no sincronizada es un termino utilizado para describir a los pacientes que manifiestan deficit de la audicion, fundamentalmente en la comprension de la palabra, con unos potenciales evocados auditivos del tronco cerebral ausentes o alterados. Por el contrario, las otoemisiones acusticas y los microfonicos cocleares se registran dentro de la normalidad. En este tipo de desorden auditivo, el oido interior o coclea parece recibir los sonidos de manera normal. No obstante, las senales que salen de la coclea pueden estar desorganizadas o puede ser que el nervio auditivo no este procesando el sonido de forma adecuada. Aparentemente la afectacion auditiva compromete al nervio auditivo o a las celulas ciliadas internas y sus sinapsis, comprometiendose su sincronismo. En cambio, las celulas ciliadas externas se encuentran indemnes. Varias son las etiologias implicadas en las neuropatias auditivas, destacandose las enfermedades geneticas, adquiridas (infecciosas, toxicas y metabolicas) e idiopaticas. En este trabajo se hizo una revision en diferentes bases de datos y fuentes de informacion que permitio concluir que esta enfermedad nosologica constituye un nuevo reto para los profesionales, para lo cual es necesario a utilizar mas pruebas diagnosticas con enfasis en el  cruce de resultados para determinar el sitio de lesion. Palabras clave: hipoacusia sensorineural, neuropatia auditiva, emisiones otoacusticas, potenciales evocados auditivos de tallo cerebral ABSTRAC Auditive lost affects the language and emotional development, and the adaptation to the social and familiy enviroment. Those adverse effects can be avoided if the diagnosis, the treatment and the rehabilitation start early. Neurosensorial hypoacusias are not the most frequent ones, but they are the most feared because of their repercussion on the psycho-social development. The clinic entity known as uditive europathy (AN) or no synchronized audition is an used term to describe patients who suffer from lost of audition, mainly in the words comprehension, with the auditive evocated potentials of the brain trunk absent or abnormal, although acustic otoemissions and cochlear microphones are normal. In this type of auditive disorder, the internal ear seems to receive the sounds in a normal way. Howeever, the signals from the cochlea may be unorganized or the auditive nerve might not be processing the sounds in an adequate form. Apparently, the auditive afectation commits the auditive nerve or the internal hair cells and their synapsis, afecting their synchronism. Nevertheless, the external hair cells are harmless. Within the causes of AN, genetic causes, adquired causes (infections, toxic and metabolic causes) and idiopatic AN can be mentioned. Key words: Neurosensorial hipoacusias, Auditive Neuropathy, acustic otoemissions, auditive evocated potentials of the brain trunk.",

      "title": "DSM-5 substance use disorder: how conceptual missteps weakened the foundations of the addictive disorders field",
      "abstract": "DSM-5, following the recommendations of its substance-related disorders workgroup, radically reformulated the diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder (SUD). The changes have generated considerable controversy and concern, and are here reviewed and evaluated. DSM-IV included two substance use disorders, substance dependence and substance abuse. Dependence attempted directly to capture the concept of addiction as a psychiatric disorder, understood as impaired-control use. (The label addiction itself was narrowly rejected in earlier DSM revisions due to its purportedly pejorative nature.) Dependence diagnosis required any three or more of seven possible symptoms indicating impaired-control substance use, including two physiological dependence symptoms (tolerance, withdrawal) and five behavioural symptoms (giving up activities, continuing use despite harmful physical or psychological effects, trying to stop but cannot, taking larger amounts than intended, spending much time obtaining and taking the substance). Abuse diagnosis represented problematic use and required any one or more of four possible substance-related symptoms, including hazardous use (most commonly, driving while intoxicated), interpersonal problems (e.g., arguing with spouse), failure to fulfill role obligations at work, school, or home, and legal problems. 'Abuse' has long been a questionable disorder category. The 'dependence syndrome' model of addiction as impaired control over use 1, 2 is generally accepted as the most plausible conceptual justification for understanding addiction as a true psychiatric disorder rather than as moral weakness, social deviance, or rational choice. Since DSM-III-R, DSM diagnostic criteria for substance use disorders have been based on this model. Consistent with the model, the original intention was for 'dependence' to be the sole addiction disorder category 3. However, pragmatic concerns about having a diagnostic label for anyone needing help with substance use overrode validity concerns, and the abuse category was included in successive DSM editions until DSM-5. DSM's 'abuse' criteria clearly conflated social deviance with addictive pathology. ICD's parallel but narrower 'harmful use' category rejects face-invalid abuse criteria such as hazardous use and insists on substance-caused physical or mental health problems, thus at least ensuring medical need for intervention. Two rationales have been used to justify the DSM's 'abuse' category despite its face invalidity. First, the dependence syndrome model portrays addiction as a 'biaxial' concept with two components, an impaired-control motivational dysfunction and a harmful consequence component involving negative social, psychological, and physical consequences of excessive use 1. The model asserts that harmful consequences by themselves do not imply addiction (e.g., heavy recreational drinking without alcoholism can cause liver cirrhosis or automobile accidents). Nonetheless, the components are sometimes interpreted as distinct categories of psychiatric disorder: impaired-control use (dependence/addiction) and a residual category of harmful use without dependence (abuse). However, as both the DSM-5 definition of mental disorder and the 'harmful dysfunction' analysis of mental disorder 4, 5 make clear, harm without an underlying dysfunction is not a medical disorder. The biaxial conception, properly understood, requi-res both impaired control and consequent harm as components of every diagnosis of substance use disorder 6 and thus provides no support for an 'abuse' disorder category. Second, it is commonly claimed that abuse is mild or prodromal dependence, thus justifying its disorder status. This empirical claim has been amply disconfirmed. Substance abuse—however worthy of intervention—does not predict later dependence at substantial rates and does not correlate with validators in the same pattern as dependence 7. Abuse is also highly contextually anchored; for example, a large percentage of abuse diagnoses are due to driving under the influence of alcohol, which occurs at increased rates among those of higher socioeconomic status simply because they have automobiles 8, 9. To its credit, DSM-5 finally eliminated the substance abuse category. However, rather than acknowledging that the abuse category lacks conceptual validity as an addictive disorder and placing it in the Z Codes for non-disordered problems often treated by clinicians, DSM-5 took another route. Much of the abuse category was assimilated to dependence, in keeping with the empirically discredited 'mild or prodromal dependence' account of abuse. The workgroup relied heavily in its deliberations on factor analyses and item response theory analyses of abuse and dependence symptom items, most of which fail to discriminate abuse symptoms from dependence symptoms as distinct clusters or syndromes. However, researchers have long noted that the DSM dependence items are poorly worded to draw the dependence/abuse distinction among the highly correlated dependence and abuse items 10. Nonetheless, rather than taking the conceptual implausibility of the technical results as confirming the need for rewording and reevaluating the items and strengthening the validity of the dependence criteria, the workgroup interpreted the technical results as refuting the idea of there being abuse that is not a form of dependence: 'The \"abuse category\" has been eliminated from the proposed structure because of the lack of data to support an intermediate state between drug use and drug addiction' (11, p. 867). The implication was that abuse symptoms (including, e.g., hazardous use, despite all the contrary considerations) could be considered variants of dependence symptoms and could validly be retained as impaired-control measures. Conceptual grounding in the dependence syndrome model was thus abandoned in favor of obeisance to a literal reading of the technical results. The consequences for the decision process are vividly presented in the following description by a workgroup member of a scene that could be right out of one of Solomon Asch's social psychology experiments in which group pressure causes an individual to affirm things that are plainly false: 'I was one of the last holdouts against combining the abuse and dependence criteria because, to me, the dependence process and its consequences do seem conceptually distinct. However, as I looked around the table at my colleagues in our in-person meeting on this issue and considered the overwhelming abundance of evidence in favor of combining the abuse and dependence criteria, I found I no longer had grounds to hold to my position' (12, p. 703). In fact, the evidence for homogeneity of dependence and abuse was not 'overwhelming'. The failure of a technical method to clearly discriminate two things, or the demonstration that two things are intercorrelated in ways that allow them to fit a unidimensional mathematical model, is not a demonstration that two things do not exist. It is only a demonstration that the specific method of analysis using the specific selected measures does not discriminate them if they do exist—and in this case, we have strong independent clinical and personal evidence that the two entities, addiction and harmful use, do exist. Unidimensionality of item response analysis results can mean many things other than that there exists only one entity varying in severity 13, and no far-reaching conclusion can be drawn before alternative hypotheses are systematically tested, a task not undertaken by the workgroup. Moreover, there are many other sources of potential evidence that were not given weight. Observing that DSM-5′s decisions were based on a highly selective citing of evidence, Edwards concluded that the workgroup's reconceptualization 'goes against clinical experience, which suggests that people can develop destructive and disruptive drinking behavior without clinical symptoms of dependence' (14, p. 701), as for example in college students' harmful binge drinking independent of addiction. The workgroup's premature embrace of specific technical analyses to override compelling clinical and conceptual realities brings to mind Wittgenstein's famous admonition: 'In psychology there are experimental methods and conceptual confusion… The existence of the experimental method makes us think we have the means of solving the problems that trouble us; though problem and method pass one another by' (15, p. 232; emphasis in original). DSM-5 thus moved the abuse criteria, with all their validity problems, into an expanded category renamed 'substance use disorder' (SUD). Only the 'legal problems' criterion was abandoned because it was rarely used and plainly a matter of social deviance, not pathology. Additionally, a new 'craving' criterion was added both because craving is intuitively a phenomenological counterpart to impaired control and because it is an attractive target of pharmacological intervention. With 11 possible symptoms rather than 7, the idea was that SUD represents an enlarged and more valid impaired-control category with dimensional structure ranging from mild to severe cases; 2 or 3 symptoms is 'mild', 4 or 5 'moderate', and 6+ 'severe' SUD. Mechanically combining existing abuse and dependence criteria in SUD without reformulation exacerbated a problem of symptom criterion redundancy, weakening validity. Criteria overlap in meaning so that it is possible to satisfy multiple criteria and spuriously reach diagnostic threshold due to just one actual feature. For example, one can imagine satisfying the three symptoms of failure to fulfill role obligations, use despite social/interpersonal problems, and activities given up or reduced, all based on the same problem, lessened marital engagement due to time spent drinking with one's friends. Yet this one feature has low face validity for indicating impaired-use disorder. With so many more symptom options in SUD than in the former dependence category, it becomes much easier for an individual to meet three criteria. Thus, one might think that to maintain validity, the threshold number of symptoms needed for diagnosis would be raised to a higher number. This would be especially true because the added abuse symptoms appear to have less validity than the former dependence symptoms in identifying impaired-control dysfunction. Thus, the number of symptoms needed to have confidence that there is a dysfunction should be increased. The workgroup did the opposite; they lowered the number of symptoms required for diagnosis to 2. This is probably the most controversial substance-related change made by the DSM-5. If one considers SUD an expanded impaired-control addiction category analogous to dependence, then this change dramatically increases—indeed, more than doubles—the estimated prevalence of addiction. DSM-5′s SUD revision with its 2-symptom diagnostic threshold allows continued diagnosis of those with two abuse symptoms (e.g., drives under the influence and argues with spouse about it) and those with one abuse and one dependence symptom (e.g., has developed some tolerance to alcohol and drives under the influence). Moreover, diagnosis newly applies to those with two dependence symptoms (e.g., increased tolerance and drinks larger amounts than intended), dubbed by the literature as 'diagnostic orphans' as if they had been incorrectly abandoned rather than purposely placed below a plausible diagnostic threshold. However, studies show that these groups resemble former abuse cases more than dependence cases in prognosis. In terms of addiction as impaired control, the evidence is that probably they are mostly false positives, as validity evaluation of DSM-5 SUD suggests. DSM-5 has been heavily criticized for the lowered SUD diagnostic threshold. Before looking at the rationales offered for this change, one might ask: 'What did this effort yield in terms of increases in diagnostic validity and clinical utility?' Clinical utility for now appears weakened, primarily because virtually all treatment studies have used dependence samples. Consequently, nothing is known about what works with the much larger and more heterogeneous SUD category. Predictive studies have generally shown quite different long-term outcomes for members of the DSM-IV dependence category and the added SUD cases. Nor do the 'mild' SUD cases correspond to the former abuse cases, so that no simple translation is possible. More importantly for long-term scientific purposes, recent analyses present a markedly disappointing picture regarding validity 6. Looking at alcohol use disorder (AUD), which is by far the largest SUD category, DSM-5 AUD provides no gain at all in predictive validity or correlation with crucial validators relative to DSM-IV combined alcohol dependence and abuse. For example, DSM-5 AUD is not significantly different from DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse in levels of standard lifetime validators including episode duration, number of episodes, frequent heavy drinking, number of symptoms, suicidal ideation, service use, and family history. One-year validator results are similarly without validity gains. Alternatively, if one construes SUD as an expanded impaired-control category and compares DSM-5 AUD to DSM-IV alcohol dependence, then DSM-5 AUD represents a major loss of validity 6. DSM-5 AUD is significantly lower than DSM-IV alcohol dependence on every one of the above-mentioned validators except episode duration. Depending on the baseline of comparison, DSM-5 AUD shows no validity gain or substantially decreased validity relative to DSM-IV. Concerns that the threshold of two or more criteria is too low…(e.g., that it produces an overly heterogeneous group or that those at low severity levels are not 'true' cases)…were weighed against the competing need to identify all cases meriting intervention, including milder cases, for example, those presenting in primary care. Construed one way, this argument is a textbook example of begging the question. Mild cases of a disorder are still true cases, and no one is objecting to identifying mild cases of addiction. The objection is that the added cases—which are indeed symptomatically mild—are not mild cases of addictive disorder but rather not true cases of addictive disorder at all. Just as sneezing due to dust in the air is not a mild case of a cold, developing some tolerance to alcohol over time from social and mealtime drinking and driving home from social occasions after drinking is not generally mild addictive disorder. The workgroup's reply that we need to identify all cases including the mild ones begs the question of validity. However, the explanation was probably intended as asserting a pragmatic point, that although the added cases may not be true cases of impaired control, for practical reasons we must be able to diagnose them as disorders to help them. The problem with this pragmatic argument is that it abandons validity as the criterion for category formulation, thereby undermining the integrity of research needed for developing more effective methods for helping those with true addictions. When there was a separate category of abuse, the pragmatic argument was more compelling because the invalidity was segregated in its own category and scientific study could focus on dependence. The present approach leaves the field with no reasonably valid target category for scientific study. The reality is that no one set of criteria is capable of both identifying the addicted and identifying all who could use help for substance use. Identifying the latter group while talking as if one is identifying the former group creates a state of confusion worse than before and presents an obstacle to scientific progress. [T]he substance use disorders criteria represent a dimensional condition with no natural threshold….To avoid a marked perturbation in prevalence without justification, the work group sought a threshold for DSM-5 substance use disorders that would yield the best agreement with the prevalence of DSM-IV substance abuse and dependence disorders combined. This argument offers an example of the classic 'sorites' or 'balding man' fallacy—the fallacy of inferring from the fact there is no sharp boundary between a concept and its opposite that therefore the distinction can be drawn anywhere one likes. The fact that the division between addiction and non-addiction is fuzzy does not imply that the threshold is entirely arbitrary and can be placed to accomplish such extraneous goals as preserving prevalence rates generated by other criteria that have been acknowledged to be invalid. A fuzzy concept can still have many reasonably clear cases, and the boundary should be drawn with an eye to avoiding the classification of conceptually relatively clear cases on the incorrect side of the distinction. Day shades into night, and childhood into adulthood, and the boundaries are fuzzy, but day/night and child/adult still have clear cases that make these vague distinctions extremely useful, and despite the vagueness, there are ways of drawing the distinctions that would be manifestly incorrect. If one can arbitrarily draw a concept's boundary anywhere one wishes, one has in effect discarded the distinction. That, I suggest, is in effect what DSM-5 did with the concept of 'addiction' when it arbitrarily placed the SUD threshold at 2 of 11 symptoms to achieve the goal of preserving earlier prevalence rates, without careful attention to the face conceptual validity of the cases that would fall on either side of the new threshold. Another argument in defense of the 2-symptom threshold concerns dimensionalization in service of prevention. The lower SUD threshold can be seen as part of DSM-5′s move toward dimensional criteria that allow for diagnosis of prodromal and mild conditions to promote prevention. The question is whether the lower end of the severity dimension represents disorders at all, or whether the risk of disorder is sufficiently high to warrant the massive numbers of additional diagnoses. Challenged to justify the fact that the new criteria will pathologize mild conditions, the workgroup Chair, Charles O'Brien, explained as follows: 'We can treat them earlier. And we can stop them from getting to the point where they're going to need really expensive stuff like liver transplants' (17, p. A11). However, this justification is based on an assumption that study after study has shown to be false, namely, that DSM-IV cases of abuse and dependence orphanhood that are newly classified as SUD are an early stage of dependence and have severe outcomes over time. To take O'Brien's example seriously, the established alcohol consumption risk factor for liver cirrhosis requires heavy drinking for decades, which is unlikely to occur at the milder end of the SUD spectrum. There are about 27 000 yearly U.S. cirrhosis deaths (from all causes, not just alcohol), <0.01% of the population, whereas DSM-5 extends the SUD 'impaired control' label to approximately an additional 7% of the entire population each year (about 21 000 000 people) over and above the 5% or so identified by DSM-IV dependence 6. There is no evidence that the cirrhosis cases come out of the added group in significant numbers, nor that such massive diagnostic overreach is a feasible let alone cost-effective way of addressing the prevention of cirrhosis or identifying those at risk. Putting substance-related symptoms together and calling the result a 'severity dimension' of SUD does not make SUD a construct-valid disorder. Non-disordered conditions can be severe (e.g., pain in childbirth, normal grief, binge drinking upon arrival at college). Moreover, the diagnostic threshold should be the point at which the diagnostician is justified in attributing a disorder (e.g., impaired control) rather than a non-disorder 18. In SUD's polythetic diagnostic criteria set, every symptom is given equal weight in meeting diagnostic threshold requirements, so adding weaker indicators of dysfunction from the former abuse criteria allows ample false positives to arise when the diagnostic threshold is reached by combinations of weak symptoms. The workgroup denied the accusation that the new criteria would add to disorder diagnoses: 'a concern that \"millions more\" would be diagnosed with the DSM-5 threshold is unfounded' (16, p. 841). This answer (which contradicts the 'prevention' argument that presupposes increased diagnosis) disingenuously construes the baseline as DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse, which, by design, DSM-5 SUD matches in prevalence. The critics of course have in mind a comparison to DSM-IV dependence, which was generally considered the 'real' impaired-control category. As noted, many millions more are indeed diagnosed by DSM-5 SUD. The name change from 'dependence' to 'substance use disorder' was justified by the claim that the label 'dependence' confused addiction with 'physiological dependence' consisting of tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. The workgroup argued, correctly, that physiological dependence is an expectable consequence of the body's adaptation to some medications, including opioid pain medication, and not sufficient by itself to imply addiction (i.e., impaired-control use) 19. This understanding was already reflected in DSM-IV's text and its three-symptom dependence threshold which required at least one additional behavioural symptom of impaired control even when tolerance and withdrawal were present. Nonetheless, the workgroup argued that the verbal confusion of 'dependence' with 'physiological dependence' was a problem in pain medicine, where doctors and patients may resist adequate opioid medication for fear of inducing physiological dependence that is misconstrued as addiction. The potential for confusion certainly exists. However, there is no solid evidence that physicians' or patients' reluctance about opioid medication for non-cancer pain was generally based on this verbal confusion. Nevertheless, the urgent, overriding importance of this terminological change to facilitate prescription of opioid medication was emphasized by the workgroup's Chair: 'Of all the changes proposed by the DSM-5 work group, this one consistently is greeted by standing ovations when presented to audiences of physicians with the responsibility for the treatment of pain' (20, p. 705). This emphasis in the DSM-5 revision process represented a major historic misstep. At the time the workgroup was making these arguments, a massive problem of abuse of opioid medication for non-cancer chronic pain was emerging in the United States, with resultant heroin addiction and a startling number of overdose deaths, as well as associated social dislocations reaching into communities where it had rarely been seen before. Earlier arguments that it was safe to extend opioid use to non-cancer pain were clearly overstated ovations by pain physicians notwithstanding. Perhaps some physician and patient caution about prescription opioid painkillers was not such a bad thing after all. The DSM-5 workgroup was blind to this growing problem that, as they deliberated, was reaching epidemic proportions. If the opioid misstep had stopped at a purely terminological change, it would have been minimally impactful on research and clinical diagnosis, but it did not. Recall that DSM-5 lowered the SUD diagnostic threshold from DSM-IV's 3 of 7 symptoms to any 2 of 11 symptoms, including tolerance and withdrawal. Thus, the DSM-5 workgroup actually created the very problem that supposedly they were trying to address; they made it possible to diagnose SUD (i.e., addiction) based on the two physiological dependence symptoms alone, thus potentially confusing physiological adaptation with impaired-control use. This self-created problem conflicted with the goal of facilitating prescription of opioids for pain. An important exception to making a diagnosis of DSM-5 substance use disorder with two criteria pertains to the supervised use of psychoactive substances for medical purposes, including stimulants, cocaine, opioids, nitrous oxide, sedative-hypnotic/anxiolytic drugs, and cannabis in some jurisdictions. These substances can produce tolerance and withdrawal as normal physiological adaptations when used appropriately for supervised medical purposes. Under these conditions, tolerance and withdrawal in the absence of other criteria do not indicate substance use disorders and should not be diagnosed as such. Note that the labeling of withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use of opioids and other medications as 'normal' in order to argue that withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use should not be used as an indicator of SUD involves a potentially misleading equivocation on the meaning of 'normal'. Having withdrawal symptoms when cutting down on opioids is not a normal human condition in the sense of 'non-disordered' and is recognized as a separate category of DSM disorder. Moreover, withdrawal disorder often leads to impaired-control use and so has traditionally been a central indicator of addiction. Withdrawal is 'normal' only in the weak sense of being an expectable reaction as the body adjusts to the presence of the substance. However, many disorders are expectable under certain conditions, such as a broken bone when a certain level of pressure is applied to a limb. Prescribed use may expectably induce the complication of withdrawal disorder, and by itself, this does not imply addiction, but calling it 'normal' and eliminating it from SUD criteria suggest that physicians should not be concerned about it in the context of assessing addiction in patients, and this is far from the case. Equivocation aside, the ad hoc approach of excluding the tolerance and withdrawal symptom criteria only when evaluating SUD in medically supervised substance use has two fatal problems. First, it is conceptually incoherent. If, as the workgroup argued, tolerance and withdrawal are not a use disorder when the drug is prescribed, then they are not a use disorder when the same drug is not prescribed, for the very same reason provided by the workgroup—namely, they do not by themselves imply impaired-control use. Moreover, the workgroup's approach yields the absurdity that changes in laws can cause and 'cure' disorders. For example, the criteria allow the absurdity that if a medical marijuana user having only tolerance and withdrawal symptoms moves from a state where cannabis use is legal and medically supervised to a state where its use is illegal, and continues precisely the same pattern of medical use with the same symptoms, the individual has gone from being non-disordered to being disordered. Even the results of research will differ by locale due to differences in the legal status of various substances. Second, this approach violates the DSM-5′s (and harmful dysfunction analysis') definition of mental disorder, which states that the existence of disorder cannot be merely a matter of deviance or conflict with society. Yet, the only difference between the disordered and the non-disordered under DSM-5′s SUD criteria may be that one is taking the substance in accordance with legal rules while the other is not. This approach makes DSM-5 diagnosis overtly an instrument of social control unrelated to disorder status, the very outcome that the definition of mental disorder was designed to avoid. The most troubling implication of these conceptually misguided features of DSM-5 SUD diagnosis is that, with an opioid abuse epidemic upon us, diagnosing an individual who may be developing an opioid SUD while taking prescribed pain medication is now more difficult than before. Such an individual who is experiencing marked tolerance and withdrawal symptoms (which are excluded from consideration) must display two additional behavioural symptoms to be diagnosed, rather than just the one required by DSM-IV. The timing for such ill-conceived changes could not be worse. An additional issue is that there is a degree of arbitrariness to the workgroup's focus on physiological dependence as a potential source of false-positive addiction diagnoses among individuals taking prescribed medication. It has long been observed that taking prescribed opioids can lead to false-positive versions of many of the behavioural SUD symptoms as well. For example, a rural individual attempting to escape chronic pain may well spend much time and give up other activities to maintain an opioid prescription if the only available pharmacy is in a distant town. It is also clear that craving when confronted with triggers can exist even without impaired-control use—and the workgroup recognized this by allowing craving to persist consistent with an individual being in remission. Again, the workgroup might have spent more effort systematically refining the symptom items to achieve greater conceptual validity. To conclude, I have argued that the concerns about DSM-5 SUD diagnostic criteria are quite justified, and the arguments put forward by the DSM-5 workgroup to address critics' concerns generally spurious. Despite some welcome improvements including the elimination of the abuse category and the clarification of terminology, DSM-5′s substantial changes to SUD diagnosis fail to strengthen validity or clinical utility and diverge markedly from projected ICD-11 criteria. In adding highly face-invalid criteria such as hazardous use and social conflicts to a category that is supposed to represent a motivational dysfunction of impaired control, and then lowering the diagnostic threshold to a level that allows weaker-validity criteria by themselves to qualify for diagnosis, DSM-5 has cast into doubt the hard-fought and still controversial validity of SUD as a category of psychiatric disorder. The changes weaken and even abandon the conceptual foundations of the substance disorders field as part of psychiatry. My analysis presupposes that there is such a thing as impaired control of use that warrants psychiatric diagnosis. This assumption is currently under challenge from a variety of quarters. If this assumption is false, then by all means we should move on to a different conceptualization of the kinds of compulsive harmful substance use that we now conceptualize as addiction. The problem is that the DSM-5 workgroup verbally retained the impaired-control framework while reformulating diagnostic criteria in ways inconsistent with that framework. This undermines the ability to pursue good science addressing the validity of the concept of addiction and of the impaired-control model. If ICD-11 resists the temptation to move toward some of DSM-5′s innovations, it will provide a much-needed alternative approach to addictive disorder diagnosis that could become the field's preferred standard for advancing addiction science.",

      "title": "Could This be a New Syndrome? Report of Seven Cases with Characteristic Mental and Physical Degeneracy",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY In a period of 5 years, seven children have been seen who show a specific state of mental and physical degeneracy occurring sporadically in otherwise healthy families. The only possible predisposing factor was birth trauma, which was present in 5. Lethargy in early infancy is followed by more than a decade of great excitability and stubborn restlessness. There is delay in motor development and outstanding clumsiness of voluntary movements. The face is often broad and flat with straight eyebrows. More constant are a ‘gosling’ mouth, a short neck and occasional postural lordosis (‘marabou stance’). The associated eye defects include strabismus, sévère myopia and a tendency to retinal detachment. There are unusual dominance patterns. The IQ is between 50 and 75. Scholastic attainments are poor except for relatively good ability and interest in reading. The outstanding characteristics are typically emotionally conditioned hand movements (rubbing and wringing), a tubular quality of voice, an abnormal sleep rhythm and very late bladder control. This consistent combination of clinical features can hardly be regarded as coincidental. No reports of similar children have been found in the literature. RÉSUMÉ Un nouveau syndrome ? A propos de sept cas présentant une dégénérescence caractéristique mentale et physique Durant une période de 5 ans, sept enfants ont été suivis qui présentaient une dégénéres‐cence mentale et physique, survenant sporadiquement dans les families par ailleurs en bonne santé. Le seul facteur predisposant qui pourrait être retenu est un traumatisme à la naissance 5 fois présent. Un état léthargique dans la première enfance a été suivi durant plus de dix ans par une grande excitabilité et une instabilityé permanente. II y a eu un retard dans le développement moteur et une maladresse évidente des mouvements volontaires. La figure est souvent large et aplatie avec des sourcils rectilignes. Plus fréquemment reléves ont été une bouche en bee d'oison, un cou court et une lordose posturale occasionnelle (tenue de marabout). Les troubles oculaires associés comprennent le strabisme, une myopie sévère et une tendance au décollement rétinien. On observe des stéréotypes anormax. Le QI est compris entre 50 et 75. Les résultats scolaires sont pauvres excepte une aptitude relative‐ment bonne pour la lecture et un intérêt certain pour cette acquisition. Les caractéristiques les plus spécifiques sont des mouvements de mains déclenchés par l'émotion: mouvements de frottements et de torsions, le caractére caverneux de la voix, le rythme anormal du sommeil et un contrôle vésical très tardif. II est difficile de considérer comme accidentelle cette combinaison de manifestations cliniques particulières; il n'a pas été observé de cas semblables dans la littérature. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Handelt es sich um ein neues Syndrom ? Bericht über sieben Fälle mil charakteristischer geistiger und physicher Degeneration Über einen Zeitraum von 5 Jahren wurden sieben Kinder mit einem spezifischen Zustand geistiger und physischer Degeneration gesehen, der sporadisch in ansonsten gesunden Familien auftrat. Der einzige mögliche prädisponierende Faktor war ein Geburtstrauma bei fünf Kindern. Nach einem Stadium der Lethargie in der fruuhen Kindheit folgt ein Jahrzehnt großer Erregbarkeit und nicht zu beeinflussender Unruhe. Die motorische Entwicklung ist verspätet und es findet sich eine ungewöhnliche Ungeschichicklichkeit bei willkürlichen Bewegungen. Das Gesicht ist oft breit und flach mit geraden Augenbrauen. Noch haufiger findet sich ein ‘Schnabelmund’, ein kurzer Hals und gelegentlich eine posturale Lordose (‘Marabuhaltung’). Zu den damit verbundenen Augenkrankheiten gehSren Strabismus, schwere Myopie und eine Neigung zur Netzhautablösung. Es gibt ungewöhliche Dominanzerscheinungen. Der QI liegt zwischen 50 und 75. Die Fähigkeiten in der Schule sind gering außer einem relativ guten Interesse und Fertigkeit im Lesen. Beson‐ders charakteristisch sind typisch emotionell bedingte Handbewegungen (Reiben und Ringen), eine Röhrenstimme, ein abnormer Schlafrhythmus und eine sehr späte Kontrolle der Blasenfunktion. Diese gleichbleibende Kombination klinischer Erscheinungen kann schwerlich als zufallig betrachtet werden. In der Literatur fanden wir keine Berichte iiber ahnliche Kinder. RESUMEN Podria tratarse de un nuevo sindrome?. Aportacion de 1 casos con una degeneracidn mental y fisica caracteristicas En un perfodo de 5 años han sido vistos 7 niños que presentaban un estado especifico de degeneracyón ffsica y mental que aparecia de forma esporádica en familias que gozaban por otra parte de buena salud. El único factor predisponente posible era un trauma del parto presente en 5 ca sos. El cuadro constaba de letargia en los primeros meses de la vida, sequida de más de 10 años de gran excitabilidad y comportamiento tumultuoso con hiper motilidad. Existe un retraso en el desarrollo motor y una notable torpeza en los movimientos voluntarios. La cara es con frecuencia ancha y plana con cejas rectas. Más constante es la boca de “tipo de pato”, cuello corto y una ocasional lordosis postural (‘position de mara‐bii’). Los defectos asociados oculares que se presentan incluyen estrabismo, miopia grave y tendencia al desprendimiento de retina. Existe tambisén esquemás de dominancia alter‐nados. El CI oscila entre 50 y 75. El rendimiento excolar es pobre, excepto a lo que respecta a une relativa habilidad e interes para la lectura. Otras caracteristicas sobresalientes son movimientos de maños condicionados por la emotividad (restregárselas y estrujárselas), una voz de tipo tubular, un ritmo de sueño anormal y un control vesical muy tardio. Toda esta combinatión de caracteristicas clfnicas no pueden ser consideradas como simple coincidencia. No se han encontrado descritos en la literatura ningún caso similar.",

It has an impact on the neurological system, particularly on the regions that regulate movement and coordination. People with cerebral palsy usually have difficulty with walking, feeding, or speaking, and may require physical and occupational therapy for management and rehabilitation. The extent of symptoms can vary, and severity can change over time. Cerebral Palsy has been long acknowledged to be associated with various challenges and difficulties in digesting and absorbing nutritional inputs, leading to malnutrition and poor nutritional health. However, little is known about the exact mechanisms behind it and the solutions available to address it. The role of nutrition in cerebral palsy is significant as it can impact multiple factors, including the physical and cognitive development of children. Children with cerebral palsy often have difficulty with chewing and swallowing, leading to poor digestion and nutrient absorption. This can further impact their nutritional status and cause various deficiencies. A proper and customized evidence based nutritional plan is essential to ensure adequate nutritional intake and adequate development, both physically and mentally ensuring quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Early infantile autism is the most severe of a group of neurodevelopmental syndromes called the pervasive developmental disorders. The clinical features of autism vary greatly, but, by definition, include deficits in social relatedness, communication, and interests or routines. The onset of autistic signs and behaviors typ ically occurs in infancy, and the syndrome is usually fully present by the fourth year. The presence of mental retardation affects the clinical picture greatly. Severely autistic children may be retarded and mute and are often preoccupied with repetitive activities; they often exhibit motor stereotypes, such as rocking or hand flapping. They can be profoundly withdrawn and may show extreme aversion to social or physical contact. More mildly affected children may have normal or even superior intelligence, with well-developed language skills. Their deficits in social relatedness and preoccupation with rituals and routines may set them apart as very odd, but not necessarily as autistic. Autism occurs in 1 of 2000 live births; boys outnumber girls about 3 or 4:1. Although there are no localizing neurological signs in autism, mild or \"soft\" neurological signs are common and grand mal seizures are frequently present after puberty (Lotspeich LJ, Ciaranello RD.

      "title": "The Connection between Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Therapeutic Approaches",
      "abstract": "A Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is an injury to the brain caused by an external force (vehicle, accidents, violence, sports injuries, industrial accidents, falls). Brain trauma can occur either from an object penetrating the skull or from rapid acceleration (speeding up), or deceleration (slowing down or stopping suddenly) of the brain. Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a major cause of mortality and disability, especially in children and young adults. Based on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), the neurological scale used to measure a person's level of consciousness after a brain injury, traumatic brain injury is classified as: mild (GCS 13 - 15), moderate (GCS 9 - 12), severe (GCS 8 or less), and evaluates the following functions: Eye Opening (E), Motor Response (M), and Verbal Response (V), to determine a patient's overall GCS, add together the scores from eye opening, motor response and verbal response. Scores range from 3 to 15. A score of 8 or less signifies coma. Symptoms can vary depending on the severity of the head injury. An individual with a mild traumatic brain injury can remain conscious, or may experience a loss of consciousness for a few seconds or minutes. Other symptoms may include headache, confusion, dizziness, vision changes, ringing in the ears or changes in hearing, fatigue or lethargy, a change in sleep patterns, behavioral or mood changes, and cognitive and/or executive functioning problems. People with a moderate or severe traumatic brain injury may show the same symptoms, but may also have a headache that gets worse, repeated vomiting or nausea, convulsions or seizures, an inability to awaken from sleep, dilation of one or both pupils of the eyes, slurred speech, weakness or numbness in the extremities, loss of coordination, and increased confusion, restlessness, or agitation. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder secondary to Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is one of the most common neurobehavioral consequences of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), occurring in 20% to 50% of individual's post-injury (Irastorza, 2011). Some of the most persistent problems include impairment in memory, attention and concentration, language, executive skills, social judgment, social behavior, and impulsiveness. Previous studies have shown that Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a major cause of mental health problems and increases the risk of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (Schachar et al., 2015). According to studies (Ilie et al., 2015), physical brain injury contributes to the development of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. Because the risk of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder development after Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) remains high over an extended period, and some of the most persistent problems include impairment in memory, attention and concentration, language, executive skills, social judgment, social behavior, and impulsiveness; this master thesis shows the importance of an early prompt intervention after brain injury, and the need to establish a therapeutic plan in order to treat the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder development and evolution. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the association between Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, and also to show the importance of prompt intervention and preventive therapy in order to stop the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder development and evolution.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Developmental stuttering (DS) is a disturbance in the normal fluency and time patterning of speech resulting in involuntary repetition, prolongation, or cessation of sound. The scientific literature has implicated the lack of strong left cerebral dominance and abnormal levels of the neurotranemitters dopamine and possibly serotonin in regions of the brain controlling the coordination of language processing and motor activity of the vocal apparatus as possible causative factors in DS. Speech‐language therapy is the most common form of treatment, but antipsychotic, antide‐pressant, and anxiolytic medications may be prescribed for some children and adults with persistent stuttering. These medications may cause xerostomia and adversely interact with certain antibiotics, analgesics, and sedatives routinely used in dentistry. Some people who stutter have sensory‐motor and tactile‐proprioceptive deficits that impede accurate and timely movements of the mandible, lips, and tongue, necessitating protection of the airway by staff during dental care.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Besides motor and behavioural disturbances, HD patients also develop cognitive deficits. Different speech and language impairments have been described, but there is no evidence of progredient semantic deficits as seen in a semantic variant of the primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) which is characterized by loss of semantic knowledge, severe anomia and single-word comprehension deficits. <h3>Case History</h3> We report the case of a 58-year-old female with Huntington disease (HD) presenting with progredient memory and language deficits and describe the differential diagnostic process with results of neurological and neuropsychological examination, imaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and genetic panel. While the patient displayed only mild HD-related motor signs including impaired fine motor skills, gait difficulties and intermittent distal chorea (TMS 18), she showed a progredient aphasia with surface dyslexia, semantic paraphasia and pronounced deficits in naming and single-word comprehension, while repetition and speech production were only mildly affected. Correlating with these deficits, cCT showed a predominantly left anterior temporal atrophy and the 18F-FDG PET displayed beside the HD-typical hypometabolism of the Ncl. caudatus, a left temporal lobe hypometabolism, reminiscent of svPPA. No mutations were detected in the gene panel for frontal temporal lobe degeneration (FTLD) spectrum disorders and liquor analysis showed normal CSF and degeneration markers. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Clinically, pattern and progredient nature of the cognitive deficits would fit the clinical diagnosis of a concurrent svPPA or, alternatively, HD with extensive temporal lobe involvement. Clinicians should be sensitized to differentially examine atypical symptoms rather than treating them as part of an existing neurodegenerative disease.",

      "title": "Impaired Mental Proprioception in Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Psychiatrists recognize that schizophrenia is a disorder in which the highest mental functions, such as thought, language, emotions, conation, and cognition, are drastically disrupted. However, the most serious impairment in schizophrenia is a global malfunction in self-integration and personal identity that includes a deficit in self-recognition. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] This distorted sense of leads persons with schizophrenia to fail to recognize what is or is not part of their own mind, which can produce clinical symptoms of schizophrenia, including bizarre delusions, hallucinations, thought disorder, social deficits, and information processing. (1) Just as intact physical proprioception enables a healthy person to be continuously aware of where his body and its parts are located in space, allowing sensory-motor integration, mental proprioception enables one to be fully aware of his identity and self-boundaries, and that his thoughts and actions are generated from within his own sphere of consciousness, not from an external source. In schizophrenia, the coherent sense of is shattered and fragmented, a frightening experience patients describe after emerging from psychosis. (2) A person affected by schizophrenia feels lost, as if his no longer belong[s] to him. He feels alienated from his real self and refers to himself in the third person. He feels disconnected, disintegrated, and diminished, with a sense of emptiness, a painful void of existence, of being disembodied with no clear demarcation between and others. (2) Not surprisingly, false beliefs (delusions) and perceptual aberrations (hallucinations) emerge from a fragmented sense of self. Patients fail to recognize that their actions, thoughts, or feelings are initiated from within the self, leading to delusions of passivity and being controlled by an outside force. One's impulses are misperceived as being imposed by an alien. One's thoughts, fantasies, and memories become external hallucinations instead of internal recollections. It is not surprising that depersonalization and derealization are common in schizophrenia and in the prodrome stage. Phencyclidine and ketamine, which can produce schizophrenia-like psychoses, are known to trigger dissociative phenomena and a loss of a coherent sense of self. What causes the disintegration of the mind (self) in schizophrenia? The leading neurobiologic explanation is well-documented white matter pathology. (3) Numerous studies have demonstrated that the myelinated axons and fibers that connect various brain regions are abnormal in patients with schizophrenia. The evidence for the breakdown of white matter--and, consequently, brain connectedness and integration--includes several lines of evidence, such as: a) in vivo neuroimaging studies using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) that show abnormal water mobility in the myelin; b) genetic aberrations in myelin genes; c) postmortem evidence of reduced oligodendrocytes, the glial cells that manufacture myelin; and d) biochemical markers such as the calcium-binding protein S100B, which is released by compromised glial cells. (3) Therefore, it is reasonable to think that the disruption of the sense of and its proprioception may be due to the extensive disconnectivity of brain regions caused by myelin pathology. (4) However, grey matter abnormality also may play a role in loss of mental proprioceptive functions, which causes a failure to properly recognize one's self. The inferior parietal cortex, which controls body image, concept of self, sensory integration, and executive function, has been reported to be structurally impaired in patients with schizophrenia. …",

We report the case of an elderly homemaker who came to our institute with features of cognitive decline and behavioral problems with language deficits in the form of nonfluent speech, impaired vocabulary to three pairs of words, agrammatism, and impaired single sentence comprehension with corroborative magnetic resonance imaging findings. PNFA is a rare clinical variant of FTD and often underdiagnosed. It should be considered in elderly patients who apart from having cognitive decline, behavioral problems, and absent insight also develop limited vocabulary, especially using a set of nouns to express themselves. Speech therapy and behavioral therapy in the initial stages can be of utility.",

The group of children with mental retardation researchers attribute those who do not have alocalised damage of speech, there is no hearing or visual impairment, mental deficiency, and, despite this, many of them have great difficulty in learning. They are characterized by slowing down the formation of cognitive and emotional spheres of their time fixing the earlier age levels. At the same time, in some cases to the forefront will be the delay in emotional development, and intellectual impairment will not be expressed sharply, in other cases, on the contrary, will be dominated by slowing the development of the intellectual sphere.

The association between speech and language disorders (SLD) and a range of mental health problems is an important finding which argues for early screening and intervention of SLD children for the presence of psychological problems and disorders. It has been suggested that links between communication disorders and psychiatric disorders such as autism and ADHD are suggestive of an underlying neurodevelopment immaturity. There have long been indications of genetic factors being involved in the aetiology of communication disorders. The range of psychiatric problems associated is quite extensive with the presence of Emotional Disorder being a significant mental health risk.

It is a mental health condition that can range in severity from mild to severe. The severity of depression can be assessed based on the number, intensity, and duration of symptoms, as well as their impact on an individual's daily functioning. Mild depression typically involves symptoms such as feeling sad, low energy, and a lack of motivation. These symptoms may not significantly interfere with an individual's ability to function in their daily life, and they may still be able to maintain their social and occupational obligations. Moderate depression involves more severe and persistent symptoms, such as a sense of hopelessness, persistent feelings of sadness, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions. These symptoms may make it challenging to fulfill daily responsibilities, and may result in social isolation or problems at work or school. Severe depression involves symptoms that significantly impair an individual's ability to function in their daily life, such as suicidal thoughts, complete loss of interest in activities, and difficulty with basic tasks such as personal hygiene or eating. Severe depression is a medical emergency and requires immediate professional intervention to prevent harm to oneself or others",

      "abstract": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex disease that affects children and adolescents as well as adults. The etiology has not been established. While many pediatricians and other healthcare providers are aware of ME/CFS, they often lack essential knowledge that is necessary for diagnosis and treatment. Many young patients experience symptoms for years before receiving a diagnosis. This Primer, written by the International Writing Group for Pediatric ME/CFS provides information necessary to understand, diagnose, and man-age the symptoms of ME/CFS in children and adolescents. ME/CFS is characterized by overwhelming fatigue with a substantial loss of physical and mental stamina. Cardinal features are malaise and a worsening of symptoms following minimal physical or mental exertion. These post-exertional symptoms can persist for hours, days, or weeks and are not relieved by rest or sleep. Other symptoms include cognitive problems, unrefreshing or disturbed sleep, generalized or localized pain, light-headedness and additional symptoms in multiple organ systems. While some young patients can attend school, on a full or part-time basis, many others are wheelchair dependent, housebound, or bedbound. Prevalence estimates for pediatric ME/CFS vary from 0.1%-0.5%. Because there is no diagnostic test for ME/CFS, diagnosis is purely clinical, based on the history and the exclusion of other fatiguing illnesses by physical examination and medical testing. Co-existing medical conditions including orthostatic intolerance are common. Successful management is based on determining the optimum balance of rest and activity to help prevent post-exertional symptom worsening. Medications are helpful to treat pain, insomnia, orthostatic intolerance and other symptoms. The published literature on ME/CFS and specifically that describing the diagnosis and management of pediatric ME/CFS is very limited. Where published studies are lacking, recommendations are based on the clinical observations and practices of the authors.",

      "title": "The right cerebral hemisphere: Emotion, music, visual-spatial skills, body-image, dreams, and awareness",
      "abstract": "Based on a review of numerous studies conducted on normal, neurosurgical and brain-injured individuals, the right cerebral hemisphere appears to be dominant in the perception and identification of environmental and nonverbal sounds; the analysis of geometric and visual space (e. g., depth perception, visual closure); somesthesis, stereognosis, the maintenance of the body image; the production of dreams during REM sleep; the perception of most aspects of musical stimuli; and the comprehension and expression of prosodic, melodic, visual, facial, and verbal emotion. When the right hemisphere is damaged a variety of cognitive abnormalities may result, including hemiinattention and neglect, prosopagnosia, constructional apraxia, visualperceptual disturbances, and agnosia for environmental, musical, and emotional sounds. Similarly, a myriad of affective abnormalities may occur, including indifference, depression, hysteria, gross social-emotional disinhibition, florid manic excitement, childishness, euphoria, impulsivity, and abnormal sexual behavior. Patients may become delusional, engage in the production of bizzare confabulations and experience a host of somatic disturbances such as pain and body-perceptual distortions. Based on studies of normal and \"split-brain\" functioning, it also appears that the right hemisphere maintains a highly developed social-emotional mental system and can independentyly perceive, recall and act on certain memories and experiences without the aid or active reflective participation of the left. This leads to situations in which the right and left halves of the brain sometime act in an uncoopertive fashion, which gives rise to inter-manual and intrapsychic conflicts.",

CARS (Childhood Autism Rating Scale) value was 42. This case was treated at the Department of Kaumarabhritya, Government Ayurveda College, Tripunithura and there was much improvement in eye contact, jumping and laughing reduced, the patient started to speak a few new words, attention improved and CARS Value reduced to 36 after treatment. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and the presence of restricted interests and repetitive behaviours. It can be correlated to Unmada in Ayurveda. Impaired agni (digestive fire) is a cardinal feature in Autism which is due to abnormal microbiota Autism. Correction of Agni by Deepana, Pachana which corrects the dysbiosis of microbiota along with the adoption of treatment principles of Unmada can bring about much improvement in the signs and symptoms of Autism.",

La inespecificidad de estas alteraciones ha hecho que muchas de estas modificaciones comportamentales sean consideradas, erróneamente, como signos típicos del envejecimiento “normal”. No obstante, estas pueden ser reflejo de un proceso patológico cerebral que provoca deterioro progresivo de las funciones cognitivas en perros geriátricos. Recientemente, fue descrita una enfermedad conocida como Síndrome de Disfunción Cognitiva de perros senior o “enfermedad de Alzheimer del perro”, debido a las similitudes clínicas y patológicas con esta enfermedad en humanos. Los animales afectados desarrollan cambios morfofuncionales en diferentes zonas cerebrales, lo que probablemente conduce a la aparición de cambios asociados al decline cognitivo, es decir, disminución en la capacidad de recopilar información, procesarla, retenerla y tomar decisiones, lo que termina provocando efectos deletéreos sobre la calidad de vida del paciente afectado al no lograr desenvolverse normalmente en su medio. Dada la inespecificidad de los signos clínicos, la anamnesis y los test comportamentales han sido considerados como las principales herramientas diagnósticas para identificar este síndrome. Por otra parte, debido a que aún no han sido plenamente establecidos los aspectos etiopatológicos, los mecanismos implicados en el desarrollo de esta neuropatología aún siguen inconclusos, por lo tanto, no son muchas las estrategias terapéuticas disponibles, de las cuales solo la selegilina ha sido aprobada por la FDA.",

Impairments in problem solving and verbal fluency tests may also occur. PD patients with predominantly right-sided symptoms usually exhibit more severe difficulties with verbal than with non-verbal tasks. We report a case of a highly educated right-handed man with very mild right-sided hemiparkinsonism who never received anti-Parkinsonian or other psychoactive medication. Our patient showed anterograde and retrograde amnesia for faces and spatial locations and difficulties on complex visuospatial tasks that required manual responses, but normal to above average performance on all other cognitive tests. The specific pattern of cognitive loss early in PD may depend on which spatial, facial or verbal pre-frontal striatal circuits are deprived of their dopaminergic inputs.",

      "abstract": "Developmental disabilities are a group of disorders resulting from injury to the developing brain (prenatal, perinatal or postnatal). Developmental disabilities are a severe chronic disability that is attributed to a mental or physical impairment or a combination of both conditions. Broad definition of developmental disabilities included; mental retardation, cerebral palsy, communication disorders, learning disability, attention deficit hyperactive disorder and childhood autism. These disabilities can occur in isolation or in combination (multiple handicaps). Together developmental disabilities account for 10-15% of the population of children and associated with considerable burden of disease, physical co-morbidities, high economic costs, and very poor quality of life (QOL).\nModern medicine has very limited success in treatment of developmental disabilities due to multi-factorial nature of these diseases. Ayurveda represents an ancient system of traditional medicine prevalent in India about 5000 years old. Medhya Rasayanas are group of medicinal plants described in Ayurveda to improve memory and intelligence. The Medhya rasayanas (herbal nootropic drugs) are beneficial to improve the power of retention, power of grasping, power of discrimination and power of recollection etc. In Charaka samhita mainly four medicinal plants mentioned as “Medhya Rasayanas”. They are Mandukaparni (Centella asiatica) swarasa, Yastimadhu (Glycirrhiza glabra) churna, Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia) swarasa and Shankhapushpi (Convolvulus pluricaulis) kalka. The recent article focuses on establishing a new potential of Medhya Rasayanas (herbal nootropic drugs) for treatment of developmental disabilities in children.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Witteveen–Kolk syndrome (WITKOS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by developmental delay/intellectual disability, facial dysmorphisms, and short stature. The syndrome is caused by loss of function of switch‐insensitive 3 transcription regulator family member A ( SIN3A ). Regarding behavioral functioning, Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), obsessive–compulsive behaviors, as well as Attention‐Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder symptoms (ADHD) have been suggested. The present study explores various aspects of neurocognitive functioning in five individuals (age range 10–23) with WITKOS. Medical records and results of extensive neuropsychological assessment are used to describe developmental trajectories and neurocognitive profiles. Systematic analysis of medical records displays developmental difficulties described as ASD or ADHD in childhood, sleep problems and internalizing problems during adolescence. Results of cognitive assessments indicate profoundly disabled ( n = 1), mildly disabled ( n = 2), borderline ( n = 1), and average ( n = 1) levels of intelligence. Furthermore, results indicate weaknesses in speed of information processing/sustained attention in all participants, and difficulties in planning and maintaining overview in three participants. Furthermore, parent reports of behavioral functioning primarily suggest problems in social functioning. Implications of both cognitive problems and social–emotional vulnerabilities for counseling are discussed and supplemented with suggestions for interventions.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics ASXL3-related disorder is characterized by developmental delay or intellectual disability, typically in the moderate to severe range, with speech and language delay and/or absent speech. Affected individuals may also display autistic features. There may be issues with feeding. While dysmorphic facial features have been described, they are typically nonspecific. Affected individuals may also have hypotonia that can transition to spasticity resulting in unusual posture with flexion contractions of the elbows, wrists, and fingers. Other findings may include poor postnatal growth, strabismus, seizures, sleep disturbance, and dental anomalies. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ASXL3-related disorder is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ASXL3 by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Feeding therapy; gastrostomy tube placement for those with persistent feeding issues; anti-reflux medication and/or fundoplication for those with gastroesophageal disease; standard treatment for epilepsy, joint contractures, sleep apnea, dental anomalies, strabismus and/or refractive error, and developmental delay / intellectual disability. Surveillance: At each visit: Measurement of growth parameters and nutritional status; assessment of developmental progress, behavioral issues, new neurologic manifestations (change in tone, seizure onset and/or frequency), mobility and self-help skills, as well as signs and symptoms of sleep disturbance. Dental evaluation every six months after age three years or as clinically indicated. At least annual ophthalmology evaluation. Genetic counseling ASXL3-related disorder is an autosomal dominant disorder typically caused by a de novo pathogenic variant. Rarely, individuals diagnosed with ASXL3-related disorder have the disorder as the result of a pathogenic variant inherited from a parent. If the ASXL3 pathogenic variant identified in the proband is not identified in either parent, the risk to sibs is presumed to be low but greater than that of the general population because of the possibility of parental germline mosaicism. Once the ASXL3 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "title": "Promoting Physical Activity in People with Brain Impairments",
      "abstract": "Brain impairment is defined as a significant loss or abnormality in the brain structure. Brain impairments may be acquired as a result of trauma (e.g., traumatic brain injury or stroke), non-traumatic origins (e.g., tumour) or disease (e.g., Parkinsonrs disease or multiple sclerosis) or congenital (e.g., cerebral palsy) and are frequently associated with abnormal brain function (e.g., impaired memory, executive function and/ or impaired motor control). Evidence indicates that physical activity is beneficial for individuals with brain impairment as the subsequent loss of cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength and flexibility that occurs as a result of inactivity can compound the effects of the initial disability. Current cross-sectional evidence indicates that individuals with brain impairment are significantly less active than individuals without brain impairment. In order to address the low levels of physical activity in adults with brain impairment and thereby improve health, fitness and functioning, it is critical to develop interventions which effectively promote physically active behaviour in this population. The overall aim of the program of research described in this thesis is to contribute to the development and implementation of evidence-based physical activity promotion strategies in individuals with brain impairment. This thesis presents studies relating to two major subpopulations of people with brain impairment: adolescents with cerebral palsy (Chapters Three and Four); and adults with brain impairment (Chapters Five and Six). Chapter Three presents a systematic review of the clinimetric properties of objective and subjective measures of physical activity in adolescents with cerebral palsy. Seven measures were included in this review. Each measure had notable limitations related to the assessment of physical activity intensity and duration and compliance with the physical activity guidelines. The review identified accelerometry as a promising means of measuring physical activity as it is objective and can collect real-time activity data on the frequency, intensity, and duration of activity, allowing for meaningful comparison to the physical activity guidelines. Chapter Four presents a study that evaluated the validity of the ActiGraph accelerometer for the measurement of physical activity in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy. Results indicated that the ActiGraph is able to differentiate between different intensities of walking and that, for the purpose of classifying activity intensity, the cut-points developed by Evenson et al. for typically developing children had excellent classifaction accuracy for detecting moderate to vigorous physical activity. These findings indicate that the ActiGraph is a suitable device for measuring free-living ambulatory physical activity among children and adolescents with cerebral palsy and that the output can be used to make meaningful comparisons to the physical activity guidelines. Chapter Five presents a systematic review of the research relating to physical activity and adults with brain impairment mapped against the five phases of a behavioral epidemiological framework. Results indicated that the vast majority of research to date has focused on identifying the benefits of physical activity for people with brain impairment; that measures previously used to evaluate physical activity participation do not allow meaningful comparison to the physical activity guidelines; that the evidence relating to correlates of physical activity has been largely concerned with levels of impairment and self-efficacy and; there is a relative paucity of studies evaluating the efficacy of interventions that promote physically active behaviour in this population. Currently there are no studies that evaluate the translation of physical activity interventions previously shown to be successful in controlled efficacy or effectiveness studies into widespread practice. On the basis of these results, it is concluded that future studies should consider a community-based rehabilitation model of intervention and that the rigor of such studies would be enhanced by the use of objective measures of physical activity. Chapter Six presents the results of a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a physical activity promotion intervention for community-dwelling adults with brain impairment. The intervention utilised elements of a community-based rehabilitation approach to deliver a lifestyle intervention to community-dwelling adults with brain impairment and outcomes were evaluated using an objective measure of physical activity. After the 12-week program, intervention participants exhibited significant increases in average counts per minute (cpm) (60.9 p 20.7 cpm, p= .004) and daily average time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (10.4 p 4.0 mins MVPA, p= .01). Daily counts per minute and time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity declined significantly among attention controls (-11.1 p 22.9 cpm; -2.6 p 4.5 mins MVPA). Net differences in daily counts per minute and time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity were 71.9 cpm (p= .02) and 12.9 mins MVPA (p= .03), respectively. Between-condition differences in the physical activity outcomes were not significant at 3-months follow-up. These findings are noteworthy given the particularly low rates of physical activity participation in this population and the significant physical and environmental barriers that individuals with brain impairment face. Given the rigour of the study, the results are sufficiently positive to warrant conducting a larger scale effectiveness trial utilising trained practitioners in clinical practice settings.n",

      "abstract": "CHARGE is a multifaceted syndrome, so named for a collection of characteristics commonly exhibited by individuals with this genetic condition. The acronym CHARGE stands for coloboma, heart defects, atresia choanae, retarded growth and development, genital hypoplasia, and ear anomalies and deafness (Blake, Salem-Hartshorne, Daoud, & Gradstein, 2005). Although individuals with CHARGE may not exhibit all of these traits, most--between 80% and 90%--meet the qualifications for deaf-blindness even when the hearing or vision impairment is mild (Hartshorne, Hefner, Davenport, & Thelin, 2011). Intellectual disabilities, however, are not as common in this population as early research indicated (Graham, Rosner, Dykens, & Visootsak, 2005). Those with CHARGE syndrome have a wide range of cognitive functioning, and some contend that intelligence is often underestimated due to communication barriers or the use of inappropriate assessments (Hartshorne et al., 2011). Furthermore, CHARGE syndrome is often associated with conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficits, tic disorders or Tourette syndrome, anxiety, and executive dysfunction (Blake et al., 2005; Hartshorne et al., 2011; Hartshorne, Nicholas, Grialou, & Russ, 2007). In addition to these concomitant conditions, communication is often a challenge related to CHARGE. Some children with CHARGE develop symbolic communication, whereas others do not (Thelin & Fussner, 2005). Most experts attribute delayed or lack of language development to the sensory impairments associated with CHARGE (Graham et al., 2005; van Dijk & de Kort, 2005). Those who do develop symbolic communication most likely use total communication (the pairing of spoken and signed languages; Thelin & Fussner, 2005) and are prone to idiosyncratic communication patterns (van Dijk & de Kort, 2005). Communication skills are imperative for social and educational outcomes as well as for self-regulation (Kennert, Ramirez, Hartshorne, Deuce, & Nicholas, 2015). Closely related to issues of communication are behavioral challenges that are prevalent with CHARGE syndrome. Problematic behaviors are often attributed to communication difficulties, and as Hartshorne and colleagues (2011) note, behaviors are communication. Behaviors exhibited by individuals with CHARGE are distinct and more frequent than expected when compared to others with deaf-blindness or similar syndromes (Graham et al., 2005; Hartshorne et al., 2011). Beyond communication difficulties, other causes cited for challenging behaviors include sensory impairments, responses to or lack of control over environments, balance and equilibrium problems, medical issues and discomfort, stress and anxiety, and executive dysfunction (Blake et al., 2005; Graham et al., 2005; Hartshorne et al., 2007, 2011; van Dijk & de Kort, 2005). Experts say that behavior interventions for individuals with CHARGE syndrome should incorporate three key features: recognizing the cause of behaviors; reducing stress, anxiety, and discomfort; and accounting for sensory impairments (Blake et al., 2005; Graham et al., 2005; van Dijk & de Kort, 2005). These priorities align well with the positive behavior support model. Recognizing that challenging behaviors lead to exclusion and isolation, positive behavior support aims to reduce problematic behaviors to improve quality of life (Horner, 2000). Positive behavior support utilizes functional behavior analysis to understand the cause of inappropriate behaviors and then addresses issues in an individual's environments because [t]he assumption is not that individuals are defective or broken, but that they experience the world around them in a way that is different from their peers (Horner, 2000, p. 99). The present study investigates the use of positive behavior support strategies with young adults who are deafblind, including those with CHARGE syndrome, to determine which are effective for preventing or stopping problem behaviors. …",

Sometimes biological aspects cause SBS, sometimes the chemicals present in your building, but human biological systems are affected. This paper reveal a review of SBS, including symptoms, causes, effects, work-related illnesses, prevention, and control. Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) is a medical condition where people experience unexplained symptoms of illness or discomfort while occupying a building. The severity of these symptoms tends to worsen with prolonged stay in the building, but improves or disappears once they leave. SBS can have significant consequences, including: Impaired work or school performance, strained personal relationships, Reduced attendance, Decreased productivity. SBS can occur in various settings, such as: Offices, Homes, Schools, Nurseries. Common symptoms of SBS include: Eye problems (irritation, watering, dryness), Respiratory issues (runny or blocked nose, sore throat), Skin problems (itching, dryness), Headaches, Fatigue, Lethargy, Poor concentration. Overall, SBS can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life and productivity, making it essential to identify and address the underlying causes of the condition.",

The coexistence of the two phenotypes and cognitive impairment is referred to as cognitive frailty (CF). It remains unknown whether frailty phenotype has a different association with hearing loss (HL) and tinnitus.Of the 5,328 community-dwelling older adults, 429 participants aged ≥58 years were enrolled in the study. The participants were divided into robust, mobility, and non-mobility frailty, mobility and non-mobility CF (subdivided into reversible and potentially reversible CF, RCF, and PRCF), and cognitive decline [subdivided into mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and pre-MCI] groups. The severity and presentations of HL and/or tinnitus were used as dependent variables in the multivariate logistic or nominal regression analyses with forward elimination adjusted for frailty phenotype stratifications and other covariates.Patients with physical frailty (mobility frailty) or who are robust were found to have lower probability of developing severe HL and tinnitus, and presented HL and/or tinnitus than those with only cognitive decline, or CF. Patients with RCF and non-mobility RCF had higher probability with less HL and tinnitus, and the presentation of HL and/or tinnitus than those with PRCF and mobility RCF. Other confounders, age, cognitive and social function, cardiovascular disease, depression, and body mass index, independently mediated the severity of HL and tinnitus, and presented HL and/or tinnitus.Frailty phenotypes have divergent association with HL and tinnitus.

It occurs as a consequence of brain damage localized in various cortical and/or subcortical structures, but mainly in parietotemporal areas of the right hemisphere. Neglect syndrome is a heterogeneous cluster of modally specific deficiency signs and often coexists with changes in emotional status and poor self-awareness. According to different criteria of classification, neglect may be perceptual (visual, tactile, auditory) or motor and it may manifest itself in one or in several modalities, and concern personal, peripersonal, extrapersonal, and even imaginal space. Since neglect belongs to cognitive disorders, it cannot be attributed to basic sensory or motor deficits and it should be clearly differentiated from them. Dynamic changes over time are typical of this syndrome, which is commonly seen in the early stages of the disease and in many neglect patients remits completely over a few months. However, in chronic forms, less or more intensive neglect features may disrupt patients’ functioning for a long time and limit efficacy of rehabilitation. There are many different standardised and clinical assessment procedures of hemineglect. Clinical and functional tasks should be analysed along with behavioural observation in natural situations as well as interview data.

Understanding the symptoms of AD, arising out of memory loss, requires deeper insights into what initiates the memory (the sensory inputs from the five sense organs), the different types of memories (explicit, implicit memories, their sub types and associative memory etc.), how the memory signals are modified at the level of the neuron, (analog to digital signals) and the synapse (sensitization, habituation and Long term potentiation / depression etc.), the processing that the inputs received , undergo (encoding, consolidation /organization, storage and retrieval) in higher brain centres (amygdala, hippocampus prefrontal vortex etc.) and also the role played by the various receptors (NMDA, AMPA and the kinase receptors), the neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, Norepineprine, Gama aminobutic acid, serotonin etc.), the central network systems involved (central executive network, salience network, and the default mode network).

      "abstract": "Abstract Children in institutional care experience many forms of sensory deprivation. Crib confinement and swaddling limit tactile experience, motor activity, vestibular and proprioceptive stimulation, and visual input. Quiet orphanage rooms reduce auditory exposures. Liquid and puréed diets diminish oralmotor stimulation. When sensory experiences are disturbed, children may develop disorders of sensory integration (DSI). This disorder is not discussed in many general pediatric textbooks, yet has gained increasing recognition as a theoretical and practical explanation for many behavioral and developmental problems in young children. Disorders of sensory integration are discussed in books on autism and in some developmental pediatric books.",

      "title": "Maternal Depression, Mothering and Child Development",
      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder of affect characterized by persistent sadness or anhedonia (an inability to experience pleasure), typically accompanied by additional symptoms such as negative cognitions (self-perceptions of failure, feelings of guilt, and/or suicidal thoughts), somatic dysfunction (fatigue, loss of appetite, fatigue, disturbances in sleep), and impairment in daily functioning (e.g., indecisiveness) (Gelfand & Teti, 1990).When such a symptom pattern persists for at least two consecutive weeks and is not accompanied by period manic swings, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) identifies it as a major depressive episode (MDD).A formal DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of MDD can be given for a single major depressive episode, or for multiple, recurring episodes over time, which is common.Other depressive disorders identified in DSM-IV-TR include dysthymic disorder, and adjustment disorder with depressed mood.Depression is more likely to occur under adverse circumstances, such as poverty, single parenthood (Gallagher, Hobfoll, Ritter, Lavin, 1997;Grant, Jack, Fitzpatrick, & Ernst, 2011), and chronic illness (Davidson, Echeverry, Katon, Lin, & Von Korff, 2011), and it may also be co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders.It is common to find, for example, that depression co-occurs with anxiety (Balta, & Paparrigopoulos, 2010) and that chronic depression is a salient feature of some personality disorders (Brieger, Ehrt, Bloeink, & Marneros, 2002).Because of the ubiquity of depressed mood as a feature of psychiatric, medical, and psychosocial conditions, researchers frequently focus on the severity and chronicity of depressive symptoms as a predictor of behavior in different contexts, using well-established, validated questionnaires that tap directly into participants' level of sadness, anhedonia, negative dysfunctional cognitions, somatic complaints, and impairments in daily living.Such measures include the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Steer, & Garbin, 1988), the Center for Epidemiological Studies -Depression scale (Radloff, 1977), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Hamilton, 1960).These assessments tap the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms and provide overall scores and cut points that, when exceeded, identify individuals with clinical levels of symptom severity.www.intechopen.",

      "title": "Spinal Cord: Anatomical Overview and Selected Pathologies",
      "abstract": "Abstract The brain and the spinal cord work together to provide sensory perception and motor function to the body. These processes are accomplished by connections that occur between the brain and the peripheral nervous system through the spinal cord. Injury to the spinal cord can lead to significant deficits. Traumatic events can lead to compression, ischaemia or destruction of the spinal cord with consequential weakness, paralysis, sensory disturbances or urinary incontinence. Traumatic spinal cord injuries are classified as either complete (complete loss of motor and sensory function) or incomplete injuries (preservation of some motor or sensory function distal to the site of injury). The spinal cord can also be the site of aberrant neoplastic growth (spinal cord tumours) or immune‐modulated pathologies that lead to destruction and damage to the spinal cord (multiple sclerosis (MS)). Tumours, vascular diseases, infections, inflammatory diseases, demyelinating diseases and nutritional diseases can all result in damage to the spinal cord. Key Concepts: The vertebrae are specifically arranged to allow protection to the spinal cord as well as supporting and permitting movement of the trunk and limbs. The spinal cord is divided into distinct regions that provide innervation to different regions of the body. There are ascending sensory tracts and descending motor tracts connecting the spinal cord to the brain. These tracts are located regionally in the spinal cord according to their function, and injury to a particular region leads to symptoms that correlate with the respective function of the damaged area. Spinal cord tumours can be primary (arise from the spinal cord or its surrounding meninges) or secondary to metastatic spread. Tumours are classified according to their location relative to the dura mater, which surrounds the spinal cord. Vascular malformations result in abnormal flow of blood within the spinal cord. They often shunt blood directly between arteries and veins, bypassing the capillary network. These malformations have a propensity to bleed. If an artery providing blood to the spinal cord is blocked or occluded, spinal cord infarct or stroke ensues. Pathogens in the blood can enter the central nervous system (CNS; brain and spinal cord) and lead to infection, inflammatory response and damage to the spinal cord. Inflammatory diseases often arise idiopathically (cause unknown); some association exists between viral infections and autoimmune diseases. Demyelination of nerves and destruction of spinal cord tracts typically result and is seen in conditions such as sarcoidosis, transverse myelitis and Guillain–Barré. Autoimmune diseases result when a maladaptive immune system recognises the host tissue as foreign material and mounts an inappropriate immune response. Multiple sclerosis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis are two disorders in which one's immune system mounts an attack against normal white matter of the CNS. Vitamin B12 is obtained through diet and is important for the formation and maintenance of the myelin sheath that surrounds neurons. Traumatic injury to the spinal cord most commonly occurs due to motor vehicle accidents and can lead to paraplegia (lower extremity paralysis) or quadriplegia (upper and lower extremity paralysis). An incomplete spinal cord injury is one in which some motor or sensory function is preserved distal to the level of injury. Treatment consists of realignment and stabilisation of the vertebral column, decompression of mass lesions and prevention of hypoxia and hypotension (preventing the spinal cord from being deprived of oxygen and blood nutrients).",

It is an innate disorder and combines several previously used definitions of mental syndromes and diseases into one diagnostic unit.

For instance, the child practices non-verbal communication speaks very little, and repeatedly makes the same movement with his fingers, arms, or legs. Such a person may have intact intelligence and the ability to live in society, but ASD is often associated with cognitive impairments of varying severity.

Examples of ABIs include traumatic brain injury, stroke (ischaemic and haemorrhagic), infections (e.g. encephalitis, meningitis), hypoxia or oxygen starvation (often occurring following cardiac arrest) and enduring difficulties following the resection of brain tumours. Difficulties that emerge from these brain lesions are complex, multi-faceted and enduring. Psychological needs are central, including anxiety, depression, anger and irritability, post-traumatic stress and struggles to adjust to the condition (Williams and Evans 2003). These often occur alongside physical restrictions (reduced, mobility, balance, sensation), cognitive impairments (problems in information processing, attention, memory, planning and organising, visuospatial perception and social communication) and strain in interpersonal relationships, with progressive social isolation developing over time (Elsass and Kinsella 1987).",

      "abstract": "Autism is a complex developmental disability that typically appears during the first three years of life and is usually diagnosed between the ages of two and three years (2-4). The term autism refers to not one disorder but a group of disorders known as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). ASD is described as impairment in one or more of the following three categories: reciprocal social interaction, communication, and specific pattern of behaviors, interest, and activities. For any of these impairments, the child has the potential to display distressed behaviors (5). Distressed behaviors can include verbal outburst, self stimulatory behaviors, aggression, etc. and various other behaviors of concerns. Distressed behaviors, such as hand flapping, appear to form a functional response to stimuli this response often negatively impacts others. These behaviors are more likely among persons who are receiving aversive stimulation, such as having to engage in non preferred academic task. (5). Of concern in this paper is can the use of physical activity decrease distressed behavior. The literature demonstrates that increasing physical activity can has also demonstrated decreased distressed behaviors; unfortunately physical education programs have been decreasing in many public schools (11). Along with academic and behavioral benefits, there is a well established link between physical activity and positive health outcomes. A large part of this risk is associated with physical inactivity. The majority of literature regarding physical activity involves children who are typically developing. This study will apply these findings to a student with Autism. This research will introduce three ten minute bouts of noncontingent physical activity per day will decrease distressed behavior and increase time-on-task. A single subject design was utilized to observe a student with autism in a classroom setting. It was hypothesized that a correlation exists between physical activity, distressed behavior, and time-on-task. During this study a wealth of data were collected regarding the impact of physical activity on distressed behaviors and time-on-task. The Fischer exact probability test was significance (p =.025); from base line through intervention the subject decreased the number of disruptive behaviors. This study demonstrated that physical activity should be implemented amongst students with Autism to decrease distressed behaviors for a single subject.",

      "title": "Semantic Dementia and Primary Progressive Aphasia: A Problem of Categorization?",
      "abstract": "The relationship between semantic dementia (SD) and primary progressive aphasia (PPA) has been the subject of debate ever since the syndromes were first described, in converging streams of research from the neuropsychological and neurologic communities. The most salient clinical features of SD are anomia with circumlocution and semantic paraphasia, single-word comprehension deficit, and reduced category fluency. Of critical importance is the fact that patients also show deficits on non-verbal tasks using visual, auditory, and other modalities, suggesting that the key impairment in SD is a breakdown in conceptual knowledge rather than a specific problem with language. The finding of item consistency between the various tests supports this view. The order in which the features appear can be explained by the variable degree of redundancy in access to semantic knowledge from the different perceptual modalities. Atrophy is seen in the anterior and inferior temporal lobe rather than in classic language areas, further distancing SD from aphasic syndromes. Semantic dementia and progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA) share some clinical and pathologic characteristics with frontal variant frontotemporal dementia, but there are also clear differences between the three syndromes. We believe that many patients described as having fluent primary progressive aphasia in fact have early SD. Semantic dementia is a well-defined syndrome, distinct from PNFA but related to it within the spectrum of frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes.",

Each year many children and adults in Scandinavia suffer an acquired brain injury, but the special needs of this group are often overlooked. Because of the wide variety of the different types of brain injury, there are many different types of symptoms. Some of these may escape detection in the first place as they may not show up for several years. Other symptoms, especially those connected with dysfunctions in the executive system, do not always show up in formal neuropsychological testing. The outcome depends on many different factors. The most important are the size and severity of the lesion, the age of the child, the support from the family and other network, and the child's personality before the injury. Though there are many differences in this group, most of the children will suffer from disturbances in one or more of the following areas: memory, concentration, energy, executive functions, perception, social skills, language and communication. The best treatment will often be a form of cognitive rehabilitation. A cognitive rehabilitation will always start with a thorough assessment which must include formal and informal testing, the latter including observations and performance of real-life tasks. The training may take different forms, like direct training of the function, learning of compensatory strategies or the use of different compensating tools.",

      "abstract": "Secure attachments with caregivers play a critical role in helping children develop a capacity to modulate physiological arousal. Loss of ability to regulate the intensity of feelings and impulses is possibly the most far-reaching effect of trauma and neglect. It has been shown that most abused and neglected children develop disorganized attachment patterns. The inability to modulate emotions gives rise to a range of behaviors that are best understood as attempts at self-regulation. These include aggression against others, self-destructive behavior, eating disorders, and substance abuse. The capacity to regulate internal states affects both self-definition and one's attitude toward one's surroundings. Abused children often fail to develop the capacity to express specific and differentiated emotions: Their difficulty putting feelings into words interferes with flexible response strategies and promotes acting out. Usually, these behaviors coexist, which further complicates diagnosis and treatment. Affective dysregulation can be mitigated by safe attachments, secure meaning schemes, and pharmacological interventions that enhance the predictability of somatic responses to stress. The ability to create symbolic representations of terrifying experiences promotes taming of terror and desomatization of traumatic memories.",

Por otro lado, la depresion es un trastorno del estado de animo que en altos niveles de gravedad muestra en adultos mayores alteraciones cognitivas significativas que pueden confundirse con un sindrome demencial. Se reporta el caso de una mujer de 75 anos de edad con datos de un probable trastorno depresivo mayor y con quejas de perdida de memoria desde hace 3 anos.

It is estimated that SYNGAP1 loss of function variants have an incidence of 1 to 4/10,000 individuals, mostly occurring de novo, even if few cases of vertical transmission of mosaic mutations have been reported. Loss-of-function mutations within this gene have been related with an epileptic encephalopathy characterized by eyelid myoclonia with absences (EMA) and myoclonic-atonic seizures (MAE) with early onset, commonly resistant to antiepileptic drugs (AED). Epilepsy is often associated with other clinical features, including truncal and/or facial hypotonia and/or ataxia with a wide-based and unsteady gate. Other clinical signs are intellectual disability, developmental delay, and behavioral and speech impairment, in a context of a normal neuroimaging study. In selected cases, dysmorphic features, skeletal abnormalities, and eye involvement are also described. The diagnosis of the disorder is usually established by multigene panel and, in unsolved cases, by exome sequencing. Management of the affected individuals involves different specialists and is mainly symptomatic. No clinical trials about the efficacy of AED in SYNGAP1 encephalopathy have been performed yet and Lamotrigine and valproate are commonly prescribed. In more than half of cases, however, epilepsy is refractory to AED.",

      "abstract": "Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) describes a neurodegenerative syndrome characterized by progressive difficulties in cortical visual and other posterior cortical functions consistent with parieto-occipital and occipito-temporal involvement. It is increasingly recognized that many patients develop difficulties with other aspects of daily living, in particular, with language and communication. We present a case emphasizing how language difficulties may emerge in PCA. Difficulties are interpreted as arising from interacting effects of linguistic deficits and impaired detection of nonverbal (particularly, visual) turns that normally facilitate, schedule, and disambiguate the exchange of verbal messages between speakers. We propose that relatively simple speech and language therapy interventions may hold promise in addressing language and communication difficulties as secondary features of PCA by targeting the behaviors of both the person with PCA and their communication partners.",

      "title": "Interventions for the Prevention of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and Sudden Unexplained Death in Infancy: A Review of Guidelines [Internet]",
      "abstract": "Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is defined as the sudden and unexplained death of an infant under the age of one (i.e., death for which a cause is not found even after a thorough investigation including review of clinical history, examination of death scene and a complete autopsy). Sudden unexplained death in infancy (SUDI) also known as Sudden unexplained infant death is a term used to describe sudden, unexpected and unexplained death of an infant for which external risk factors may be present. SUDI is a blanket term that encompasses SIDS, other unexplained infant deaths, and explained infant suffocations. SIDS and SUDI are not diagnoses. Risk factors for SIDS fall under three groups: intrinsic risk factors (e.g., male sex, prematurity, exposure to cigarette smoke), extrinsic risk factors (e.g., prone or side sleep position, bed sharing, overheating) and exogenous factors (e.g., ethnicity, climate, geographical location). It has been shown that racial and ethnic disparities (such as Indigenous peoples and other racial minorities) and vulnerabilities (such as low socioeconomic status, fewer social supports, those experiencing problems with housing, violence or mental illness) may contribute to increased risk of SIDS.,In Canada, the incidence of SUDI was the highest in 1980 with a rate of 2.07 SUDI per 1,000 live births. The rates of SUDI and SIDS have since decreased, especially since the 1990s. In 2018, there were ten deaths classified as SIDS in Canada. A global decrease in the incidence of SIDS can be attributed to widespread “Back-to-Sleep” campaigns, which were aimed to promote placing babies in a supine position for sleeping., Several similar risk reduction strategies, primarily focused on sleep position, have been implemented globally with the aim of reducing the incidence of SIDS and SUDI., The “Back-to-sleep” campaign was later expanded to the “Safe-to-sleep” campaign in 2012 to involve new and evolved evidence for preventing SIDS. As a result of continued research, guidelines regarding the prevention of SIDS and SUDI have been developed and updated throughout the last three decades.A previous CADTH Summary of Abstracts report, published in 2016, briefly summarized evidence-based guidelines for the prevention of SIDS. The purpose of this report is to summarize and critically appraise evidence-based guidelines that were published within the last five years regarding interventions for the prevention of SIDS or SUDI.",

      "abstract": "Summary The incidence of casualties in an institution for mentally retarded children is shown to be about three times as great as in the normal Danish child population. The circumstances concerned are analysed by means of a retrospective investigation to elucidate the mechanisms involved and the contributory factors. The investigation reveals that there is a definite relationship between the degree of mental handicap and the underlying disease (e.g. epilepsy and/or cerebral paresis, mon‐golism etc.) and the incidence of casualties. Other types of incapacity such as motor handicap, anaesthesia, defective sight or hearing and other physical disease (e.g. hydrocephalus) may predispose to accidents. Some children are undoubtedly more accident‐prone than others and the cause may be found in their disease (most frequently epilepsy) while, in others, purposeless motor activity and the inability to learn from experience combined with severe or profound mental retardation appear to be responsible. Phases of accident‐proneness may be associated with the acquiring of new skills. Some prophylactic measures are suggested which should be considered when new institutions are planned. A broad spectrum of somatic, developmental, handicap, environmental, emotional and mental factors interplay in the production of accidents in mentally retarded patients. Attempts should be made to analyse the mechanism of every accident so that appropriate prophylactic measures can be undertaken.",

      "abstract": "La Enfermedad de Párkinson es una enfermedad neurodegenerativa que produce el deterioro del siste- ma nervioso y, de entre la generalidad de síntomas que produce, va disminuyendo la capacidad de hablar en la persona que la padece. El objetivo de esta propuesta de intervención es conseguir que esa persona afectada sea capaz de ex- presarse oralmente de manera comprensible para que pueda desenvolverse de forma independiente en su ambiente cotidiano. Para ello, es imprescindible la rehabilitación de los mecanismos involucrados en el habla que se han visto deteriorados por esta enfermedad. La metodología utilizada para recuperar estos mecanismos se fundamenta en técnicas desarrolladas por Thaut y Hömberg en lo que se denomina Musicoterapia Neurológica, vertiente de la musicoterapia orientada a preservar o rehabilitar disfunciones cognitivas, motoras y del lenguaje ocasionadas por lesiones sobrevenidas o condiciones de degeneración neurológica. En el caso de las disfunciones del lenguaje, se trata de utilizar el canto de modo terapéutico sirviéndose, por un lado, de actividades de relajación, respiración y emisión vocal para mejorar la fonación; por otro, de ejercicios dirigidos a recuperar la movilidad de los órganos articulatorios para la adecuada producción de vocales y letras y, por último, de actividades de ritmo, entonación, melodía y acentuación para recuperar la expresividad del habla.

Abstract Parkinson's Disease is a neurodegenerative disease that causes deterioration of the nervous system and, among the generality of symptoms it produces, the ability to speak in the person who suffers from it decreases. The objective of this intervention proposal is to ensure that the affected person is able to express themselves orally in a comprehensible manner so that they can function independently in their daily environment.To achieve this, it is essential to rehabilitate the speech mechanisms that have been impai- red by this disease. The methodology used to recover these mechanisms is based on techniques developed by Thaut and Hömberg in what is called Neurological Music Therapy, an aspect of music therapy aimed at preserving or rehabilitating cognitive, motor and language dysfunctions caused by sudden injuries or neurological degeneration conditions. In the case of language dysfunctions, it is about using singing therapeutically using, on the one hand, rela- xation, breathing and vocal emission activities to improve phonation; on the other hand, exercises aimed at recovering the mobility of the articulatory organs for the adequate production of vowels and letters and, finally, rhythm, intonation, melody and accentuation activities to recover the expressiveness of speech.

      "title": "Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder",
      "abstract": "Frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (FTNCD) represents a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases that compromise function of frontal brain networks, resulting in cognitive and behavioral deficits (see Box 65- ). More often referred to as frontotemporal dementia in the medical literature, FTNCD is a common cause of dementia among patients ages 45–65 years and comprises two sometimes overlapping clinical syndromes: behavioral-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Bv-FTNCD) and language-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Lv-FTNCD) (Table 3- ). The latter syndrome includes two subtypes: progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) and semantic dementia. DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Major or Mild Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder. The disturbance has insidious onset and gradual progression. Either (1) or (2): Behavioral variant: Three or more of the following behavioral symptoms: Behavioral disinhibition. Apathy or inertia. Loss of sympathy or empathy. Perseverative, stereotyped or compulsive/ritualistic behavior. Hyperorality and dietary changes. Prominent decline in social cognition and/or executive abilities. Language variant: Prominent decline in language ability, in the form of speech production, word finding, object naming, grammar, or word comprehension. Relative sparing of learning and memory and perceptual-motor function. The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular disease, another neurodegenerative disease, the effects of a substance, or another mental, neurological, or systemic disorder. Probable frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder is diagnosed if either of the following is present; otherwise, possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder should be diagnosed: Evidence of a causative frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder genetic mutation, from either family history or genetic testing. Evidence of disproportionate frontal and/or temporal lobe involvement from neuroimaging. Possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder is diagnosed if there is no evidence of a genetic mutation, and neuroimaging has not been performed. Coding note: For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with behavioral disturbance, code first 331.19 (G31.09) frontotemporal disease, followed by 294.11 (F02.81) probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with behavioral disturbance. For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, without behavioral disturbance, code first 331.19 (G31.09) frontotemporal disease, followed by 294.10 (F02.80) probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, without behavioral disturbance. For possible major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, code 331.9 (G31.9) possible major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration. ( Note: Do not use the additional code for frontotemporal disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) For mild neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, code 331.83 (G31.84). ( Note: Do not use the additional code for frontotemporal disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) FTNCD involves a variety of largely nonoverlapping neuropathological patterns that are distinct from those observed among persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD). These frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) pathological subtypes include diseases that are characterized by aggregation of one of three proteins in affected frontal or temporal areas of the cerebral cortex: tau, transactive response DNA-binding protein (TDP-43), and fused-in-sarcoma (FUS). Other less common pathologies have been described. Clinical symptomatology may provide clues about the underlying FTLD subtype, but there are no strict associations between Bv-FTNCD or Lv-FTNCD and a particular histopathology. Clinical features of behavioral-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Bv-FTNCD) and language-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Lv-FTNCD), including progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) and semantic dementia (SD) Subtype Symptoms Cognitive profile Neuroimaging Motor findings Neuropathology Bv-FTNCD Behavioral disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, repetitive or stereotyped motor behaviors, and hyperorality Deficits in attention, working memory, set shifting, mental flexibility, response inhibition, and abstract reasoning, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Right hemispheric frontal and/or anterior temporal atrophy, particularly involving the orbitofrontal, insular, and anterior cingulate cortices Motor neuron disease in 10%–15%; Parkinsonian findings or supranuclear gaze disturbance in others FTLD-tau, FTLD-TDP, FTLD-FUS, and others Lv-FTNCD (PNFA) Slow, effortful, and telegraphic speech; dysarthria; agrammatisms; and occasional asymmetric right foot and hand motor impairment Agrammatical speech, decreased phonemic fluency, and apraxia of speech, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Left frontoinsular and perisylvian atrophy Asymmetric Parkinsonian signs, apraxia, focal dystonia, myoclonus, alien limb phenomenon, supranuclear gaze disturbance, axial rigidity, and postural instability FTLD-tau in most cases Lv-FTNCD (SD) Decreased object naming and single word comprehension Impaired naming, surface dyslexia, and prosopagnosia, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Asymmetric anterior and lateral temporal atrophy, usually left more than right Less common than in other FTNCD subtypes FTLD-TDP in most cases Note. FTLD = frontotemporal lobar degeneration; FUS = fused-in-sarcoma; TDP = transactive response DNA-binding protein. There are two general approaches to treatment of FTNCD: disease modification and symptomatic management. Disease-modifying therapies target pathogenic molecules and thereby alter, slow, or arrest the disease process. Unfortunately, no disease-modifying therapies are available for persons with FTNCD at this time. Symptomatic management attempts to control disease manifestations alone, and it is the only approach to FTNCD currently available.",

      "abstract": "Diseases with movement disorders may be difficult to diagnose, both at the onset, when motor symptoms are mild and not sufficiently specific (e.g., difficulty in manipulating objects), or at end stage when distinctive motor signs are diluted in a severe and polymorphous clinical picture (eg, gait disorder with postural instability and cognitive decline in aged patients). Erroneous diagnoses are not infrequent, even in the most common disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). [1] Some of these errors may be avoided if the cognitive dysfunctions that often accompany these diseases are included in the diagnostic criteria.\n\nIn general, the cognitive disturbances found in movement disorders are in the category of ``subcortical dementia,'' consisting of a frontal lobe-like syndrome, without genuine amnesia or impairment of instrumental functions (aphasia, apraxia, or agnosia). Except for a few illnesses, such as essential tremor and idiopathic dystonia, in which intellectual deterioration is absent, subtle but specific cognitive deficits can frequently be detected in patients with a variety of diseases accompanied by movement disorders. [2] This is explained by the neuronal pathways connecting the basal ganglia to the cortex projecting not only to regions involved in the control of movements (motor, premotor, supplementary motor areas) but also to cortical areas contributing to cognitive functions (prefrontal cortex). In each of these diseases, the loss of different specific populations of neurons in the basal ganglia produces not only a characteristic motor syndrome but also a recognizable pattern of neuropsychological deficits. The use of appropriate neuropsychological tests to detect these deficits can therefore contribute to the diagnosis of such diseases.\n\nThis brief review will not deal with disorders caused by subcortical lesions of nondegenerative origin (tumors, sequelae of trauma or stroke, inflammatory and metabolic disorders, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, etc.) or with easily identified neurodegenerative diseases, i.e., when motor disability is prominent …",

SOD may manifest as strabismus, nystagmus, decreased visual acuity, or visual impairment; as an endocrine dysfunction in isolation; or in addition to mental retardation, cerebral palsy, developmental delay, or delayed growth.This article reviews the presenting signs and symptoms of SOD, optic nerve hypoplasia, consequences of an absent septum pellucidum, endocrine findings associated with SOD, SOD diagnosis determination, syndromes associated with SOD, and optometry's role in caring for these patients. It also examines two cases that demonstrate the variety and severity of visual and physical impairments associated with SOD.SOD has a multi-factorial etiology, including insult during pregnancy (e.g., viral infections, gestational diabetes); vascular disruption; or a genetic mutation. Children with SOD may manifest a variety of visual and/or physical symptoms that range from mild to severe.The associated vision, developmental, neurologic, and endocrine disturbances require early diagnosis and management. Optometrists need to be aware of optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) and consider this diagnosis in patients with visual acuity loss. A comprehensive eye examination and visual-field assessment should be completed in addition to appropriate referrals for endocrine, developmental, and/or cognitive anomalies.",

The etiology remains unclear, but there may be a genetic predisposition (haplotype HLA-DR1), associated with environmental factors [6,7]. The syndrome is characterized by hypersomnia (up to 20 hours a day), cognitive symptoms (mainly derealisation, but also confusion, delusions, and/or hallucinations, memory impairments), behavioral symptoms (sexual disinhibition, irritability/aggression, compulsive eating), and mental symptoms such as depression and anxiety [4,8-13]. There are also physical signs such as autonomic dysfunction, weight gain; and at the end of the episodes, amnesia, elation, and depression. It is important to underline that these symptoms and signs are generally not combined in a single patient. The average length of an episode is 8 to 10 days, and episodes lasting several months are relatively exceptional. They usually recover after a period of about 8 years.",

The usual environmental and psychological factors that influence maturation are modified by the attitudes of other persons toward the disabled one and by his own attitudes toward his defects and the limitations which they impose upon him. During the first few formative years, the normal child develops increasing physical independence as his motility and equilibrium patterns mature, enabling him to erect himself against gravity and to locomote independently. This growing capability is paralleled by the ego development and the appreciation of body image concept. The development of speech is a major step in communication and greatly facilitates the child's contact with his environment. The alteration of these patterns of maturation by central or peripheral neuromuscular disorders may influence profoundly the individual's personality. This results from the anxiety",

Further, consciousness of actions (voluntariness) and consciousness of motives (intentionality) are not necessarily associated. Illness behavior can be learned and reinforced and is a potential confounder in the association between illness or injury and impairment or disability. Illness behavior is not an impairing condition according to the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), and a table in the article describes the characteristics of the symptom magnification syndrome and other related conditions. Three diagnoses—somatic symptom disorders, illness anxiety disorder, and conversion disorder—possibly are ratable using the AMA Guides . Unsupported and insupportable conclusions regarding symptom exaggeration represent substandard practice because of the importance of such conclusions to the disposition of patients who present for assessment of impairment or disability. Similarly, failure to note and account for illness behavior and symptom exaggeration also represent substandard practice because the goal in impairment ratings is to note and account for all evidence related to the impairment, including the extent of illness behaviors.",

ASD is a condition that influences a child's sensory system that includes touch, smell, taste, hearing, and visual abilities. Typical forms of ASD in the pre-2013 DSM-5 manual also include Asperger's Syndrome; and Pervasive Developmental Disorder. The characteristics of these disorders are similar but may differ significantly. Children with ASD show difficulties or delays with social communication and necessary daily activities. Still, on the other hand, some may present themselves with the average ability to communicate both verbally and non-verbally. These disorders affect social interaction, behavior, interests, and other norms in life. Understanding the method of early intervention may include therapy and mediation that will assist in connecting natural and pharmacological approaches to deal with the treatment of ASD and distinguish standard or fundamental dynamic elements for advancing positive outcomes.",

They may be diagnosed in either the presence or absence of individual mental disorders. In some cases, relational problems may interact with genetic vulnerabilities in contributing to the development of psychopathology. Four major constructs have been investigated that describe nodal areas of relational difficulty in the family and marital environment: structure, communication, expression of affect, and problem solving. Relational problems are best observed and treated directly in a family format in which the conflicted family members are present with the therapist. Genetics, neuroimaging, and family studies are important vehicles for deciphering how interpersonal relationships affect the etiology of both physical and mental disorders.",

Ultimately, patients become wheelchair-bound and experience early death. Neurologic signs that frequently but not reliably coexist include other seizure types (particularly generalized tonic-clonic), progressive ataxia, and dementia. Typically, presentation is in late childhood or adolescence; however, all ages may be affected. Although distinction from more common forms of genetic generalized epilepsy, particularly juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, may be challenging early on, the presence or evolution of 1) progressive neurologic disability, 2) failure to respond to antiepileptic drug therapy, and 3) background slowing on EEG should suggest PME. Importantly, inappropriate therapy in the genetic generalized epilepsies may result in ataxia, impaired cognition, and uncontrolled seizures, which may mimic PME. PMEs should be distinguished from progressive encephalopathies with seizures (due to degenerative conditions such as GM2 gangliosidosis, nonketotic hyperglycinemia, Niemann-Pick type C, juvenile Huntington and Alzheimer disease) and progressive myoclonic ataxias, which affect predominantly adults with progressive ataxia, myoclonus, few if any tonic-clonic seizures, and without evidence of dementia.(2,3.)",

Insufficient sleep can have important effects on daytime function by increasing the need to nap, reducing cognitive ability including attention and memory, slowing response time, adversely affecting relationships with friends and family, and contributing to a general sense of being unwell. However, rather than aging per se, circadian rhythm shifts, primary sleep disorders, comorbid medical/psychiatric illnesses, and medication use cause sleep difficulties in older people, which psychosocial factors may also affect. Clinicians should ask elderly patients about satisfaction with sleep. Any sleep complaints warrant careful evaluation of contributing factors and appropriate treatment.",

      "abstract": "Conduction aphasia is a syndrome characterized by impaired repetition in the context of relatively preserved auditory comprehension and fluent speech. The classical conceptualization of conduction aphasia as a disconnection syndrome has been undermined in recent years. Nevertheless, this diagnosis delineates a small subset of individuals with aphasia who have many common cognitive and anatomical characteristics. Conduction aphasia is associated with damage to a relatively narrow and well-defined group of left hemisphere brain structures, which may include the posterior superior temporal lobe, the inferior parietal lobe, and the insula. According to current cognitive neuropsychological frameworks, an impairment in phonological planning for speech production is the common underlying cognitive dysfunction in the majority of cases, which may sometimes be accompanied by an analogous impairment in receptive phonology. Other common features, such as sentence repetition problems and reduced short-term memory span, may be a secondary consequence of the primary phonological impairment. Current approaches to the treatment of conduction aphasia target the underlying impairment in phonological planning. It is argued that the diagnosis of conduction aphasia can be a useful first step toward understanding a person’s language difficulties and planning effective treatment interventions.",

      "abstract": "By 'Dysphasias' we mean disorders of language development in children, as opposed to Aphasias which is the term used for loss of previously acquired language as a consequence of focal cerebral lesions. The definition of Dysphasia refers to alteration in the expression or comprehension of language which cannot be explained by deafness, motor deficit, mental retardation, brain damage, emotional disorders or insufficient exposure to language (DSM IV). Even within this definition there is room for different criteria for inclusion. This is shown by the lack of homogeneity in the populations studied by different authors, depending to some degree on the age of the children studied (the symptoms and signs of dysphagia are not the same in a 3 year old child as in one of school age) and the intellectual level required to rule out mental deficiency. Once the differential diagnosis with other conditions has been established, we should try to situate the dysphasia as being due to faulty reception, emission or both. Allen and Rapin have defined 4 categories of Dysphasia with subtypes which permit more specific classification within the two spheres mentioned above (reception and emission). In the sphere of emission, with characteristics of lack of fluency of speech and better comprehension than elocution are: syntactic phonological deficit syndrome, phonological programming deficit syndrome, verbal dyspraxia and lexical syntactic deficit syndrome. In the sphere of reception, with comprehension more affected than elocution are: verbal auditory agnosia and pragmatic semantic syndrome. Although the work of Allen and Rafin was done on a population of English-speaking children, this classification has also been shown to be useful in the Spanish language. We give a detailed description of these syndromes, illustrating them with video recordings of clinical cases.",

      "abstract": "The effectiveness of the activity of an operator controlling a complex technical system depends not only on his professional qualifications and his vested interest in obtaining a high rating but also on his actual functional state, the most important characteristics of which are: level of alertness, degree of emotional tension, and fatigue. These three factors are closely interrelated in a complex system of reciprocal influences and mutual dependence. Thus, the performance of monotonous, routine operations results not only in emotional indifference but also in a reduction in the level of alertness, in drowsiness, apathy, loss of attention, slowed reactions, missing of important signals, and rapidly increasing fatigue. Excessive emotional tension, which can arise in any type of unforeseen, out-of-the-ordinary situation or in performing familiar operations when time is at a premium, is characterized by disorganization of activity, overhasty reactions, an increase in the number of errors (mainly false alarms), and, of course, increasing fatigue because of an excess consumption of energy.",

      "abstract": "CHARGE is the acronym for Coloboma, Heart malformation, Choanal Atresia, Retardation of growth and/or development, Genital and Ear anomalies. It is a rare genetic syndrome, usually with no family history. From an otological point of view, it is characterized by semicircular canal agenesia, Mondini-type cochlear hypoplasia, frequent vestibular dysfunction, and hearing impairment (ranging from transient OME to profound deafness) (Abadie et al., 2000).Speech and language delay in this syndrome is due not only to hearing problems, but also to mental retardation, facial palsy, oro-lingual motor deficit, and swallowing disorders, which often require enteral feeding or gastrostomy. Moreover, anatomical cochlear or facial nerve anomalies have been described.Due to these aggravating factors, few children affected by CHARGE have undergone cochlear implantation. However, several cochlear implantation centres, including ours, consider that children affected by this syndrome and profound hearing impairment might obtain benefit from a cochlear implant (CI), at least to improve communication, although not necessarily to develop spoken language (Bauer et al., 2002; McArdle et al., 2002; Lanson et al., 2007). This point of view was supported by a previous work about four children with CHARGE and sensorineural hearing loss: communication mode and language reception and expression progressed in a similar way in the two implanted profoundly deaf children as in the two of them with severe hearing impairment and hearing aids (Lina-Granade et al., 2006). Hence, we undertook this case study with more children and a longer follow-up, in order to have a more accurate description of the surgical particularities, fitting, and outcomes of implantation in children with CHARGE.",

      "title": "1687 – Social cognition in patients with dissociative amnesia",
      "abstract": "Introduction Dissociative amnesia is triggered by psychological stress or trauma. Its hallmark is a severe (usually retrograde) memory impairment within episodic-autobiographical domain, occurring without evidence of significant brain damage on conventional structural brain imaging. Objectives This work’s objectives are establishing greater recognition of possible relations between memory performance and social cognition in patients with dissociative amnesia. Aims We review data on social cognition (affective and cognitive theory of mind, simulation, empathy, social judgment, moral judgment) from our own patients with dissociative amnesia. Methods Patients were investigated medically, psychiatrically and with neuropsychological and neuroimaging methods. Results Patients with dissociative amnesia show variable degrees of impairments of components of social cognition, based on their comorbid conditions (e.g. concurrent clinical or subclinical depression), types of memory impairments (e.g. extent of retrograde amnesia, presence of autobiographical semantic deficits), pattern of brain metabolic changes, personality characteristics, neuropsychological profile (performance on executive functions or emotional processing) and testing paradigms. Conclusions The impairment in dissociative amnesia seems to go beyond the conscious mnemonic deficit, encompassing various aspects of social information processing. Knowledge about the pattern of metabolic and micro-structural brain changes in patients with dissociative amnesia as well as a fine-grained analysis of the neural correlates of various aspects of social cognition might provide an understanding of when and how episodic-autobiographical memory contributes to social cognition. As several studies emphasized, some structures involved in mnemonic processing may also play a role in social perception, cognition and behavioural regulation, including future-minded choice behaviour.",

Both the type of pathology and the location of the brain lesion are significant to the clinicians caring for an aphasic patient. Techniques that demonstrate lesion type and site are crucial to the neuropathology of aphasia. Several generalizations can be offered (Benson, 1979a): Aphasia is produced lry damage to brain structures. Neuropathological pro cesses that involve nonbrain portions of the nervous system (e.g., cranial nerves) and secondary neurological dysfunctions such as systemic or psychogenic disorders do not produce aphasic language syndromes. Metabolic and toxic disorders (e.g., hepatic encephalopathy) produce a broad, overall disruption of brain function, not a focal aphasia. Also, because language loss, by definition, is a requirement for aphasia, congenital and developmental disorders in which language failed to develop cannot be considered sources of aphasia.",

Die Aphasie stellt den Oberbegriff für die erworbenen Sprachstörungen dar, deren Differenzierung sowohl vor dem Hintergrund der Diagnostik als auch der Therapie und Prognose bedeutsam ist. Die Primäre Progressive Aphasie (PPA) beruht auf Degenerationen kortikaler Areale und stellt eine Erweiterung der bisherigen Klassifikation in Broca- und Wernicke-Aphasien dar, deren häufigste Ursache zerebrovaskuläre Ereignisse sind. Dysarthrien und Dysarthrophonien bezeichnen Störungen der Artikulation und Stimmgebung, die sowohl aufgrund kortikaler Läsionen als auch auf dem Boden extrapyramidaler Erkrankungen oder durch Erkrankungen des Klein- und Mittelhirns entstehen können. Hierbei können vaskuläre Ereignisse oder Neurodegeneration ursächlich sein. Therapeutische Ansätze sind stark vom Charakter der Erkrankung (progressiv oder regressiv) abhängig.",

      "title": "Sleep and Circadian Rhythm Disorders",
      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are an important aspect of geriatric psychiatry. In the United States, more than half of noninstitutionalized individuals age 65 years and older report chronic sleep difficulties (Foley et al. 1995; \"National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference Statement\" 1991; Prinz et al. 1990). These problems affect quality of life, increase the risk of accidents and falls, and may lead to long-term-care placement (Pollak and Perlick 1991; Pollak et al. 1990; Sanford 1975). Working effectively with elderly individuals requires expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association 2013) includes eight general sleep disorders categories: insomnia disorder, hypersomolence disorder, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, parasomnias, restless legs syndrome, and substance/medication-induced sleep disorder. Patients with these conditions generally complain about some aspect of their sleep and/or waking function. For some patients, the sleep-focused concerns pertain to the quality, timing, amounts, or discontinuity in their sleep. For other patients, primary complaints may focus more on daytime sleepiness or impairment. For a subset of patients, complaints may focus on unusual behaviors occurring in sleep. In this chapter we consider those sleep-wake disorders most commonly encountered in geriatric psychiatry. Among these are those insomnia disorders involving a difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep with associated daytime impairment or distress, as well as those that present as disorders of excessive daytime somnolence characterized by persistent daytime sleepiness that causes significant distress or impairment in function (American Psychiatric Association 2000; American Sleep Disorders Association 1997). The most important disorders of excessive sleepiness are sleep ap-nea, restless legs syndrome/periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), and narcolepsy. Circadian rhythm disorders manifest as a misalignment between an indi-vidual's sleep-wake cycle and the pattern that is desired or required (American Psychiatric Association 2000; American Sleep Disorders Association 1997). The circadian rhythm is important for function because it is a cycle not only of sleep and wakefulness but also of many physiological processes and phe-nomena, including body temperature, alertness, cognitive performance, and hormone release (Czeisler et al. 1990; Folkard and Totterdell 1994; Minors et al. 1994).",

      "abstract": "A 60-year-old, right-handed woman, with no focal brain lesions, suffered from a progressive impairment in recognising people of personal relevance and public figures familiar to her in the premorbid period. The patient did not suffer from general cognitive deterioration. There was no ecological or clear psychometric evidence of visuoperceptual or visuospatial deficits. Her defective person recognition was not overcome by extra-facial (e.g., observing animated people in their usual surroundings) or extra-visual information (e.g., listening to the voice). Moreover, presenting the correct name in the presence of an unrecognised familiar person failed to prompt her familiarity judgement, or retrieval of the relevant biographical knowledge. The patient also had some recognition difficulties with famous buildings and songs as well as with some common objects. It is argued that the patient's difficulty in identifying familiar people was the consequence of progressive loss of stored exemplars of familiar persons and perhaps also of some other \"unique items\" (famous songs and monuments) in an independent subsystem of semantics that we term \"exemplar semantics.\" We discuss the associative (semantic) nature and specificity of the deficit in person knowledge, the possible top-down negative influences of the loss of exemplars in the person recognition system, and the link between the disorders and the right/left temporal lobe.",

Seizures starting in the first year of life including the neonatal period might have a favorable course, such as in infants presenting with benign familial neonatal epilepsy, febrile seizures simplex or acute symptomatic seizures. However, in some cases, the onset of seizures at birth or in the first months of life have a dramatic evolution with severe cerebral impairment. Seizure disorders starting in early life include the \"epileptic encephalopathies\", a group of conditions characterized by drug resistant seizures, delayed developmental skills, and intellective disability. This group of disorders includes early infantile epileptic encephalopathy also known as Ohtahara syndrome, early myoclonic encephalopathy, epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures, infantile spasms syndrome (also known as West syndrome), severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (also known as Dravet syndrome) and, myoclonic encephalopathies in non-progressive disorder. Here we report on seizures manifesting in the first year of life including the neonatal period. Conditions with a benign course, and those with severe evolution are presented. At this early age, clinical identification of seizures, distinction of each of these disorders, type of treatment and prognosis is particularly challenging. The aim of this report is to present the clinical manifestations of each of these disorders and provide an updated review of the conditions associated with seizures in the first year of life.",

Phenotypic expression is highly variable and ranges from severe life‐threatening conditions to only a few associated features. Most common medical problems include: congenital heart disease, in particular conotruncal anomalies; palatal abnormalities, most frequently velopharyngeal incompetence (VPI); immunodeficiency; hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism; genitourinary anomalies; severe feeding/gastrointestinal differences; and subtle dysmorphic facial features. The neurocognitive profile is also highly variable, both between individuals and during the course of development. From infancy onward, motor delays (often with hypotonia) and speech/language deficits are commonly observed. During the preschool and primary school ages, learning difficulties are very common. The majority of patients with 22q11.2DS have an intellectual level that falls in the borderline range (IQ 70–84), and about one‐third have mild to moderate intellectual disability. More severe levels of intellectual disability are uncommon in children and adolescents but are more frequent in adults. Individuals with 22q11.2DS are at an increased risk for developing several psychiatric disorders including attention deficit with hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), anxiety and mood disorders, and psychotic disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we will focus on the developmental phenotypic transitions regarding cognitive development in 22q11.2DS from early preschool to adulthood, and on the changing behavioral/psychiatric phenotype across age, on a background of frequently complex medical conditions. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

      "title": "(Mis)perception of sleep in insomnia: A puzzle and a resolution.",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is prevalent, causing severe distress and impairment. This review focuses on illuminating the puzzling finding that many insomnia patients misperceive their sleep. They overestimate their sleep onset latency (SOL) and underestimate their total sleep time (TST), relative to objective measures. This tendency is ubiquitous (although not universal). Resolving this puzzle has clinical, theoretical, and public health importance. There are implications for assessment, definition, and treatment. Moreover, solving the puzzle creates an opportunity for real-world applications of theories from clinical, perceptual, and social psychology as well as neuroscience. Herein we evaluate 13 possible resolutions to the puzzle. Specifically, we consider the possible contribution, to misperception, of (1) features inherent to the context of sleep (e.g., darkness); (2) the definition of sleep onset, which may lack sensitivity for insomnia patients; (3) insomnia being an exaggerated sleep complaint; (4) psychological distress causing magnification; (5) a deficit in time estimation ability; (6) sleep being misperceived as wake; (7) worry and selective attention toward sleep-related threats; (8) a memory bias influenced by current symptoms and emotions, a confirmation bias/belief bias, or a recall bias linked to the intensity/recency of symptoms; (9) heightened physiological arousal; (10) elevated cortical arousal; (11) the presence of brief awakenings; (12) a fault in neuronal circuitry; and (13) there being 2 insomnia subtypes (one with and one without misperception). The best supported resolutions were misperception of sleep as wake, worry, and brief awakenings. A deficit in time estimation ability was not supported. We conclude by proposing several integrative solutions.",

      "title": "Application of Pediatric Balance Scales in Children with Cerebral Palsy",
      "abstract": "Human postural control involves the complex task to integrate automatic postural responses and multisensory (visual, labyrinthine, and proprioceptive) feedback for the adjustment of motor output.[1] Some multisensory signals provide information for dynamic and static balance, others stabilize body segments (i.e., head, trunk, or arm) to provide a reference for the planning of movements, and finally there are signals that assist in the proper execution of movements. The temporal development of multisensory integration results in the achievement of motor milestones such as rolling, sitting, and walking. By maturation and training, postural adaption may improve until after adolescence.[2] Accuracy of motor learning by visual feedback has revealed that 12-year-old children depend less on visual information than 6 to 8-year-old children.[3] But even after the 12th year of life, protracted development of visual integration may still occur until adulthood. Multisensory integration for postural control involves functional activity of the premotor and supplementary areas, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. In children with cerebral palsy (CP), nonprogressive damage of associated brain areas and subsequent neurologic impairment (spasticity, cocontractions, muscle weakness, and visual impairment) can interfere with the development of static and dynamic balance.[4]",

      "title": "Vulnerability to chronic stress and the phenotypic heterogeneity of presbycusis with subjective tinnitus",
      "abstract": "Age-related functional reserve decline and vulnerability of multiple physiological systems and organs, as well as at the cellular and molecular levels, result in different frailty phenotypes, such as physical, cognitive, and psychosocial frailty, and multiple comorbidities, including age-related hearing loss (ARHL) and/or tinnitus due to the decline in auditory reserve. However, the contributions of chronic non-audiogenic cumulative exposure, and chronic audiogenic stress to phenotypic heterogeneity of presbycusis and/or tinnitus remain elusive. Because of the cumulative environmental stressors throughout life, allostasis systems, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and the sympathetic adrenal–medullary (SAM) axes become dysregulated and less able to maintain homeostasis, which leads to allostatic load and maladaptation. Brain–body communication via the neuroendocrine system promotes systemic chronic inflammation, overmobilization of energetic substances (glucose and lipids), and neuroplastic changes via the non-genomic and genomic actions of glucocorticoids, catecholamines, and their receptors. These systemic maladaptive alterations might lead to different frailty phenotypes and physical, cognitive, and psychological comorbidities, which, in turn, cause and exacerbate ARHL and/or tinnitus with phenotypic heterogeneity. Chronic audiogenic stressors, including aging accompanying ontological diseases, cumulative noise exposure, and ototoxic drugs as well as tinnitus, activate the HPA axis and SAM directly and indirectly by the amygdala, promoting allostatic load and maladaptive neuroplasticity in the auditory system and other vulnerable brain regions, such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). In the auditory system, peripheral deafferentation, central disinhibition, and tonotopic map reorganization may trigger tinnitus. Cross-modal maladaptive neuroplasticity between the auditory and other sensory systems is involved in tinnitus modulation. Persistent dendritic growth and formation, reduction in GABAergic inhibitory synaptic inputs induced by chronic audiogenic stresses in the amygdala, and increased dendritic atrophy in the hippocampus and mPFC, might involve the enhancement of attentional processing and long-term memory storage of chronic subjective tinnitus, accompanied by cognitive impairments and emotional comorbidities. Therefore, presbycusis and tinnitus are multisystem disorders with phenotypic heterogeneity. Stressors play a critical role in the phenotypic heterogeneity of presbycusis. Differential diagnosis based on biomarkers of metabonomics study, and interventions tailored to different ARHL phenotypes and/or tinnitus will contribute to healthy aging and improvement in the quality of life.",

      "title": "Examining the Effect of Work‐Life Imbalance on Cognitive Complaints",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Subjective cognitive complaints (SCCs) are self‐reported cognitive concerns, often without objective impairment and are associated with higher risk of MCI and/or dementia. Moreover, the related subjective cognitive decline is suggested as a form of cognitive impairment, and precursor to Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). Sleep, stress, and anxiety have been shown to explain significant portions of variance in relationships between multi‐morbidity and SCCs. Leisure/social time can mediate stress and negative moods which may prevent worsening cardiovascular and cognitive decline. While there are many barriers to leisure, the most universal limitation is lack of time. Specifically the US has less vacation days and more expected work hours than other nations, leaving little time for rest, resulting in a work‐life imbalance (WLI) causing added stress and possible mood disorders. Though discussions are rising around federal minimum wage, and remote work, there’s little insight into WLI’s impact on long term health outcomes and cognition. Method We explored the effect of markers of WLI (ex: stress, sleep, life satisfaction) on the presence of SCCs in participants (N = 89,976, 51.6% Female, 16.0% Black, M age = 35.64 years) from the 2010 National Health Interview Survey. WLI was defined via a composite score of the subjective measures work‐family responsibility compatibility, social satisfaction, and hours slept. SCC was defined via self‐report of difficulty remembering or concentrating, with reporting at least some difficulty representing the presence of a SCC. Result There was a significant association between WLI and greater reporting of SCCs; (X 2 2, N = 379) = 7.145, p = 0.028. ANOVA analysis further demonstrated the significant influence of a greater presence of WLI on SCCs; F(2,376) = 10.29, p&lt;.001. Those who experienced a higher frequency of SCCs (e.g. difficulty remembering things “all of the time”; [M = 2.4231]) scored highest on the WLI scale followed by the next highest “frequently” (M = 2.3456) and then “sometimes” (M = 2.0428). Conclusion Our results demonstrate potential harmful effects of WLI on the presence SCCs. These results confirm previous research connecting stress and other modifiable risk factors for AD like impaired sleep to SCCs, suggesting an avenue for intervention. Further research is needed to fully illuminate how this relation applies to cognitive decline and ADRD.",

      "title": "Scientific Evaluation of Brahma Rasayana as a Cognitive Enhancer in D-Galactose Induced Cognitive Impairment in Mice",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:Cognition refers to thinking skills and the intellectual skills that allow a person to perceive, acquire, understand and respond to information. This includes the abilities to pay attention, remember and process information, solve problems, organize and reorganize information, communicate and act upon information.1\r\nThe disorders that affect cognition include neurodegenerative disorders, vascular diseases, trauma, toxin, anoxia and infectious processes. Cognitive impairments are deficits in the processes by which persons perceive, encode, store, retrieve and use information. Many processes can lead to cognitive impairment. Neurodegenerative disorders that can affect cognitive ability include Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Pick’s disease, Parkinson’s disease (PD), Lewy body disease, Huntington’s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and cerebellar degeneration. Common vascular disorders that affect cognition include stroke, multiple strokes and cerebral embolic disease. Toxic agents that affect cerebral function (cognition) include carbon monoxide poisoning, adverse drug events and interactions and prolonged exposure to specific toxic chemicals or gases. Electrolyte abnormalities, organ failure and anoxia can also cause cognitive impairments.AIM AND OBJECTIVE:Brahma Rasayana is an Ayurvedic formulation, which contains several herbal constituents and is marketed for the treatment of drowsiness, fatigue, mental weakness, progeriasis, aging and disturbed memory.38\r\nLiterature review indicates that no specific study has been carried out to evaluate the cognition enhancement property of Brahma Rasayana. Some of the ingredients used in Brahma Rasayana have been tested for their cognition enhancing property.20-23 One of the commonly used models to evaluate cognitive impairment is D-Galactose model.\r\nThe aim of this study is\r\n1. Evaluation of in vivo cognition enhancing potential of Brahma Rasayana using D-Galactose induced memory impaired mice.\r\n2. To elucidate the effect of Brahma Rasayana on various neurotransmitters associated with cognitive impairment. SUMMARY:Cognitive impairment is a classic sign of various conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Pick’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Lewy body disease, Huntington’s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and cerebellar degeneration. In market there are a few drugs available for the improvement of cognition. There are several Ayurvedic formulations which are being marketed for this condition. Brahma Rasayana is one such formulation with the memory boosting capacity.\r\nThis study was undertaken to scientifically validate the claim of BR as a cognitive enhancer. The model used for the study was the D-Galactose which is one of the commonly used models for cognition impairment.\r\nDonepezil was used as a standard drug for comparison. The models used to test cognition were Morris water maze and Y-maze test for evaluating spatial memory, Actophotometer and open field tests were used for evaluation of locomotor activity. On all these studies it was seen that BR, especially at the higher dose (i.e 2g/kg p.o), was able to reverse the cognitive impairment induced by D-Galactose. This activity was almost the same as that of Donepezil.\r\nIn order to establish the mechanism of action, the brain levels of acetylcholinesterase (Ach being one of the important neurotransmitters in cognition) and neurotransmitters like Serotonin, Dopamine, Adrenaline, Nor-adrenaline and Glutamate were estimated. Brahma Rasayana at the higher dose (i.e 2g/kg p.o), showed a good anti-cholinesterase activity. The levels of other neurotransmitters like Serotonin, Dopamine, Adrenaline, Nor-adrenaline were increased markedly as compared to the disease group animals. The level of Glutamate was decreased in Donepezil and BR treated group as compared to disease group of animals, which indicates that the excitotoxicity of glutamate was reduced by the both standard and BR. CONCLUSION:From the study it is concluded that Brahma Rasayana, which is marketed with claims for use in the treatment of drowsiness, fatigue, mental weakness, senility/ progeriasis, aging and disturbed memory, has cognition enhancing property at a higher dose of 2g/kg and this action is mediated mainly by the Anticholinesterase activity. It has also shown an improvement in the levels of neurotransmitters like Serotonin, Dopamine, Adrenaline, Nor-adrenaline and Glutamate, which are altered in cognition impairment induced by D-Galactose. This study validates the Ayurvedic claim of Brahma Rasayana as a memory enhancer.\r\nThis claim can be further strengthened by carrying out a systematic clinical study using Brahma Rasayana in cognition impaired patients.",

      "abstract": "Depressive Storungen konnen neben den Erstrangsymptomen „depressive Stimmung“, „Verlust von Interesse oder Freude“ und „erhohte Ermudbarkeit“ mit einer grosen Anzahl an weiteren Symptomen einhergehen. Folgende kognitive Defizite sind kennzeichnend: Storungen der kognitiven Flexibilitat, des Arbeitsgedachtnisses, des freien Abrufs von Gedachtnisinhalten, der geteilten Aufmerksamkeit und von Teilbereichen der selektiven Aufmerksamkeit.\nDie Bundesanstalt fur Strasenwesen (BASt) und wissenschaftliche Forschungsarbeiten konnten eine Reihe an Leistungs- und Personlichkeitsmasen identifizieren, welche eine ausreichende psychische Leistungsfahigkeit im Strasenverkehr gewahrleisten sollen. Obwohl sich die hierbei hervorgehobenen kognitiven Leistungsfunktionen nahezu umfassend mit den Defizitbereichen bei depressiven Storungen uberschneiden und bisher kein rein linearer Zusammenhang zwischen der Schwere der depressiven Symptomatik und dem Auspragungsgrad kognitiver Beeintrachtigungen gefunden werden konnte, besagt die aktuelle Rechtslage, dass lediglich bei schweren depressiven Episoden die Fahreignung anzuzweifeln sei.\nZiele der vorliegenden Arbeit: Zum einen sollte uberpruft werden, ob sich die in der Literatur berichteten Unterschiede zwischen depressiven Patienten und gesunden Vergleichspersonen in der kognitiven Leistungsfahigkeit, bei der Fahrkompetenz, bei der Selbstbeschreibung und im Risikoverhalten finden lassen. Zum anderen wurde zu bestimmen versucht, welche dieser Mase hauptverantwortlich fur Unterschiede in der Fahrkompetenz sind.\nMethode: Hierzu bearbeitete eine Gruppe stationar-psychiatrischer Patienten mit unipolarer Depression jeweils unmittelbar nach stationarer Aufnahme und bei Entlassung (neuro-) psychologische Testverfahren. Daruber hinaus wurde zeitnah zu den Testungen eine praktische Fahrerprobung in einem Fahrschulauto durchgefuhrt. Ein dritter Schwerpunkt der vorliegenden Arbeit bestand darin, die wissenschaftliche Gute dieser praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe zu uberprufen. Alle Untersuchungen wurden parallel auch mit einer Kontrollgruppe korperlich und psychisch gesunder Probanden durchgefuhrt. \nErgebnisse: Die Fahrverhaltensprobe konnte strenge wissenschaftliche und verkehrspsychologische Anforderungen erfullen. Es zeigte sich, dass sich die Patienten neben dem Ausmas ihrer subjektiven und objektiven Depressivitat, auch in einer Reihe von Leistungs- und Personlichkeitsmasen von den Kontrollpersonen unterschieden. Es liesen sich sowohl einzelne wie auch Kombinationen an Variablen identifizieren, die bereits fur die eher geringe Stichprobengrose der Studie die Fahrkompetenz der Probanden mit einem zufrieden stellenden Mas an Sensitivitat und Spezifitat vorhersagten. \nDiskussion: Mit dieser Arbeit wurde erstmals bei Patienten mit mittelschwerer Depression sowohl anhand neuropsychologischer Testverfahren als auch mit Hilfe einer praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe untersucht, welche Auswirkungen deren Erkrankung auf die Fahrkompetenz hat. Vorangegangene Studien konnten aber bereits die Annahme der BASt, dass nur bei schweren depressiven Episoden die Fahreignung fraglich sei, deutlich in Frage stellen. Die vorliegende Studie stutzt die bisherigen Erkenntnisse und zeigt zusatzlich auf, dass auch bei einer praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe, die den Anforderungen der BASt entspricht, nicht von vergleichbaren Leistungen bei depressiven Patienten und gesunden Kontrollen auszugehen ist. Die geringe Stichprobengrose lasst allerdings eine Generalisierung der Ergebnisse nicht zu. Weitere Forschungsarbeit in dieser Richtung ist erforderlich.",

Degenerative and vascular diseases involving the central nervous system (CNS) may impair sleep either as a result of the brain lesion or because of illness-related discomfort (motor immobility, social and familial impairment, depression, drugs). Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint. CNS lesions and/or dysfunction in three specific neurological conditions (fatal familial insomnia, Morvan's chorea, and delirium tremens) impair the basic mechanisms of sleep generation inducing a syndrome in which the inability to sleep is consistently associated with motor and sympathergic overactivation.

TBI-related cognitive impairment is common in veterans who have served in recent conflicts in the Middle East and is often related to blasts from improvised explosive devices.

      "abstract": "Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are behaviourally defined syndromes where the etiology and pathophysiology are not very well understood. If the child has been diagnosed with autism, parents already face special behavioural challenges. What makes ASD even more difficult, are the many other medical health issues that often arise in this population.The purpose of this article is to summarise the latest understanding of autism’s commonly associated physical and mental health conditions.Methods: An analysis of relevant literature, sources from the internet and published literature, personal experience and observations of the author.Recent findings: Autism is a disorder of the whole body. It is often in co-morbidity with: epilepsy, gastrointestinal disorders, neuro-inflammation and immunological disorders, asthma, eczema, sleep disturbances, eating and feeding disorders, food allergies, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), headaches, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, depression, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Fragile X syndrome, intellectual disability, nonverbal learning disorder, motor clumsiness, Tourette syndrome, sensory problems, tuberous sclerosis, oxidative stress, acquired mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic abnormalities. Many of the issues outlined here can overlap each other.Conclusions: Improved understanding of the underlying pathology of ASD and associated conditions, and the development of a common purpose across multiple treating sites, can improve the consistent and coordinated healthcare of children with autism. There is need for the development of improved strategies for delivering effective health education and healthcare to this large population. Improving the ability of these persons to lead relatively independent lives has a great economic impact.",

      "title": "Sleep-related epilepsies in the course of development in childhood",
      "abstract": "Abstract Epilepsy, as one of the most prevalent neurological diseases in childhood, has a strong reciprocal relationship with sleep. Sleep-associated epilepsy syndromes in childhood are mostly genetic and can be divided into (a) the group of self-limited focal epilepsies of childhood including self-limited epilepsy with autonomic seizures (SeLEAS) and self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (SeLECTS) and (b) (non-self-limited) sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE). Sleep-accentuated (developmental and) epileptic encephalopathies (DEE/EE-SWAS, Landau–Kleffner syndrome [LKS]) are either genetic (possible transition from SeLEAS or SeLECTS) or structural, and they are characterized by continuous bilateral focal or generalized epileptic activity throughout the night with a clinical manifestation of stagnation or regression, in particular of cognition (verbal agnosia in LKS). Epilepsy syndromes with increased seizure frequency after sleep deprivation or with seizures in the transition to awakening include juvenile generalized epilepsy syndromes such as epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures alone (GTCA) or juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), but also SeLECTS. Sleep is a very active process: Regeneration, reorganization, and consolidation of memory facilitate development and cognitive functioning. Epilepsy can alter sleep architecture and vice versa, which can appear as a vicious circle in epilepsies that are sleep related. Macrostructural elements of sleep such as sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, wakefulness after sleep onset, REM and non-REM sleep fraction, as well as microstructural sleep elements such as slow-wave activity, slope of slow waves, cyclic alternating pattern (CAP), and physiological sleep figures, are important biomarkers with which to understand clinical symptoms such as cognitive stagnation and regression, to monitor treatment, but also to determine prognostic factors and will be an important tool for future studies.",

      "title": "Executive Functions and Emotional Regulation in Autism Spectrum Disorder: Clinical Implications",
      "abstract": "Cognitive neuroscience has shown that the development of emotional regulation is closely linked to several basic executive functions, such as attention control, inhibition of inappropriate behaviour and decision-making, all of which are activated in emotionally demanding situations [95,101]. Executive functions (EF) are, in fact, a fundamental element of self-regulation, defined as the ability to regulate cognition, emotions and behaviour [19,55]. In people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), deficits in EF are frequently observed. They are related to difficulties such as theory of mind, social cognition, and repetitive and restricted behaviour patterns, which negatively affect the quality of life (Pugliese et al., 2015). Furthermore, these difficulties in EF can compromise social skills, mainly regulating behaviour in social contexts. Despite numerous studies, the role of EF in ASD is still unclear, with conflicting results due to factors such as age, functioning profile, comorbidities (e.g. ADHD) and assessment methodologies used [33].The identification of an executive dysfunction profile through neuropsychological assessment, together with targeted interventions to enhance executive functions, could not only improve the understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying ASD but also offer new opportunities to promote better emotional regulation and to improve diagnosis, assessment and clinical treatment.",

      "abstract": "Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonate mortality and the second cause of death for children under 5 years of age in the world. The neonates born with very low birth weight (&lt;1500 g) and extremely low birth weight (&lt;1000 g), as well as neonates born very preterm and extremely preterm are at high risk for neurodevelopmental disabilities. Three common and frequent forms of brain injury in preterm neonates are intraventricular hemorrhage, white and gray brain matter injury. Motor developmental delay is early identified in premature neonates, especially during the first three years of life. The major motor deficit is cerebral palsy, but in school age, minor motor dysfunctions are diagnosed and named developmental coordination disorder. The second domain in which developmental delays are identified is cognitive development. Children born prematurely have lower intelligence quotient and a high risk of speech and language disabilities. The low gestational age and low birth weight are the risk factors for emotional disorders, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorders and autism spectrum disorders. The frequency of visual impairment and hearing loss decreased with enlarging gestational age at birth. Intracranial hemorrhage and neonatal seizures are identified as prominent risk factors for later-onset epilepsy. A key strategy to reduce neurodevelopmental disability is the prevention of preterm delivery. Transport of pregnant women with a risk of preterm delivery and delivery in tertiary centers, prenatal administration of glucocorticoids and magnesium sulfate decreases the risk of preterm brain injury and improves neurodevelopmental outcomes. Also, the program \"Neonatal Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program\" and the application of the \"skin-to-skin contact\" method (Kangaroo Mother Care) have favorable effects on the neurodevelopmental outcome in premature neonates. Future research should make new recommendations for neuroprotection of the preterm neonates.",

      "abstract": "Four (possibly five) boys are described with a profound comprehension deficit for acoustic language, leading to severe or complete abolition of expressive speech. One boy had presumed megalencephaly from birth but was of superior intelligence. He had a severe articulation deficit from early childhood, with delayed acquisition of speech. Another boy is thought to have a small angiomatous anomaly in the depth of the left parietal lobe. No brain lesions are known in the other three. Evidence for bilateral brain dysfunction consists of minor motor abnormalities in three boys, oromotor deficits in two boys, and bilaterally synchronous diffuse or independent focal paroxysmal discharges in the EEG of three, possibly four, of the boys. Seizures have occurred in only three boys, and have been easily controlled with anticonvulsants. One boy with a grossly abnormal EEG has had no clinical seizures to date and has not benefited frome one year of anticonvulsant therapy. Two of the boys are brothers, including the boy in whome the diagnosis is questionable since speech was never normal and since he has had neither seizures for an abnormal EEG. The severity of EEG abnormalities did not correlate closely with the course of the language deficit. The relationship of this syndrome to acquired aphasia in children, to Wernicke's aphasia and pure word deafness in adults, and to developmental lagnuage disability with predominantly receptive deficits, is discussed. One child illustrated the close association between writing and phonologic encoding and decoding operations, and two children the preservation of linguistic skills provided the acoustic channel was by-passed and language presented visually. This latter point has been emphasized because of its implications for the remedial education of children with this syndrome.",

In der Zusammenschau lässt sich schlussfolgern, dass schizophrenen Patienten eine große Bandbreite perzeptueller, motorischer und kognitiver Fertigkeiten durch Übung verbessern können. Die Lernraten sind trotz eines häufig reduzierten Ausgangsniveaus vergleichbar mit denen gesunder Probanden. Dagegen haben schizophrenen Patienten Schwierigkeiten, von unbekannten zugrunde liegenden Strukturen oder Regeln in den verwendeten Stimuli zu profitieren. Implizite Lernleistungen werden wenig von der Symptomschwere, wahrscheinlich aber von der Medikation beeinflusst.

The more frequent case is that the child suffers from being an object of symptom fabrication induced by a close person caring for the child, regularly the mother (Munchausen syndrome by proxy). This review focuses on psychopathological aspects of the clinically more relevant factitious disorder by proxy. Typical behaviour and personality characteristics are presented that can be taken as clinical warning signs. Doctor-mother-interaction is affectively challenging due to conflicting tasks imposed on the physician. Complementary to pediatric exclusion of genuine disease, psychopathological assessment is required to exclude other sources of deviant illness behaviour. Factious disorder shares particular features (active violation of the child, false report of history, aggravated symptom presentation and increased doctor-hopping, difficulties in conforming maternal report in biomedical data) with other psychopathological entities (child abuse, simulation, dissociative disorders, somatoform disorders including hypochondria, variants of maternal overprotection and infantilization, psychosis or delusion in the mother). Criteria for differentiation are presented. Three concepts on the psychopathological etiology of factitious disorder by proxy are relevant: In some cases, it may be conceived as secondary manifestation of a primary psychopathological entity or personality disorder. Learning theory emphasises operant rewards received from vicarious sick role. Attachment theory provides possible explanations concerning the traumatic impact on the child, early sources of psychopathology in the fabricating mother and risks for intergenerational transmission of factitious disorders.",

Given unfavorable polygenic potentiators (eg, introversion, hypohedonia, and anxiety) and adverse life experiences (eg, childhood trauma or adult misfortune), around 10% develop schizophrenia. That schizophrenia is basically a neurologic disorder does not contradict whatever is known about its psychodynamics, nor preclude efficacy for psychotherapy or other psychosocial interventions. Research should concentrate on soft neurology and psychophysiology as indicators, being closer in the causal chain to the schizogene than psychometric, social, or high-level cognitive processes.

Etiologies vary and include traumatic brain injury, neurodegenerative disease, and psychiatric illness. Different forms of amnesia can be distinguished: anterograde amnesia affects memory for the present, and retrograde amnesia affects memory for the past. Different memory systems may also be affected (working memory, episodic memory or semantic memory). This entry discusses hippocampal amnesia, amnesia caused by Alzheimer's disease (including mild cognitive impairment), memory dysfunction caused by vascular cognitive impairment, Korsakoff's syndrome, posttraumatic amnesia, transient global amnesia, transient epileptic amnesia, and psychogenic amnesia.",

      "title": "The long‐term course of autistic disorders: update on follow‐up studies",
      "abstract": "The majority of children with autism show deviance and socially or psychiatrically handicapping conditions throughout life. Only a small proportion of those with classical childhood autism lead independent adult lives. Others, particularly those with ‘high‐functioning’ autism and so‐called Asperger syndrome will improve enough to live an independent adult life. The level of mental retardation and other comorbid conditions (such as medical syndromes and other neuropsychiatric disorders, including epilepsy) is important in predicting outcome. An IQ below 50 around school age predicts severe restriction of social and adaptive functioning in adult life. The absence of communicative speech at 5–6 years of age is indicative of a poorer long‐term overall outcome. There is a clear co‐variation between IQ and level of communication, but probably there is some prognostic factor in language development apart from this. Measures of flexibility and cognitive shifting abilities tend to be good predictors of social outcome in a few studies. There is a continued need for prospective, longitudinal studies of children with autism spectrum disorders, particularly in Asperger syndrome. The role of interventions of various kinds needs to be addressed in such studies.",

      "title": "Psychosocial Treatments for Early Psychosis",
      "abstract": "People experiencing psychosis often have to deal with a number of problems. These problems may stem from certain symptoms. As explained in Chapter 2, these symptoms may include positive symptoms (such as hearing voices or having unusual beliefs), negative symptoms (such as being isolated, withdrawn, or slow), cognitive dysfunction (such as difficulties with attention, learning, or memory), and other types of symptoms. However, psychosocial difficulties (like problems with school, work, relationships, and recreation/leisure activities) may disrupt life as well, even though they are not necessarily thought of as symptoms. Unfortunately, these types of problems are very common for people dealing with a psychotic disorder. Treating the se difficulties in addition to the specific symptoms is necessary to begin to feel better and to live a full life. In fact, the recovery process focuses as much on resuming school, work, relationships, and leisure activities as it does on remission (see Chapter 11 on Promoting Recovery). Although medicines are extremely important in treating symptoms, especially positive symptoms (see Chapter 6 on Medicines Used to Treat Psychosis), another type of treatments, called psychosocial treatments, focus more on helping patients with these broader problems. Normal psychosocial development begins in childhood but continues throughout adolescence and early adulthood. Adolescence and early adulthood are extremely important times when most people develop social skills and build relationships. Late adolescence and early adulthood is typically a time of finishing high school, starting college, getting a first job, having a first romantic relationship, beginning to live more independently from parents, buying a car, and establishing career goals. Success in all of these domains of life requires both psychological skills and social skills. The term psychosocial brings together these two words. So, psychosocial development refers to the important developmental stage when psychological and social skills mature. Unfortunately, for people who develop a psychotic disorder, late adolescence and early adulthood is the period of time when a first episode of psychosis usually begins. Thus, psychosis that first happens in this time period often interrupts psychosocial development, leading to psychosocial problems. Psychosocial problems refer to difficulties at school, at work, in relationships, or in recreation and leisure activities.",

In Moscow, a specialized logopedic service has been established which makes it possible to take logopedic and rehabilitation (in the broad sense of the word) measures at various stages of the disease. This service includes logopedic stations at emergency aid, neurological, and neurosurgical divisions of hospitals and polyclinics, the city centre, and a specialized hospital for patients with speech pathologies. At the latter two institutions new methods of the work (in addition to the traditional ones) are practised, particularly, restoration of the higher psychic functions in the process of working activity, teaching non-verbal communication, family psychotherapy, etc. which considerably increase the effect of the rehabilitation.",

This at least is the feeling of many professionals in the field of child development in Britain, who believe that in recent years they have been seeing more children with autistic spectrum disorders. Autism was first characterised in 1943 by Kanner,1 who described a group of children with an unusual pattern of behaviour present from birth or before 30 months. He called this “early infantile autism.” His essential criteria for diagnosis were social aloofness and elaborate repetitive routines.2 Subsequent epidemiological studies have shown that autism is not, as Kanner first thought, a unique and separate condition occurring in children of otherwise normal development but that it is closely related to a range of developmental disorders.3 4 These include Asperger's syndrome,5 a condition characterised by borderline or normal IQ; social isolation or naive, inappropriate social interaction; intensive interest in only one or two subjects; a narrow, repetitive life style; limited or inappropriate intonation and body language; and poor motor coordination.\n\nAutistic spectrum disorders share a triad of impaired social interaction, communication, and imagination, associated with a rigid, repetitive pattern of behaviour.

The objective of this study was to develop and test the reliability of a new instrument, the CTI. Methods A movement disorder neurologist devised the outline of the scale. A steering committee (four neurologists and two psychiatrists) provided revisions until consensus was reached. The resulting instrument assesses frequency of abnormal movements of the eye/eyelid/face, tongue/mouth, jaw, limb/trunk, complex movements (e.g., handwringing, self-caressing), and vocalizations. The CTI rates symptoms from 0–3 with 0 = absent, 1 = infrequent/intermittent or only present with activating maneuvers, 2 = frequent intermittent, brief periods without movements, 3 = constant or nearly constant. Functional impairments including activities of daily living (ADL), social impairment, symptom bother, and harm are rated 0–3 with 0 = patient is unaware or unaffected, 1 = symptoms mildly impact patient, 2 = symptoms moderately impact patient, 3 = symptoms severely impact patient. Following institutional review board approval, the CTI underwent inter-rater and test-retest reliability testing. Videos of patient TD examinations were obtained and reviewed by two movement disorder specialists to confirm the diagnosis of TD by consensus and the adequacy to demonstrate a TD-consistent movement. Vignettes were created to include patients’ symptom descriptions and functional, social, or occupational impairments/limitations. Four clinicians rated each video/vignette. Selected videos/vignettes were also subject to an intra-rater retest. Interrater agreement was analyzed via 2-way random-effects interclass correlation (ICC) and test-retest agreement assessment utilizing Kendall’s tau-b. Results 45 video/vignettes were assessed for interrater reliability, and 16 for test-retest reliability. ICCs for movement frequency were as follows: abnormal eye movement .89; abnormal tongue/mouth movement .91; abnormal jaw movement .89; abnormal limb movement .76; complex movement .87; abnormal vocalization .77; and functional impairments including harm .82; social embarrassment .88; ADLs .83; and symptom bother .92. Retests were conducted on mean (SD) 15 (3) days later with scores ranging from .66–.87. Conclusions The CTI is a new instrument with good reliability in assessing TD symptoms and functional impacts.

      "abstract": "The biomechanical expert opinion on the injury mechanism is necessary in few cases only. However, the judgement of these cases is extremely compromised if mechanically wrong terms are introduced in the clinical report. Since the injury mechanism in the neck is very complex the clinical physician should concentrate on the clinical findings familiar to him; usually the clinician lacks technical case documentation and specific training in injury biomechanics. The relevant mechanisms of neck injuries are an indirect trauma induced by a) a head contact leading to compression, hyperflexion, hyperextension and/or hypertranslation and b) a non-head-contact mechanism (hyperflexion or hyperextension, hypertranslation, acceleration). A non-contact mechanism occurs e.g. during a rear end impact without head restraint (hyperextension) or a frontal collision of a belted occupant (hyperflexion) without head impact. The term \"whiplash\" is misleading and incorrect: It presumes a virtually non existing two phase movement back and forth (or vice versa) like during the development of the crack of the whip. Secondly, it mixes the physical criterion mechanism with the anatomical or morphological criterion injury e.g. distortion, sprain etc. A (head)-contact mechanism is due to a corresponding momentum exerted from the head on the neck. Again, the anatomical or morphological terms are equal, but the mechanism is different. During a contact mechanism as well as during a non-contact mechanism not only a hyperflexion or a hyperextension can occur; in the first phase of the impact also a shearing force between the upper vertebral bodies (CO-C2) may load the intervertebral structures by hypertranslation.",

Nervous system problems: Nervous system problems can cause imbalances by causing problems in communicating with your body’s sensory information and motor functions. Medication side effects: Some medications can cause symptoms such as dizziness or unsteadiness as a side effect. Eye disorders: Visual disturbances, especially problems with coordination between the eyes or damage to the retina, can cause imbalances. Low blood pressure: Low blood pressure can also cause imbalance, especially when you get up suddenly or go to high altitudes. Stress and anxiety: Stress and anxiety can cause symptoms such as dizziness and unsteadiness in some people.",

      "title": "ENGAGE-DEM : a model of engagement of people with dementia",
      "abstract": "Dementia is a neurodegenerative disease that affects cognition, producing a reduction in thinking, problem-solving, and mnemonic abilities, functioning, preventing affected people to care for themselves and carry out activities of daily living (e.g., self-feeding, dress oneself), and psychosocial well-being, causing the appearance of disorders of thought content, mood, and behavior (e.g., depression, apathy, anxiety). The reduction of cognition, the disorientation in space and time, and the inability to complete basic tasks and function independently are the major causes of institutionalization in dementia. Care facilities are extremely efficient in meeting the physical and environmental needs of persons with dementia (e.g., food, self-care, drugs). However, they often fail in addressing mental and social needs. Several studies show that people with dementia living in institutionalized contexts spend most of their time inactive and isolated. Just as many studies demonstrate that engagement in playful activities is crucial to ensure quality of life and psychosocial well-being in dementia. On the one hand, the centrality of the medical aspects of dementia is due to the legacy of the biomedical approach to care. On the other hand, it is caused by the objective difficulty of understanding the needs of somebody who struggles to communicate. As a matter of fact, we are in great need of models enabling us to make meaning of how people with dementia express their psychological states. According to the literature, engagement is the psychological state of proactive involvement with an object (e.g., a game, an interactive system) or an agent (e.g., a person, a social robot) that has a positive affective nuance. In healthy adults, engagement can be measured on three different levels, according to three distinct response systems: experiential/subjective (i.e., self-reports), behavioral/expressive (i.e. overt behavior), and peripheral-physiological (i.e., human bodily reactions). In adults with dementia, the experiential/subjective level is rarely accessible due to cognitive impairment, the behavioral/expressive level might be blunted by motivational disorders like apathy and depression, and the peripheralphysiological level might p rovide insightful r esults, but is often overlooked. As the three response systems are not always equally accessible, it becomes crucial to combine them to achieve the most exhaustive possible measurement of engagement in people with dementia. The objective of this dissertation is twofold. First, it aims at exploring new techniques to assess engagement in dementia with the help of unobtrusive physiological sensors and systematic behavior observation. Second, it focuses on the development of a model of engagement of people with dementia that could formalize the relationships among these assessment techniques and outline their relative meaning in the economy of the overall engagement state. In order to pursue these two goals, the doctoral research was organized in three studies. First, we carried out an extensive ethnographic study to understand people with dementia in their context of living and get acquainted with the activities proposed by nursing homes. Second, we conducted an exploratory study to investigate the reactivity of people with dementia to an experimental setting and deploy a sensible research protocol for data collection. Third, we performed an experimental study and collected a database of multimodal data (e.g., video recordings, electrodermal activity signals, accelerometer signals) while people with dementia were involved in two types of activities: a game-based cognitive stimulation (i.e., jigsaw puzzles, shape puzzles, and a match with dominoes) and a robot-based free play (with the dinosaur robot Pleo). As a first result, we came up with three techniques to measure different aspects of engagement in people with dementia: electrodermal activity (EDA), the Ethographic and Laban-Inspired Coding System of Engagement (ELICSE), and quantity of movement. EDA – which is the variation in the skin conductance derived from the activation of the sympathetic nervous system – accounts for the arousal of the person with dementia during the activity. The ELICSE – which is a coding system of engagement based on nonverbal behavior – permits the measurement of different body configurations that account for different levels of engagement. Quantity of movement – which is the amount of movement on the non-dominant wrist gauged with a triaxial accelerometer – captures the proactive engagement of the person with dementia during the activity (i.e., holding and manipulating objects, reaching out others). Según la literatura, la involucración o el compromiso es el estado psicológico de la participación proactiva con un objeto (por ejemplo, un juego, un libro) o un agente (por ejemplo, una persona, un robot social) que tiene un matiz afectivo positivo. En adultos sanos, el compromiso puede medirse en tres niveles: experiencial / subjetivo (es decir, mediante autoinformes), conductual / expresivo (es decir, por el análisis del comportamiento manifiesto) y periférico-fisiológico (es decir, a través de las medidas de reacciones corporales humanas). En adultos con demencia, el nivel experiencial / subjetivo rara vez es accesible debido a un deterioro cognitivo, el nivel conductual / expresivo puede verse afectado por trastornos motivacionales como la apatía y la depresión, y el nivel fisiológico periférico puede proporcionar resultados interesantes, pero a menudo no se contempla. Dado que los tres sistemas de respuesta no son siempre accesibles, resulta crucial combinarlos para lograr la medición más exhaustiva posible del compromiso en personas con demencia. El objetivo de esta disertación es doble. Primero, su objetivo es explorar nuevas técnicas para evaluar la participación en actividades en personas con demencia con sensores fisiológicos discretos y la observación sistemática de su comportamiento. En segundo lugar, se centra en el desarrollo de un modelo de compromiso de las personas con demencia que podría formalizar las relaciones entre los componentes del compromiso y sus medidas. Como primer resultado, desarrollamos tres técnicas para medir diferentes aspectos del compromiso en personas con demencia: actividad electrodérmica (EDA), el Sistema de Compromiso de Codificación Etográfico e Inspirado en Laban (ELICSE) y la cantidad de movimiento. La EDA, la variación en la conductividad de la piel derivada de la activación del sistema nervioso simpático, explica la excitación de la persona con demencia durante la actividad. El ELICSE, un sistema de codificación de compromiso basado en el comportamiento no verbal, permite la medición de diferentes configuraciones corporales que responden a diferentes niveles de compromiso. La cantidad de movimiento en la muñeca no dominante medida con un acelerómetro triaxial, captura el compromiso proactivo de la persona con demencia durante la actividad (por ejemplo, sujetar y manipular objetos). Como segundo resultado, construimos un modelo de compromiso, el ENGAGE-DEM, que especifica los componentes del compromiso, cómo se miden a través de las técnicas de medición implementadas y qué relaciones mantienen. El ENGAGE-DEM es el resultado de un proceso de prueba y refinamiento progresivo de un modelo de compromiso extraído de la literatura. Este proceso llevó a refutar la definición ampliamente aceptada de compromiso como un compuesto de afecto positivo y compromiso proactivo y a la promoción de una definición de compromiso más coherente con los datos. Según ENGAGE-DEM, el compromiso es el grado de participación proactiva de la persona con demencia en una actividad que puede tomar diferentes tonos hedónicos y lograr diferentes niveles de movilización de energía. El ENGAGE-DEM podría contribuir en varios dominios de conocimiento. Podría ser útil en el campo de la investigación en enfermería, ya que podría promover una mejor comprensión de la persona con demencia y permitir una elección más informada de actividades significativas. También podría ser una ayuda para los diseñadores que buscan crear tecnologías atractivas y divertidas para las personas con demencia. Por último, se podría usar para permitir que los robots socialmente interactivos y las tecnologías interactivas detecten el estado de compromiso de la persona con demencia en el mismo momento que se produce la actividad y reaccionar en consecuencia.",

      "abstract": "Childhood autism, the most characteristic subgroup of the broader PDD (pervasive developmental disorders) category, is the consequence of genetic or typically prenatal, organic factors causing cerebral damage. The resulting mental handicap lasts for a lifetime. It is characterized by a behavioural syndrome, that becomes recognizable between the 2.-3. year. The core of the syndrome is a deviant and/or retarded development of cognitive capacities and skills necessary for social relations, communication, fantasy and symbolic thinking. Almost all autistic people (95%) would not reach independence as adults, and most of them (75%) is mentally retarded as well. According to our calculations about 16,000 people are affected in Hungary, in a more or less serious degree, 2000 children among them. Their condition would require intensive, early and long lasting intervention: conditioning, training, education, and special social services. Today we do not possess the necessary organisational background, nor the professional training, and knowledge. For the early diagnosis, proper care and services the competence of child- and general psychiatrists, also of family doctors is indispensable. The author summarizes the most important available informations on the field first of all for those, who work in the general medical services.",

Concepts of health and illness are influenced by, among other things, physical, psychological, and social processes, and are dynamic and subject to change. Mental health problems arise from diverse sets of circumstances and from widely varying contexts. Often a problem can be detected through changes in a child’s emotional state (increasing anxiety or distress) or through changes in behaviour towards other people or property. Features of a problem that facilitate the assessment and understanding of what is happening include the intensity and seriousness of the problem, its frequency of occurrence, its duration over time, and its effects on the child and those close to the child. When mental health problems become severe, persistent, or associated with other problems, they may be referred to as a ‘disorder’. A mental disorder is, therefore, a mental health problem that has become severe or persistent, and seriously disrupts normal functioning.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder defined by symptoms reflecting disturbances in cognitive, behavioral, and physiological functioning that develop in the wake of exposure to a psychologically traumatic event. According to the DSM‐IV‐TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), the diagnosis applies to individuals who develop a requisite number of symptoms after experiencing, witnessing, or being confronted with an event that involved perceived or threatened loss of life, serious injury, or loss of physical integrity and that evoked fear, helplessness, or horror (e.g., military combat, sexual or physical assault, serious accidents, and major disasters). DSM‐IV‐TR organizes the symptoms of PTSD under three clusters: (1) reexperiencing (e.g., intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, and psychophysiological reactivity to reminders of the trauma), (2) avoidance and emotional numbing (e.g., avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma and inability to experience a full range of emotions), and (3) hyperarousal (e.g., hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and sleep disruption). By definition, these symptoms must persist for more than 1 month after the trauma and produce clinically significant distress and/or impairment.",

Conversely, developmental delays and disabilities may themselves precipitate sleep disorders. Young children with developmental delays experience sleep disorders at a higher rate than do typically developing children; the most common types are difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep and sleep disordered breathing. To date, attention has been focused on sleep problems in children with specific conditions (e.g., autism, genetic syndromes, prematurity, and seizure disorder). The authors review evidence of sleep problems' broader impact across the range of children screened for early intervention. Eligibility evaluations for early intervention address the five developmental domains: adaptive, motor, cognitive, communication, and socioemotional. Disordered sleep may be symptomatic of socioemotional and adaptive problems. Assessing sleep problems within the evaluation may help establish eligibility for early intervention services and would maximize developmental potential by ensuring timely identification, referral, and treatment.",

      "title": "Generalized Versus Selective Cognitive Impairments Resulting from Brain Damage Sustained in Childhood",
      "abstract": "Children who have sustained focal brain damage frequently have learning problems. It is difficult to determine whether the learning problems are selective, in that they affect only certain domains of cognitive function, or generalized and consistent with restricted intellectual ability. To distinguish between the two types of outcome, the consequences of early damage to the hippocampus and its effects on memory are contrasted with the effects of early hemispheric damage and surgery on speech and language function. That global amnesia results from bilateral damage to the medial temporal lobe in adults has been known for nearly 50 years 1. Until recently, however, there were no reports of a similar syndrome resulting from medial temporal pathology incurred in infancy. The earliest injuries that had been reported to produce such an effect were those that occurred at ages 8–10 years 2-4. The absence of cases with injuries earlier than this had led to two possible explanations: (a) damage to the medial temporal lobes very early in life results not in selective memory impairment but in mental retardation because of the widespread effects of such early damage on the development of cognition; or (b) the functional effects of early medial temporal pathology are only transient because of the special plasticity and impressive reorganizational capacity of the immature brain. Both of these explanations have now been challenged by the discovery of several young patients who, in association with hypoxic–ischaemic episodes incurred perinatally or during early childhood, showed severe bilateral hippocampal pathology verified by magnetic resonance imaging, and marked impairments in recall and episodic memory (i.e., memory for everyday events), in the presence of relatively preserved recognition and semantic memory (i.e., memory for factual information) 5, 6. The spared abilities were sufficiently developed to enable these children to attend mainstream schools and to acquire average levels of intelligence, language, and literacy skills. Conversely, the memory impairments, evident on such everyday tasks as remembering routes, appointments, messages, and so on, were sufficiently severe and chronic to preclude independence later in life. To distinguish this unusual pattern of memory function from that commonly seen in adult-onset amnesia, the syndrome has been labeled “developmental amnesia”(Fig.1)6. A: Severely impaired performance of five patients with developmental amnesia of perinatal origin on a test of episodic memory, the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test. B: Normal performance of these same five patients on verbal IQ subtests assessing semantic memory. Interestingly, the memory problems of patients with developmental amnesia of perinatal origin typically become manifest many years after their original insult, as they grow older and are required to become responsible and look after their schedules, belongings, and homework. Furthermore, the patients with pathology of perinatal origin show as great an impairment in recall and in episodic memory as do the patients with onset of damage in middle childhood, suggesting that the increased plasticity associated with a very early age at damage does not overcome the adverse consequences of selective hippocampal pathology on cognitive memory 7. Diagnosis of such selective memory problems early in life is now of critical importance, both to provide the affected children with appropriate remedial help in school and in daily life, and to protect against the adverse socioemotional consequences that memory impairment can impose on the developing child and adult alike. Unlike patients with developmental amnesia who develop low average to average intelligence, language, and literacy skills in the presence of bilateral hippocampal pathology, the majority of patients with focal hemispheric damage leading to hemispherectomy in childhood show a generalized pattern of cognitive impairment, primarily manifested as a dramatic loss of intellectual ability 8. This restriction affects both verbal and nonverbal functions 8, 9. In rare cases where a discrepancy between verbal and nonverbal abilities does occur, it almost always favours verbal intelligence, suggesting that verbal functions tend to be rescued and nonverbal functions crowded out as a consequence of early hemispheric damage 9, 10. Against the background of restricted intellectual abilities, levels of language comprehension and expression, reading, spelling, and numeracy are usually in line with expectations derived from the full-scale IQ. This generalized impairment in all aspects of cognitive ability resulting from early pathology is independent of hemispheric side of removal, as outlined below 8. Left hemisphere damage sustained during early childhood, particularly before the age of 4 or 5 years, rarely produces long-lasting aphasia 11-13, provided the homologous areas on the right remain functional. Extensive left hemisphere damage sustained congenitally or perinatally (i.e., before the onset of speech) has not been reported to result in aphasia or even dysphasia, although there may be delays in the development of speech and language. Later in childhood, subtle deficits in the production and comprehension of higher-order aspects of language emerge, but these appear to reflect not difficulties in language, per se, rather the limits set by a general reduction of intellectual abilities after hemispheric dysfunction and removal. With extensive left hemisphere injury acquired before the age of 4 or 5 years but after the onset of speech, aphasic symptoms may result initially, but the symptoms generally resolve before hemispherectomy. Furthermore, there is usually postmorbid development of speech to a point where, as in the patients with congenital or perinatal injury, there is no longer a selective dysphasia 14, 15. Indeed, language production in these patients may actually exceed comprehension ability, which again tends to decline together with the pathology-induced reductions in overall intellectual capacity. When extensive left hemisphere pathology is acquired after the age of 5 or 6 years, a mild version of the adult pattern of aphasia typically emerges. In such cases, speech arrest, transient mutism, anomia, and/or agrammaticism are seen, and these symptoms may become chronic 16-18. Even then, however, speech tends to be a resilient function, with the patient able to communicate effectively through short phrases and sentences. Numerous reports have indicated that, except for temporary interference with speech and language at the onset of a right hemisphere seizure disorder, neither extensive pathology nor removal of this hemisphere impairs linguistic functions selectively 11, 19, 20. Unlike linguistic outcome after left hemispherectomy, outcome after right hemispherectomy appears to be less dependent on the age at initial pathology, there being no reports in the literature of chronic dysphasic symptoms after right hemisphere pathology incurred at any age. Thus, with right hemisphere damage acquired late in childhood, just as with such pathology acquired in adulthood, speech and language functions appear to be unaffected even at the outset of the disorder. With right-sided pathology acquired early but after the onset of speech, there may be some initial linguistic disturbances (e.g., slurring, disorganized, or irrelevant speech) associated presumably with interhemispheric spread of epileptic activity, but these effects ordinarily resolve after hemispherectomy and arrest of seizures. Finally, right-sided, like left-sided pathology of congenital/perinatal onset may result in delayed development of speech and language, but there are no selective deficits. Rather, as with pathology leading to removal of the left hemisphere, damage and subsequent removal on the right at any age has an indirect effect on linguistic function that is related to the lowering of intelligence 8, 15. Because patients with either early-acquired or late-acquired pathology leading to left or right hemispherectomy have had acute-onset seizures, it is often difficult to disentangle the effects of seizures, per se, from those of the underlying pathology. The same confounding factor exists in most patients with congenital/perinatal pathology, because such pathology is commonly accompanied by early-onset seizures. There are exceptions, however, and these add support to existing evidence 21 that the seizures, or the associated anticonvulsant treatments, are particularly deleterious to both linguistic and intellectual development. When both the initial pathology and its related seizure disorder commence early in life, then intellectual and, as a consequence, linguistic outcome can be extremely poor. In such cases of early-onset, drug-resistant seizures, the prospects for a favourable intellectual and linguistic outcome are greatly improved by early hemispherectomy, presumably because it minimizes the chance that seizures will further damage or produce chronic dysfunction in the remaining hemisphere, particularly during early development. Late onset of protracted seizures is less deleterious for intellectual ability than early onset, however. For example, patients with middle- to late-childhood onset of epilepsy associated with Rasmussen's encephalitis 22 have better preserved nonverbal intellectual ability in the presence of selective linguistic and verbal intellectual impairments than do those with early-onset seizures 8, 18. This brief overview of the effects of neuropathology on the development of memory and speech and language functions indicates that there are definite limits to rescuing of cognitive functions in the face of early brain damage. Thus, in the domain of cognitive memory, episodic memory is selectively impaired after bilateral hippocampal pathology, even when this pathology is sustained perinatally. In the domain of language function, there is evidence of rescuing of speech and basic communication abilities, but this is often achieved at the cost of nonverbal cognitive functions being “crowded out.” More importantly, early unilateral brain damage leading to hemispherectomy places a heavy cost on intellectual ability, and thus sets limits on the ultimate development of all aspects of cognitive function.",

Children may present with physical manifestations of stress, such as secondary enuresis or self-harm, or strange behaviours including aggression or submissiveness. They may be referred because of developmental delay or anxiety. Recognition and management of emotional abuse is vital to prevent long-term sequelae.

      "abstract": "Many ALS patients experience deterioration of voluntary motor function in all four limbs and speech, followed by deterioration of voluntary motor function in facial muscles, so that nonverbal communication also becomes difficult. ALS can be divided into upper limb, lower limb, and bulbar types [6], according to the site of onset of motor function deterioration. Nevertheless, in each type, motor function deteriorates over the entire body as the disease progresses. In upper limb onset ALS, communication is impaired by the difficulty of voluntary movement of the shoulder, elbow, hand, and finger joints, and so it becomes difficult to write or input text using a mouse or keyboard. Nonlinguistic communication such as arm gestures is also impaired. In lower limb onset ALS, voluntary movement of the hips, knees, and ankles is impaired, and so it becomes difficult to move towards people for communication or move to where communication devices are located. Bulbar onset ALS impairs voluntary contraction of the muscles used for speech, swallowing, and facial expressions, and so linguistic communication such as conversation and nonlinguistic communication through facial expression become difficult.",

      "title": "Quality of Life of Older Adults with Urinary Incontinence",
      "abstract": "Health-related quality of life is now recognized as an important patient outcome in response to a disease, treatment, or procedure. The term health-related quality of life (HRQL) refers to a multidimensional construct involving the individual's evaluation or judgment about subjective well-being and objective attributes of functioning. Although there are varying definitions of HRQL, a group of international experts agreed that the fundamental dimensions of HRQL are physical, mental/psychological, and social health, as well as global perceptions of function and well-being.1 Other dimensions of HRQL might also be important, depending on the purpose of an investigation and the specific health condition being studied. These dimensions include cognitive or neuropsychologic functioning, sexual functioning and intimacy, personal productivity, symptoms, pain, energy/vitality, sleep, and self-esteem. Urinary incontinence and its associated symptoms can have a significant impact on the HRQL of older adults. Evidence suggests that incontinence can affect HRQL in diverse and far-reaching ways and that there is considerable variability among individuals in their perceptions and responses to urinary symptoms.2 In addition, there are differences in HRQL impairment, depending on the type of incontinence, the age, and possibly the gender of the patient.2 Surprisingly, research has not consistently documented a strong relationship between incontinence severity (typically measured in the number of incontinent episodes or grams of fluid lost on a pad test) and HRQL impact. The explanation for the lack of a strong relationship between these two types of patient outcome measures is unclear. In this issue are two reports that examine aspects of the HRQL of community-dwelling older adults with urinary incontinence. The reports approach the topic from different perspectives and research methodologies, yet each report makes an important contribution that furthers our understanding related to the impact of incontinence on one or more domains of quality of life. Catherine DuBeau and her colleagues3 present descriptions of the impact of urge incontinence in the lives of older women and men obtained through qualitative research methodologies. The ultimate goal of their work is to develop a HRQL instrument that has strong validity for use in urge incontinent older patients. These authors compared patient-defined areas of impact obtained through focus group interviews with provider/expert areas of impact obtained from the literature and included in published condition-specific quality of life instruments. DuBeau et al. also examined the patients'descriptions to identify the possible role of patients'explanatory style as a mediator of the impact of incontinence on HRQL. DuBeau et al.'s study represents the second generation of instrument development work in research on the HRQL of incontinent patients. She and her colleagues are to be commended for their sound approach to the development of a new condition-specific HRQL instrument. Because HRQL is, by definition, the patient's own perspectives on his/her functioning and well-being, the use of focus group and content analysis methodologies is appropriate. As a next step in establishing content validity, the authors could either take the items identified in the focus groups back to the participants or take them to a new group of older adults with urge incontinence for further validation. Another critical step, one which is usually skipped in HRQL instrument development, would be to have the participants evaluate the importance of each of the specified items in relation to the other items. This would help identify whether each item should be weighted equally or given a different value in calculating subscale scores. See also p 683 and p 693 One limitation in DuBeau et al.'s study was the use of a nonrepresentative sample, i.e., the sample was all white and predominantly of high socioeconomic status. Cultural and economic differences could affect perceptions of the impact of incontinence in participants'lives. Despite this limitation, the results from this study emphasize the differences between the way experts and patients view HRQL and provide new information on the impact of urge incontinence on older adults. More than half of the items identified by DuBeau and her colleagues were not described previously, which may be related to the different conceptual orientations of researchers about what constitutes HRQL versus what factors influence it. For example, DuBeau and her colleagues include a domain on coping. In some theoretical perspectives, this might be considered a personal trait that is not a characteristic of HRQL, whereas in others it might be viewed as a mediating variable of HRQL.4 Also, specific items identified — such as the inevitability of incontinence, that incontinence is a psychological not a physical problem, the association of incontinence with women's biology, and fear of aging — reflect an individual's knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs rather than HRQL. A significant finding in this study was the greater influence of urge incontinence on coping with embarrassment and the interruption of activities compared with the performance of activities, which is used typically in geriatric assessment models. A novel aspect of DuBeau et al.'s study was the examination of explanatory style, i.e., the habitual manner in which persons explain how and why uncontrollable adverse events such as illness occur to them, as a possible mediator of HRQL. Previous research suggests that explanatory style correlates with the range of responses of individuals to illnesses. It makes sense that explanatory style affects responses to incontinence. The authors'findings indicate an association between negative explanatory statements and HRQL items and suggest that there may be gender differences. However, the results on gender differences must be interpreted cautiously because of the small number of men in the sample. No consistent relationship was found between incontinence severity, as measured by the number of incontinent episodes on a voiding diary, and explanatory style. Theodore Johnson II and his colleagues5 conducted a secondary analysis from data collected in the 1990–1991 National Survey of Self Care and Aging to assess whether urinary incontinence and its severity were associated with the self-rating of poor health. The National Survey of Self-Care and Aging is a random sampling of geographic clusters of community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older in the contiguous United States. This study had a sample size of 3485, with oversampling of the oldest-old age group and men to enable subgroup analyses. Findings from Johnson et al.'s study confirm earlier research about the relationship between incontinence and health perceptions. This is an important milestone. Urinary incontinence was associated with poor self-rated health for white subjects who had no instrumental activities of daily living impairments even after controlling for age, activity of daily living status, and comorbid health conditions. The odds of rating one's health poor were doubled if the incontinence was mild to moderate and quadrupled if the incontinence was severe. Previous research examining the relationship between incontinence and self-rated health status has been criticized because of the failure to account adequately for frailty. Johnson et al.'s study did control carefully for functional status and comorbidity and found that urinary incontinence is associated with poor self-rated health independent of frailty. Although analyzed carefully and interpreted cautiously, this study has two main limitations. First, it was a post hoc comparison dependent on cross-sectional data collected in a larger study for a different purpose. Thus, as the authors pointed out, conclusions about causality are problematic. Prospective studies are needed. Second, the quantitative nature of the study, with fixed choice responses to a survey instrument, does not allow for the breadth of responses that might come from in-depth interviews of incontinent individuals, allowing better understanding of why they rated their health as poor. Was it because of the incontinence and its associated symptoms or consequences, or are there other unexplained factors that might have been missed? Future research should address the frame of reference used by incontinent adults in their self-ratings of health. Krause and Jay6 found that global ratings of health are interpreted in different ways by different people and that these ways may depend on race and, possibly, education. Understanding why persons rate health in a particular way may be helpful in determining appropriate interventions. Additional studies on the HRQL of incontinent older adults are greatly needed. There is much that we still need to learn about how age, gender, and lower urinary tract pathophysiology alter the impact of incontinence on HRQL, as well as the factors that influence HRQL. However, these studies should be based on a clear conceptualization of HRQL in which the determinants of quality of life are distinguished from the dimensions of quality of life. Wilson and Cleary7 have presented a useful model that helps categorize clinical variables and shows their relationships with measures of HRQL. In their model, various patient outcomes are linked with causal pathways to show how intervening variables mediate the effect on HRQL. Their model includes five levels of patient outcomes: biological and physiological factors, symptoms, functioning, general health perceptions, and quality of life. Characteristics of the individual (e.g., personality, motivation, values, preferences, and symptom amplification) and of the environment (e.g., psychological, social, and economic supports) influence the five levels in complex ways. In addition, nonmedical factors may directly influence an individual's rating of overall quality of life. Translating their model to incontinence research, the biological and physiological factors might include the underlying pathophysiology of the lower urinary tract, urodynamic variables, and pelvic support and pelvic muscle strength characteristics. Symptoms are the patient's perception of abnormal physical, emotional, or cognitive states and are influenced by demographic and cultural factors. Examples of these include lower urinary tract symptoms such as urgency, frequency, nocturia, and incontinence. Functioning refers to the individual's ability to carry out his/her normal activities. General health perceptions would be the individual's self-rating of health status. Overall quality of life would be the individual's life satisfaction as a whole. In conclusion, the qualitative study by DuBeau and her colleagues and the survey analysis by Johnson and his associates complement each other, enriching our understanding of the way incontinence is interpreted and processed by patients. Further depth and refinement in our understanding of the impact of incontinence can lead to more focused and more effective interventions that will improve the HRQL of the millions of Americans who suffer from incontinence.",

The problems which usually accompany dyslexia are: attention deficit with hyperactivity, dysgraphia, dyscalculia and disorders of the development of coordination. The starting point for understanding this comorbidity is finding broad, dysfunctional areas of the brains of dyslexic patients beyond those theoretically involved in dyslexia. Each of these disorders may or may not occur together with dyslexia. There are even some subtypes which are defined by being associated with dyslexia, leading to the conclusion that in some cases there are underlying common mechanisms. It is necessary to avoid confusion arising over dyslexia due to comorbidity with other conditions.",

      "title": "Pharmacological Treatments of Pediatric Insomnia",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION In a general sense, the operational definition of insomnia in children may be construed as similar to that in adults, i.e., significant difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep and/or non-restorative sleep (early morning awakening is an infrequent complaint in children). However, practically speaking, the most frequent clinical manifestations of childhood insomnia, particularly in younger children, are bedtime refusal or resistance, delayed sleep onset, and/or prolonged night wakings requiring parental intervention. It is estimated that overall 20% to 30% of children in cross-sectional studies are reported to have some significant bedtime problems and/or night wakings (1-7), and a recent study suggests that lifetime prevalence of insomnia in 13 to 16-year-old adolescents approaches 11% (8). These percentages are substantially higher in children with psychiatric comorbidities (9,10) and with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders (11). Furthermore, there is clear evidence from both experimental laboratory-based studies and clinical observations that insufficient and poor quality sleep in children results in or exacerbates mood instability and behavioral dysregulation, impacts negatively on neurocognitive functions and academic performance (12-14), and affects caregivers, with significant repercussions on family functioning. Therefore, appropriate and effective management of insomnia in the pediatric population is an important therapeutic goal for mental healthcare providers.",

Accurate diagnosis is essential to guide management, in particular, treatment options, any genetic implications, and prognosis. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is the family prototype and is a diffuse neurodegenerative disorder characterized by both upper and lower motor neuron cell death, causing progressive paralysis of limb, bulbar (speech and swallowing) and respiratory muscles, and resulting in death from respiratory failure. The cardinal clinical feature of combined upper and lower motor neuron signs in various body regions (bulbar, arms, trunk, legs) forms the basis for diagnostic criteria. There is no cure and the disease progresses relentlessly, with few patients surviving beyond 5 years from symptom onset.",

      "abstract": "The data concerning neurophysiological and neurotransmitter mechanisms of two principal kinds of inhibition of behavior is carried out: the inborn genetically determined inhibition and that developed in the course of training. On the basis of the experiments performed by the author and the literature on general neurophysiology the conclusion is made that development of inhibition of behavior during training (i.e. internal inhibition, including \"latent inhibition\") is determined by the relative strengthening of inhibitory hyperpolarization processes either locally (in a conditioned stimulus analyzer) or globally in the brain cortex and other brain structures during intensification of the inhibitory state (profound inhibition of a reflex and sleep). The main neurotransmitter in development of internal inhibition is gamma-aminobutyric acid. Inhibition of behavior without preliminary training arises either during the action of superstrong stimuli, (exceeding the maximum value inhibition) or during interaction of two and more active systems. A stronger one of these two systems suppresses another one (external inhibition, dominant inhibition, \"freezing\", \"prepulse inhibition\", etc.). These kinds of inhibition develop on the background of EEG activation, which suggests participation in their realization of reticular structures and corresponding neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, noradrenalin, dopamine and serotonin). Behavior pathology causes a break of the balanced interaction between the excitation and inhibition in the central nervous system. This affects both genetically determined forms of behavior inhibition and the learned internal inhibition.",

The need for psychotherapeutic intervention related to childbearing is discussed and some special features of psychotherapy with pregnant women are described, including common phase-related themes, unusual therapeutic structure, transference/counter-transference issues for both individual and group work. Key therapeutic situations are indicated by delineating three somewhat overlapping subgroups of women, who may be particularly at risk during pregnancy due to factors in their current or past experience which constitute stressors when interacting with resensitized areas of intrapsychic vulnerability. Risk-indicators specified are: Conflicted pregnancies - including unplanned, untimely and 'wrong' (such as those resulting from incest or rape). Emotional sensitization - expectant mothers who for a variety of predisposing reasons (own or maternal obstetric history, previous stillbirth or neonatal loss) or neurotic disorders, are prone to emotional difficulties such as over-or undervaluation of foetus/baby, pregnancy and/or birth. Complicated pregnancies - examining some of the possible concurrent physical conditions (maternal illness, substance abuse or eating disorders, AIDS-imperilled babies, threatened miscarriage or maternal disability), life-events (bereavement, eviction, negative test results), socioeconomic difficulties (unemployment, housing problems, poor social support), emotionally impoverished marital relationship and unsupported women on their own.",

The percentage co-relation of aphasic people with acalculia/dyscalculia with disorders in the left hemisphere is from 16% to 28%. In this disorder, a significant decrease in the patients’ ability to cope with daily situations such as space orientation, clock recognition, basic money counting, etc. is observed, which, however, results in worsening of the quality of their life ((Pommerehne, Delboni, Fedosse, 2016 ).). A focal point with dyscalculia among adults is whether it is a result of a language disorder or cognitive one. After completing the tasks of the adapted EC301 test (Dellatolas, G., Deloche, G. and Salinas, D., 2001), in Bulgarian conditions disorders in the calculation processes were identified with all the 13 persons under investigation. 9 of them were diagnosed with dyscalculia: one was unable to distinguish written numbers and found it difficult to differentiate between optically close in their configuration numbers. Three persons suffered from impaired activity planning – arithmetic calculations consisting of a number of activities and requiring a succession of steps. Five persons were diagnosed with primary dyscalculia: their concept of ‘number’ was impaired (its place in a line of numbers etc.). The other four investigated patients suffered from acalculia-total inability to calculate. The EC301 Diagnostic Battery Tested in Bulgarian conditions is a reliable way of evaluating the type of acalculia/dyscalculia and supports the process of adequate therapy for patients with aphasia.",

Two main forms of frontotemporal dementia exist: a behavioral form (behavioral variant) and a language form (primary progressive aphasia). Either form may be accompanied by parkinsonism or a disorder of muscle weakness called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease or motor neuron disease). Less common are forms of frontotemporal dementia that can present primarily with physical decline, including corticobasal syndrome and progressive supranuclear palsy. The chapter then considers how to identify the key signs and symptoms of common forms of frontotemporal dementia, including language and behavioral changes, and how they differ from other forms of dementia.",

      "title": "Somatisation as a manifestation of emotional disturbance in children",
      "abstract": "Somatisation is a phenomenon consisting in signalling complaints originating “from the body” (pain, discomfort, disturbances of physiological functions), whose cause is not explained on the basis of physical examination and additional examinations, and whose basis is usually an unconscious emotional factor. The most common somatic manifestations of negative emotions include abdominal pain, headache, palpitations or stabbing sensation in the chest, dizziness, shortness of breath, cough, squeezing sensation in the throat, numbness of limbs, as well as diarrhoea, vomiting or fainting. Although the described type of disorder occurs particularly often in people burdened with other mental problems, such as anxiety, depression or personality disorders, nowadays it is observed more and more often in children not showing any psychogenic abnormalities so far. A significant influence on the development of such symptoms has the environment of upbringing, from which the developing person draws behavioural patterns. In addition, the entire general social context with all its conditions, both positive and negative, is important. In the case of children, due to the lack of possibility of regular and constructive self-observation, developed abstract thinking and conscious, consistent verbalisation of inner experiences by the patient, the process of diagnosis and therapy of such disorders often requires diagnostic hospitalisation, multi-specialist consultations, long-term treatment in the outpatient mode, as well as at least partial modification of environmental relations, including the educational process. The fundamental issue remains the protection of mental health in the form of preventive measures aimed at creating existential conditions that have a positive impact on the mental development of children, which is particularly true of relations between generations.",

The cranial segment of the neural tube develops into the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. The caudal segment of the neural tube develops into the spinal cord and spine. Partial or complete failure of closure of the neural groove leads to neural tube defects (or defects of dorsal induction) and multiple causes have been identified. These include folic acid deficiency, maternal diabetes, exposure to teratogens, and karyotype/genetic defects [1, 2].",

      "title": "Potentials of Telehealth Devices for Speech Therapy in Parkinson's Disease",
      "abstract": "disease (Streifler, 1984).Hypokinetic dysarthria is mainly associated with PD; mixed dysarthria tends to occur in atypical parkinsonism.General motor symptoms such as rigidity, bradykinesia (reduced speed of muscles), tremors or trembling are reflected in typical speech symptoms of hypokinetic dysarthria.Bradykinesia associated with Parkinson's disease causes difficulty in the initiation of voluntary speech.This can result in delay in starting to talk as well as very slow speech.According to Duffy (1995), there may be freezing of movement during speech.Rigidity can also occur.Additionally, parkinsonian patients have reduced loudness, imprecise consonant production, reduced pitch variability and festinating speech.The latter can result in extremely fast speech together with short rushes of speech (Ferrand and Bloom, 1997).Perceptual features of parkinsonian speech associated with hypokinetic dysarthria, are a weak, breathy (hoarse) voice, monotone and monoloud speech, low volume, articulatory imprecision and rate disturbances (Darly et al., 1969).The syndrome of parkinsonian dysarthria is by no means homogeneous with respect to speech rate.This might be due to different consecutive stages in the development of parkinsonian dysarthria or to different degrees of impairment (Ackermann & Ziegler, 1991).In general, more pronounced phonatory than articulatory disturbances tend to occur as far as clinical-perceptual ratings are observed. Speech intelligibilityAs a consequence of distorted oral motor functions and coordination, speech intelligibility in patients with PD obviously tends to be reduced.Prevalence studies point out that about 70% of patients living at home with Parkinson's disease have speech complaints (Kalf et al., 2008a), which are mainly associated with hypokinetic dysarthria.Diminished communication skills, in addition to the fact that these patients are increasingly disabled in their physical condition and motor abilities in the course of their disease, frequently lead to patients experiencing a deteriorating quality of life (Slawek et al., 2005).Improving or at least maintaining speech quality as long as possible is essential to enable optimal social participation and to maintain relationships.As a consequence, patients with PD are often eager to practice and improve their speech quality.Although the majority of patients with PD are dysarthric speakers, only a minority of this group with diminished speech quality receives speech therapy (20-30%).The small percentage of PD patients under 'speech therapeutical control' might be partially due to the fact that a majority of speech language therapists consider themselves not capable to adequately treat dysarthric speakers with PD.Another reason might be the fact that speech therapy often is provided to patients that have only recently been diagnosed with PD.Therapists lose sight of their patients once face-to-face therapy sessions have been completed.Thus, dysarthric patients tend to be deprived of speech therapy in the chronic and deteriorating course of their disease.As it is, this tendency of 'undertreatment' of dysarthric patients with PD is likely to continue in the course of the coming years.That is, the incidence and prevalence of PD will increase due to our aging population.It is estimated that in 2030 about 30% of our population will be 65 years of age or older. Guidelines for diagnostic and treatment proceduresApart from the observed 'undertreatment' of patients with PD, large variability exists in therapeutical approaches of this patients group.In the Netherlands, evidence based guidelines for diagnostic and treatment procedures for patients with PD were developed in order to www.intechopen.com",

      "abstract": "Disabling neurological diseases are accompanied by disturbances in motor activity, sensitivity, cognitive impairment and chronic pain, often reduce the quality of life in its last years and months, cause death, and therefore they are proposed to be considered as palliative diseases. To determine the list of these diseases, we made a selection from the analytical report of the Global Burden of Disease Study for 1990–2010, published in the Lancet journal in 2012. Of 289 disabling diseases, based on the criteria of direct or frequent comorbid damage to the nervous system, the presence of chronic pain, cognitive decline and limitation of motor activity, which are the causes of a significant decrease in the quality of life and work capacity, we chose the following diseases and pathological conditions: malignant neoplasms, AIDS, severe injuries, strokes, demyelinating diseases, epilepsy, depression and suicide, musculoskeletal disorders (neck, lower back pain, arthritis), tension headache, migraine, loss of vision and hearing, dementia of adults, severe and profound mental retardation of children, children’s cerebral palsy, congenital malformations. We studied the trend of increasing or decreasing the burden of selected diseases depending on the number of years lived with disability and analyzed the interpretation of these trends according to literary sources. Special attention in the review was paid to disabling neurological diseases, which are unjustifiably not considered in the health care systems of most countries as palliative: epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and dementia. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of these diseases were also studied by the bibliosemantic method. The search for literature sources for the review was conducted in PubMed and Google Scholar. It is concluded that the treatment of patients with disabling neurological diseases as palliative patients, with appropriate organizational solutions in national health care systems, will help to improve the quality of life and reduce suffering of both patients and their family members.",

      "abstract": "Art and creativity originate in the brain and depend on normal brain functioning. Music is a multifacet phenomenon that exists as a universal heritage across all human societies and throughout the entire human history. There are numerous brain-based mechanisms involved in the cognitive processing of music, including music listening, performing, composing, reading, writing, as well as musical aesthetics and musical emotion. Music relates to many brain functions including perception, motor action, cognition, emotion, learning and memory. Various brain regions are associated with music processing and production, including the right anterior and posterior superior temporal lobe, the right inferior frontal cortex, the right prefrontal, bilateral premotor and bilateral parietal areas, the right anterior cerebellar lobe, language areas and limbic structures. In a diseased brain, after acquired brain injury, disorders in music perception or production have been described, although considered rare. Amusia or music-specific agnosia, a defective perception of music or its components is typically associated with temporal lobe lesions, and is more likely to occur with right-sided involvement. Etiology of acquired amusia comprise many diseases and conditions leading to brain injury, including traumatic brain injury, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, neoplasma, iatrogenic and epilepsy-related conditions, infections and degenerative diseases. Additionally, there are cases of congenital amusia, attributed to abnormality in neural networks for music, associated with structural variations in the frontal and temporal lobes.",

      "title": "Nonfebrile Seizures",
      "abstract": "Nonfebrile seizures occur in children of all ages and often pose a challenge to the pediatrician in terms of cause, management, and prognosis. The term “seizure” does not imply a diagnosis, but rather indicates a clinical event that reflects a time-related dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS) and may signal a serious underlying abnormality;however, more often in children the term indicates a transient disturbance of brain function. The pediatrician’s role is to determine the cause of the seizure and to treat the condition, based on an understanding of its pathogenesis, impact on the child and family, and the long-term outlook of the condition.Seizures and epilepsy are not synonymous. A seizure(convulsion) is defined as a paroxysmal involuntary discharge of cortical neurons that may be manifested clinically by an impairment or loss of consciousness, abnormal motor activity, behavioral and emotional abnormalities, sensory disturbances, or autonomic dysfunction. Some seizures are characterized by abnormal movements without loss of consciousness. The term epilepsy refers to spontaneous recurrent seizures unrelated to fever. In other words, a patient who has a single nonfebrile seizure that does not recur over time would not merit the diagnosis of epilepsy. The ages of greatest risk for nonfebrile seizures are during infancy, childhood, and adolescence. The annual incidence rate from birth to 20 years of age is 0.56 per 1000; the cumulative risk of epilepsy during the first 2 decades of life is approximately 1%. The prevalence of epilepsy in the pediatric population is 4 to 6 cases per 1000 children.Some may ask why it is necessary to classify epilepsy if the treatment and prognosis are similar for all children. There are primarily two forms of epilepsy characterized by either generalized seizures or a focal onset, and generalized and focal seizures respond predictably to some classes of anticonvulsants and not to others. The clinical appearance of a seizure may not indicate clearly whether the origin of the epileptiform discharge is focal or generalized. For example, a child may present with repetitive episodes of staring and unresponsiveness. Is this a generalized absence or a complex partial seizure? The proper classification will dictate the appropriate anticonvulsant. Finally, accurate classification of epilepsy permits the pediatrician to discuss the prognosis of the condition with the child and family. Most likely the child who has absence epilepsy will become seizure-free and not require medication as a teenager; focal seizures do not have the same favorable outcome.The International Classification of Epileptic Seizures (ICES) was introduced in 1981 and is based primarily on the clinical description of the seizure and the associated changes on electroencephalogram (EEG). The majority of seizures can be classified according to the ICES nomenclature (Table 1). Simple partial seizures (SPS) are associated most commonly with asynchronous clonic or tonic motor movements such as forced deviation of the head and eyes to one side. An SPS typically is short-lived,rarely persisting longer than 10 to 20 seconds, and the child remains conscious and is able to verbalize throughout it. The EEG characteristically shows unilateral spikes or sharp waves in the anterior temporal region, but the discharges may be bilateral;occasionally a multifocal spike pattern is recorded.Complex partial seizures (CPS) initially may share the characteristic appearance of an SPS with or without an aura, followed by impairment of consciousness. Alternatively, CPS may begin with loss of consciousness. The average duration of a CPS is 1 to 2 minutes, which is significantly longer than an SPS or an absence seizure. Aura is common and signals the onset of a seizure in approximately 30% of children who have CPS,with the child complaining of epigastric discomfort, fear, or an unpleasant discharge may spread from a temporal lobe throughout the cortex, causing a generalized tonic-clonic convulsion (termed secondary generalization). The majority of children who have CPS have an abnormal EEG characterized by sharp waves or spike discharges in the anterior temporal or frontal lobe or by multifocal spikes. Partial seizures are the most common form of epilepsy in children.Simple (petit mal) absence seizures typically have their onset at 5 to 6 years of age and are characterized by brief (5 to 20 sec) lapses in consciousness, speech, or motor activity,sometimes associated with flickering of the eyelids. Absence seizures never are accompanied by an aura or a postictal period of drowsiness, but automatisms may be observed during the seizure. The automatisms usually consist of eye blinking or lip smacking. Hyperventilation for 3 to 4 minutes by the cooperative patient frequently induces a seizure. The EEG is characterized by 3 per second generalized spike and wave discharges that indicate a clinical seizure. In contrast, an atypical absence seizure is characterized by associated myoclonic movements of the face and body,sometimes leading to loss of body tone, which causes the child to fall. The EEG pattern commonly is associated with either 2 to 2.5 per second or 3.5 to 4.5 per second generalized spike and wave discharges.Myoclonic seizures may occur in isolation or in association with other types of epilepsy, including tonic-clonic convulsions. Myoclonic seizures are characterized by brief, often repetitive symmetric muscle contractions with loss of normal body tone. Atonic seizures are difficult to differentiate from myoclonic seizures; in many cases they represent a prolonged myoclonic seizure. Atonic seizures typically cause the child to fall because of the sudden loss of postural tone.Primary generalized tonic-clonic (formerly called grand mal) and tonic or clonic seizures are well known to most pediatricians. These seizures are characterized by sudden loss of consciousness and tonic-clonic, tonic, or clonic contractions. Tonic seizures are associated with intense muscle contraction and clonic seizures with rhythmic, usually symmetric jerking movements. The child may develop perioral cyanosis and lose bladder control. The seizure is followed by a 30 to 60 minute period of deep sleep and postictal headache.The major disadvantage of the ICES classification is its failure to recognize certain distinct epileptic syndromes that are age-related, are characterized by specific types of seizures, and have varying etiologies that differ significantly from causes of epilepsy in the adult patient population. A“syndromic” classification proposed in 1989 by the International League Against Epilepsy permits selection of an anticonvulsant that is most appropriate to treat the patient’s predominant seizure type. The primary drawback of this more sophisticated approach to diagnosis and treatment of a child’s epileptic syndrome is that at present, only approximately 50% of seizure disorders in children can be placed into a specific syndrome. For the purpose of this review, the clinical description,characteristic EEG patterns, treatment, and prognosis of five epileptic syndromes are outlined briefly in Table 2. These syndromes include infantile spasms, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, benign childhood epi- lepsy with centrotemporal (rolandic) spikes, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (Janz syndrome).Despite the advent of molecular diagnosis and new neuroimaging techniques, the etiology of most seizures in children remains unknown. The acute onset of seizures may result from cerebral trauma(head injury), CNS infection (meningitis, encephalitis), cerebrovascular diseases (infarction, arteriovenous malformation, hemorrhage, venous thrombosis), toxins (lead), brain tumor (cerebral or extracerebral),specific epilepsy syndromes (Table 2), genetic/heredi-tary diseases (eg, Down syndrome, tuberous sclerosis), metabolic and systemic diseases (endocrine, renal), degenerative disorders (leukodystrophy), or hereditary malformations (eg, cortical dysplasia, lissencephaly).An increasing number of epilepsy syndromes have been identified that are the result of a genetic abnormality. To date, the chromosomal loci have been identified for seven epilepsy genes and three epilepsy syndromes, including benign familial neonatal convulsions (chromosomes 20q and 8q), fatal progressive myoclonic epilepsy or Unverricht-Lundborg disease (chromosome 21q), and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (chromosome 6p). The gene locus on chromosome 6 also may be responsible for other types of generalize tonic-clonic seizures. Studies of large numbers of families that have other well-defined epilepsy syndromes likely will uncover additional epilepsy genes.The age of presentation often provides a clue to the possible cause of epilepsy. Hypoxic-ischemic encepha-lopathy is the most common cause of seizures in the newborn, which characteristically are apparent within the first 24 hours. Children who have neonatal seizures following a hypoxic-ischemic insult are at significant risk to continue to have seizures (ie, epilepsy). Pyridoxine dependency may be the cause of seizures that begin shortly after birth, especially if they are associated with signs of fetal distress and particularly when there is a history of seizures in utero. Metabolic encephalopathies typically are associated with seizures in the newborn and usually are unresponsive to conventional anticonvulsants. The infant who has a urea cycle abnormality or a disorder of amino acid metabolism such as nonketotic hyperglycinemia may appear normal at birth, but within a few days will lose interest in feeding and sucking, followed by lethargy proceeding to coma and seizures, which often are of the myoclonic variety. Disorders of mitochondria, such as Leigh disease and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency,often present during infancy with repetitive seizures. The anoxic and metabolic encephalopathies that are associated with seizures will not be discussed further; several excellent reviews are included in the reading list.With the advent of modern imaging technology, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission computed tomography(SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET), it has become evident that structural abnormalities of the brain and congenital disorders of neuronal migration play an important role in the causation of epilepsy. The migrational abnormality may be severe and generalized, as seen in the child who has lissencephaly, which is characterized by a smooth brain due to a lack of gyri and a structure equivalent to a 12-week fetus. On the other hand, discrete collections of aberrant neurons visible by MRI imaging may be the cause of focal epilepsy in an otherwise normal child. A small number of children who have generalized infantile spasms have been found by EEG, MRI,SPECT, and PET scanning to have focal nests of dislocated neurons. In these cases, surgical excision of the abnormal cortex may result in complete seizure control.There is strong evidence that simple febrile seizures are not a cause of epilepsy, but whether a prolonged febrile seizure, especially during infancy,may cause mesial temporal sclerosis, thereby producing epilepsy at a later age, is still controversial. The cause of epilepsy in a cognitively and neurologically normal child has not been well defined; additional studies in these children may uncover a genetic basis.A presumptive diagnosis of epilepsy generally is made from a history of spontaneous recurrent seizures and findings on the physical examination because it is unlikely that the child will have a seizure in the presence of the physician. In response to careful questioning, the parent usually can give a good account of the seizure and whether it is generalized or focal in onset. The child also should participate in history taking because the existence of aura, which signifies a focal onset, may not be known to the parents. Certain seizures, such as absence or pseudoseizures, may be provoked in the clinical setting by hyperventilation or the power of suggestion. If the history and description of seizures remain unclear, the parent can videotape seizures for later review by the pediatrician. Generally, if a diagnosis of epilepsy is in doubt following the examination and an EEG, it is in the child's best interest to watch and wait before initiating specific treatment. It is possible that a condition mimicking epilepsy will become apparent during the period of observation.A number of paroxysmal nonepileptic disorders share features with epilepsy and, therefore, may be misdiagnosed by the physician. None of these conditions responds to anticonvulsant drugs. Breath-holding spells are such an example. Unlike epilepsy, breath-holding spells always are provoked and stereotyped and often are predictable. The child is frightened or chastised or falls and bumps his or her head, which is followed immediately by a brief shrill cry, forced expiration, and sudden loss of consciousness. The child becomes cyanotic(occasionally pallid) and during the succeeding 30 to 60 seconds may have several generalized tonic-clonic movements before consciousness returns. The child is lethargic and sleepy for a brief period following the event. Gastroesophageal reflux may cause laryngospasm, bradycardia, and apneic episodes in an infant, which may be confused with a seizure disorder. Prompt management of the reflux usually brings the apnea under control.Benign paroxysmal vertigo(BPV) often is confused with epilepsy. BPV causes the normal toddler to stagger or fall suddenly and to become pale and frightened. Some children will vomit during the episode, and all children will become dysarthric and complain of vertigo if they are able to verbalize. About 25% of children will have nystagmus during the attack. Although episodes of BPV usually are brief, persisting for 1 to 2 minutes, they may recur repetitively throughout the day.Simple syncope (fainting) is common in the adolescent and adult but is unusual in a child younger than 10 years of age. Tilt-table testing is a useful method to distinguish simple syncope from a seizure when the diagnosis is uncertain.Two types of syncope or loss of consciousness that begin during childhood may be confused with epilepsy and pose a significant hazard to the child. Cough syncope often is associated with poorly controlled asthma. These children develop cough paroxysms a few hours after falling asleep. The paroxysms may be so prolonged and persistent that the child loses consciousness and control of the bladder sphincter. There often are generalized tonic-clonic movements during the period of unconsciousness. The child has no recollection of these events the following morning. The prolonged QT syndrome results from an abnormality of myocardial function due to a familial or acquired insult, which may result in ventricular arrhythmias leading to sudden death. Children who have the prolonged QT syndrome are especially prone to cardiac arrhythmias during exercise or periods of anxiety or fear. It is vital not to confuse this condition with simple syncope or epilepsy because genetic counseling, teaching the parents cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or introducing specific drug therapy aimed at preventing the arrhythmia (eg, beta blockers) may be life-saving.Night terrors are common,especially in boys 4 to 6 years of age,and sometimes may be confused with epilepsy. They typically develop during the early stages of sleep and are characterized by the sudden onset of crying or screaming,uncontrollable flailing of the extremities, unintelligible speech, dilated pupils, and drooling. A few minutes later the child returns to sleep and has no recollection of the event.The episodic dyscontrol syndrome (rage attacks) is a behavioral disorder observed primarily in boys ages 6 to 12 years. The rage attack always is provoked by a confrontation with a student, friend, or more likely a parent, usually the mother. Following the precipitating event,the child simply loses control,lashing out at the parent; scratching,biting, or physically injuring the person; and sometimes threatening the individual with a knife or weapon. There usually is profanity and verbal threats, but no loss of consciousness. At the conclusion of the episode, the child usually is remorseful. In my experience, the largest number of referrals are initiated by child psychiatrists who wish to exclude CPS as a possible etiology for the severe behavioral outbursts observed in these children.Masturbation may mimic a seizure disorder. This behavior is seen most frequently in 2- to 4-year-old girls. In the recumbent position, the child develops repetitive rhythmic copulatory movements accompanied by a staring appearance, perspiration,plethoric facies, and unresponsiveness to the parents’ or siblings’voices.Tics are involuntary, spasmodic,nonrhythmic, repetitive movements. Unlike seizures, tics are stereotypic movements, unassociated with impaired consciousness; at times they may be suppressed by the patient.Pseudoseizures commonly are misdiagnosed as epilepsy; at the time of referral, patients typically are receiving three or four anticonvulsants with poor seizure control. Pseudoseizures develop most often during the preadolescent or adolescent periods in patients who have a previous history of epilepsy. The seizures may seem very realistic but often are bizarre and characterized by peculiar extremity postures,frequent falling without injury, and various vocal utterances. A pseudoseizure rarely persists longer than 5 minutes, and tongue biting or perioral cyanosis are uncommon. Frequently the recovery is sudden compared with the typical postictal period associated with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Pseudoseizures rarely occur when the child is unattended and lack the typical neurologic findings observed during a seizure, such as unresponsive dilated pupils and extensor plantar responses. The eyelids may be closed firmly, and the patient resists eye opening by the examiner during a pseudoseizure. Because a significant number of children who have pseudoseizures also have epilepsy,the presence of epilepsy does not exclude the diagnosis. A useful rule of thumb is that urinary or fecal incontinence during the ictal event excludes the diagnosis of pseudoseizures. Adolescent girls subjected to incest or sexual abuse may present with pseudoseizures. The pediatrician must consider initiating a comprehensive evaluation to exclude sexual abuse for all adolescent girls who have pseudoseizures.The EEG is a useful adjunct to the history and physical examination in establishing the diagnosis of epilepsy, but a routine interictal(between seizures) EEG will show an epileptiform abnormality in only approximately 60% of patients. EEG abnormalities are more likely to be recorded in the infant or child who has epilepsy than in the adolescent or adult who has epilepsy. Various procedures are employed during the EEG in an attempt to activate a seizure discharge in a child suspected of having epilepsy, including eye closure, hyperventilation, photic stimulation, and in specific circumstances, sleep deprivation and special electrode placement (eg,zygomatic leads). Prolonged EEG monitoring with simultaneous closed-circuit video recording is used in specific circumstances. For example, prolonged recording is useful for identifying ictal seizures that rarely are captured during routine EEG testing. Furthermore,prolonged EEG recording is particularly helpful in determining the location and frequency of seizure discharges while simultaneously visualizing and recording changes in levels of consciousness and the presence of clinical signs, which is critical for proper classification of the seizure disorder. Detailed localization and frequency of the seizure focus is essential for choosing appropriate candidates for epilepsy surgery. Finally, prolonged EEG recording is the “gold standard” test for investigating a patient who has suspected pseudoseizures.Unfortunately, the routine EEG often is not used appropriately. It cannot be used reliably to determine the appropriate duration of anticonvulsant therapy or to explain a lack of response to therapy. The EEG does provide essential information in at least four situations: to support a clinical diagnosis by typical EEG changes during the recording(eg, benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes or absence epilepsy); to differentiate seizure disorders with similar clinical characteristics (eg, absence versus CPS); to detect potential structural brain lesions (focal slow-wave abnormalities); and to identify patients who have pseudoseizures.Computed tomography (CT) is of little use in the evaluation of a child who has epilepsy, except in special circumstances such as investigation of a child suspected of having congenital Cytomegalovirus infection characterized by periventricular calcifications or tuberous sclerosis typified by calcified tubers in the subependymal layer. CT studies of children who have epilepsy have shown an abnormality in approximately 30% of cases, consisting primarily of cortical atrophy or dilated ventricles; this provides little useful information for clinical management.MRI is gaining increasing importance in the study of children who have epilepsy, especially in examination of temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy and sclerosis in patients resistant to anticonvulsant therapy. The use of MRI should be reserved for investigating all children who present with complex partial seizures, those who have a focal neurologic deficit (either static or postictal), those who present with complex seizures of increasing frequency or severity regardless of type, and all adolescents who have a first seizureThe initial step in the management of a child who is suspected of having epilepsy is to ensure that the paroxysmal event was, in fact, a seizure. A thorough history and examination coupled with appropriate studies and observation should distinguish nonepileptic events from seizures, as discussed previously.Whether anticonvulsant medication should be prescribed for the child who has a first nonfebrile seizure depends on the seizure type. The risk of recurrence following absence(typical or atypical) seizures,myoclonic seizures, and infantile spasms is certain; thus,anticonvulsants are initiated at the outset. A child who has a single afebrile tonic-clonic seizure, particularly if it occurs on awakening, has a good prognosis; 75% will not experience a second convulsion if the neurologic examination and EEG are normal and there is no family history of epilepsy. Anticonvulsants are not advised following the initial seizure in these children.However, when two or more unprovoked afebrile seizures occur within a 6- to 12-month time frame,anticonvulsants usually are indicated. Fasting blood glucose and serum calcium levels are indicated prior to the initiation of anticonvulsant therapy if the history suggests hypoglycemia or hypocalcemia as a cause of the seizure.Following the decision to treat with an anticonvulsant, the choice of drug depends on the seizure type or specific epileptic syndrome, as well as the efficacy and toxicity of the agent. The therapeutic goal is to treat with a single anticonvulsant that is most likely to control seizures completely with little or no adverse effects. Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve these objectives in many cases. Table 3summarizes the choice of drugs used in specific seizure types, the dose, the range of therapeutic serum levels, and the potential side effects and toxicity for each anticonvulsant.The amount of attention that should be given to the standard therapeutic ranges of anticonvulsants in the management of childhood epilepsy is very controversial (see Table 3). Some children achieve seizure control with subtherapeutic serum drug levels (eg, carbamazepine); for others, the seizures do not come under control until serum drug levels above the published range are reached (eg, valproic acid). Thus, if standard therapeutic serum levels are used as the only benchmark,children will be overtreated or undertreated routinely. There are specific periods when therapeutic drug monitoring is indicated: 1) At the initiation of therapy to ensure that the therapeutic range is achieved, 2)During times of accelerated growth, and 3) If the seizures are out of control or the child is toxic. In general, the patient’s response to treatment is more important than the serum concentration of the drug.I also recommend routine drug monitoring in the following clinical situations: 1) Children who undergo a change in seizure type; 2) Patients who continue to have seizures in spite of an adequate drug dose based on weight and age; 3) Patients who have hepatic or renal disease;4) Children treated with phenytoin;5) Patients receiving multiple drugs(polytherapy), especially valproic acid, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital,because drug interactions are common; 6) Children who have mental and physical handicaps in whom drug toxicity may be difficult to evaluate; and 7) Patients and families who are noncompliant with the drug regimen.Adverse reactions to anticonvulsant drugs are common and on rare occasion may be life-threatening. Most serious adverse reactions occur during the initial 1 to 3 months of therapy and are more prominent when specific risks are present. For example, severe hepatotoxicity in association with valproic acid therapy is more likely to occur in the developmentally delayed or neurologically abnormal child younger than 2 years of age who is being treated with multiple anticonvulsants. The risk is even greater if the infant has an underlying metabolic disorder, particularly involving mitochondrial function. If the cause of the child’s seizure disorder is unknown, screening for a metabolic disorder (eg, blood gases, serum lactate and pyruvate, carnitine,ammonia, amino acids, and urinary organic acids) should be under-taken prior to the introduction of valproic acid.Routine screening with liver function tests and a complete blood count does not necessarily select patients destined to develop a serious adverse drug reaction such as aplastic anemia, hepatotoxicity, or Stevens-Johnson syndrome. In many cases the drug complication becomes apparent clinically prior to changes in blood test results. Thus,careful clinical monitoring of the patient, especially during the initial phase of treatment, is mandatory to identify early adverse reactions.Anticonvulsants may induce or inhibit enzyme production or they may displace another anticonvulsant from a shared plasma protein-binding site. Several anticonvulsants are capable of enzyme induction,including carbamazepine, primidone,phenytoin, and phenobarbital. When these drugs are used together, they may lower the plasma levels of each other by increasing the rate of metabolism. Conversely, enzyme inhibition tends to increase plasma levels by decreasing the rate of metabolism. An important example of this phenomenon is the potential for carbamazepine toxicity when erythromycin also is prescribed. Erythromycin inhibits microsomal enzyme systems, which results in decreased clearance of carbamazepine. Phenytoin and phenobarbital may be displaced from plasma protein-binding sites by valproic acid, which may lead to toxic serum levels that can be adjusted by lowering the dose of valproic acid. Valproic acid also reduces the plasma clearance and prolongs the half-life of lamotrigine. It is not known whether this interaction explains the increased incidence of severe skin rashes and Stevens-Johnson syndrome when valproic acid and lamotrigine are used simultaneously.Each anticonvulsant drug can cause unwanted behavioral and cognitive side effects in children. What often is not appreciated is that up to 30% of untreated children who have epilepsy experience behavioral problems, perhaps in part as a psychological reaction to the chronic condition or to dysfunction of the CNS. Furthermore, intellectual impairment has been well-described in children who have epilepsy. It often is difficult to determine whether behavior changes or poor academic performance by a child who has epilepsy is the result of the medication, the underlying seizure disorder, or both. Often the behavioral or performance problems are subtle,and they are recognized by parents or the teacher only after discontinuation of the anticonvulsant.Phenobarbital causes behavioral side effects in up to 50% of children, including personality change, irritability, fitful sleep,hyperactivity, short attention span, and depression. Many of the unwanted symptoms become less apparent when the dose is decreased. Because of the high frequency of side effects associated with phenobarbital, this agent no longer is the drug of choice in the treatment of childhood epilepsy. In decreasing frequency, the following drugs also may cause similar behavioral problems—ACTH, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and primidone. Valproic acid is the least likely to affect a child’s behavior adversely. Valproic acid also has little untoward influence on a child’s cognitive performance, although any anticonvulsant may produce unwanted behavioral side effects.If the child develops an adverse behavioral change following initiation of anticonvulsant therapy, theppediatrician has several options, including lowering the dose or if the problem persists,substituting another anticonvulsant for the offending drug. This situation also affords an opportunity to reassess the need for an antiepileptic drug. Follow-up should include an assessment of the child’s behavior and school performance on every visit. If academic or behavioral problems continue after drug readjustment or substitution, the child must be referred for a comprehensive evaluation to assess learning and cognitive parameters; plans also must be established for appropriate remediation.If a child’s seizures are completely controlled for a period of approximately 2 years, consideration should be given to weaning from the anticonvulsant, particularly if the child has no risk factors for seizures.The most prominent risk factors associated with recurrence of seizures include developmental delay or motor handicap, age greater than 12 years at seizure onset, neonatal seizures, and multiple seizures before control is attained. Absence and generalized tonic-clonic seizures on awakening tend to have a better outcome following drug withdrawal than partial complex seizures with secondary generalization. Agreement is not uniform as to the predictability of EEG abnormalities and seizure recurrence, whether at the onset of therapy or during follow-up. There is mounting evidence, however,that paroxysmal EEG features (eg, spike and wave) are a contraindication to withdrawing anticonvulsants. If the child has several risk factors, a trial with monotherapy (if the child is receiving several drugs) following 2 years of complete seizure control is suggested.The weaning process should be supervised closely and occur over a period of 4 to 6 months. If the child is receiving polytherapy, one drug should be removed at a time; the entire weaning period will be extended compared with that of a child receiving monotheraphy. Of those children who are seizure-free for 2 years and who have no risk factors, 70% to 75% will remain seizure-free without anticonvulsants. The most vulnerable time for seizure recurrence is the initial 6 months following drug withdrawal. If seizures recur, the child once again is placed on the drug that initially provided seizure control for at least 2 years. If the seizures reappear following a second drug withdrawal,life-long anticonvulsant theraphy may be required.The ketogenic diet was used frequently for the treatment of intractable epilepsy before the discovery of the newer antiepileptics—carbamazepine, the benzodiazepines,and vallproic acid. Interest has been renewed in this high-fat diet by television shows and videotapes sponsored by parent groups. The mode of action is unknown, but seizure control may be correlated directly with elevated levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate that result from ketosis. Children who have complex myoclonic epilepsy associated with tonic-clonic convulsions are most likely to respond to the diet. For those who do respond, it often is possible to decrease or discontinue most, if not all, anticonvulsants, so that the child inevitably becomes brighter and more responsive. The use of valproic acid is contraindicated in conjunction with the ketogenic diet because the latter potentiates the hepatotoxicity of the former. The ketogenic diet may be appropriate for the child who has recalcitrant seizures despited polytheraphy, in whom an underlying cause of the seizure is unknown. Because the diet is unpalatable and has a high fat content, some children beyond the age of 1 to 2 years will not tolerate it. The ketogenic diet usually is continued for a period of 2 years in children who have good seizure control.Surgery is gaining increasing popularity as a method of treatment children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy. The assessment of children for possible surgery must be conducted in a tertiary center by a skilled pediatric epileptologist in a multidisciplinary setting. Following routing EEGs,prolonged EEG recording with video monitoring is imperative to localize the site(s) and identify the frequency of epileptogenic discharges. Many centers use subdural electrodes to define the extent of the epileptogenic activity more accurately. These studies often are accomplished by decreasing or discontinuing the anticonvulsant drugs to promote frequent seizures, which increases the reliability of locating the seizure focus.In addition to the EEG studies,the child undergoes a series of other proceduresto assist in localization of the seizure focus and identification of the dominant cerebral hemisphere, including neuropsychologic evaluation, the Wada test (intracarotid injection of amobarbital),SPECT, PET in some centers, and MRI studies. These studies may identify a lesion corresponding to the focal seizure abnormality,including a low-grade glioma,hamartoma, or evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis. The results of epilepsy surgery in children who have a localized area of epileptogenic activity associated with a structural lesion is excellent. Temporal lobe resection is the most common surgery performed in children and adults; corpus callosotomy,hemispherectomy, and nontemporal lobe resections are more common in the younger child who has intractable seizures. Further development of electrophysiologic monitoring and advances in neurosurgery will allow more children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy to benefit from epilepsy surgery.Appropriate and timely counseling of the parents and child is at least as important as choosing the correct anticonvulsant. Parents and patients who comprehend the purpose and side effects of anticonvulsant drugs as well as their action are much more likely to be compliant and supportive. At the time of diagnosis, the family often is overwhelmed and does not know where to start. It is useful initially to review the causes of epilepsy and explain the need for an EEG and additional studies if warranted. This consultation also provides an opportunity to dispel various myths about epilepsy.Subsequently visits should focus on factors that may exacerbate seizures,including a low-grade fever, undue stress, lack of sleep, and certain drugs such as methylphenidate and the phenotiazines. On occasion,anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine and phenytoin, may potentiate seizures. The physician should review first-aid measures that can be initiated at home if a seizure occurs. I recommend that the child not bathe or swim unattended because a seizure could result in drowning. However, the pediatrician should encourage participation in all activities, including contact sports if the patient desires, as long as appropriate protective equipment is used. Because adolescents who have epilepsy are primarily concerned about obtaining a driver’s license,the pediatrician should be aware of state laws governing driver’s licenses for people who have epilepsy. It is imperative that school teachers be made aware of children who have epilepsy because the children are at risk for learning disorders and require careful surveillance to identify situations in which special assistance is needed.The diagnosis of epilepsy frequently affects the family negatively. The parents are frightened that their child might die during a seizure,develop brain damage as a consequence of recurrent seizures, or have significant irreversible side effects from the anticonvulsant. Many parents feel guilty and vulnerable,particularly if there is a family history of epilepsy. If their fears and questions are not addressed adequately, a parent may tend to isolate the child,which will cause greater anxiety and family discord. The pediatrician must respond to the psychosocial needs of such a family. Most parents benefit from reading material produced by the Epilepsy Foundation of America and by participating in parent meetings sponsored by local epilepsy organizations. Time should be set aside at each follow-up visit to address concerns relating to any academic, social, or behavioral problems. As the parents become more familiar with the many facets of epilepsy, their confidence will grow and ability to cope will improve.Most children who have epilepsy are well-controlled on anticonvulsant medication with few if any side effects, have normal intelligence,and can be expected to lead normal lives. The pediatrician can play a pivotal role in ensuring that the child who has epilepsy reaches his or her highest potential.SUGGESTED RESOURCES FOR PARENTS AND CAREGIVERSFreeeman JM, Vinning EPG, Pillas DJ.

      "title": "Clinical Update: Grip Strength: An Uncommon Impairment",
      "abstract": "Abstract Upper extremity impairment rarely is assessed using grip strength, according to the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), because results can be influenced by subjective factors that are difficult to control, including sex, age, comorbidities, fatigue, handedness, time of day, pain, and the individual's cooperation. The AMA Guides, Section 16.5b, Impairment Evaluation Methods, discusses the approach used for rating peripheral nerve injuries, but this section applies only to specific nerve lesions with resulting weakness of the muscles supplied or sensory changes. Strength correlates only poorly with performance of the activities of daily living, and grip strength testing using a dynamometer or other types of isometric strength testing has not been shown to reliably discriminate between submaximal and maximal efforts. Grip strength usually is not used in the presence of decreased motion, painful conditions, deformities, or absence of body parts (eg, missing digit), nor is it used to rate weakness from a peripheral nerve lesion. In rare cases, the AMA Guides allows the use of loss of strength (eg, due to a severe muscle tear that healed leaving a palpable muscle defect). Impairment ratings based on objective anatomic findings take precedence, and loss of strength is rarely combined and only if based on unrelated etiologic or pathomechanical causes.",

      "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental motor disorders are a group of conditions characterized by developmental deficits in learning, control, and execution of motor skills. The pathophysiology of these cognitive–motor dysfunctions involves complex neuronal processes of sensorimotor integration (that is, somatosensory, proprioceptive, visual, and vestibular), as well as motor control pathways (that is, cortico-basal ganglia, cerebello-thalamo-cortical, and intracortical networks). The most common neurodevelopmental motor disorders are tic disorders (including Tourette’s syndrome), stereotypic motor disorder, and developmental co-ordination disorder. Here, the chapter provides a useful clinical guide regarding the phenomenology, pathogenesis, and management of these conditions.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric rehabilitation of the chronically mentally ill requires conceptual distinction among psychological abnormalities of the nervous system, representing active pathology or a disease state; impairment of functions by means of which those abnormalities can be inferred; disabilities, i.e., losses of functional ability consequent upon an impairment; and handicaps, which are the social disadvantages resulting from disability [1-3]. These various levels of functioning cannot be separated from the environment. Socioenvironmental stressors, defined by Mechanic [4] as a discrepancy between demands presented to a person and his or her capacity to deal with them, influence the appearance of impairments, disabilities, and handicaps. Wing [5] lists three factors that can cause and exacerbate social disablement in cases of frequent relapse or chronic impairment: environmental overstimulation or understimulation, social disadvantage, and adverse personal reactions (secondary disablement) caused by acceptance by the handicapped person of limitations that are not actually necessary. It is clear that assessment and evaluation of impairments are important in avoiding understimulation and overstimulation and preventing or correcting adverse personal reactions. Although premorbid and environmental factors play an important role, we can expect the more severely impaired also to be the more severely disabled.

Such difficulties can include problems with the placement and manipulation of food in the oral cavity or the physiology of swallowing, or both, and are referred to as dysphagia. Swallowing is a highly complex motor process, requiring neurological control and coordination of breathing and swallowing. Cerebral damage may affect the neurological control of swallowing (Murdoch and Theodoros 2001) and consequently, the child is at increased risk of fluids and food material entering the airway, termed aspiration. According to Reilly et al. (2000) the signs suggestive of aspiration include coughing, choking or deterioration in respiratory status during a feed, noisy or wet breathing, or excessive pharyngeal secretions; sneezing during drinking may also indicate nasopharyngeal incoordination and reflux.",

      "abstract": "Speech difficulties are common issues in the management of people with Parkinson's disease (PD), and become more so with progression of the disease. Problems with speech can be variable, and include a reduction in the volume of speech (hypophonia), accompanied by a hoarse and breathy voice, mono-loud and monotone speech or loss of the quality of articulation (dysarthria) [[1]Pinto S.

In EClinical Medicine, Levy et al. [[5]Levy E.S. Moya-Galé G. Chang Y.M. et al.The effects of intensive speech treatment on intelligibility in Parkinson's disease: a randomized controlled trial.EClinicalMedicine. 2020; 24100429Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar] report the results of a randomised controlled trial of 64 participants with PD and hypokinetic dysarthria, who were randomly allocated to receive 1 of 2 forms of speech therapy or to no treatment. The gold standard speech therapy for PD involves a technique called Lee Silverman Voice Treatment termed LSVT LOUD. This approach trains people to increase the amplitude of their vocal motor output and re-calibrates their perception of vocal loudness. Previous trials have documented that this treatment program can lead to significant objective changes in speech amplitude (loudness) and pitch variation. Furthermore secondary gains have been identified for articulation, swallowing and hypomimia. The current trial set out a different aim, to explore whether objective measures of speech intelligibility may be significantly impacted by the use of LSVT LOUD in comparison to an equivalent time exposed to speech therapy specifically focusing on articulation (LSVT-ARTIC). The authors hypothesised a-priori that both interventions would improve speech intelligibility compared with a 3rd group of people with PD who had no treatment. They adopted an objective measure of speech intelligibility- using multiple blinded raters to transcribe sentences recorded from participants before and after the therapy to allow quantification of transcription accuracy. They were careful to use self-generated narrative speech as this is more likely to reflect day to day speech intelligibility rather than read or repeated sentences. Furthermore, the listeners had to transcribe sentences adjusted to be of equal loudness at baseline and follow up this excluding the possibility that any change in intelligibility resulted purely due to speech becoming more audible. All participants had PD and dysarthric speech. Both active treatment groups received 16 one- hour sessions of LSVT which fits with the existing recommendations for LSVT. 57/64 participants had complete data collection. The authors report that those individuals receiving \"LSVT LOUD\" had a significant (31%) improvement in intelligibility compared to baseline and also compared to the \"no treatment\" and the \"LSVT ARTIC \"groups which is highly likely to reflect a clinically meaningful improvement in speech. Surprisingly, there was no significant improvement in intelligibility from baseline among people who had LSVT ARTIC, focussed on articulation. This result adds to the evidence that LSVT LOUD not only improves the amplitude of speech but also its intelligibility, further supporting its clinical value. This obviously has important clinical consequences for effective communication. While the failure of LSVT ARTIC to improve intelligibility is surprising, this result adds certainty that the effects seen with LSVT LOUD are not simply placebo effects due to the additional attention from speech clinicians, but that the therapy itself has a clear impact on intelligibility. This said, it would be unwise to conclude that LSVT focusing on articulation has no value. While it would appear to have less impact than LSVT LOUD, the modest mean improvement of 6.8% may conceal more meaningful improvements among subgroups of patients. Additionally we cannot be sure whether therapy that encompasses both Speech amplitude (LSVT LOUD) as well as articulation (LSVT ARTIC) might be of greater value that either of these alone. The existing trial only reports the immediate benefits seen with LSVT LOUD. Other trials have previously confirmed long term benefits on speech amplitude and the authors indicate that data regarding the long-term benefit of LSVT LOUD on intelligibility should become available. Nevertheless, the take home message from this trial is that LSVT LOUD works at improving both speech amplitude AND intelligibility and therefore there is all the more evidence that it should be made available to all people with PD with hypokinetic dysarthria.

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

The pathology in such cases is straightforward, if severe. But there are other children who, for reasons that may be a complete mystery, never speak at all.

A disfunção sexual consiste na incapacidade para participar do ato sexual com satisfação, comprometendo desejo e/ou excitação e/ou orgasmo. Pode também se apresentar como dor que antecede, ocorre durante ou após o ato. Os numerosos fatores de risco para a disfunção sexual explicam sua alta prevalência nas diferentes fases da vida, podendo apresentar etiologia orgânica, psicossocial e/ou sociodemográfica. Entre estes últimos citam-se idade avançada, renda familiar baixa e educação precária. Quanto aos fatores orgânicos, encontram-se: deficiência hormonal, hipertensão arterial, diabetes, cardiopatias, neuropatias, alcoolismo, tabagismo, uso de drogas ilícitas, bem como uso de alguns medicamentos. Depressão e ansiedade respondem pelas causas psiquiátricas mais comuns de disfunção sexual. A prevalência é alta em homens, especialmente nos casos de disfunção erétil (DE) e de ejaculação precoce (EP). O mesmo se observa nas mulheres, quanto à diminuição do desejo, falta de lubrificação vaginal, transtornos do orgasmo e dor ao intercurso sexual. Por comprometer a satisfação sexual e a satisfação com a vida, a disfunção sexual resulta em menor qualidade de vida, baixa autoestima, depressão, ansiedade e prejuízo na relação interpessoal e dos parceiros. Doenças crônicas podem conduzir ao desinteresse sexual e à falta dessa atividade, por baixa autoestima e preocupação quanto à imagem corporal, por exemplo. A depressão também reduz a libido, deteriorando a qualidade do relacionamento sexual. Os pacientes, ansiosos sobre sua habilidade em satisfazer o parceiro, com o tempo desenvolvem ansiedade antecipatória e, pelo receio de falhar, acabam evitando o intercurso. Fadiga e estresse também acompanham as doenças crônicas, podendo contribuir para a disfunção sexual.",

The aetiology of ID is often unknown but common aetiologies include Down syndrome (DS), foetal alcohol syndrome, disease/infection, and birth defects. Physical fitness and physical activity can be accurately measured following appropriate familiarisation using validated tests with excellent reliability. This includes treadmill protocols with oxygen uptake measurements, various field tests of aerobic capacity, isokinetic and isometric muscle testing, and field tests such as sit-ups, push-ups, and standing long jump. Physical activity is typically measured using steps per day or accelerometery, but to accurately interpret results population-specific cut-points need to be used. Children with ID typically have low aerobic capacity, muscle endurance, muscle strength, and physical activity levels. Furthermore, children with ID with DS have even lower values, yet obesity does not appear to influence aerobic capacity in the same manner as the general population in children with DS. Interventions have been shown to increase aerobic capacity in children with ID, but it is unclear if aerobic capacity is increased in children with DS. Run performance is improved with exercise training, as is muscle strength and endurance. Body weight and body composition are not likely to change appreciably with exercise training alone but can be improved with multifactorial interventions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Attentional deficits characterize a number of childhood syndromes. However, attempts to delineate these deficits have been confounded by confusion in terminology. For example, the terms “MBD,” “conduct disorder,” and “hyperactivity” were often used interchangeably in earlier studies. MBD children are defined as having neurochemical and neurophysiological dysfunction and perceptual or learning disabilities, although these features are not always associated with the hyperactive syndrome. In contrast, hyperactivity has often been treated as part of the MBD syndrome despite statistical evidence to the contrary. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-111-R, American Psychiatric Association 1987) used the term “Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Table 23-1) but allowed for attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity in the previous edition and again in the current edition (DSM-IV, American Psychiatric Association 1994). Co-morbidity of ADHD with conduct disorders, oppositional-defiant behavior, mood disorders, anxiety dis orders, learning disabilities, speech and language disorders, and mental retardation is extremely high, e.g., 50 per cent with conduct disorders (Biederman et al. 1991); 41 per cent with learning difficulties (Holborow and Berry 1986); and 78 per cent with speech and language disorders (Baker and Cantwell 1992), which can make differential diagnosis difficult.",

Any condition that affects the physical or functional integrity of the brain is likely to impact on some aspect of a person's ability to remember, as successful remembering involves many different interacting cognitive systems, including attention, memory and executive functions. Furthermore, mood disorders such as anxiety or depression, which impair concentration, also reduce the efficiency of memory.",

      "abstract": "ognitive neurology deals mainly with disorders of memory (for example, is the patient's poor memory due to early dementia or to anxiety/depression?) or language (as in stroke).It should be remembered, however, that other areas of cognition may be selectively impaired.This review will cover disorders of perception and of higher order motor output, both in terms of pathological loss and pathological gain of function. PERCEPTION AND ITS DISORDERS cA patient must be conscious in order to perceive the world around them.An exploration of consciousness is outside the remit of this article though recently reviewed by others. 1 2 The patient must also have the capacity to attend selectively in order to focus on one part of the sensorium.Perceptual processing is then necessary to identify what is being perceived through the various sensory modalities (namely vision, hearing, touch, smell, taste), thus allowing access to semantic knowledge and through this understanding of the environment.Initially, perceptual information is basic and modality specific, but as it is processed by higher order centres, meaning is ascribed to percepts, and information becomes multi-modal (fig 1).Ultimately, semantic knowledge is accessed using the various sensory streams.For example, if standing in the path of an oncoming train, basic perception will involve visual information, hearing the train coming, and feeling vibration from the ground.These separate streams then come together, accessing relevant semantic knowledge and thus allowing the individual to understand what is taking place.In discussing perception, I shall focus mainly on vision and hearing, as the other three forms of perception are of lesser clinical importance.Perception is not a passive process, but is modulated by attention.There is feedback from higher order centres down to primary sensory cortex.Similarly, attention influences what is perceived.Attention itself has many levels or subcomponents, including selective, divided, sustained attention, etc.Of relevance to perception is selective attention, a process by which the individual focuses specifically on particular areas of sensory experience, rather than simply passively absorbing all such experience.Patients with subcortical dementia can lose this ability to attend selectively, resulting in increased distractibility due to inability to ignore background extraneous stimuli.To some extent, we see what we expect to see.For example, if waiting for someone at a crowded venue, we may have several false positive recognitions of strangers because we are primed to expect to see the friend. VISION Normal visual processingVisual processing involves signal relay from the retina via the lateral geniculate nucleus to the striate cortex (area V1).In the visual cortex itself, there is initially strong retinotopic localisation, such that striate occipital lesions cause deficits restricted to segments of the visual field.Extrastriate visual cortex is organised more by process than by visual field location-that is, different areas of extrastriate cortex are involved in colour, motion perception, etc. Extrastriate deficits therefore cause deficits in aspects of vision, such as perception of motion, affecting the entire visual field.Broadly speaking, extrastriate regions group into two streams: the ventral occipitotemporal ''what'' stream is involved in object recognition, while the occipitoparietal ''where'' stream is involved in spatial processing. 3The ventral stream runs below the calcarine fissure into the medial temporal lobe, while the dorsal stream extends superolaterally from the striate cortex into occipitoparietal and temporoparieto-occipital areas.Deficits of visual processing, and how to test for them Deficits in visual attention can result in neglect, whereby attention is no longer directed either to self-that is, body part-or to external objects such as food on a plate.",

The literature is quite clear on the debilitating effect of fatigue on (different aspects of) performance. Fatigue behaviours that are often mentioned when fatigue was considered to be a cause of collisions and groundings are 'activation problems', meaning decreased vigilance and decreased alertness, and 'perception (and sensory input) limitations', meaning a reliance on visual inputs, decreased attention to peripheral stimuli, uncertainty of the observations, and decreased communication. Particularly these fatigue behaviours are often found in reports from collisions and groundings occurring between 00:00 to 04:00 hours, but are also quite prevalent in collisions and groundings occurring between 20:00 to 00:00 hours. Because several organisations are already active in increasing the monitoring of causes, behaviours and consequences of fatigue, this option was not selected to be assessed on its consequences for the shipping industry and maritime.",

Nesse grupo encontram-se aqueles com o Transtorno de Deficit de Atencao e Hiperatividade (TDAH), condicao que se caracteriza por deficits em funcoes cognitivas, cruciais para a aprendizagem. Apresentamos, aqui, um breve apanhado sobre as habilidades de leitura, de escrita e de matematica no TDAH.  Em relacao a leitura de palavras isoladas, pesquisas identificam um deficit no controle inibitorio, sendo necessario ampliar a investigacao da consciencia fonologica. Sobre a escrita, como na leitura, parece que o prejuizo se deve a presenca de deficits diretamente ligados aos sintomas do TDAH ou ao dominio afetado, mais do que uma dificuldade com o reconhecimento e/ou producao de palavras. Quanto a matematica, as criancas com TDAH usam estrategias de calculo imaturas e mostram nao terem automatizado os processos cognitivos ligados a representacao mental de calculos matematicos. Identificou-se, ainda, a situacao desvantajosa do grupo TDAH+dislexia, que parece imperceptivel para os educadores e profissionais da saude. Concluimos que o conhecimento precario sobre o TDAH e comorbidades por parte dos profissionais que lidam com essa condicao, associado a ausencia de politicas publicas educacionais apoiadas nos avancos da neurociencia sobre o envolvimento dos processos cognitivos no ensino/aprendizagem, as praticas pedagogicas desenvolvidas no Brasil, em sua grande maioria, perpetuarao o ciclo de fracasso que ha decadas se instalou no pais, especialmente para as criancas com TDAH.",

      "abstract": "A variety of studies indicate that folate deficiency is associated with the appearance of problems of a neuromuscular or neurological nature such as depression, muscular and mental fatigue, states of confusion and non-senile dementia, and that these processes improve fully or partly when the deficiency is corrected. Because of the role of folates in the reactions in synthesis of neuro-transmitter and elements of neuron structure, it is not surprising that a deficiency is associated with depression and other mental problems. Folates are involved in the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) which is the main contributor of methyl groups in the nervous system and whose action as an antidepressive agent is confirmed. They are also involved in the synthesis of glutamate which is an excitant neurotransmitter, and in the formation of puric and pyrimidic bases. An alternative mechanism for explaining the etiopathogenesis of folate deficiency in depression and other mental disorders involves the regeneration of tetrahydrobiopterin (THB) which is an essential cofactor in hydroxylation process in the brains of mammals. Folate deficiency is a common nutritional problem in many groups of the Spanish population and, given the role of this vitamin in the operation of the nervous system, we might consider the possibility that, in some case, folate deficiency may cause or aggravate some alterations to mental function.",

Les programmes de traitement pour les enfants sont assez bien développés et peuvent être utilisés pour les enfants souffrant de problèmes d'apprentissage, ceux atteints de paralysie cérébrale ou de troubles émotionnels ainsi que pour les retardés mentaux. Les programmes de traitement pour adultes ne sont pas très bien connus et cet article mentionne quelques-unes des conclusions d'un projet de recherche en cours à l'Institut de Réhabilitation de Détroit. Certains symptômes de troubles perceptuels se retrouvent chez les enfants et chez les adultes. Les adultes avec une hémiplégie droite montrent des problèmes dans la compréhension d'instructions verbales, dans l'incapacité de se rappeler une succession de noms et dans la lenteur d'exécution. Ceux atteints d'hémiplégie gauche manifestent surtout des troubles visuels, des problèmes d'organisation spaciale, des difficultés sensorielles et des distorsions de l'image corporelle, surtout du côté gauche. Dans le projet de Détroit, les physiothérapeutes traitent les désordres du sens de position et de mouvement, tandis que les ergothérapeutes font l'entrainement dans le domaine de la perception visuelle et tactile. Toutes les thérapeutes traitent les problèmes ayant trait à l'apraxie, à l'image corporelle, aux relations spaciales visuelles et à la formation de concepts. Les activités de la vie quotidienne sont utilisées comme base de traitement. Des exemples de techniques employées incluent: a) l'utilisation d'un miroir où la thérapeute mime la direction des mouvements pour aider le patient qui a de la difficulté à comprendre le language; b) bloquer la vision pour permettre la meilleure perception d'un stimulus tactile et proprioceptif chez un patient qui a des problèmes de perception visuelle. Comme les patients perçoivent et interprètent souvent mal un stimulus, il faut leur laisser le temps “d'apprendre à apprendre”. Il est préférable de pratiquer plusieurs exercices ayant une relation entre eux plutôt que de persister longtemps dans le même exercice. Les lecteurs devraient se référer à la bibliographie pour plus d'information ayant trait aux tests de problèmes perceptuels chez le patient adulte.",

Anxiety disorders are the most common group of mental illnesses together with sleep disorders and astheno-neurotic syndrome [3]. Anxiety accompanies the course of many mental and somatic diseases [4]. It usually appears early in life, causes cumulative damage, and can contribute to depression, substance abuse, and other adverse outcomes [5]. Sleep disturbances and anxiety are frequent competing or synergistic symptoms. The onset and development of these conditions are often interrelated. In addition, these conditions often correlate with the appearance and course of other disorders - such as depression, dementia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Long-term, uncorrected disturbances of circadian rhythms lead to clinically significant distress and cause mental, physical, social, professional, educational, or other functional impairments [6].",

      "abstract": "In terms of disability and handicap, problems in auditory function involve much more than a reduced sensitivity to soft sounds, the most commonly used measure of hearing impairment. In daily life, many hearing-impaired (HI) listeners suffer more from impaired processing of audible sounds, than from missing inaudible sounds. For example, people can have difficulties understanding speech in noisy situations or localizing sounds. The degree of these types of disabilities does not only depend on hearing thresholds, but also on other aspects of the auditory system such as loudness recruitment and spectral and temporal resolutions as well as non-auditory factors, such as cognition. All these aspects in hearing are widely investigated in research settings using many different, often time-consuming tests, but there are very few applications in clinical audiology. In clinical audiology, pure-tone audiometry is traditionally used and sometimes supplemented with speech audiometry for functional diagnostics, hearing aid fitting and counselling. As a result, many hearing aid fittings are based on audiogram data only, although modern hearing aids have a large number of fitting parameters that should ideally be set based on individual hearing capacities. The present thesis focuses on clinically applicable tests that could complement the pure-tone audiogram for functional diagnostics. The clinical usability and relevance of these tests for speech perception or broader auditory function is investigated. The end result is a battery of tests that could serve as a standard in extensive diagnostics or in audiological research: the (preliminary) Auditory Profile.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy on Shyness: Influence of Age",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONShyness may be defined experientially as excessive self-focus characterized by negative self-evaluation that creates discomfort and/or inhibition in social situations and interferes with pursuing one's interpersonal or professional goals. The experience of shyness can occur at any or all of the following levels: cognitive, affective, physiological and behavioural and may be triggered by a wide variety of situational cues (Henderson and Zimbardo, 1998). Among the most typical situations are interactions with authorities and strangers, one on one opposite sex interactions, and unstructured social settings. Subcategories of shyness reflect the degree (i.e., mild social awkwardness to totally inhibiting social phobia) and frequency of experienced shyness and include chronic shyness (self-labeling as shy and the experience of shyness in numerous social situations), situational shyness (the experience of shyness in specific social situations), and shy extroverts (experience anxiety and negative self-evaluation but are publicly outgoing).Shyness, often start in adolescence and is centered on a fear of scrutiny by other people in comparatively small groups (as opposed to crowds), usually leading to avoidance of social situation (Schmidt et al., 1997). According to various statistics, around 40 to 50 percent of the people (and sometimes more) are involved in shyness. Shyness evokes negative effect, which leads to sadness, unhappiness and fearfulness, and tendency to describe oneself as 'shy natured' is associated with low global self esteem and with feelings of low self worth in several domains of the self (Crozier, 1995). Shy adolescents tended to be lower in self-esteem, more introverted, and more anxious than their non-shy counterparts (Lawrence and Bennett, 1992). Shy individuals also tend to lack confidence (Crozier, 1982), and express larger perceived skill deficits compared to non-shy individuals (Jackson et al., 1997). A common observation in virtually all shyness research is that the consequences of shyness are deeply troubling. A general observation in most of the shyness research is that the consequences of shyness are deeply troubling shyness leads to higher levels of anxiety (D'Souza, 2003), fear (D'Souza, Gowda and Gowda, 2006), depression and loneliness (Somesha and D'Souza, 2008, 2009).Researchers in India and abroad have proposed several treatment approaches to shyness from medication to life skills intervention to psychotherapy. Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) theory is a method to understand and treat dysfunctional emotions and behaviors. It is a cognitive-behavioral approach that posits that inappropriate behaviors result not from an event but rather from irrational beliefs. REBT asserts that irrational beliefs lead to unhealthy negative emotions and behaviors, such as rage and guilt (Jensen, 2008). The present study is aimed at finding out the effectiveness of REBT on shyness among early and late adolescents in India.METHODSampleA large sample of adolescents (N=1200) between 12-18 years was screened for Shyness Assessment Test (SAT) and the samples who had high levels of shyness (scores more than 72) were selected. Next, the researcher selected 96 adolescents randomly and assigned them for the intervention of the study, 48 as experimental group and 48 students as control group. There were 24 early and 24 late adolescents in each group. The experimental group was administered REBT, while the control group was not given any specific intervention.ToolThe Shyness Assessment Test (SAT) was developed by D'Souza (2006) of Maharaja's College, University of Mysore. It consisted of 54 items and requires the subject to indicate his/her response by marking YES, NO or CAN'T SAY. The items in the test pertained to three domains of shyness-Cognitive/Affective, Physiological and Action oriented. Item analysis of the scale using SPSS program resulted in Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0. …",

In primary insomnia, the term insomnia constitutes a diagnostic entity. In other disorders it is considered a symptom and not a primary diagnosis. Insomnia is frequently a component of the symptom complexes of other primary sleep disorders, and is listed among the diagnostic criteria for the following dyssomnias: obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome, central sleep apnea syndrome, central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), and restless legs syndrome (RLS). Disrupted sleep is among the diagnostic criteria for narcolepsy. The complaint of insomnia can also accompany parasomnias, and is listed among the diagnostic criteria for sleep starts and nightmares (1). As in other forms of insomnia, in order to be considered a clinically significant problem, the complaint of sleep disturbance must be associated with adverse daytime consequences such as fatigue, decreased concentration, or irritability.",

They can emerge due to genetic factors or abnormalities in the brain or body acquired after birth, or because of faulty or incomplete physical experiences when learning more complex behavior. Many are first identified in infancy, but onset can occur over the lifespan. Some of these disorders are progressive in nature, whereas others are nonprogressive or static. Individuals diagnosed with these disorders display various motor, perceptual, intellectual, neuropsychological, and psychosocial impairments. The general intellectual functioning level of individuals with motor disorders is variable, with some functioning in the average range and others experiencing significant impairment. Psychological outcomes are also variable. Individuals diagnosed with neurodegenerative disorders frequently experience significant mental deterioration.",

Low-level deficits are various forms of homonymous hemifield scotomata, which affect all types of vision within their borders. Intermediate-level deficits refer to impairments of colour or motion perception, which affect either one hemifield or the entire field when lesions are bilateral. High-level deficits are divided into those of the ventral (occipitotemporal) or dorsal (occipitoparietal) stream. Occipitotemporal lesions affect various aspects of object recognition, ranging from general visual agnosia to selective agnosias, such as prosopagnosia or topographagnosia from right or bilateral lesions, and pure alexia from left-sided lesions. Occipitoparietal lesions cause the various components of Bálint syndrome, namely, simultanagnosia, optic ataxia, and ocular motor apraxia. They can also cause other impairments of visuospatial or visuotemporal processing, such as astereopsis and sequence-agnosia. Because of anatomic proximity, certain deficits cluster together to form a number of cerebral visual syndromes. Treatment of these disorders remains challenging, with frequent reliance on strategic substitutions rather than restorative approaches.",

Negative symptoms occur alongside positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations in acute psychotic episodes, where they generally respond to treatment with antipsychotic medication, but for the 15-20% of patients for whom negative symptoms are enduring,1 2 current treatment strategies have modest benefits at best.\n\nA critical but often difficult clinical distinction is between primary and secondary negative symptoms,3 The former constitute an enduring deficit state within schizophrenia, whereas the latter can be manifestations of depressive features or medication side effects such as bradykinesia (as part of drug induced parkinsonism), or the consequence of positive symptoms (for example, social and emotional withdrawal may be a response to persecutory delusions or reflect a patient’s avoidance of social stimulation to minimise the provocation of intrusive psychotic experiences). Irrespective of cause, persistent negative symptoms disproportionately limit recovery4 and are associated with poorer occupational and social functioning in the community, including a reduced likelihood of living independently.5 6\n\nFindings from studies that have tested drug strategies for negative symptoms in the context of acute psychotic episodes may not be generalisable to those with persistent symptoms. Few published studies have specifically recruited patients with illness characterised by persistent symptoms.\n\nThe introduction of the second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, was accompanied by claims of better efficacy against negative symptoms, but whether any such effect is independent of an improvement in positive symptoms or medication …",

Definitions have changed and full filed parallel to the development of medicine and new discoveries. Cerebral palsy is defined as a group of permanent movement and pasture disorders that cause limitation in activities and are the consequence of unprogresive disorders of immature brain or brain that is developing. The children with cerebral palsy can also have some others damages such as vision, learning, sense or speech damages, intellectual damage, epilepsy, feeding disorders and so on. Cerebral palsy can be divided into four types: spastic, choreoatetotic, ataxic and mixed type. All limbs can be affected, that is, both arms and legs (quadriplegic), or mostly just the legs (diplexia), or just a hand and a leg on one side of the body (hemiplegia). It can not be surely determinate which are the causes of cerebral palsy. The causes are not the complications during child birth, but different prenatal factors and indications, which are divided as prenatal, perinatal and postnatal. Also, there are mostly several causes, and not only one that leeds to the formation of cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy symptoms can be detected already in early childhood. When detected, the doctors pediatricians and physiatrists will set the diagnosis and determine the necessary exercises. Very important factors for successful integration and active participation of people with cerebral palsy are family support and timely treatments. If needed, a child with cerebral palsy can have an assistant or a therapeutic dog. With a purpose to view more insight into the life and everyday activities of people with cerebral palsy, it has been done a research which has shown that most people with cerebral palsy dresses by themselves, do the hygiene by themselves, participate in housekeeping, but unfortunately most respondents are unemployed, have difficulties in living, and don't do the sports. The conclusions of the research pointed to the need for greats involvement of society in the implementation of activities aimed at improving the life of people with cerebral palsy.",

      "title": "Micturition reflex epilepsy with tonic seizures – A rare semiology with insights from magnetoencephalography",
      "abstract": "Reflex epilepsy is a condition, wherein epileptic seizures are triggered by specific stimuli such as flashing lights, music, reading etc. Stimuli may be exogenous (sensory) or endogenous (e.g.: praxis induced, solving calculations). Very rarely, the act of urination can set off seizures and this may often be confused with micturition syncope, when loss of consciousness occurs early. Our patient is a 5-year-old boy who was born to non-consanguineous parents by normal delivery. He had a smooth perinatal transit and an unremarkable first year of life. He had delay in acquisition of language milestones and began to speak bi-syllables by 2.5 years of life. Development in other domains was relatively normal. At the age of 4 years, he was noticed to have brief episodes of posturing of his upper limbs with up-rolling of eyes during sleep. These events lasted for a few seconds and occurred 5–6 times during the night. The child was treated with sodium valproate (SVA) and levetiracetam (LEV) at weight appropriate doses elsewhere. Despite good compliance, he continued to suffer from daily nocturnal brief tonic seizures. About 4 months into the illness, he developed another symptom. When the child commences to urinate, he loses consciousness and slumps to the floor. His mother reported that his limbs appeared to be tightly held in extension and his eyes looked to the right. This phenomenon occurred when child urinated in both sitting and standing position. The possibilities considered were micturition induced reflex seizures vs. micturition syncope. In view of pre-existing developmental delay and co-existing nocturnal seizures, the former differential diagnosis appeared to be more likely. His scalp EEG showed a posterior dominant rhythm of 4−5 Hz. He had frequent spikes in the right temporal (F8, T4) and frontocentral (FC) regions (F4,C4) and rare spikes in the left FC leads (F3,C3). To precisely characterize the nature of his symptoms, he underwent video-EEG telemetry. A total of 6 stereotyped events were recorded, all during micturition. Within a few seconds of starting to urinate, the child had slow neck flexion, looked to the right side with eye version to the right and had posturing of his upper limbs (right in extension and left in flexion). Its counterpart ictal EEG showed low amplitude fast activity in the midline centroparietal leads which increased in amplitude and culminated into bilateral centroparietal slowing towards the end of the attack. He regained consciousness 10 s after the cessation of ictal activity (Fig. 2). EKG recording during the ictus did not show any alteration in rhythm. It is likely that these seizures were originating from near the midline, possibly from the left hemisphere. Given that the micturition centers are also in the mesial frontal regions, this finding is not surprising. MRI done with a 3 T scanner was normal and PET-MRI did not show any areas of focal hypometabolism (Fig. 1a, ). Interictal MEG showed equivalent current dipoles clustered in the left midline posterior parietal region just above the corpus callosum (Fig. 1b). Though this is an interictal finding, it appears to be concordant with the hypothesis generated from VEEG. LEV was tapered and was prescribed lamotrigine (3 mg/kg) along with SVA (25 mg/kg). There was complete cessation of both reflex and non-reflex nocturnal seizures for the past 9 months.Fig. 2Clinical semiology and ictal EEG.Show full captiona. Clinical semiology b.

Micturition is a complex physiological process which is controlled by the spinal cord, brainstem and the cortex. The higher centers for micturition lie in the pons, periaqueductal grey, mesial frontal, anterior cingulate and insular cortex. Though the exact mechanism of reflex seizures during urination has not been elucidated, one might intuitively assume that mesial frontal activation could set off seizures in susceptible individuals. An ictal EEG and ictal PET study from Japan [[1]Okumura A. Kondo Y. Tsuji T. Ikuta T. Negoro T. Kato K. et al.Micturition induced seizures: ictal EEG and subtraction ictal SPECT findings.Epilepsy Res. 2007; 73: 119-121https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2006.09.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar] observed changes in the mesial frontal region in the ictal PET scan. Clinical semiology was also suggestive of ictal onset from the left supplementary motor area. Only a handful of cases have been reported in literature, whose clinical features have been reviewed [[2]Jang H.-J. Kwon M.J. Cho K.-O. Central Regulation of Micturition and Its Association With Epilepsy.Int Neurourol J. 2018; 22: 2-8https://doi.org/10.5213/inj.1836040.020Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar]. Interestingly most patients have co-existing neuro-developmental issues. Seizure onset though commonly is seen in the midline in EEGs, case reports have mentioned other areas of EEG changes namely frontotemporal and occipital regions. Semiology and ictal EEG similar to our patient has been reported from another center in southern India [[3]Rathore C. Teaching Video NeuroImage: Electroclinical characteristics of micturition-induced reflex epilepsy.Neurology. 2008; 70: 20https://doi.org/10.1212/01.wnl.0000312283.88683.0dCrossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar]. In another study, urodynamic testing during the ictus identified detrusor over activity [[4]Seth J.H. McLaughlin C. Eriksson S. Fowler C.J. Walker M.C. Panicker J.N. Blackouts in the toilet: a case of micturition-induced reflex epilepsy.Pract Neurol. 2014; 14: 261-263https://doi.org/10.1136/practneurol-2013-000733Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar]. To the best of our knowledge, no MEG data in this type of reflex epilepsy is currently available in literature. The MEG cluster has localized to the midline left parietal region, which is posterior to the 'known micturition center' in the frontal region. The interictal MEG corresponds fairly to the region ictal EEG onset. It may only be hypothesized that this region is closely networked with the frontal micturition center. This case highlights an unusual semiology of asymmetric tonic seizures during micturition in a child with mild developmental delay and normal imaging. Overall, VEEG and MEG has suggested the role of midline structures possibly in the left parietal region. The importance of video-telemetry is emphasized, as it can help differentiate between epileptic seizures vs non-epileptic conditions. Lamotrigine and valproate combination resulted in sustained seizure freedom for 9 months. Further studies are required to elucidate treatment algorithms for these patients, but may be cumbersome as this condition is exceedingly rare.",

      "title": "A Psychobiologic Analysis of Cognitive Failures",
      "abstract": "• Impairments in memory, learning, and related cognitive functions can vary in most psychiatric or neuropsychiatric disorders. Although many methods have been used to measure the presence and severity of cognitive symptoms, little progress has been made in defining and contrasting possible determinants of cognitive dysfunction. We propose a theoretical framework that describes impairments of higher mental functions in terms of both \"extrinsic\" noncognitive processes and \"intrinsic\" cognitive processes. The latter include effort (capacity) demanding processes; automatic processes; episodic (recent biographical) memory; and processes involved in accessing previously acquired knowledge. Noncognitive processes include sensitivity to reinforcement, activation, sensorimotor function, and mood. Each of these processes can be expressed at the time of information acquisition or retrieval from memory. Findings from clinical studies of patients suffering amnestic disorders, progressive dementias, and mood disorders illustrate the utility of such a model for understanding some of the determinants of cognitive dysfunction, for developing diagnostic tools, and for considering therapeutic strategies that may be useful in treating cognitive dysfunctions.",

Nevertheless, this is the picture that can be produced by an increased serum viscosity.<sup>1,2</sup>The bleeding characteristically occurs from the nose, mouth, or gums but may stem from the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract. Postoperative oozing is also common. Ocular symptoms range from partial to complete loss of vision due to retinal hemorrhages, venous changes, or even papilledema. The neurologic disturbances, often known as the Bing-Neel syndrome, include headache, dizziness, true vertigo, deafness, nystagmus, diplopia, ataxia, paresthesias, and postural hypotension. Less often, congestive heart failure or renal impairment is seen. The main cause of the hyperviscosity syndrome is increased viscosity of the serum (as in macroglobulinemia or myeloma), although increased numbers of cells (polycythemia or leukemia) or increased resistance of cells",

Symptoms are quite diverse, but not specific to this disease entity. The most common are: concentration and memory problems, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, joint pain, sleep disturbances, headache. Moreover, autonomic nervous system functioning and post-exertional malaise examination is considered to be important in diagnosis of adolescent patients with ME/CFS. The presented analysis of research shows that adolescents with ME/CFS urge to be understood and believed regarding an illness that few understood. Continuing education and remaining the social activity in young ME/CFS patients seems to be crucial in maintaining quality of life. ME/CFS in adolescents might lead to significant problems related to the school absenteeism, poorer quality of life at school, school and academic achievement compared to healthy adolescents. Anxiety might co-occur with ME/CFS in adolescents. Supportive therapy for comorbidities could be considered, if needed. However, there is no established effective treatment for ME/CFS, for which there is urgent need. (JNNN 2020;9(2):76–79)",

Although sub-clinical sleep disturbances (insufficient sleep duration or inadequate sleep quality) may be difficult to assess with conceptual and/or methodological clarity, this review attempts to summarize and synthesize these findings. First, the concept of sleep disturbance in a public health context is introduced, to provide context and rationale. Second, operational definitions of 'cardiometabolic disease' and 'sleep disturbance' are offered, to address many unclear operationalizations. Third, the extant literature is summarized regarding short or long sleep duration and/or insufficient sleep, insomnia and insomnia symptoms, general (non-specific sleep disturbances), circadian rhythm abnormalities that result in sleep disturbances, and, briefly, sleep-disordered breathing. Fourth, the review highlights the social/behavioural context of sleep, including discussions of sleep and race/ethnicity, socio-economic position, and other social/environmental factors, in order to place these findings in a social-environmental context relevant to public health. Fifth, the review highlights the issue of sleep as a domain of health behaviour and addresses issues regarding development of healthy sleep interventions. Finally, a research agenda of future directions is proposed.",

      "title": "Gambling Disorder",
      "abstract": "Gambling disorder is characterized by a persistent and recurrent maladaptive pattern of gambling behavior, preoccupation with gambling activities, loss of control, and continued gambling despite problems in social or occupational functioning (Box 62- ). It is associated with significant financial losses, legal problems, and disrupted interpersonal and familial relationships. Individuals with gambling disorder are also at increased risk for suicide attempts (Phillips et al. 1997), new-onset comorbid psychiatric disorders (Kessler et al. 2008), and several medical conditions (Morasco et al. 2006). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Gambling Disorder 312.31 F63.0 Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more) of the following in a 12-month period: Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble). Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed). After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (\"chasing\" one's losses). Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic episode . Specify if: Episodic: Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months. Persistent: Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for multiple years. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months. In sustained remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of 12 months or longer. Specify current severity: Mild: 4–5 criteria met. Moderate: 6–7 criteria met. Severe: 8–9 criteria met. Despite its serious consequences (Kessler et al. 2008; Petry et al. 2005), gambling disorder is rarely diagnosed and even more rarely treated (Slutske 2006). Less than 10% of individuals with gambling disorder ever seek treatment (Slutske 2006), probably because of a combination of ambivalence about seeking treatment on the part of the patients and limited access for those who wish to seek it. Although some data suggest that many individuals with gambling disorder recover without formal treatment (Hodgins and el-Guebaly 2000; Slutske et al. 2003), there is no available information on the time to remission in natural recovery or the risk of recurrence. Fortunately, despite our limited knowledge about the epidemiology and etiology of gambling disorders, a growing body of literature has examined pharmacological and psychological treatments for gambling disorder.",

      "title": "Genetic neurodevelopmental clustering and dyslexia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Dyslexia is a learning difficulty with neurodevelopmental origins, manifesting as reduced accuracy and speed in reading and spelling. It is substantially heritable and frequently co-occurs with other neurodevelopmental conditions, particularly attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Here, we investigate the genetic structure underlying dyslexia and a range of psychiatric traits using results from genome-wide association studies of dyslexia, ADHD, autism, anorexia nervosa, anxiety, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, and Tourette syndrome. Genomic Structural Equation Modelling (GenomicSEM) showed heightened support for a model consisting of five correlated latent genomic factors described as: F1) compulsive disorders (including obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa, Tourette syndrome), F2) psychotic disorders (including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia), F3) internalising disorders (including anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder), F4) neurodevelopmental traits (including autism, ADHD), and F5) attention and learning difficulties (including ADHD, dyslexia). ADHD loaded more strongly on the attention and learning difficulties latent factor (F5) than on the neurodevelopmental traits latent factor (F4). The attention and learning difficulties latent factor (F5) was positively correlated with internalising disorders (.40), neurodevelopmental traits (.25) and psychotic disorders (.17) latent factors, and negatively correlated with the compulsive disorders (–.16) latent factor. These factor correlations are mirrored in genetic correlations observed between the attention and learning difficulties latent factor and other cognitive, psychological and wellbeing traits. We further investigated genetic variants underlying both dyslexia and ADHD, which implicated 49 loci (40 not previously found in GWAS of the individual traits) mapping to 174 genes (121 not found in GWAS of individual traits) as potential pleiotropic variants. Our study confirms the increased genetic relation between dyslexia and ADHD versus other psychiatric traits and uncovers novel pleiotropic variants affecting both traits. In future, analyses including additional co-occurring traits such as dyscalculia and dyspraxia will allow a clearer definition of the attention and learning difficulties latent factor, yielding further insights into factor structure and pleiotropic effects.",

Insomnia may be either an acute or a chronic problem. Acute insomnia, usually defined as poor sleep associated with a specific life event, such as an important examination, resolves when the event passes or within a period of 3 weeks.

      "abstract": "Neuromotorne poteskoce se definiraju kao skupina poremecaja koje ukljucuju neki od oblika ostecenja mozga i njegovog razvijanja. One mogu utjecati na motoricki, kognitivni, bihevioralni razvoj, te na razvoj govora i ucenja, sa dugorocnim posljedicama. Rana identifikacija djece sa rizikom razvijanja neuromotornih poteskoca neophodna je za rani fizioterapijski pristup. Fizioterapijska intervencija, koja ima za cilj pozitivno modificirati prirodni tijek ovih poremecaja, osigurava pocetak svoje primjene vec u prvim tjednima i/ili mjesecima života. Genetske anomalije ili kongenitalne lezije mozga, ne moraju nužno biti odgovorni za pojavu neuromotornih poteskoca kod dojencadi. Stovise, okolina i iskustvo mogu modificirati razvoj mozga i poboljsati ishod u dojencadi koja su u riziku od nastanka neuromotornih poteskoca. Ova definicija svrstava u jednu grupu sirok spektar neuroloskih problema kao sto su: autizam, poremecaj pozornosti s hiperaktivnoscu (ADHD), epilepsija i cerebralna paraliza. Cerebralna paraliza je poremecaj pokreta i položaja uzrokovan neprogresivnim ostecenjem nezrelog mozga. Posljedice ostecenja utjecu na motoricku funkciju, misicno-kostani i kognitivni razvoj. Imajuci uvid u stanje problema, trebamo uzeti u obzir da cerebralna paraliza ne predstavlja samo medicinski problem, vec i socijalni i psiholoski problem. Habilitacija djece sa neuromotornim poteskocama veoma je bitna jer ona olaksava razvoj djeteta i pridonosi boljem rezultatu terapije i kvaliteti života. U habilitaciji djeteta sa cerebralnom paralizom neizostavna je suradnja strucnjaka razlicitih profesionalnih disciplina. Djeca sa cerebralnom paralizom i drugim neuromotornim poteskocama, edukacijom roditelja i dobivanjem uputa za provođenje terapijskih programa kod kuce dobivaju vježbe kako bi im pomogle u ostvarivanju fizioterapijskih ciljeva. Primjena kucnih programa može povoljno utjecati na daljnji razvoj djeteta s poteskocama. Veoma je bitno pridržavati se programa vježbanja jer je to neophodno za postizanje razine vježbi potrebne za postizanje ciljeva. Ukoliko se kucni programi pravilno primjenjuju, mogu poboljsati grube motoricke funkcije, pokrete ruku i sake, kao i brigu o sebi, komunikaciju i ponasanje djece sa cerebralnom paralizom.",

      "abstract": "Frailty is a clinical situation of decreased homeostatic reserve that, after a minor trigger (acute illness, fall, taking a drug...) increases the risk of an adverse event such as hospital admission, institutionalization, functional and/or cognitive decline, death, etc. Frailty can be understood as physical frailty, Fried's phenotype, a true geriatric syndrome that can be reversible by avoiding its progression to more advanced stages of irreversibility and dependence, and Rockwood's frailty due to accumulation of deficits, as a continuum of health or classification typology of the elderly along the frailty spectrum (healthy, robust, vulnerable, mild-moderate-severe and extreme frailty or end of life). The diagnosis of physical frailty is part of the comprehensive geriatric assessment, recommending the use of a performance test such as gait speed (<0,8m/s), Timed Up and Go (>12 s) or Short Physical Performance Battery (<10). Physical frailty is reversible by a multidisciplinary management based on three fundamental pillars: multicomponent physical exercise and resistance training, adequate protein and micronutrient intake (leucine, vitamin D, etc.) and appropriate pharmacological prescription, management of comorbidity and geriatric syndromes. Frailty is a risk factor for neurological disease progression and increased risk of adverse events in neurodegenerative diseases such as mild cognitive impairment, dementia, Parkinson's disease and cerebrovascular disease. Frailty based on the Clinical Frailty Scale or VIG-Frail shows patient typologies in relation to a greater or lesser state of fragility, being a basic prognostic tool of great utility in making diagnostic and therapeutic management decisions. It opens up a new opportunity for improvement in the management of neurological disease in the diagnosis and treatment of frailty.Concepto y manejo práctico de la fragilidad en neurología.La fragilidad se entiende como un situación clínica de disminución de la reserva homeostática que, ante un desencadenante (enfermedad aguda, caída, toma de un fármaco...), aumenta el riesgo de un evento adverso, como ingreso hospitalario, en residencia, deterioro funcional y/o cognitivo, muerte, etc. La fragilidad puede entenderse como fragilidad física, fenotipo de Fried, verdadero síndrome geriátrico, que puede ser reversible evitando su progresión a estadios más avanzados de irreversibilidad y de dependencia, y fragilidad por acúmulo de déficits de Rockwood, como continuum de salud o tipología de clasificación del anciano a lo largo del espectro de la fragilidad (sano, robusto, vulnerable, fragilidad leve-moderada-grave y extrema o final de vida). El diagnóstico de fragilidad física forma parte de la valoración geriátrica integral y se recomienda para su diagnóstico utilizar un test de ejecución, como velocidad de la marcha (menor de 0,8 m/s), Timed Up and Go (>12 segundos) o Short Physical Performance Battery (menor de 10). La fragilidad física es reversible basándose en un tratamiento multidisciplinar sobre tres pilares fundamentales: ejercicio físico multicompetente y contra resistencia, aporte adecuado de proteínas y micronutrientes (leucina, vitamina D, etc.), y adecuada prescripción farmacológica, de tratamiento de comorbilidad y de síndromes geriátricos. La fragilidad es un factor de riesgo de progresión de la enfermedad neurológica y de mayor riesgo de evento adverso tanto en enfermedades neurodegenerativas, como el deterioro cognitivo leve, la demencia o la enfermedad de Parkinson, como en la enfermedad cerebrovascular. La fragilidad a través de la Clinical Frailty Scale o el VIG-Frail muestra tipologías de pacientes en relación con un mayor o menor estado de fragilidad, y es una herramienta básica pronóstica de gran utilidad en la toma de decisiones de manejo diagnóstico y terapéutico.

      "abstract": "[EN] The patients with Alzheimer's disease suffer a memory loss, with a partial or total disability to recall something previously learned. Today the pharmacological intervention not is capable to reduced the deficit and his efficiency is little for generate a good everyday life. From the scientific literature, it has been proved that these limitations, in some cases, may be reduced if in the acquisition and retrieval new information, are provided to the patients in the form of contextual supports, phonetic, semantic or visual aids. Provide this kind of help generate savings of mental resources, by the short-term memory, allowing patients to focus fully on the activities performed and successfully carry out. Exists some form of interventions to reduce the memory deficit. For the acquisition phase, the visual encoding appears to be the most efficacies, but his efficacy is limited to short term memory, disappear the visual cues, disappear also the memorized information. This is very frustrating for sufferers of Alzheimer's, because means memorizing the same material every time is necessary to have it. For this reason the main purpose of this work is to propose a mnemonic learning model, based in acquisition phase on visual encoding, and consolidation phase on semantic elaboration with prosodic aspects of language (coherence, cohesion and rhythm), that would overcome the limitations found in Alzheimer's disease. To overcome these obstacles is necessary to make a second encoding of information encapsulating in an elementary linguistic structure as a simple sentence SVC (Subject, Verb, Complement), which is easily managed by the working memory and to foster the process of consolidation and automation. Present the items in to the verbal and visual form, correspond to saving cognitive energy, and generate a robust encoding. Made once the information on this form, for to automate the recollection and make information available for an indefinite period, it is necessary repeat the sentences created in a rhythmic form a sufficient number of times to make his pronunciation without any uncertainty and that the phonological system is saturated (are required a minimum of five repetition). The phase is realized with synchronized repetition with a metronome set at 120 bpm (beats per minute) and with the Spaced Retrieval Technique, well known in the scientific literature for consolidation of memory.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are a common problem among children beginning school and may be associated both with impaired school performance and with behavioral difficulties. Because these disorders manifest themselves highly variably among children of any given age, and even in an individual affected child, they need an appropriate diagnostic evaluation so that the many environmental and background factors that may be relevant to the further course of the problem can be assessed.Extensive data were obtained on approximately 1400 children who were tested before beginning school in 2005 by means of a special sleep questionnaire and another screening instrument that is used to assess behavioral strengths and difficulties (the SDQ, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire).Five percent of the children were found to have difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, or nocturnal awakening. Less frequent problems included parasomnias such as pavor nocturnus (0.5%), sleepwalking (0.1%), and frequent nightmares (1.7%).Sleep disorders increase the risk of daytime fatigue and of psychological problems in general, including both hyperactivity and excessive emotional stress. These results imply that sleep problems and emotional disturbances are intimately connected and underscore the importance of diagnosing sleep problems in young children.",

      "abstract": "Basic elements of artistic (and other) creativity are the technical-professional skill and knowledge, the special talent and ability and the willingness or motivation; one of which being absent results in partially realised creativity like juvenile, frustrated or abandoned types, respectively. Psychometric scales have been developed to measure everyday and eminent creativity, which show that creativity correlates with higher psychoticism, impulsivity and venturesomeness scores and with lower neuroticism and conformity scores of the personality test employed in a general population. Among the psychological components of creativity are the cognitive processes, mood, motivation, and personality traits. Regarding mood, a theory of \"inverted U\" has been proposed as elevation of mood facilitates creativity to a certain point after what extreme increase has an adverse effect on achievement. Analysing psychopathology and creativity among various professions, higher rates of psychopathology, especially affective symptoms, have been found in art-related professions. Examples of immortal poets, writers, painters, sculptors and composers, having created invaluable cultural treasures for mankind, illustrate that many of them showed signs of mood alterations (unipolar or bipolar affective disorder spectrum) which were expressed in their artistic products.",

      "title": "Animal well-being. II. Stress and distress.",
      "abstract": "The concepts of stress and distress are integral parts of consideration of animal well-being. Generally, stress refers to a state of threatened homeostasis, but precise clinical definitions, causes, and biological measurements have been controversial and confusing. Numerous factors associated with needs, life in captivity, threatening events, or aversive stimuli may threaten homeostasis. An animal's well-being or quality of life is an individual's internal somatic and mental state that is affected by what it knows or perceives; its feelings and motivational state; the responses to internal or external stimuli or environments; interacting variables; and phylogeny and ontogeny. Threats to homeostasis activate a complex pattern of behavioral changes and responses in the central and autonomic nervous and endocrine systems. Some responses can be considered normal adaptive and coping activities, satisfactorily handling the threats and therefore contributing to well-being. Other responses may be considered abnormal, maladaptive, and affective disorders. A persistent threat may lead to prolonged hyperactivity of the neuroendocrine system, which impairs rather than contributes to well-being. Except for extremes, differentiation between normal and abnormal internal states is frequently unclear. Individual adapting and coping styles may be more important than the stimuli in determining the varied responses. In animals, perception of a stimulus or life event is as important as the actual situation or environment. As caregivers, humans may know that an event or situation is no threat, but the animal usually does not function with the same information base as humans. A principal component in controlling an animal's response to an external event is determining how the animal perceives a situation. Mental and biological well-being is more likely to exist in animals if they are familiar with their environment, including social groups, and if they can predict or anticipate changes in the environment.",

      "title": "The role of extraocular muscle pulleys in incomitant non-paralytic strabismus",
      "abstract": "The rectus extraocular muscles (EOMs) and inferior oblique muscle have paths through the orbit constrained by connective tissue pulleys. These pulleys shift position during contraction and relaxation of the EOMs, dynamically changing the biomechanics of force transfer from the tendon onto the globe. The paths of the EOMs are tightly conserved in normal patients and disorders in the location and/or stability of the pulleys can create patterns of incomitant strabismus that may mimic oblique muscle dysfunction and cranial nerve paresis. Developmental disorders of pulley location can occur in conjunction with large, obvious abnormalities of orbital anatomy (e.g., craniosynostosis syndromes) or subtle, isolated abnormalities in the location of one or more pulleys. Acquired disorders of pulley location can be divided into four broad categories: Connective tissue disorders (e.g., Marfan syndrome), globe size disorders (e.g., high myopia), senile degeneration (e.g., sagging eye syndrome), and trauma (e.g., orbital fracture or postsurgical). Recognition of these disorders is important because abnormalities in pulley location and movement are often resistant to standard surgical approaches that involve strengthening or weakening the oblique muscles or changing the positions of the EOM insertions. Preoperative diagnosis is aided by: (1) Clinical history of predisposing risk factors, (2) observation of malpositioning of the medial canthus, lateral canthus, and globe, and (3) gaze-controlled orbital imaging using direct coronal slices. Finally, surgical correction frequently involves novel techniques that reposition and stabilize the pulley and posterior muscle belly within the orbit using permanent scleral sutures or silicone bands without changing the location of the muscle's insertion.",

The disorder is classified as developmental/epileptic encephalopathy with spike wave activation on sleep (DEE-SWAS), with 70% of affected patients having epileptic seizures. The disorder is diagnosed based on language regression in addition to severe EEG abnormalities during non-REM sleep. Sometimes patients with epileptiform disorders can sense when a seizure is imminent and alert caretakers of the situation so they can be safely situated when the seizure occurs. This period is called the preictal period or prodrome in which patients can sometimes detect changes in mood and behavior. However, in disorders such as LKS, the loss of verbal expression proves difficult for expression of needs, and could lead to dangerous situations along with a constant need for such patients to be monitored. In this study, machine learning techniques are utilized to analyze several hours of ictal and preictal EEG data from 23 patients in order to predict the onset of a seizure. This study aims to promote patient safety and reduce need for constant monitoring by predicting when a seizure will occur. Several machine learning models have been constructed and their accuracies have been analyzed and compared to those of other studies to create an optimized program which can accurately interpret EEG data.",

Nevertheless, because of a substantial overlap (about a third either way) between LD and ADHD, and because superficially diagnosed ADHD may actually be secondary to LD, the clinician must know how to evaluate for LD in all ''school problem'' referrals. Unfortunately, the ''official'' manner in which educational and legal systems define LD differs from state to state depending on variations in statistical comparisons of aptitude and achievement scores. In general, however, the term implies a significant deficit in learning relative to expectations based on intellectual ability, not explained by environment or psychological symptoms. While mention is sometimes made of ''underlying psychological processes,'' even after aptitude-achievement discrepancies are judged statistically significant, these descriptors of the student are remote from concepts in cognitive neuroscience=neuropsychology. Additionally, the roles of subcategories of DMCD in various aspects of child development (e.g., handwriting, neatness of appearance, ability to participate in sports or music or art) should be of special concern to the pediatric neurologist, whose training equips him or her to appreciate the motor status of the student in ways that other specialities do not.",

      "abstract": "Drowsiness is common in those with DLB and PDD, and can interfere with thinking and memory, as well as quality of life. There are a variety of potential reasons for this, many treatable. Getting a little sleepy during a boring task or napping after lunch on the weekend is not a sign of a medical problem. However, daytime drowsiness should draw attention in certain circumstances: 1. More than one nap most days, or near-daily naps that span 2 to 3 hours 2. Falling asleep during conversations or eating 3. Frequently falling asleep during reading, watching TV, doing computer work or other vigilant tasks 4. Returning to sleep after breakfast These are signs that could indicate that nighttime sleep was not adequate (nonrestorative) but could have other explanations. Daytime drowsiness has limited causes: 1. Insomnia at bedtime 2. Awakening during the night 3. Insufficient time spent in bed at night 4. Poor quality sleep at night (despite adequate time in bed) 5. Daytime medications inducing drowsiness 6. A primary sleep disorder directly causing drowsiness (which may be DLB or PDD related) We will explore each of these possible causes and how they might be diagnosed and treated. If a person with DLB or PDD is excessively drowsy, at least one of these could be the problem. Inability to get to sleep at bedtime can translate into sleepiness during the daytime. Many people with DLB or PDD who experience insomnia benefit from nighttime carbidopa/levodopa doses. The benefits of carbidopa/levodopa dosing at bedtime for Lewy-related insomnia were addressed in Chapter 9. Various other factors, however, may contribute to insomnia. Sometimes medications taken in the evening are alerting. Such drugs include duloxetine (Cymbalta) or venlafaxine (Effexor), used for depression and often dosed twice daily. Elimination of all but the morning dose may allow sleep in such cases. Other drugs for depression from the Prozac class (SSRIs; see the list in Chapter 18) may also cause insomnia if taken at bedtime. A simple strategy is to simply switch to morning dosing on a trial basis. The tricyclic antidepressants, such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, or protriptyline, should not cause insomnia; they may induce sleep. Occasionally, sleepy people are prescribed stimulants with long-acting properties, such as extended-release methylphenidate (Concerta), modafinil (Provigil), or armodafinil (Nuvigil).",

Those born with FXS experience cognitive and social impairments, developmental delays, and some features of autism spectrum disorders. Carriers of a premutation (55-200 CGG repeats) are generally not severely affected early in life; however, are at high risk of developing the late onset neurodegenerative disorder, Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS), or Fragile X-associated Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (FXPOI), and may have other medical conditions such as developmental delay, autism spectrum disorders, hypertension, anxiety, and immune-mediated disorders. Here we present a case of a 58-year-old man with a borderline IQ, average memory skills, and executive function deficits. He met criteria for multiple psychiatric diagnoses and presented with tremor and ataxia, meeting criteria for FXTAS. Molecular testing unveiled a completely unmethylated FMR1 full mutation in peripheral blood mononucleated cells with elevated FMR1 mRNA and premutation alleles of different sizes in two other tissues (primary fibroblasts and sperm), indicating the presence of allele instability based on both inter- and intra-tissue mosaicism. The observation of FXTAS in this case of a full mutation mosaic man suggests that the pathogenic mechanism underlying this disorder is not observed exclusively in premutation carriers as it was originally thought. The concomitant presence of features of FXS and late onset neurological deterioration with probable FXTAS likely result from a combined molecular pathology of elevated FMR1 mRNA levels, a molecular hallmark of FXTAS and low FMRP expression that leads to FXS.",

      "title": "Behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia – selected diagnostic dilemmas in neuropsychiatry",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Differential diagnosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia remains a challenge for neurologists and psychiatrists as some behavioural symptoms of this illness and psychiatric disorders, such as apathy, are not specific. Aim: The paper aims at presenting the differential diagnosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and primary psychiatric disorders. Discussion: Behavioural symptoms of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia overlap with symptoms typical for primary psychiatric disorders. Psychotic symptoms, apathy and inappropriate behaviour are prominent in schizophrenia. Repetitive behaviours are typical for obsessive-compulsive disorders. Inattention and impulsivity are common in attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder. Disinhibition is typical of mania in the context of bipolar disorder. Thus, all these psychiatric diagnoses need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. This condition is associated with language deficits and more widespread executive and social cognition deficits. Also, the presence of neurological symptoms, such as oculomotor dysfunction, upper/lower motor neuron dysfunction or bradykinesia, may facilitate the diagnosis. Functional decline is observed during follow-up in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, but not in phenocopy syndrome. Conclusions: Differential diagnosis requires integration of behavioural and neuropsychological data with the results of neurological assessment and neuroimaging work-up. In ambiguous cases, if genetic testing is negative, only longitudinal observation can confirm the diagnosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia or phenocopy syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Anti‐immunoglobulin‐like cell adhesion molecule 5 (IgLON5) disease is an autoimmune encephalitis that targets the cell adhesion molecule, IgLON5. The disease presents with various clinical features, including sleep disorders, bulbar palsy, movement disorders, cognitive dysfunction and neuromuscular manifestations. Sleep disorders are characterized by parasomnias and sleep‐disordered breathing (stridor and sleep apnea). Bulbar palsy includes dysarthria, dysphagia, vocal cord paralysis and stridor. Movement disorders include a variety of symptoms and signs, such as chorea, dystonia, rigidity, tremor, myoclonus and myorhythmia. Cognitive dysfunction includes executive dysfunction, impairment of attention, and verbal and visual memory dysfunction. Neuromuscular manifestations include fasciculations in the tongue and peripheral muscles, limb weakness, and muscle atrophy. Some patients resemble those with neurodegenerative diseases, such as progressive supranuclear palsy or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. On video polysomnography, undifferentiated non‐rapid eye movement sleep and poorly structured N2 sleep are characteristic. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid studies are often normal or non‐specific. Human leukocyte antigen testing shows that HLA‐DRB1*10:01‐DQB1*05:01 is highly associated with the disease. Pathologically, neuronal deposition of both hyperphosphorylated 3‐repeat and 4‐repeat tau isoforms, neuronal loss, and gliosis in the hypothalamus, brainstem tegmentum, and upper cervical cord are observed. Some patients are responsive to immunotherapies, such as steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasma exchange therapy and rituximab. Factors associated with a favorable response to immunotherapies include early initiation of treatment, cerebrospinal fluid inflammation and immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) predominance of IgLON5 antibody compared with immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4). Anti‐IgLON5 disease should be suspected in patients with atypical movement disorders complicated by sleep disturbances.",

      "abstract": "Although shouting is a common psycho-behavioral symptom in geriatric institutions, the question of its assessment and treatment remains seldom studied and has rarely been the subject of specific recommendations. The combination of the focus group method and brainstorming has emerged as a methodology both relevant and feasible in geriatric facility to identify the coping strategies used by professionals and generalize guidelines for clinical observation and vocally disruptive behaviors management (shouting). The standardized gathering of professional experiences in nursing homes and their analysis with reference to results of the literature enabled the development of an analytical and clinical decision making diagram that can be an operational tool to cope with the occurrence of shouting in older people with dementia. Five types of triggers/aggravating shoutings emerged: 1) physical or moral pain and emotional reactions, 2) presence of sensory loss, 3) social isolation, under-stimulation or hyper sensitivity to stimulation and care, 4) reminiscences and 5) re-emergence of painful memories and loss of language skills. These factors have been associated with five methods of intervention : 1) pharmacological treatments, 2) animations, such as listening to music, physical activity and workshops using therapeutic mediation, 3) family or animal support and use of interventions to provide relaxation or stimulation, 4) interventions to deal with sensory deficits and 5) interventions modifying the environment.",

      "abstract": "Peningkatan suara dengan gelombang kompleks yang tidak beraturan dikenal sebagai bising, merupakan salah satu stresor bagi individu. Bila hal tersebut terjadi berulangkali dan terus menerus sehingga melampaui adaptasi individu maka berakibat tetjadi kondisi stres yang merusak atau sering disebut distress. Keadaan bising dapat berakibat kelainan pada sistem pendengaran serta menurunkan kemampuan dalam berkomunikasi, disamping sebagai stresor yang dapat memodulasi respons imun. Telah dilaporkan bahwa pekerja yang berada atau bekerja di tempat yang mempunyai tingkat kebisingan tinggi sering mengalami gangguan kesehatan dan mudah terserang infeksi. Bila hal tersebut tidak segera mendapat perhatian maka kejadian dengan mekanisme yang belum jelas berpeluang besar terjadi, yang pada akhirnya akan mempengaruhi kualitas sumber daya manusia yang selanjutnya berakibat produktivitas kerja menurun. Intensitas suara yang melebihi 85 dB selama 1 jam, diberikan dalam waktu 14 hari berpeluang un tuk mengakibatkan gangguan pendengaran, disamping mempengaruhi kondisi kesehatan individu. Sistem safaf, endokrin, dan sistem imun saling berhubungan dengan memanfaatkan berbagai substansi penghantar sinyal stres dan reseptor sinyal, yang berakibat terjadi pengaturan perilaku sel pada sistem imun. Stres yang ditunjukkan dengan peningkatan kortisol dan katekolamin akan menekan aktivitas sel imunokompeten berakibat penurunan ketahanan tubuh. Pengaruh kortisol pada hambatan sekresi IL-l eleh makrofag dan IT,-2 oleh sel Th yang clapat menurunkan sintesis imunogobulin oleh sel B. Pengaruh perubahan kondisi ketahanan tubuh akibat peningkatan kebisingan menunjukkan bahwa terdapat hubungan stres pada sistem imun yang dicerminkan oleh perubahan ketahanan tubuh dengan tingkat kebisingan. Namun sampai saat ini mekanisme perubahan ketahanan tubuh akibat pengaruh stresor suara tersebut belum terungkap dengan jelas. Psikoneuroimunologi sebagai ilmu yang digunakan untuk menjelaskan tentang respons imun pada kondisi stres mulai dikembangkan. Konsep ini memberi peluang untuk menjelaskan perubahan biologis sebagai bentuk respons stres oleh rangsangan yaitu tingkat kebisingan. Sinyal stres yang dirasakan individu, dirambatkan melalui hypotalamic - pituitary - adrenocortical axis (HPA axis). Stresor menyebabkan peningkatan corticotropin releasing factor ( CRF) hipotalamus, yang memicu aktivitas HPA aksis. Dalam kondisi normal sel imunokompeten dalam keadaan homeostasis. Perubahan kadar kortisol, jumlah limfosit dan IgG akan menentukan hubungan antara stres yang disebabkan oleh kebisingan dengan perubahan respons ketahanan tubuh. Namun sejauh ini mekanisme pengaruh kebisingan terhadap modulasi respons imun tersebut belum terungkap dengan jelas. Jenis penelitian eksperimental, bertujuan untuk menjelaskan mekanisme inmnopatobiogenesis respons imun yang stres, dengam rancangan penelitian faktorial the post test only control group design dan analisis multivariat. Penelitian menggunakan stresor suara dengan lama paparan 1 jam dan 2 jam serta intensitas suara 40-50 dB dan intensitas suara > 85 dB pada hewan coba mencit BALB/c jantan berumur 6-8 minggu (sexualy mature), berat badan kurang lebih 40 gram, dibagi 6 kelompok dengan setiap kelompok terdiri dari 8 sampel secara alokasi random, variable tergantung adalah kortisol, jumlah limfosit, IgG. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa terjadi peningkatan kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan kadar IgG serum (p 85 dB. Demikian pula pada paparan.selama 2 jam dengan intensitas suara 40-50 dB maupun intensitas suara > 85 dB yaitu peningkatan kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan kadar IgG serum (p 85 dB terjadi peningkatan lebih tinggi untuk kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan IgG serum yang lebih rendah, daripada intensitas suara 40-50 dB (p<0,01). Dengan demikian dapat disimpulkan bahwa pada stres akibat stresor suara yang berlangsung cepat ataupun lama disertai dengan intensitas suara yang berbeda dapat menyebabkan modulasi respons imun. </description",

      "title": "Let's Focus on Frailty",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Frailty may be a clinical condition during which a person's vulnerability to acquiring dependency and/or mortality increases after they are subjected to a stressor.[1] Frailty is most regularly characterized as an aging-related disorder of physiological decline, characterized by marked vulnerability to unfavorable health outcomes, such as comorbidities, polypharmacy, the loss of independence, increasing hospitalizations, and mortality, improving the care for the most vulnerable subset of patients by frailty awareness and associated risks for adverse health outcomes. The physical frailty is \"A medical syndrome with multiple causes and contributors that are characterized by diminished strength, endurance, and reduced physiologic function that increases an individual's vulnerability for developing increased dependency and/or death.\"[2] Frail people usually have three or more than five symptoms such as unintentional weight loss (10 or more pounds within the past year), muscle loss and weakness, fatigue, reduced walking speed, and reduced levels of physical activity. WHAT ARE CONSEQUENCES OF FRAILTY? Frailty is viewed as a geriatric disorder with various causes and contributors portrayed by reduced strength, perseverance and diminished physiologic capacity, and increasing a person's weakness for developing disability.[1] As one of the fundamental causes of functional decrease in the elderly, sarcopenia has a high clinical effect, influencing the status and recuperation of an individual's mobility, independence, and quality of life conveys an increased danger for chronic frailty which results in falls, disability, hospitalization, and mortality.[3] WHAT ARE the RISK FACTORS FOR FRAILTY? The elements related with frailty, especially sociodemographic factors such as age, gender, and educational level, just as actual factors, for example, body weight and activities of daily living.[4] Malnutrition, inactivity, and comorbidities have a high antagonistic effect in older people and are risk factors for sarcopenia and physical frailty. The loss of muscle mass, strength, and function, called sarcopenia, is a key factor in the development of physical frailty. WHAT IS ORAL FRAILTY? Oral frailty is characterized as a progression of phenomena and cycles that lead to changes in different oral conditions (number of teeth, oral cleanliness, oral capacities, and so forth) related with aging, and accompanied by diminished interest in oral health, decreased physical and mental reserve capacity, and an expansion in oral frailty prompting to eating dysfunction; the general impact is of deteriorating physical and mental capacity.[5] HOW TO ASSESS THE ORAL FRAILTY? Oral assessments comprised of 16 measures including five dental status, eight oral functions, and three subjective difficulties. The 16 measures were as follows: dental status – number of natural teeth and functioning teeth, community periodontal index, tongue thickness as a marker of oral nutrient status, and turbidity of mouth-rinsed water as a marker of oral hygiene. Oral functions – maximum occlusal force, chewing ability as a marker of general masticatory performance, maximum tongue pressure, repetitive saliva-swallowing test (RSST), articulatory oral motor skill for \"pa, ta, ka\" and experience of dry mouth measured-oral wettability. Subjective assessments – difficulties in eating and swallowing, and using the questionnaire chewing ability, RSST, xerostomia. Oral frailty – the accumulation of a slightly poor status of oral conditions and function, strongly predicts physical frailty, dysphagia, malnutrition, need for long-term care, and mortality. IS ORAL FRAILTY LINKED TO PHYSICAL FRAILTY? A hypothesis for the connection between poor oral health and frailty is that poor diet intervenes the impact of poor oral health (like loss of teeth, dental agony, or potentially biting issues), prompting to frailty.[6] Poor eating routine and nutritional risk have for some time been involved in the etiology and progression of frailty by affecting useful functional reserves and strength and leading to loss of energy, functional decline, morbidity, and subsequent frailty. Oral frailty was essentially connected with physical frailty by 66.6% and sarcopenia by 72.7%. Poor oral condition in hospitalized patients can be attributed to factors such as age, physical dependency, psychological decline, malnutrition, low skeletal muscle mass and strength, and multimorbidity.[7] WHAT ARE the POLICY IMPLICATIONS? The proof from frailty studies has not yet been completely converted into clinical practice and medical care strategy making. As of now, in any case, there is no viable treatment for frailty and the best intervention is not yet known. In view of presently available proof, the multicomponent exercise, which incorporates resistance training, appears to be promising.[8] The current challenges in frailty research incorporate the absence of a worldwide standard meaning of frailty, further comprehension of interventions to reverse frailty, the best planning for intervention, and education/training of health-care professionals. Population-based evaluation for frailty could be costly and resource intensive, and as of now, there is no obvious proof for expected advantage, cost-adequacy, or improved results. Research and development efforts aimed toward building up and spreading best practice in frailty should not lack strategic consideration regarding older people with early (pre-) frailty that passes up on a chance to address a few requests on health and social care services. Another significant space of delicacy research is schooling and preparing The medical services experts including doctors, attendants, and other medical workers need to comprehend essential standards of care for frail older adults and to have the option to distinguish frailty and give therapy/interventions. There is an increasing interest in frailty in other medical fields than the geriatrics One model is that frailty has recently been pursued as a potential risk assessment measure for older surgical patients and has demonstrated to be promising in anticipating postoperative intricacies, for example, mortality or length of emergency clinic stay. Finally, frailty research may have evolved without considering the patient perspective Frailty can be considered as a profoundly adverse term and being marked as frail may influence contrarily the weakest people differently. The individuals who were marked as \"old and fragile\" by others were bound to be related with a loss of interest in friendly and proactive tasks, poor physical health, and increased disparagement. The future innovative work endeavors need to recognize the risks of naming older individuals in defaming ways and stay away from turning into the new cloak of ageism and an instrument for segregation.[8] Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "abstract": "Abstract Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a syndrome of focal, often asymmetric, neurodegeneration presenting clinically as a progressive dementia associated with focal atrophy of the frontal and/or temporal lobes. The disease is capable of producing striking changes in personality, behaviour, and language, with a diverse range of clinical presentations. Two major clinical presentations of FTLD are recognized. In the frontal variant — usually designated frontotemporal dementia (FTD) — the emergence of disinhibition, mental rigidity, stereotyped and perseverative behaviour, hyperorality, and loss of insight give rise to marked changes in personality. An aphasic variant — designated primary progressive aphasia (PPA) — is also recognized. The fluent variant appear to have difficulty expressing and understanding meaning, a syndrome that has been given the name semantic dementia (SD). In contrast, the nonfluent variant — progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA). Because FTLD can be associated with degeneration of cortical and bulbar motor neurons and anterior horn cells of the spinal cord, some patients with FTD, SD, or PNFA also meet clinical criteria for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).",

      "abstract": "The article states that the investigator must be well aware of the various reasons for conscious or unconscious misrepresentation or reporting of false testimony by a person. These reasons are conditionally divided by the author into psychological, social and psychophysiological. The essence of the main psychophysiological mnestic reasons for a person’s unintentional giving of unreliable testimony during investigative (search) actions is revealed. The author includes repressed memories and types of memory disorders as such causes: dysmnesia (hypermnesia, hypomnesia and different variants of amnesia (anterograde, retrograde, delayed, fixation, reversal, congrats and progressive) and paramnesia (confabulation, pseudo reminiscence, cryptomnesia, echomnesia and phantasms). The meaningful essence and peculiarities of the influence of repressed memories and types of memory disorders (dysmnesia and paramnesia) on the person’s testimony are revealed. It is emphasized that since the preliminary investigation and trial process relies on the memory of the suspect, the accused or the witness, any kind of memory impairment can have significant consequences in these areas. Because it gives reason to doubt the person’s testimony and confessions. Therefore, the investigator in the process of carrying out investigative (search) actions must be vigilant and prudent in order to verify the information and collect and obtain accurate information from the subject of the pre-trial investigation. And for this, he must know well the substantive essence of the main types of violations of cognitive, volitional, emotional and motivational processes and states, as well as the criteria for their diagnosis.",

Under the term dysphasia would be classified both stammering and stuttering. I have never encountered either of these difficulties in Little's disease and therefore I will not discuss them. In patients with cortical injuries, I have observed two types of disability: (1) difficulty in making certain sounds, for instance,<i>sw</i>in \"sweet,\" or in giving the rough sound to a vowel, such as<i>h</i>in \"hello\"; (2) difficulty in slipping rapidly and easily from syllable to syllable. The latter disability may be obvious when the second sound is a repetition of the first, as in \"mama\"; but it is much more likely to be enhanced when",

This results in severe problems with social relationships, communication, and behavior. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) defines autism as a pervasive developmental disorder characterized by: • Impairments in communication • Impairments in social interaction, and • Restricted, repetitive, and stereotypic patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASDs) handle information in their brain differently than other people. ASDs are “spectrum disorders.” That means ASDs affect each person in different ways, and can range from very mild to severe. Children with ASDs share some similar symptoms, such as problems with social interaction. But there are differences in when the symptoms start, how severe they are, and the exact nature of the symptoms. It is a spectrum condition, which means that, while all children with autism share certain difficulties, their condition will affect them in different ways. Some people with autism are able to live relatively independent lives but others may have accompanying learning disabilities and need a lifetime of specialist support. Children with autism may also experience over- or under-sensitivity to sounds, touch, tastes, smells, light or colors.",

      "abstract": "It has been estimated that 6% to 7% of school-aged children manifest poor coordination.1 Clinicians will rarely identify the presence of this type of disability from their findings during routine physical and neurologic examinations. What is required is careful observation of the child during performance of fine and gross developmental motor tasks. It is infrequent that parents will express concern to the pediatrician, unless they have clues from nursery school or grade school teachers, coaches, peers, or, occasionally, from the child him- or herself. The child is usually the first one to be aware of motor limitations, especially when he or she is in competition with children of the same age. Unfortunately, the child does not usually verbalize his or her concern but will refrain from participating in competitive motor activities to conceal motor inadequacies. DEFINITION The term \"clumsy child\" refers to a boy or girl who performs fine and/or gross motor tasks in an immature, disorganized, erratic, slow, irregular, or inconsistent fashion. The relevant motor skills are imprecise rather than grossly impaired and the neurologic examination does not reveal significant postural disabilities or involuntary movements. SIGNIFICANCE A pediatrician should not minimize the significance of clumsiness. It is frequently associated with other evidence of cerebral dysfunction, such as cognitive and/or perceptual impairments that may result in learning disabilities.",

Neurobehavioral disorders, including autism, are common, and approximately half of the patients have seizures.4, 5 In 2019, Hamanaka et al..5 first reported heterozygous mutations in the PHF21A gene in patients with IDDBCS The PHF21A gene is located on chromosome 11p11.2 and encodes BHC80, a component of the BRAF35-histone deacetylase complex (BHC), which is involved in transcriptional repression of neuron-specific genes and expressed highly in brain and skeletal muscle.5, 6 PHF21A haploinsufficiency is associated with intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies.7 To date, 15 cases have been reported involving microdeletion frameshift or nonsense variants in the PHF21A gene.4, 5, 8-13 This report describes AS coexisting with a PHF21A-related disorder. The patient was a 16-year-old Chinese boy who was the first child of unrelated parents. He was born full-term after an uneventful pregnancy and vaginal delivery with a birth weight of 8 kg. Signs of developmental delay and intellectual disabilities appeared early in life. He learned to crawl at 12 months and to walk at 18 months and experienced poor balance and motor coordination. Speech delay was also present. He learned to say short sentences at 2.5 years of age. At 1 year of age, he underwent surgery to correct an atrioventricular septal defect. The patient visited the Rheumatology Clinic of Shandong Provincial Hospital at 14 years old with a complaint of 1.5 years of low back pain, which had developed gradually. He experienced morning stiffness that improved with exercise but not with rest. At presentation, he weighed 93 kg (97th percentile), and his height was 178 cm (97th percentile). He showed the unique features of a broad forehead, low and flat nasal bridge, sparse teeth, and externally rotated ears. Physical examination revealed restricted spinal movement in both the sagittal and frontal planes and percussion tenderness over the T12–L2 spine; neurological examination findings were within normal limits. Laboratory testing demonstrated a positive human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27) result, prolonged erythrocyte sedimentation rate (43 mm/h; reference range: 0–15 mm/h), and elevated C-reactive protein (15.60 mg/L; reference range: 0–5 mg/L) and interleukin 6 (15.41 pg/mL; reference range: 0–7 pg/mL) concentrations. Other routine laboratory examination results, such as blood counts, liver function, and blood biochemistry, were normal. Autoantibodies, including antinuclear antibodies, antidouble-stranded DNA antibodies, anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, were absent. Tuberculosis screening tests, namely tuberculosis antibody, T-SPOT, and purified protein derivative tests, were negative; the result of rheumatoid factor testing was also negative. Lumbar and sacroiliac joint magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a normal physiological curve, narrowed intervertebral spaces, and a coarse margin of L1/2. MRI also showed inflammatory lesions, Hummer's nodules in L1 and L2, herniated intervertebral disks at L4/5 and L5/S1, and abnormal patchy high T1 signal intensity in bilateral sacroiliac joints, indicating sacroiliitis. Upon biopsy of the L2 vertebra, a slimy substance was detected, and pathological analysis revealed neutrophil proliferation and mild edema of the bone trabecula. No granulomatous inflammation, such as that seen with tuberculosis, was observed. Immunohistochemical studies showed that immunoglobulin G4, Congo red staining, and cluster of differentiation (CD)68 and CD117 evaluations were negative while CD235a was positive. As the patient was under 45 years of age and presented with more than one clinical criterion of AS, namely inflammatory low back pain for more than 3 months, limited lumbar spinal motion in both the sagittal and frontal planes and signs of bilateral sacroiliitis on MRI, the radiological criteria met the modified New York criteria for diagnosis of AS.14 The clinical features and test results did not support a diagnosis of diseases with similar manifestations, such as psoriasis; Reiter syndrome; synovitis, acne, pustulosis, and osteitis syndrome; diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis; enteropathic arthritis; and spinal tuberculosis. The patient had also visited the endocrinology department previously because of overgrowth and underwent relevant examinations, including hormone levels for the different pituitary axes, and pituitary MRI. As a result, endocrine and metabolic diseases such as acromegaly were ruled out because the hormone profile did not reveal abnormal results. Hence, we initiated therapy with oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (loxoprofen sodium 60 mg three times daily, which was subsequently changed to celecoxib 0.2 g twice daily) and injections of etanercept (25 mg twice weekly). However, the patient experienced no significant pain relief after 3 months of treatment. Therefore, we initiated 150 mg secukinumab therapy for the next 3 months instead. Adalimumab (40 mg biweekly) was given subcutaneously thereafter. However, the patient complained of persistent lower back pain at the most recent follow-up visit. The patient's father had proximal junctional kyphosis with a 10-year history of low back pain, and he suffered from intellectual disability. HLA-B27 testing revealed a positive result, and he had been diagnosed as having AS 1 year after his son was diagnosed. Other known family members were unaffected (Figure 1A). Whole exome sequencing was performed on a high throughput sequencing platform for the patient and his parents. Sequencing results were compared with reference genome hg19, and the pathogenicity of detected variants was evaluated in accordance with the 2015 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines.15 The heterogeneous variant, PHF21A (NM_00110802.1) c.840del (p.S280Sfs*14), was identified and confirmed to be of paternal origin by Sanger sequencing (Figure 1B). In accordance with the 2015 ACMG guidelines, the c.840del (p.S280Sfs*14) variant was defined as the pathogenic variant on the basis of the following evidence: this was a known loss-of-function variant recorded in the Human Gene Mutation Database; the deletion of the 840th nucleobase of the PHF21A gene caused frameshift and premature termination of protein synthesis (p.S280Sfs*14) (PVS1); and this variant was absent from the population databases in the Genome Aggregation Database (PM2). IDDBCS is caused by a heterozygous mutation in the PHF21A gene. The PHF21A gene encodes BHC80, a subunit of BHC, and mediates negative regulation of neuron-specific gene expression. This occurs by recruitment at the cis-regulatory element (repressor element 1 or neuron-restrictive silencer element sites) by repressor element 1 silencing transcription factor. BCH80 acts as a chromatin modifier by regulating histone demethylation and deacetylation.16, 17 Histone methylation dysregulation is a major driver of neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorder (ASD).18 Orthologous suppression of PHF21A in a zebrafish model caused neuronal apoptosis and abnormal development of the head, face, and jaw,7 supporting the etiological role of PHF21A in neural and craniofacial abnormalities. The high transcription levels of PHF21A in the brain and skeletal muscle further support its relationship with neurological and hypotonia phenotypes.4 Although the phenotypic spectrum of intellectual disabilities, developmental delays, facial anomalies, overgrowth, and obesity in our case was generally consistent with that of previously reported cases, the pathogenic variant carried by our patient differed from those in previous reports.4, 5, 12, 13 This finding reinforces that PHF21A haploinsufficiency could contribute to intellectual developmental disorders and facial dysmorphism. Compared with previous cases, our patient showed no obvious cranial anomalies, finger anomalies, epilepsy, hypotonia, or diagnosis of ASD or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Different nucleotide changes between previous cases and our case may account for the discrepancy mentioned above, with mutations possibly located in different exons. Satterstrom et al.10 identified a female patient who carried the same frameshift mutation in exon 9 as that in our patient. However, the clinical features in the report were not provided except for the presence of ASD. Thus, there was insufficient evidence to confirm a clear relationship between the phenotypic spectrum and specific nucleotide changes. Several possible reasons may explain the limited response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and biological agents in our patient. One is that the low back pain had mechanical features that resulted from spinal overload caused by obesity and/or an excessive vertebral growth rate. Another was that the drug dosages were insufficient owing to the patient's overweight. It is also possible that IDDBCS itself could have resulted in poor therapeutic effects; however, the underlying mechanism is unclear. We report the coexistence of AS and IDDBCS in a patient with a genetic familial history, and the paternally-inherited frameshift variant c.840del (p.S280Sfs*14) was detected in the PHF21A gene. PHF21A gene haploinsufficiency has been reconfirmed as a cause of neurobehavioral disorders and craniofacial dysmorphism. Our findings provide additional insight into phenotypes and genotypes of PHF21A-related disorders. However, an association between PHF21A gene disruption and the pathogenesis of AS was not confirmed and requires further research. Weizhen Xiang and Min Fu collected data and wrote the manuscript.

      "title": "The Epigenome in Neurodevelopmental Disorders",
      "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental diseases (NDDs), such as autism spectrum disorders, epilepsy, and schizophrenia, are characterized by diverse facets of neurological and psychiatric symptoms, differing in etiology, onset and severity. Such symptoms include mental delay, cognitive and language impairments, or restrictions to adaptive and social behavior. Nevertheless, all have in common that critical milestones of brain development are disrupted, leading to functional deficits of the central nervous system and clinical manifestation in child- or adulthood. To approach how the different development-associated neuropathologies can occur and which risk factors or critical processes are involved in provoking higher susceptibility for such diseases, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying proper brain formation is required. NDDs rely on deficits in neuronal identity, proportion or function, whereby a defective development of the cerebral cortex, the seat of higher cognitive functions, is implicated in numerous disorders. Such deficits can be provoked by genetic and environmental factors during corticogenesis. Thereby, epigenetic mechanisms can act as an interface between external stimuli and the genome, since they are known to be responsive to external stimuli also in cortical neurons. In line with that, DNA methylation, histone modifications/variants, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, as well as regulatory non-coding RNAs regulate diverse aspects of neuronal development, and alterations in epigenomic marks have been associated with NDDs of varying phenotypes. Here, we provide an overview of essential steps of mammalian corticogenesis, and discuss the role of epigenetic mechanisms assumed to contribute to pathophysiological aspects of NDDs, when being disrupted.",

Indications for surgically planned amputation include bone or soft tissue neoplasia of an extremity, complicated fracture healing (malunion or nonunion), debilitating peripheral nerve damage, congenital deformity, severe arthritis, ischemic necrosis, and revision of a traumatic injury. Contraindications to limb amputation include any patient with a debilitating condition in its remaining limbs or with an obese body condition score that would impair a three-legged gait. Thorough orthopedic and neurologic examination of patients is highly recommended preoperatively. This chapter focuses on specific aspects of complications associated with limb amputation and onychectomy. It discusses inappropriate level of amputation, tissue swelling, loss of function and complications associated with onychectomy. Loss of function in amputees may be associated with disease affecting the remaining limb(s). Nonphysical complications include behaviors such as anxiety and depression. They may be more prominent in human amputees than in animals.",

Distinct from Foreign Accent Syndrome (FAS), FLS often arises acutely following anesthesia, brain injury, or psychological stress. Although neuroimaging typically reveals no structural pathology, functional disconnection within bilingual language control systems has been hypothesized. Case reports suggest contributions from both neurological disruptions-such as transient cortical dysfunction-and psychiatric mechanisms, including dissociation and conversion phenomena. This review synthesizes the clinical features, diagnostic strategies, neurocognitive models, and psychiatric interpretations of FLS. It emphasizes the importance of multidisciplinary evaluation and treatment and outlines prognosis patterns. The need for longitudinal follow-up, functional imaging studies, and centralized case databases is highlighted to better understand the pathophysiology and clinical management of this enigmatic syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most prevalent neurobehavioral disorder in childhood. The major components of this disorder are developmentally inappropriate levels of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, which result in functional impairment in 1 or more areas of academic, social, and emotional function. In addition to the propensity for children to have some compromise of academic and emotional function, children with ADHD also have a higher frequency of co-occurring learning, cognitive, language, motor, and mental health disorders. Similarly, children with developmental disorders have a higher risk of co-occurring ADHD. The diagnosis of ADHD can be ascertained by a review of the risks for the condition, consideration of masquerading conditions, a careful history and physical examination, and the recognition of co-occurring disorders. The signs and symptoms of co-occurring disorders and the management of ADHD differ across early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence. Management is largely limited to behavioral and pharmacologic interventions, and it favors behavioral strategies in early childhood, pharmacologic and behavioral strategies in middle childhood, and pharmacologic interventions in adolescence. This article offers an approach to the evaluation, presentation, and management of ADHD with a focus on guiding primary care pediatricians.",

      "title": "Functional Weakness and Sensory Loss",
      "abstract": "Functional weakness and sensory loss are common clinical problems with variable presentations. Functional weakness commonly presents as weakness of an entire limb, paraparesis, or hemiparesis, with observable or demonstrable inconsistencies and nonanatomic accompaniments. Documentation of limb movements during sleep, the arm drop test, the Babinski thigh-trunk test, Hoover tests, the Sonoo abductor test, and various dynamometer tests can provide useful bedside diagnostic information on functional weakness. Functional sensory loss typically affects all sensory modalities, either in a hemisensory distribution or affecting an entire limb. Although often inconsistent over serial examinations with nonanatomic features, many clinical findings reported to be helpful in diagnosing functional sensory loss are neither sensitive nor specific for functional sensory loss. The yes-no test, Bowlus-Currier test, and forced-choice tests can provide useful bedside diagnostic information on functional sensory loss. Clinicians must be prepared to make more than one diagnosis in some cases, including an organic neurological diagnosis and a diagnosis of functional overlay. Recent studies have reported relatively low rates (<5%) of misdiagnosis of functional weakness or sensory loss as indicated by subsequent diagnosis of neurological or psychiatric conditions that explained the presenting symptoms. Most neurologists find such patients more difficult to help than patients with organic disease. Management focuses on supportive psychotherapy and behavioral management, exploration of social and psychological issues, treatment of comorbid depression or anxiety, and facilitation of development of more appropriate and constructive coping methods. Many patients with functional weakness, and to a somewhat lesser extent functional sensory loss, have persisting or relapsing-remitting somatic symptoms and persistently impaired social/interpersonal, occupational, and psychological functioning.",

Although tic symptoms have been reported since antiquity, systematic study of individuals with tic disorders dates from the nineteenth century. In addition to tics, individuals with tic disorders may present with a broad array of behavioral difficulties including disinhibited speech or conduct, impulsivity, distractibility, motoric hyperactivity, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (Leckman and Cohen, 1998). Alternatively, a sizable portion of children and adolescents with tics will be free of coexisting developmental or emotional difficulties.

There are several reasons for carrying out a neuropsychological assessment of an individual who has sustained a severe head injury. Physical impairments which in themselves are not of major importance may in combination with cognitive impairments lead to the patient's job prospects being very much curtailed. Whereas physical deficits are not the direct concern of psychologists, it should be borne in mind that they may have psychological effects. The mental state examination in neuropsychology is very similar to that used in psychiatry but much shorter. The characteristic picture is that abilities which are overlearned and well-practised, and which, presumably, involve a considerable element of redundancy, such as familiar verbal tasks, the use of language, capacity to define words, capacity to retrieve general knowledge. Assessing the head-injured requires observational, interviewing, and formal testing skills.",

One of the direct consequences is poorer quality sleep. It has also been proven that sleep-related symptoms correspond to significant changes in the respiratory center, airway resistance, and muscle contractility. The main sleep disorder that these patients may present is Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS), which is characterized by repetitive airway obstruction during sleep with complete or partial cessation of airflow. This alteration can have effects on the circadian rhythm of the sleep-wake cycle, such as a desynchronization of the light-dark cycle or endogenously desynchronized, resulting in: insomnia, fatigue, and poor performance in daily activities and symptoms such as insomnia or hypersomnia, common in patients with circadian sleep disorders, although there are other causes to which they can be attributed and that must be excluded before making the diagnosis of a circadian sleep disorder. In a patient without another sleep pathology, a daily record of activities, meals, exercise, naps, and bedtime is an essential tool to evaluate circadian sleep disorders.",

      "title": "Melatonin: helping to MEND impaired sleep",
      "abstract": "Many neurodevelopmental disorders adversely affect sleep; children often have difficulty in falling asleep, wake up more often during the night, and sleep less than their typically developing peers. ‘Sleep problems’ were found in 53% of over 300 children with autism, compared with 44% of 63 children with delayed development, and 32% of 163 children with normal (typical) development.1 Sleep problems arise from complex interactions between biological, psychological, social, family and cultural factors. Circadian sleep rhythm disorders (CSRD) may be acute but are more often chronic, and frequently result in associated health problems. CSRDs usually exacerbate any pre-existing learning and behavioural difficulties, and may affect the entire family's whole health and well-being and impair their ability to continue in employment or further education.\n\nThere is considerable pressure for both parents and paediatricians to try and improve a child's disturbed sleep. Management options include behavioural, or pharmacological, or both. Behavioural interventions are probably undervalued, but may be difficult to implement, and may take weeks or months to show any benefit. Conventional medications including hypnotics and sedatives are frequently associated with unacceptable day-time sedation that may adversely affect the child's quality of life. The past 20 years have witnessed the introduction of melatonin which continues to be increasingly prescribed to many children both with and without neurodevelopmental disorders and using a wide range of doses. To many, it is the ubiquitous safe solution to any ‘sleep problem’. The popularity of melatonin reflects the …",

The autistic children have hyperactivity, lack of communication' lack of cooperation, inappropriate patient/dentist interaction, so they require professionally recognized behavioral management technique during dental treatment such as behavior modification, phamacological agents, and general anesthesia. A behavior management technique can be chosen by factors such as the severity of autism and possible accompanying disabilities, degree of cooperation, oral and general conditions of children. A non-pharmacological behavior modification may be selected for the autistic children who are able to communicate with dentist with mild dental caries, without compromised medical history. In case of excessively hyperactive, destructive, antisocial, and/or severe communicative disorder, a sedation technic with chloral hydrate, hydroxyzine, midazolam or nitrous oxide gas might to be performed.

      "title": "Assessment of Executive Function for Schizophrenia in Hong Kong",
      "abstract": "Abstract Patients with schizophrenia have been found to exhibit a cluster of symptoms collectively known as dysexecutive syndrome. However, neuropsychological studies of dysexecutive syndrome and their corresponding assessments are inherently difficult. Published studies of dysexecutive syndrome have predominantly considered English-speaking populations and, almost invariably, western cultural groups. As a consequence, the majority of assessment measures and checklists are standardised in English. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the current issues in the assessment of executive functions for schizophrenia in clinical practice in Hong Kong. Key words: Hong Kong, Needs assessment, Schizophrenia Introduction Schizophrenia is associated with a wide range of cognitive impairments, including attention, memory, and executive functions, as well as a general decline in intellectual functioning. (1,2) In particular, patients with schizophrenia have been found to exhibit a cluster of symptoms collectively known as dysexecutive syndrome. (3) Dysexecutive syndrome may have a range of effects on activities of daily life, including the ability to work or attend school, function responsibly in the home, or have appropriate social relationships. (4-6) Green et al found that deficits in executive functions in patients with schizophrenia ultimately determine the functional outcomes in terms of poor community living skills, self-care activities, social problem-solving skills, and psychosocial skills. (7,8) Neuropsychological studies of dysexecutive syndrome and its rehabilitation face inherent difficulties. One of the main critiques is the assessment of executive functions. Executive functions are thought to comprise a series of abilities to achieve a goal. (9,10) Therefore, failure to accomplish executive function tests may be due to several reasons because damage may occur to any component of the process following the onset of schizophrenia or a brain lesion. A further difficulty lies in the apparent fractionation of dysexecutive syndrome, (11,12) meaning that a patient's performance in 1 frontal lobe test may have little or no predictive value for how they may perform in another test, let alone in a complex real-world situation. To address this problem, there is an increasing emphasis on incorporating more complex multifaceted life-like challenges within performance measures; in other words tasks that will tap a number of executive domains at the same time. (13-15) However, behaviour in real-life must always remain the ultimate test for the clinician. Published studies of dysexecutive syndrome have predominantly considered English-speaking populations and, almost invariably, western cultural groups. As a consequence, the majority of assessment measures and checklists are standardised in English. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the issues relating to the assessment of executive functions in local clinical practice. In particular, the focus will be on the Supervisory Attentional System. (9,16) This theory assumes that the processes involved in the cognitive control of action and thought can be divided into 2 systems: contention scheduling and a supervisory attentional system. Contention scheduling is responsible for routine learned behaviour and performance of everyday tasks. Contention scheduling enables prioritisation of the order of simultaneously competing tasks or routine activities such as making a cup of coffee when a telephone rings. The supervisory attention system is responsible for regulating non-routine and novel tasks. There are 5 types of situations where routine automatic activation of behaviour would not be sufficient for optimal performance: situations involving planning or decision-making; situations involving error correction or troubleshooting; situations where responses are not well-learned or contain novel sequences of actions; dangerous or technically difficult situations; and situations that require a strong habitual response to be overcome or a temptation to be resisted. …",

      "title": "Cognitive Impairments in Parkinson’s Disease",
      "abstract": "The clinical neuropsychologic profiles of patients with Parkinson's disease and patients with SDAT show both overlap and dissociation. Speech, language, and certain memory skills are examples of dissociable differences, especially in the early stages of the disease. Furthermore the presence of depression, evidence of cognitive slowing, and absence of aphasia in patients with Parkinson's disease suggest prominent subcortical involvement. It is probably premature to categorize all of the cognitive changes in patients with Parkinson's disease as subcortical, however. Some skills, such as visuospatial and executive functions, are impaired in both disorders, and although the etiologic bases for task failure may differ for each, this issue remains open-ended. Another problem is that often the evidence for or against the cortical/subcortical distinction is insufficient and in some cases based on a single measure thought to be representative of a given cognitive domain. Most importantly there are few comparative studies that provide unequivocal support for making a cortical/subcortical distinction. Failure to equate for level of cognitive impairment or functional disability between dementias and strict adherence to cross-sectional study designs further compromise efforts to characterize each syndrome precisely. Whitehouse suggested that a prospective study of several different dementias studied in parallel, examining a wide range of cognitive skills, is required before the cortical/subcortical classification scheme can be validated. A critical component is an autopsy program to confirm diagnoses and provide clinicopathologic correlation. It is possible that the diverse nature of the cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease is not a methodologic artifact but reflects multiple disease subtypes. Ross, Mahler, and Cummings proposed three dementia syndromes in patients with Parkinson's disease: one that is relatively mild and meets the criteria for subcortical dementia, a second that is more severe and shows a wider range of cognitive impairment but is still neuropathologically distinct from SDAT, and a third severe dementia with both subcortical and cortical involvement that may reflect basal ganglia and Alzheimer-type pathology.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive disability linked to neurodegenerative diseases and in particular to Alzheimer's disease, remains an increasing cause for concern through a dramatic prevalence increment and associated socio-economic burdens. Initially Alzheimer's disease develops asymptomatically with primary clinical signs, such as memory impairment, decline of spatial and perceptual abilities, occurring at a later stage. This delay implies the possibility of promoting early interventions during the pre-symptomatic stage of the disease. Different strategies have been applied in order to prevent/delay onset of Alzheimer's disease or at least to improve quality of life and health conditions of Alzheimer's disease patients and their caregivers, especially in the absence of current viable therapies. Multidomain interventions, aimed at affecting several risk factors simultaneously, offer a versatility that may attain improved outcomes in comparison with single-domain prevention trials. These multidomain interventions involve diet, physical exercise, cognitive training and social activities, while music therapy, improving self-consciousness and reducing neurofibrils, may contribute to deceleration/delay onset of Alzheimer's disease progression. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) provides broad applications to improve quality of life and well-being of Alzheimer's disease patients and caregivers, suffering from psychological distress, as well as reducing additional public health costs.",

      "abstract": "Progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) is one of the 3 clinical presentations of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), the other 2 being frontotemporal dementia and semantic dementia (SD). PNFA and SD, both representing relentlessly progressive language impairment in the realm of FTLD, may share a large part with primary progressive aphasia (PPA). A salient distinction between PPA and PNFA or SD is that PPA includes another clinical type, namely, logopenic/phonemic aphasia (LPA), which is not represented in FTLD. This is primarily because LPA is usually caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the brunt of the lesion is localized at the left temporo-parietal region of the brain. Further, PNFA/SD should be limited to the clinical consequencies of FTLD while PPA is more generous with regard to its causal pathology. By definition, PNFA is an expressive language impairment which is characterized by effortful speech, phonemic errors, grammatical impairment, and word-finding difficulties. Reading and writing may be comparatively impaired. Comprehension of single word meaning is normal, while comprehension of sentencies may sometimes be impaired. PNFA should be differentiated from SD, LPA, and pure progressive apraxia of speech (AOS or alternatively referred to as aphemia or anarthria). SD may be distinguished from PNFA by virtue of its fluency, characteristic loss of word meaning and absence of agrammatism. LPA is similar to PNFA, yet differs in that there is preservation of grammatical skills and speech motor function that is devoid of AOS and/or dysarthria. AOS is an impairment at the level of speech motor programming without language impairment. Thus, there may be a double dissociation between AOS and PNFA i. e., PNFA may or may not accompany AOS and vice versa. PNFA is associated with a localized lesion in the left frontotemporal area of the brain. Immunohistochemical investigations have revealed that ubiquitin/TAR DNA binding protein-43 (TDA-43) positive and tau negative pathology, mostly FTLD with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U) type 3, accounts for 90% of PNFA cases, while the remaining 10% may be caused by tauopathy. Therapeutic attempts for PNFA are currently unsuccessful.",

The impairments which are commonly associated with ASD manifest during early development as delayed speech or impaired social skills, for example. These early indicators are often noticed by parents who convey concern to medical professionals. Research has found associations between these early parental concerns and a later diagnosis of autism, noting their predictive validity. Research has yet to address the relationship between types of parental concerns and developmental functioning. This study examined whether certain parent reported concerns are more predictive of impaired developmental functioning assessed by a standardized measure in toddlers with ASD or developmental delay (DD). The DD group was found to have significantly higher frequencies of parent-reported language concerns, while the ASD group had significantly higher frequencies of general developmental concerns, multiple concerns, and other concerns. Individuals with ASD had significantly greater developmental impairment than the DD group across first concern types. For the ASD group, greatest developmental impairment was found for those with general developmental concerns, followed by motor, multiple, other, sensory, communication, and language concerns. For the DD group, greatest developmental impairment was found for those with general developmental concerns, followed by multiple, motor, other, language, communication, and sensory concerns.",

      "abstract": "Cerebellar mutism syndrome (CMS) or posterior fossa syndrome (PFS) consists of a constellation of neuropsychiatric, neuropsychological and neurogenic speech and language deficits. It is most commonly observed in children after posterior fossa tumor surgery. The most prominent feature of CMS is mutism, which generally starts after a few days after the operation, has a limited duration and is typically followed by motor speech deficits. However, the core speech disorder subserving CMS is still unclear.This study investigates the speech and language symptoms following posterior fossa medulloblastoma surgery in a 12-year-old right-handed boy. An extensive battery of formal speech (DIAS = Diagnostic Instrument Apraxia of Speech) and language tests were administered during a follow-up of 6 weeks after surgery. Although the neurological and neuropsychological (affective, cognitive) symptoms of this patient are consistent with Schmahmann's syndrome, the speech and language symptoms were markedly different from what is typically described in the literature. In-depth analyses of speech production revealed features consistent with a diagnosis of apraxia of speech (AoS) while ataxic dysarthria was completely absent. In addition, language assessments showed genuine aphasic deficits as reflected by distorted language production and perception, wordfinding difficulties, grammatical disturbances and verbal fluency deficits.To the best of our knowledge this case might be the first example that clearly demonstrates that a higher level motor planning disorder (apraxia) may be the origin of disrupted speech in CMS. In addition, identification of non-motor linguistic disturbances during follow-up add to the view that the cerebellum not only plays a crucial role in the planning and execution of speech but also in linguistic processing. Whether the cerebellum has a direct or indirect role in motor speech planning needs to be further investigated.",

Social factors have a certain influence on the outcome of autistic disorder, but prognostically significant variables should be looked for in individual characteristics of every person with autism individually.

      "abstract": "Introduction When mental retardation is suspected early during a child's life, it is the pediatrician who is usually confronted with the problems of diagnosis and the difficulties of parental counseling. Pediatricians are also assuming increasing responsibilities in community programs for retarded children. It is, therefore, timely to review current concepts in this field. In sequence, we will discuss definition and epidemiology, diagnosis, somatic problems, behavior and intelligence, management, community resources, family crises, and implications for prevention. Throughout we will focus attention on the practical, clinical issues. Definition and Epidemiology Mental retardation is a syndrome which can have a number of causes, producing a variety of symptoms and degrees of impairment. The most commonly used definition describes it as sub-average general intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period and is associated with impairment in adaptive behavior.1Impaired intelligence, delayed maturation, slowness in learning, and failure in social adjustment are",

      "abstract": "Presbylarynx refers to age-related structural changes of the vocal folds that include muscle atrophy, reduced neuromuscular control, loss of superficial lamina propria layer, and reduced pliability. The changes result in thin and bowed vocal folds, increased vocal effort requirements, breathy voice, change in habitual pitch, and strain. The primary treatment options are voice therapy focused on strengthening breath support and the intrinsic muscles of the larynx, and optimization of resonance; injection augmentation of the vocal folds; and type I thyroplasty. Functional dysphonia is defined as change in voice quality in the absence of structural or neurological abnormalities of the larynx. Muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) is a subtype of functional voice disorders and involves laryngeal muscle tension imbalance due to excessive or dysregulated activation resulting often in strained or breathy voice. MTD can be divided into primary (psychological etiology or vocal misuse) and secondary (compensatory for organic laryngeal pathology). The mainstay of treatment for MTD is voice therapy, along with medical or surgical treatment of the underlying vocal pathology in secondary MTD. Mutational falsetto, or puberphonia, is a functional voice disorder where a high-pitched, pre-adolescent voice fails to transition to the lower pitch of adulthood.

      "abstract": "Autism is characterised by severe and pervasive impairments in several important areas of development: reciprocal social interaction and communication as well as behaviour, and imagination. In order to be diagnosed with autism, the behavioural symptoms in all of the above-named areas must be present by age 3. Even if the parents often notice that something is wrong during infancy, it is very difficult to diagnose autism before the age of eighteen months. This is because the behavioural symptoms used to establish the diagnosis have not clearly emerged developmentally until that age. The majority of children with autism also have a learning disability (mental retardation), although a few have average intelligence. Many also have epilepsy, and visual and hearing impairment are over-represented in this group. Persons with Asperger’s syndrome, which is a condition resembling autism, have average or above average intelligence. Roughly estimated, 1 - 2 children per thousand have autism, which means that about one hundred children are born with autism every year in Sweden. Autism and the other pervasive developmental disorders (autistic-like conditions), or in other words the entire autism spectrum, adds up to at least 6 children in every thousand in Sweden. The same figures are seen in other nations worldwide. Many more boys than girls have autism.",

      "abstract": "Feeding and eating disorders (FEDs) are serious mental health disorders that cause impairments in physical health, development, cognition and psychosocial function and can go undetected for months or years. They are characterised by disturbed eating behaviour associated with concerns about weight and shape or by disinterest in food, phobic avoidance or avoidance due to sensory aspects of food. Restrictive forms of FEDs lead to significant weight loss requiring intervention. Without specific knowledge of these conditions, they can evade detection, delaying time to diagnosis and treatment and potentially influencing outcome. This review article focuses on the key factors involved in the psychiatric assessment and treatment of four feeding or eating disorders (EDs): anorexia nervosa, avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder, bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. They have been chosen for discussion as they are most likely to be encountered in both a psychiatric and paediatric setting. It emphasises the importance of a family-focused, developmentally appropriate and multidisciplinary approach to care. It does not address aspects of medical assessment and treatment. Other feeding or EDs not included in this article are pica, rumination disorder, other specified feeding and eating disorder and unspecified feeding and eating disorder.",

Hearing and intelligence may be normal although both are difficult to evaluate. Abnormal behavior may appear in these children simply because they lack normal opportunities to express themselves. It is pointed out that many of the children of 4 to 5 years of age with delayed speech development may not simply be deviates from the norm but may actually suffer from mild degrees of aphasia. Earlier recognition and proper guidance for milder types of aphasia will depend ultimately on better definition of the pattern and rate of normal speech development. At present, there apparently is little or no agreement either as to frequency or actuality of this syndrome in childhood. Unfortunately, mild cases are apt to be passed over and more severe ones are often tragically mislabeled as mental defectives.",

However, little is known about the factors that are associated with these cognitive biases. Recently, researchers have begun to consider whether neurocognitive deficits, common in schizophrenia, may be risk factors for the development of cognitive biases. In the present study, we assessed neurocognition (verbal learning, delayed verbal recall memory, and verbal recognition memory) and cognitive biases (knowledge corruption and impaired cognitive insight) in 72 individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. As hypothesized, poorer delayed verbal recall memory was associated with increased knowledge corruption. Contrary to expectations, verbal learning and verbal memory were not associated with cognitive insight. These findings suggest that an inadequate recall memory system may put patients with schizophrenia at greater risk for cognitive distortions.",

Physical frailty is a complex condition deriving from multiple causes and contributors. It is characterized by the decline of physiological systems, leading to a loss of strength and endurance, and reduced physical ability. Frailty presents an increased risk of vulnerability to disease, dependency and/or death. Frail individuals are also prone to falls and are at greater risk of hospitalization and admission to long-term care. Consequently, there is a need for an effective tool or tools that can easily identify frail community-living individuals at an early stage of physical decline. Screening tools can be performance-based tests, questionnaires or a combination of both. The aim of the present narrative literature review is to describe the existing simple performance-based frailty screening tools.",

Cognitive function can be affected by several factors including attention, emotion, and sleep. In restless legs syndrome (RLS), cognitive dysfunction may ensue due to sleep disturbance, emotional disorders, and attention deficit which are common in RLS. However, it remains unclear whether cognitive performance is decreased in patients with RLS. To date, there are ten published articles which studied cognition in RLS. Five studies reported cognitive dysfunction of RLS, particularly decreased performance in the attention, frontal executive function, and mental flexibility function. Three reported no significant differences in cognitive performance between RLS patients and control subjects. Two studies reported even better performance in patients with RLS compared with control subjects. Dopamine agonist may improve cognitive performance in RLS. However, it remains unclear whether this is direct effect on RLS symptoms or indirect effect including improved sleep duration, daytime sleepiness and depression, or both. Event-related potential studies demonstrated reduced P300 amplitude either oddball task or Sternberg working memory task. Larger sample and studies using functional neuroimaging study are needed to confirm whether cognition is impaired or not in RLS.

      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), while nearly universal in AD, tend to occur in phenotypic clusters, which may reflect distinct pathophysiologies arising from specific underlying brain damage. Therefore, treatments targeting their specific cause(s) are required. For example, symptom clusters (“syndromes”) characterized as affective, psychotic, agitated, apathetic, or reflecting sleep-wake cycle disorders have been proposed. Individual symptoms may co-occur in more than one syndrome at a given time, and these relationships may differ across the MCI to severe AD spectrum. Adding to the complexity, many NPS are thought to be the short-term result of environmental provocations (reactive psychological states and behaviors) which partly arise from non-specific effects of brain damage. For example, striking out during caregiving, acute nocturnal confusion, and excessively loud vocalization when confronted by cognitive limitations might be understood as the result of unsophisticated caregiving, acute delirium, or catastrophic reaction. The above issues have hampered the NPS field's ability to agree on how to evaluate, differentiate, and treat NPS. Gaining consensus on a common algorithmic approach to evaluation, differentiation, and how and when to initiate non-pharmacologic psychosocial treatments, would lay solid foundation for tackling NPS in the clinical world, and inform research in developing new therapies. We present an Expert Consensus Panel's proposed unified algorithm for the assessment, differentiation, and treatment of NPS in AD. Three talks are envisioned, followed by a panel discussion. The first talk uses epidemiologic findings from several international studies to define the challenge posed by NPS overlap, varying etiologies, and differences by AD stage, and lays the conceptual background for the proposed algorithm. The second talk expands the Four “D's” systematic approach to evaluation and differentiation (Rabins, Lyketsos, and Steele, 1999) that allows clinicians and researchers to develop patient specific interventions. The final talk presents evidence supporting the use of psychosocial interventions for NPS linked to the outcomes of the “4D” method, and discusses both specific and non-specific psychosocial approaches to the management of individual NPS syndromes. The latter assumes that such well articulated psychosocial approaches must be used prior to medication treatments. The panel concludes with speaker and audience discussion moderated by the panel chair.",

In this review we will discuss in particular form of ASD and altered sensory sensitivity. The role of NGF in causing pronociceptive activity and its role in peripheral sensitisation is discussed under the light of its involvement in forms of MR where loss of pain perception is a main feature due to mutations to NGF receptors or NGF genes during development.

Meanwhile, constipation, including symptoms of evacuation difficulty and/or fewer bowel movements, is a common problem as people age. Risk factors include problems in cognition, mobility, gastrointestinal motility, dysautonomia, anorectal dysfunction, and disabling neurologic disorders. Faecal incontinence is more common in frail individuals but is often assessed inadequately. The cause is often multifactorial. Treatment depends on the cause: a combination of approaches may be necessary, including avoidance of faecal impaction, instigation of a structured bowel care plan including regular prompted toileting, dietary modification, and (in some cases) use of loperamide or similar medications.",

      "title": "The effectiveness of preferred or familiar music listening on behavioural and psychological symptoms of institutionalised older adults with dementia: a systematic review",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective Is preferred or familiar music listening effective in reducing behavioural and psychological symptoms of institutionalised older adults with all types of dementia? For institutionalised older adults with all types of dementia what is the evidence about the: Frequency of use of preferred or familiar music listening; Length of preferred or familiar music listening per session. Background Dementia is a severe public health problem affecting over 35 million people worldwide1. Dementia is a syndrome of cognitive deterioration which may result in changes in personality and interfere with activities of daily living and social functions2. According to the Progressively Lowered Stress Threshold model (PLST), older adults with cognitive impairment caused by wide range of psychological reactions, psychiatric symptoms, and behaviors which may be disruptive, unsafe and impair the care of patients with dementia in a given environment4. Specific symptoms may include apathy, agitation, aggression, depression, anxiety, wandering, psychotic symptoms and others5. Of those diagnosed with dementia, more than two-thirds experience BPSD6. BPSD may cause significant impairment of social or occupational functioning in those with dementia2 and place tremendous burden on family caregivers and nursing staff in the care of those with dementia as well as a strain on health care resources7. BPSD in older people with dementia are typically managed with the use of psychotropic medications, but these treatments present risks for adverse effects8. Use of psychotropic medications in those with dementia has to be cautious due to the unwanted side effects9, and a further study concludes that the adverse effects of antipsychotics, including an increased risk of stroke and death, offset its potential advantages10. Given the concerns associated with the use of antipsychotic medications for BPSD, a wide range of non-pharmacological strategies have been suggested to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms. One approach is modifying environmental factors that place too much demand or pressures on the individual and this has been suggested as one of the most effective interventions in reducing behavioural problems of those with dementia in residential care facilities11. Introducing a sense of familiarity into a new environment or maximising familiarity in an existing environment can enhance the functional abilities of those with dementia12, 13. Using aspects of prior familiar environments can modify unpleasant and external stimuli in the environment and prevent anxiety in those with dementia14. One other non-pharmacological care approach which has been frequently suggested to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms is use of music15. Music has been shown to positively influence a broad range of outcomes including alleviating anxiety, promoting relaxation, improving mood, reducing pain, decreasing agitation, improving exercise performance, and increasing food intake among various populations16. Listening to preferred music in particular has been suggested to effectively manage agitated behaviours of older adults with dementia15, 17-19. Familiar music from the past can assist in memory recall and elicit memories associated with positive feelings15. Researchers indicate that the areas of the brain that respond to music are the last to deteriorate in dementia and suggested that music may be one form of communication that remains preserved in people with dementia who respond to music20. Older people are usually fond of music that was popular during their youth21. Music from religious services, patriotic ceremonies or cultural events would have specific meaning to the person's life15. Music that elicits positive memories from the past can have a soothing effect, and these positive feelings, in turn, will prevent or reduce agitation in people who are aged 65 or above with dementia15, 21. Listening to familiar or preferred music can enhance the sense of familiarity into a new environment or maximise familiarity in an existing environment for those with dementia to stimulate their memories associated with pleasant feelings and thereby induce relaxation22 and reduce anxiety23 and enhance their functional abilities12, 13. music is proposed to be accessible, relatively inexpensive, and easy to use with those with dementia28, 29. Several reviews have focused on the use of music for older people with dementia and found beneficial effects on their behaviours and social interaction30-34. Some reviews on music and dementia research included different types of music activities and various outcomes. For example, Vink et al33 reviewed randomised controlled trials related to effects of music therapy on behavioural problems, social, cognition, and emotion, and concluded that there is no substantial evidence to support nor discourage the use of music therapy in the care of older people with dementia. In Sheratt et al's review34, they included different types of music therapy, such as group music activities or individual or group listening to all types of music, and concluded that music have the potential to reduce problematic behaviours and provide engagement in meaningful activity. However, these reviews limited the generalisability of findings as they failed to differentiate which type of music activities worked for which outcomes in older adults with dementia. Sung and Chang29 conducted a review of eight studies which specifically focused on preferred music on agitated behaviours of older adults with dementia and reported that the evidence was inconclusive due to small sample sizes and variations in the application of the preferred music intervention across the studies. In addition, previous reviews only included studies written in English and published in English journals, and did not include studies which were published in other languages. This review will focus on studies determining the effects of preferred or familiar music listening or comparisons of preferred or familiar music listening with other types of interventions for managing behavioural and psychological symptoms in older adults with dementia, and will include published studies written in English or Chinese. This review will be a joint review conducted by the Queensland Centre for Evidence Based Nursing & Midwifery and the Taiwanese Centre for Evidence-based Health Care. One reviewer from each centre, who is competent in reading, writing, and speaking both in English and Chinese, will conduct the searching, relevance checking and quality appraisal of the studies written in English or Chinese. Inclusion criteria Types of participants This review will consider studies that include adults aged 65 or older and diagnosed with all types of dementia who exhibit behavioural or psychological symptoms living in long-term care institutions. Behavioural or psychological symptoms to be included: agitation; aggressive behaviours; aggression, disruptive behaviours, anxiety; depression. Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest This review will consider studies that evaluated preferred or familiar music listening interventions for the prevention or reduction of behavioural or psychological symptoms of older adults with dementia. This review will consider studies that include the following outcome measures: behavioral and psychological symptoms, agitation, agitated behaviours, aggressive behaviours, aggression, disruptive behaviours, anxiety, or depression. Types of studies This review will consider any randomised controlled trials (RCT); In the absence of RCT's, other research designs such as non-randomized controlled trials and before and after studies will be considered for inclusion. In addition to excluding studies that were not reported in English or Chinese, this review will exclude studies with patients receiving music listening without considering music preferences and familiarity. Observational, cohort, case-control, and qualitative studies will be excluded. Search strategy The search strategy aims to find published studies in peer review journals written in English and Chinese from 1990-2010. A three-step search strategy will be utilized in each component of this review. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL will be undertaken followed by analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe article. A second search using all identified keywords and index terms will then be undertaken across all included databases. Thirdly, the reference list of all identified reports and articles will be searched for additional studies. Additional hand search in music journals will also be conducted. The databases to be searched include:PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsyInfo, PsychArticles, Cochrane Library, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, Music Index (via EBSCOhost) as well as Chinese publication databases. The Chinese databases will include: (1) http://www.ceps.com.tw (2) http://www.cetd.com.tw (3) http://www.ncl.edu.tw/journal/journal_docu01.htm Initial keywords to be used will be‘preferred music’, ‘individualized music’, ‘familiar music’, ‘behavioural and psychological symptoms’, ‘agitated behaviours’, ‘agress*’, ‘agitat*’, ‘anxiety’, ‘depress*’, ‘dementia’, ‘Alzheimer's disease’, ‘preferred music and dementia’, ‘preferred music and Alzheimer's disease’, ‘familiar music and dementia’ and ‘familiar music and Alzheimer's disease’. Assessment of methodological quality Quantitative papers selected for retrieval will be assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardised critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) (Appendix I). Any disagreements that arise between the reviewers will be resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. the review question and specific objectives. Data synthesis Quantitative results will, where possible be pooled in statistical meta-analysis using the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI). All results will be subject to double data entry. Odds ratio (for categorical data) and weighted mean differences (for continuous data) and their 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for analysis. Heterogeneity will be assessed using the standard Chi-square. Where statistical pooling is not possible the findings will be presented in narrative form. None",

      "abstract": "Autism is now a very common condition, and some degree of autism symptoms frequently are found in individuals who have ADHD. Sometimes, these symptoms can be masked by more overt ADHD symptoms, and not recognized. Therefore to understand the spectrum of conditions associated with ADHD, it is necessary to have an understanding of autism. When individuals with ADHD are not responding as expected to usually effective treatments, especially with additional symptoms such as oppositional and aggressive behaviors, argumentative or social skills difficulties, unrecognized co-occurring autism should be considered. The autism spectrum is very broad, and individuals with autism may present with severe speech delay, intellectual disability, behavioral meltdowns and social isolation when toddlers, or may have milder learning and speech difficulties with sensory and social skills difficulties recognized in grade school, or may be very high functioning with exceptional skills in areas of interest, but struggling with subtler social skills deficits and interactions. Anxiety is almost universal in those with autism. Treatment is usually multimodal, involving potentially speech therapy with social skills training, occupational therapy, psychotherapy, medication directed at specific conditions or symptoms, and sometimes more intensive ABA therapy.",

      "title": "Psychological Responses to Scarcity",
      "abstract": "Scarcity is the condition of having insufficient resources to cope with demands. This condition presents significant challenges to the human cognitive system. For example, having limited financial resources requires the meticulous calculation of expenses with respect to a budget. Likewise, having limited time requires the stringent management of schedules with respect to a deadline. As such, scarcity consumes cognitive resources such as attention, working memory, and executive control and elicits a range of systematic and even counter-productive cognitive and behavioral responses as a result. Specifically, scarcity induces an attentional focus on the problem at hand, which facilitates performance by enhancing cognitive processing of information relevant to the problem, increasing the efficiency of resource use, and stabilizing the perception of value. Such prioritization of the problem at hand may seem advantageous, but it can produce undesirable consequences. For example, scarcity causes myopic and impulsive behavior, prioritizing short-term gains over long-term gains. Ironically, scarcity can also result in a failure to notice beneficial information in the environment that alleviates the condition of scarcity. More detrimentally, scarcity directly impairs cognitive function, which can lead to suboptimal decisions and choices that exacerbate the condition of scarcity. Thus, scarcity means not only a shortage of physical resources (e.g., money or time) but also a deficit of cognitive resources (e.g., attention, executive control). The cognitive deficits under scarcity are particularly problematic because they impair performance and lead to counter-productive behaviors that deepen the cycle of scarcity. In addition, people under financial scarcity suffer from stigmas and stereotypes associated with poverty. These social perceptions of poverty further burden the mind by consuming cognitive resources, weakening performance in the poor. Understanding the cognitive and behavioral responses to scarcity provides new insights into why the poor remain poor, identifying the psychological causes of scarcity, and illuminating potential interventions to stop the cycle of scarcity. These insights have important implications for the design and the implementation of policies and services targeting the populations under scarcity.",

Furthermore, several longitudinal studies have demonstrated that untreated insomnia predicts the onset of mental health disorders. Other sleep disorders also often cause mood and/or anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, overlapping symptoms of sleep apnea, a sleep disorder with undoubted public health significance, and depression merits special attention. Sleep disorders have profound effect on daytime functioning causing daytime sleepiness, tiredness, fatigue and impaired cognitive functioning. These symptoms may severely affect both the quality of life of the patient and also the sleep and quality of life of their bedpartners and family members, as well. It is increasingly appreciated that the majority of medically ill patients suffer from sleep disorders and sleep complaints, which contribute to their impaired quality of life and clinical outcomes. “Sleep Health” is an important aspect of everyone's life but has a special relevance in mentally or medically ill patients. In our studies focusing on patients with various stages of chronic kidney disease (moderate to severe chronic renal failure, patients on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients) we have found high prevalence of sleep disorders (insomnia, Restless Legs Syndrome, Periodic Leg Movements in Sleep, Sleep apnea). We have shown that they are associated with the presence of depressive symptoms, increased illness intrusiveness and worse quality of life. Furthermore, RLS predicted mortality of kidney transplant recipients.

      "title": "Clinical practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders in children and adolescents",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Dissociative or conversion disorders (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision [ICD-10]; hereafter referred to as dissociative disorders) are characterized by disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, sensations, and control of body movements. The symptoms of this disorder are not due to substance use and are not limited to pain or sexual symptoms, and the gain is primarily psychological and not monetary or legal. In these disorders, it is presumed that the ability to exercise a conscious and selective control over the symptoms is impaired, to a degree that can vary from day to day or even from hour to hour. However, it must be added that it is usually very difficult to assess the extent to which some of the loss of function might be under voluntary control. The diagnosis is made by the presence of specific clinical features, no evidence of a physical disorder that might explain the symptoms, and evidence for psychological causation in the form of clear association in time with stressful life events and problems or disturbed interpersonal relationships. Dissociative disorder can be of different types, as shown in Table 1.Table 1: International Classification of Disease-10 category of dissociative 10 categories of dissociative (conversion) disordersThese guidelines are an update to previous IPS guidelines on dissociative disorders (2008) in child or adolescent (hereafter child unless specified). These are broad guidelines which will help in systematic assessment and management of a child with dissociative disorder. ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS The assessment of dissociative disorders involves a detailed psychiatric and developmental history. An assessment should be made of the child's temperament, schooling, and peer relationships. The family functioning should be explored. A comprehensive medical, neurological, and mental status examination should be done. An assessment of psychosocial circumstances and problems should be done, especially to find which ones are temporally associated with the onset of dissociative symptoms. One should obtain psychiatric history from all the possible sources including the teachers, if possible. Furthermore, assessment should be made of the perception of the child and parents about the dissociative symptoms. An attempt should be made regarding the presence of physical and psychological symptoms in the other family members or the neighbors which may act as a model. The key points in the assessment of pediatric dissociative disorders are shown in Table 2.Table 2: Key points in the assessmentRULING-OUT PHYSICAL AND OTHER PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS As mentioned above, an initial comprehensive medical and neurological assessment is crucial in any child where a possibility of a dissociative disorder is being kept. In this regard, the treating psychiatrist should always consider seeking appropriate consultations. Relevant physical and psychological investigations must be done [Table 3]. An assessment of educational achievement of the child with regard to the child's potential and the level of education provided should be done, which is often indicated. The possibility of dissociative symptoms superimposed on neurological or medical disorders or other psychiatric disorders should always be carefully considered.Table 3: Investigations for ruling out physical or psychiatric disordersIf dissociative symptoms appear for the first time in a preschool child, a strong suspicion of an underlying physical or psychiatric disorder should be kept in mind because dissociative disorders are very rare in this age group. DIAGNOSIS OF DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER SHOULD NOT BE MERELY BASED ON THE ABSENCE OF OBJECTIVE SIGNS OF PHYSICAL DISORDER Although it is very important to exclude an underlying or associated physical disorder, as well as other primary psychiatric disorders that may explain the dissociative symptoms, the diagnosis of dissociative disorder should not be based merely on the absence of objective signs of a physical or psychiatric disorder. It is imperative to remember that the absence of physical findings applies universally to an earliest stage in the development of all diseases. Moreover, physical findings that appear nonrelevant at first may assume significance later. The diagnosis of dissociative disorder is not just of exclusion. The clinician should always keep in mind the overall biopsychosocial context of the child and the symptoms. When the diagnosis of a dissociative disorder is made with too much certainty without proper assessment, other physical or psychiatric disorders are often missed. When the diagnosis is too tentative, multiple and irrational medical evaluations may be conducted, and iatrogenic reinforcement of the symptoms and harm is possible. Pseudoseizures or nonepileptic seizures are a common presentation of dissociative disorders in children which must be differentiated from true epileptic seizures [Table 4].Table 4: Differences between dissociative convulsion and epileptic seizurePSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS OR STRESSORS Psychological distress overt or covert is an essential causative factor for dissociative disorders. A list of common stressors in pediatric dissociation is shown in Table 5. Stressors are not mutually exclusive.Table 5: Psychosocial factorsAttempts should be made to systematically identify the child's psychosocial environment, stressors, and coping abilities to handle stressful life situations. An attempt should also be made to find the secondary gains due to dissociative disorder. A view that stressors are \"unconscious\" creates a barrier in the physician's mind about looking for stressors. Studies in children with dissociative disorders have shown that stressors are generally present in day-to-day life of the patients and are known both to the patient and the family members. However, they may not reveal them for certain reasons. It is important for the clinician to evaluate the child for the stressors from a developmental perspective. It may not be possible to find stressor in the initial interviews. By repeated, careful and sensitive interviewing stressors can be elicited. Stressors in children and adolescents may include day-to-day problems such as difficulty in school or in family relationships, fights with other children, scolding and punishment by the teachers or family members, some frightening experiences, and educational difficulties. The child may find oneself in some kind of unwanted or disliked situation such as marriage, job or studies, bullying, and sometimes abuse and neglect. The stressor could also be an unaddressed physical illness or deformity. Assessing in detail about the onset of symptoms may give clue to the possible stressor, for example, becoming unconscious at school in English period. At times, stressors may not be severe enough to be noticed by the family members of the patient. Moreover, the family members may not be able to correlate the stressor with the onset of dissociative symptoms. In such cases, stressors should be assessed systematically, and the severity and temporal correlation of stressors with the onset of symptoms should be clearly delineated. One may use multiaxial ICD-10 Axis V for systematic assessment of stressors in children. The ICD-10 specifies that there should be convincing associations in time between the onset of symptoms of the disorder and \"stressful (life) events, problems, or needs.\" However, Indian studies point out that stressors are found in only 62%–82% of cases of dissociative disorder. Unless all the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of dissociative disorder including temporally related psychosocial stressors are met, a confident diagnosis should not be made. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND COMORBIDITIES Dissociative symptoms could be the presenting symptoms of underlying undetected psychiatric disorders such as separation anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, school phobia, depression, and at times, impending psychosis. Then, dissociative disorder may also have comorbid oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual disability, especially in boys. Therefore, it is important to screen for all age-appropriate psychiatric disorders in the child to avoid missing an underlying primary or a comorbid diagnosis. Dissociative disorders should be differentiated from factitious disorder and malingering. In latter two situations, the symptoms are intentionally produced to a assume sick role. The gain is psychological in factitious disorder. In factitious disorder by proxy, the parent (s) induce illness in the child for their own psychological gains. In malingering, the symptoms are feigned to obtain an incentive like money or some other material gain or to avoid a disliked responsibility or punishment. Apparent fabrication of symptoms or gross inconsistencies in history should raise possibility of malingering or factitious disorder. FALSE-POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS Rates of misdiagnosis are around 4%. False-positive diagnosis is likely if importance is given only to the symptoms and not to the underlying physical or psychiatric morbidity and psychosocial circumstances. One must assess the case with open mind. One should review the past medical records carefully, and if required, further assessments should be done. Some of the diagnostic difficulties are mentioned in Table 6.Table 6: Physical differential diagnosisIt is also likely that these false-positive diagnoses are made more often in females, psychiatrically disordered children, patients presenting plausible psychogenic explanations for their illnesses, and patients with unusual movement disorders or epilepsy. POSITIVE SIGNS Various \"positive signs\" of dissociative disorders have been described in the literature such as tunnel vision, discrete anesthetic patches, astasia-abasia, positive Hoover's test, preserved cough in hysterical aphonia, and hemianesthesia sharply separated at the midline. These signs indicate normally preserved physiological functions underlying the superficial appearance of incapacity. In addition to the above \"positive signs,\" hysterofrenic areas (areas on body, which when pressed, abort the hysterical episode, usually convulsive in nature) and hysterogenic areas (areas on body, e.g., a hyperesthetic spot, which when pressed can induce a hysterical episode) have also been mentioned. It must be kept in mind that dissociative disorders can be easily misdiagnosed or overdiagnosed if these \"positive signs\" are taken to be pathognomonic of the disorder. Studies indicate that these positive signs can also be seen in neurological patients. Gould et al. looked for the positive signs of hysteria in 30 consecutive neurological admissions (25 of which had acute strokes in adults). These \"signs\" were la belle indifference, nonanatomic sensory loss, midline split of pain or vibratory sensations, changing boundaries for hypoalgesia, giveaway weakness, and history of hypochondriasis. All 30 patients showed at least one out of seven \"signs,\" most exhibited more than one \"signs,\" and one patient had all seven \"signs.\" TREATMENT It is imperative to treat dissociative disorders promptly to prevent habituation and future disability. The longer the symptoms remain, the more aggressive the treatment should be. The treatment usually consists of two parts: (a) early treatment directed toward symptom removal and (b) long-term treatment directed toward the resolution of stressors and prevention of further episodes. Dissociative disorders are seen very less internationally. Therefore, there are no practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders. The proposed treatment guidelines are based mainly on Indian work in this area. Table 7 gives the key points of treatment.Table 7: TreatmentPRINCIPLES OF ACUTE MANAGEMENT Rapport and therapeutic alliance The cornerstone of successful therapy is establishment of therapeutic rapport and alliance with the child. It is also very important to have good doctor–parent relationship because the parents have to become an ally in treatment of the child. Parental influences on the child are significant even in the hospital setup. Unless the parents understand the clinician's point of view, it may not be possible to alter their overprotective and overindulgent attitude and behavior toward the child. One should listen to the concerns of the family carefully and try to understand their perception of the child's symptoms. PSYCHOSOCIAL EXPLANATION OF DISSOCIATIVE SYMPTOMS First of all, the diagnostic assessment must be done in an impressive manner, and the parents should be involved in the assessment process. It would be useful to explain to them why a particular assessment is being done and what the results are expected to show. When the results of this diagnostic assessment are obtained, their significance should also be explained to the parents. After reliably ruling out physical or other psychiatric illness as the cause of dissociative symptoms, the child and the family should be strongly assured that there is nothing physically seriously wrong with the child and the symptoms are psychogenic and that the child will make a complete recovery [Table 8]. When physical or psychiatric disorders are ruled out and the possibility of the dissociative symptoms being psychogenic is put forward, it is usually very vehemently rejected by the parents. That there could be anything psychologically wrong with their \"severely ill\" child, their parenting or with their family functioning, is totally unacceptable to the parents. Any suggestion of this possibility is met with resentment, anger, and sometimes open hostility. Therefore, any confrontation about the nature of the symptoms should be avoided at all costs, and all the members of the treating team should adopt the same nonconfrontational, calm approach toward the disorder the child and family. When the treatment team's point of view is understood and accepted by the family, only then it would be possible for them to cooperate in psychosocial assessments.Table 8: Key points in psychoeducationADDRESSING THE PSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS Once the causes are known, then attempts should be made to solve the \"problem.\" The problem should be discussed with the child and the family. In case of adolescents, if the problem has been revealed to doctor or the ward staff in confidence, then consent of the adolescent should be taken to discuss it with the family. The physician should not force his opinion on the child or the family. Problems of family relationships should be discussed, and family should be told that the child is being adversely affected by the family problems and their resolution will improve the child. At times, family therapy may be required. It is also important to open up the channels of communication between the child and his family. Throughout the treatment, attention should be focused on the child and his functioning rather than on the symptoms. This helps in speedy recovery. In most of the patients, reassurance and suggestions of recovery coupled with attention to the patient's psychosocial needs lead to a rapid recovery [Table 9].Table 9: Behavioral management of childrenSYMPTOM SUBSTITUTION As the dissociative symptoms begin to subside, the child may sometimes manifest other new dissociative symptoms in their place. Occasionally, distress may be expressed by deliberate self-harm, demanding, and histrionic behavior or the child may develop depressive symptoms. In such a situation, consistent limit setting may be essential for continuation of psychological treatment. Regularity of follow-up visits is important so that the patient does not need to \"produce\" a symptom to visit the therapist. Finally, the physician should not feel pressurized to cure the child very quickly. He should retain his calm and be prepared to face the hostility and aggression of the family and coercion for not using medication and quickly improving the child. SECONDARY GAINS Reduction in secondary gains is not advisable very early in the treatment and without adequate explanations to the family because of three reasons.First, the physician himself may not be certain about the origin of the symptoms. Second, the family may perceive reduction in secondary gain as neglect of the child. Furthermore, initially, the family may not have full confidence in the physician and the hospital's ability to take total care of their child. Later on, the family should be offered adequate explanations regarding secondary gains. Reduction in secondary gains in a child should be coupled with an alternative, healthy, socially acceptable, and age-appropriate role or activities for the child in which he or she can be trained and rewarded for doing something positive. ABREACTION AND AVERSION THERAPY Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior has often been employed in resistant cases, for example, using liquor ammonia, aversive faradic stimulation, pressure over trochlear notch, tragus of ear or over the sternum, and closing the nose and mouth. Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior is not advised as it may harm the patient and has a pejorative connotation equivalent to punishment. It may provide only temporary benefits, if any. Abreaction is bringing to conscious awareness, thoughts, affects, and memories for the first time, with or without the use of drugs. This may be achieved by hypnosis, free association, or drugs. Abreaction may further foster dissociative states. Moreover, some patients treated with this technique may perceive the therapist as sanctioning the dissociative states; hence, it is not recommended. MEDICATION Medication may be used only for concomitant anxiety, depression, or behavioral problems and not for the dissociative symptoms. The family should be tactfully made to understand that medications are neither required nor approved for dissociative symptoms. Otherwise, the family may perceive that doctor is unable to diagnose the child's problem and treat it. The use of medication will unnecessary expose the child to the side effects. In addition, the family may not give enough attention to psychological treatment thinking that medication will cure the dissociative symptoms. However, at times, there are families who persistently demand medication despite repeated explanations. In such situations, one may consider using a placebo to retain the child in treatment and overcome resentment or hostility of the family. NEED FOR HOSPITALIZATION Hospitalization is required when there is doubt in the diagnosis, severe symptoms are present, the family is very distressed, or the symptoms are recalcitrant and resistant to outpatient treatment. DUAL DIAGNOSIS If the dissociative symptoms are present with the physical disorder, then the physical disorder should be treated first. When the physical disorder is stabilized, then the dissociative symptoms if still present should be managed as per the guidelines. TREATMENT OF CHRONIC DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER Chronic cases are more difficult to treat, and the management should always begin with a rational comprehensive evaluation and clear explanation to the child and the family about the findings. Psychoeducation of the family about the nature of the disorder and its course and outcome is necessary. Similar things should also be explained to the child taking into account his ability to understand and accept the information. The family should be explained that although the symptoms are real and impairing, a serious physical disorder is not causing them and there is hope of full recovery. Psychotherapy may be useful but contraindicated in a patient who is resistant to it or gets worse when it is initiated. COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY Family-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps the affected child to become aware of, examine, and if appropriate revise the way they think, respond, and behave rationally to their symptoms. The aim of CBT is to maximize functioning and reduce the dissociative symptoms. Gradually, onus of treatment should be shifted from the physician to the child and the family. The following are the principles of CBT in chronic dissociative states: Give positive explanations for symptoms Persuade the child that change is possible, he or she is not \"damaged,\" and they do have the potential to recover Discuss the treatment rationale with the patient and the key family members Encourage engagement in daily routine activities Teach relaxation and distraction away from unpleasant thoughts and the symptoms Encourage the patient to rationally reconsider unhelpful and negative thoughts Negotiate a phased return to work and studies Joint activities with family in symptom-free periods. Evidence exists at systematic review level that CBT is effective for a wide range of functional somatic symptoms. Its use has also been described (although not properly tested) in patients with nonepileptic attacks, dissociative motor symptoms, and severe and multiple functional symptoms.

Yet, a closer look at emotional experience reveals that all is not well in the experience domain. People with schizophrenia have difficulty anticipating emotional events and maintaining or savoring their emotional experiences, as evidenced in behavioral, psychophysiological, and brain imaging studies. Furthermore, people with schizophrenia have difficulty integrating emotion perception with context and reporting on feelings that are differently valenced than presented emotional stimuli. Differences in brain activation are typically observed in areas tightly coupled with cognitive control, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and thus the latest research on emotion in schizophrenia explicitly integrates emotion and cognition. Translational research holds promise to identify when in the course of the disorder emotion deficits emerge and to develop more effective interventions for schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Recognizing Psychiatric Comorbidity With Reading Disorders",
      "abstract": "Reading disorder (RD), a specific learning disorder (SLD) of reading that includes impairment in word reading, reading fluency, and/or reading comprehension, is common in the general population but often is not comprehensively understood or assessed in mental health settings. In education settings, comorbid mental and associated disorders may be inadequately integrated into intervention plans. Assessment and intervention for RD may be delayed or absent in children with frequently co-occurring mental disorders not fully responding to treatment in both school and mental health settings. To address this oversight, this review summarizes current knowledge regarding RDs and common comorbid or co-occurring disorders that are important for mental health and school settings. We chose to highlight RD because it is the most common SLD, and connections to other often comorbid disorders have been more thoroughly described in the literature. Much of the literature we describe is on decoding-based RD (or developmental dyslexia) as it is the most common form of RD. In addition to risk for academic struggle and social, emotional, and behavioral problems, those with RD often show early evidence of combined or intertwined Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition childhood disorders. These include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and depression, disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and other SLDs. The present review highlights issues and areas of controversy within these comorbidities, as well as directions for future research. An interdisciplinary, integrated approach between mental health professionals and educators can lead to comprehensive and targeted treatments encompassing both academic and mental health interventions. Such targeted treatments may contribute to improved educational and health-related outcomes in vulnerable youth. While there is a growing research literature on this association, more studies are needed of when to intervene and of the early and long-term benefits of comprehensive intervention.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter explores velopharyngeal dysfunction (VPD), its impact, aetiology, assessment, and management. VPD may cause hypernasal, weak, and unintelligible speech, facial grimacing, nasal turbulence and nasal regurgitation, middle ear problems, and sinusitis. Such manifestations may be distressing for the patient, be associated with poor academic outcomes, be negatively perceived by others, lead to bullying and withdrawal, and result in relationship and employment difficulties. Like the effect of a visible difference on psychosocial confidence and self-esteem, the manifestations of VPD on emotional well-being and social interaction do not necessarily correlate with the amount of speech, language, or communication dysfunction. Normal anatomy, neuromotor function, and speech learning are prerequisites for effective velopharyngeal function. A problem with any of these components may result in a velopharyngeal mechanism that fails to efficiently and fully close throughout oral speech sound formation leading to VPD and an ensuing speech disorder. Perceptual speech evaluation is used to diagnose VPD. Lateral videofluoroscopy and nasoendoscopy are commonly deployed to assess velopharyngeal function and determine management strategies. Surgical interventions include pharyngoplasty, pharyngeal flaps, and velopharyngeal augmentation. Non-surgical interventions include speech prostheses and nasal obturators for speech improvement.",

      "abstract": "The most recent neuroscientific studies have provided evidence about the existence of structural and functional abnormalities in fronto-estriatal circuits among patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Those abnormalities have also been proposed as the explanation for cognitive deficits and clinical symptoms of patients with OCD. In this paper we present a review of studies that have examined the neurocognitive functioning (attention, memory and executive functions) of patients with OCD.Studies show mixed results in terms of selective attention and processing speed. With regards to executive functions, patients with OCD display deficit to change the focus of attention, problems in response inhibition and difficulties to generate planning strategies. Studies assessing memory indicate that these patients present an evident deficiency in non-verbal memory, while is not so clear in verbal memory. This memory deficit seems to be related to the lack in the use of effective strategies, the need for excessive testing and the appearance of the doubt.The vast heterogeneity of the disorder and the limitations of some studies, which do not control the influence of variables such as comorbidity and medication, do not allow more definitive conclusions. Anyway, executive functions deficit seems to be the more consistent neuropsychological deficit in OCD. Future studies should focus on the control of extraneous variables, as well as on the relationship between the cognitive processes and symptoms of OCD.",

Particularly in recent years, the use of social media has emerged as an outstanding problem with the increasing use of the internet, mobile phones, tablets, computers and other mass media in the field of communication around the world as well as in our country. This rapidly erupted situation is also considered to cause mass physical and psychological health problems all over the world. The main reasons behind the increase use of social media are mainly depend on the attitudes of individuals towards social media and the related psychological symptoms. These symptoms can be summarized as somatization; transformation of stress into somatic symptoms, OCD; obsessive thought disorder, interpersonal sensitivity; feelings that cause difficulties in relationships, depression; sadness and depressed mood, anxiety; excessive and constant anxiety, paranoid thinking; emotional states such as suspecting and not trusting anyone, psychotism; lack of empathy with an aggressive instinct, additional scale; and measuring the amount of conditions such as anorexia and insomnia. The current study mainly focuses on the investigations of social media levels of individuals, the factors affecting social media use and the relationship between social media use and psychological symptoms.

      "title": "Urinary Incontinence1",
      "abstract": "The extent, misery, and costs of urinary incontinence are well known to readers of the Journal. Although much has been accomplished, there are still formidable barriers to clinicians’ efforts to control incontinence. These include physician and patient acceptance of incontinence as an expected accompaniment of aging; a lack of detailed knowledge of the relationships of incontinence with associated conditions such as dementia, depression, urinary infections, and vaginitis; scant empirical information to evaluate symptoms and physical signs; and little knowledge of the operating characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value) of urodynamic tests. Excluding acute or transient incontinence caused by sudden, acute illness or environmental conditions,1 established incontinence is usually due to four types, largely distinguished by urological pathology.2 Sphincter weakness incontinence (SWI) or urethral incompetence (UI) is involuntary loss of urine caused by increases in intra-abdominal pressure without bladder muscle contractions. This is usually associated with stress incontinence, the symptom of incontinence with coughing or exertion. Detrusor instability (DI) or detrusor hyperactivity (DH) is caused by involuntary contractions of the detrusor or bladder muscle sufficient to cause incontinence and is frequently associated with the symptom of urge incontinence, the loss of urine associated with a strong desire to void. Overflow incontinence (OI) occurs when bladder pressure exceeds maximal urethral pressure, due either to bladder distension from a urethral obstruction or an atonic bladder. Functional incontinence occurs with and without other pathology in individuals who are unable to toilet themselves independently due to chronic physical, psychological, or neurological dysfunction. Unlike many other medical conditions, currently these diagnoses can not be made by a short history, physical exam, and easily performed laboratory tests. The existing “gold standards'” of incontinence diagnosis—urodynamic testing—reflect a number of different tests, are expensive, and require referral to subspecialists. However, most incontinence is and always will be treated by geriatricians, internists, nurse practitioners, and nurses in the community and longterm care. These professionals need clear, reliable, and reproducible data on the ability of history questions and clinical bedside tests to detect treatable urinary pathology that causes incontinence. It is clearly necessary to refer certain patients for urodynamics, but the data should suggest how those patients can be identified and delineate the risks of empirical treatment and steps necessary to avoid these risks. Decision rules3 and algorithms4,5 have been proposed, but as of yet little data from comprehensive studies of the incontinent elderly support them. In this issue of the Journal, Wells et al. present data on the clinical characteristics, urodynamics, and the diagnostic usefulness of common tests in a large sample of women with established incontinence. They reconfirm the dismal suspicion of most geriatricians that while incontinence is a chronic problem and many patients do seek care for it, few continue with long-term therapy. In this well-educated, largely upper middle class sample, chronic diseases were common (86%), and the incontinence was not associated with significant dementia, functional disability, or negative health status. Wells et al. identified more SWI or UI incompetency (77%), relatively less DI or DH (25%), and about half the number of patients with normal bladders (7%) and overflow (9%) than seen in other studies of incontinent women.5,6 This probably represents the relatively healthy population, although the use of three separate tests (radiological, clinical, and urodynamic) for urethral incompetence may have identified more of these patients than other studies with less intense evaluations. Clinical diagnoses, easily made by the nurse practitioner using both symptoms and a “bedside'” test, were compared to urodynamic diagnoses and found to be accurate in 55%, over all diagnoses. As a first step in validating decision rules or office procedures for diagnosis, the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of incontinence symptoms, signs, and tests can be determined. These concepts are widely used7 in determining the applicability of clinical data to the diagnosis of disease. In this determination, the diagnoses are made with the best available standard—“the gold standard.'” Sensitivity refers to the percentage of patients with the diagnosis who have the characteristic (symptom, positive test) in question. Specificity refers to the fraction of patients without the diagnosis who do not have the characteristic. The positive predictive value is the fraction of patients with a characteristic who have the diagnosis. The negative predictive value is the fraction of patients without the characteristic who do not have the diagnosis. Sensitivity and specificity are attributes of the test or the symptom being evaluated, but predictive values are the characteristics most clinicians rely on as they specify the probability that a particular patient with a positive (or negative) test or symptom does (or does not) have the diagnosis. For the same test or symptom, the predictive value changes with changes in the prevalence of the disease in the population. Consequently, the prevalence of the disease must be available or estimated. The sequence of diagnoses identified and whether an algorithm should aim to exclude diagnoses or confirm them, depend on the characteristics of the tests. Ideally, available procedures should be able to confirm a diagnosis with a high degree of certainty (a high positive predictive value); alternatively, the test may be able to exclude it with a high degree of confidence (a high negative predictive value). The consequences of misdiagnosis should also be considered and be minimal or, at least, risk-free. A decision rule for incontinence should address the four diagnoses of established incontinence, but practically, office procedures for diagnoses exist only for SWI, DI, and OI. Ouslander's test for DI,4 (slowly filling the bladder by catheter while watching for uninhibited contractions) is not empirically established. Patients with overflow or obstruction can have normal postvoid residual bladder volumes, making simple measurement of this characteristic in the office unreliable. However, sphincter weakness can be identified by an office examination, the stress test. Additionally, therapy for SWI—estrogens and alpha agonists,8 carries little risk to patients with other categories of urinary pathology if misdiagnoses are made, unlike therapy for DI (anticholinergics). Consequently, it would appear that the first step in a diagnostic algorithm should be identification of SWI. According to Wells et al., the standing stress test, an examination for urinary leakage while coughing or sneezing with a full bladder, is useful for the diagnosis of SWI. It can be confused with cough-induced DI, as detrusor contractions can be induced by the coughing and cause urinary leakage five to 15 seconds later. However, the results of Wells et al. show that the standing stress test, as conducted in the office, is 50% sensitive for a urodynamic diagnosis of SWI or mixed SWI and DI, and 76% specific, with a positive predictive value of 88%. In other words, using these results in a similar population, there is an 0.88 probability that a patient with a positive stress test in the office would have sphincter weakness later demonstrated at urodynamics. Thus, the risk of false positives is 12%. Using symptoms with the stress test yields a more sensitive test at 94%, but due to a much lower specificity (13%) the positive predictive value drops to 78%. Before these results can be used with complete confidence, they need careful confirmation and extension to other populations with a lower prevalence of SWI (where the positive predictive value would be lower) and to populations of incontinent men. Using similar tests in the office, if these results are confirmed, clinicians can expect to be able to accurately identify about 50% of women with SWI. The women with a negative test could have SWI, DI, obstructions, or atonic bladders. A bedside test for DI might be able to separate out a group of patients with a high probability of DI and allow them to be effectively treated without initial urodynamics. A postvoid residual measurement, if high, may identify many of the patients with overflow incontinence, who could be referred to urologists.3 Each of these steps, and the role of therapy for patients who do not show evidence of a specific diagnosis, need careful study and validation. These studies should include carefully defined, large populations, specific diagnostic criteria acceptable to experts in urodynamics, and careful attention to the analysis to provide the data and validated approaches clinicians need to treat incontinence. The work by Wells et al. begins this process.",

      "abstract": "Climate solutions are available now, are widespread, and support psychological health.Increasing adoption of active commuting, public transportation, green spaces, and clean energy are all solutions that people can choose to support and integrate into their daily lives.These climate solutions, among others, can help to curb the stress, anxiety, and other mental illnesses incurred from the decline of economies, infrastructure, and social identity that comes from damage to the climate.Major acute mental health impacts include increases in trauma and shock, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), compounded stress, anxiety, substance abuse, and depression.Climate changeinduced extreme weather, changing weather patterns, damaged food and water resources, and polluted air impact human mental health.Increased levels of stress and distress from these factors can also put strains on social relationships and even have impacts on physical health, such as memory loss, sleep disorders, immune suppression, and changes in digestion.Major chronic mental health impacts include higher rates of aggression and violence, more mental health emergencies, an increased sense of helplessness, hopelessness, or fatalism, and intense feelings of loss.These feelings of loss may be due to profound changes in a personally important place (such as one's home) and/ or a sense that one has lost control over events in one's life due to disturbances from climate change.Additionally, a sense of loss regarding one's personal or occupational identity can arise when treasured objects are destroyed by a disaster or place-based occupations are disrupted by climate change.Personal relationships and the ways in which people interact in communities and with each other are affected by a changing climate.Compounded stress from a changing environment, ecomigration, and/or ecoanxiety can affect community mental well-being through the loss of social identity and cohesion, hostility, violence, and interpersonal and intergroup aggression.Recent increases in natural disasters illustrate the relationship between the acceleration of climate change and severe weather.Areas that endure a natural disaster face a number of risks and difficulties.Direct physical impacts range from brute physical trauma to more pernicious effects, like increased incidence of infectious disease, asthma, heart disease, and lung problems.These physical health impacts interact with mental health impacts, which is why they are detailed in this report on page 39.In this section, we use floods, the most common form of natural disasters (EM-DAT, 2011, as reported in Alderman, Turner, & Tong, 2012), as an example to illustrate the ways in which direct health impacts of disasters come about.",

Neuropsychological assessment of such individuals can shed light on the cognitive substrates for these unusual patterns of ability. This paper presents a neuropsychological case study of an Asperger's syndrome patient with remarkable mathematical abilities. Within a framework proposed by Rourke (1982), it is hypothesized that the social deficits associated with Asperger's syndrome may arise from longstanding difficulty with processing of information in novel situations, including decoding of visual information such as interpersonal cues and facial expressions. Relatively intact verbal skills may prevent these individuals from leading severely autistic lives and, in some cases, superior auditory verbal memory capacity may support development of extraordinary isolated “savant” skills which utilize routinized processing.",

Guided by clinical and neuroimaging evidence, visual perceptual disorders are classified by the functional anatomical networks likely to be involved and the class of underlying dysfunction, whether topological (a localised deficit or region of hyperfunction) or hodological (a disconnection or hyperconnection).

Korsakoff's patients, however, may recall rules and principles for organizing information and can gain access to their previously acquired knowledge (semantic memory), whereas recent memory may be grossly impaired. In contrast, dementia patients may have little access to previously acquired knowledge and therefore have great difficulty in organizing and encoding ongoing events. These contrasting forms of memory failure have implications for understanding the structure and mechanisms of memory and learning, particularly the relationship between episodic and semantic memory, as well as the development of therapeutic strategies for cognitive impairments.",

      "abstract": "Five pre-school children with variability in the quality of their social relationships, unusual or abnormal speech and/or expressive language, and ritualistic or manneristic behaviors, were diagnosed as having an atypical pervasive developmental disorder. In order to study the natural history of this disorder these children were followed-up 10 years later. Four of the adolescents showed evidence of the persistence of social and communicative disorders consistent with a diagnosis of a pervasive developmental disorder (PDDNOS), while one was found to have a social phobia and the residual state of the PDDNOS. One of the PDD adolescents was actively psychotic. We find that young children diagnosed as having a pervasive developmental disorder with atypical features can have thinking disorders and/or poor reality testing which persists into adolescence, and can develop symptoms of childhood and adolescent schizophrenia. The overall cognitive functioning of young children diagnosed as having a pervasive developmental disorder with atypical features tends to be stable or perhaps even improve somewhat as they grow into adolescence. Parents are aware of, and can report, the presence of severe emotional and/or behavioral disturbance in such adolescents. The marked similarities in symptomatology, clinical course, and treatment histories, between this group and a group of adolescents who were not diagnosed as having a PDD until adolescence, suggests that there may be an underreporting or underdiagnosis of young children with pervasive developmental disorders.",

Such outcomes are considered potentially more sensitive and specific to important therapeutic effects, and may be more linked to disability and disease-related life losses than conventional assessments of impairment (e.g. ability to walk, performance on language tests, serological or radiological indices). Self-report is invaluable to identify social and emotional consequences of brain injury: depression, changes in intimate and family relationships, social role and community participation losses. However, common stroke-related neuropsychological deficits are likely to confound subjective stroke outcome measures. The scientific community focused on stroke-related health outcomes may arrive at {significantly underestimated} patient reports of stroke-related disability, caused by a failure to adjust for the effect on self-report of spatial neglect, deficits of magnitude estimation, pathologic alteration of self-awareness, and alteration in distributed cortical systems supporting emotional semantics and abstraction.",

These are (in the order listed in DSM-IV): ... Note: ... This chapter will focus mainly on autism and Asperger's—the other PDD's are included for completeness, but as they are relatively rare they will not be covered in any detail.

      "abstract": "The intricate mechanism of swallowing can be divided into three phases: oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal. Causes of disruptions in the swallowing process can be divided into superior (oropharyngeal) and inferior (esophageal). Neurlologic dysphagia may be caused by a disruption in different parts of the central nervous system (supranuclear level, level of motor and sensory nuclei taking part in swallowing process, peripherial nerves level and a pathology of muscle cells and spindles) or neuromuscular and muscular disorders. Neuromuscular disorders causes are: stroke, brain tumors, brain injury, bulbar and pseudobulbar paralysis, neurodegenerative diseases (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis), tabes dorsalis, multisystem degenerations, Parkinson's disease, delayed dyskineses, Huntington's disease, myasthenia and myasthenic syndromes, myopathies and peripherial neuropathies. The correct diagnosis evaluation includes history taking, physical examination with palpation and consultations (laryngological, gastrological and neurological). Radiological esophagogram, videofluoroscopy, flexible endoscopic examination, ultrasound examination, manometry, electromyography, scintigraphy and 24 hour pH monitoring are main diagnostic procedures of dysphagia. Some of the reasons for the neurologic dysphagia may be treated by surgical and pharmacological methods. Neurlologic dysphagia rehabilitation is difficult, long-lasting and often falling far short of expected results. Primary it should include neurologic cause treatment if it is possible. According to WHO International Classification of Functioning and Health in 2001 non-invasive methods of dysphagia treatment may be divided into reconstitution, compensatory and adaptive techniques. The most popular reconstitution methods are thermal stimulation or tactilethermal application techniques. Dysphagia treatment by compensatory methods consists in various techniques of swallowing and posture changes application. Adaptive techniques include dietary changes avoiding of sustenances strengthening dysphagia and adequate dietary intake.",

      "title": "Afasia motora transitoria por encefalopatía hipóxica: papel de la ínsula",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Aphasia is a disorder of language, where there is alteration in the production and/or understanding of both oral and written language. It can occur in both child and adult population. Presentation of case: A 70 year-old female presented an event of motor aphasia without hemiparesis after a respiratory arrest. An magnetic resonance imaging showed an acute ischemic lesion in the insular cortex bilaterally. A subsequent study showed no infarcted zone. The patient s deficit subsided after a couple of days. At the present time the patient has no deficit. Discussion: We present data regarding the clinical syndrome of aphasia without hemiparesis and its anatomic an etiologic associations (embolic stroke at the insular cortex). At histologic examination insular zone may have a role on language production. When the insular region suffers a vascular event it generally involves another region that may add neurologic symptoms or data not corresponding to a pure insular affection. This symptoms include dysarthria, ataxia, aphasia that can be global, transcortical motor or conduction type. On the other hand there are chronic degenerative diseases that involve the insula and course with aphasia. There are few reports of hypoxic episodes that are accompanied with transitory neurologic disorders. Most cases describe a transitory global amnesia, although at special circumstances (mountain climbing) aphasia, motor disorders, and apraxia have been observed. Conclusions: We postulate that the transitory aphasia that the patient presented was due to an episode of focal insular ischemia due to an event of cerebral hypoxia. RESUMEN Introduccion: La afasia es un trastorno del lenguaje, en donde existe alteracion en la produccion y/o comprension tanto del lenguaje oral como escrito. Se puede presentar en poblacion infantil y en adulta. Presentamos un caso de afasia transitoria y completamente reversible tras un episodio de hipoxia cerebral. Caso clinico: Femenino de 70 anos, que presento posterior a un paro respiratorio con hipoxia y desaturacion prolongadas, un cuadro de afasia motora sin hemiparesia. Se solicito imagen por resonancia magnetica de craneo, la cual mostro datos sutiles de lesion aguda isquemica en ambas cortezas insulares, de predominio izquierdo, con ausencia de infarto en estudio posterior. Curso con buena evolucion con mejoria en dias. Actualmente, la paciente se encuentra sin deficit neurologico alguno. Discusion: Se comentara el fenomeno de afasia sin hemiparesia y su sustrato anatomico y etiologico mas frecuente (embolismo a la insula que provoca infarto). El papel de la insula en el lenguaje puede ser entendido al examinar su histologia y conexiones. Cuando la insula se afecta por isquemia o hemorragia cerebral, generalmente es con afeccion de areas circundantes, y los datos clinicos agregados obscurecen los hallazgos aislados que se encontrarian por afeccion insular. Estos datos incluyen alteraciones, disartria, ataxia y afasia que puede ser global, de conduccion, o transcortical motora. Existen por otro lado padecimientos cronico-degenerativos con afeccion primaria de la insula y que cursan con afasia. Asimismo, existen pocos reportes de alteraciones neurologicas transitorias por episodios de hipoxia, la mayoria se refieren a amnesia global transitoria, aunque en circunstancias especiales como el montanismo se ha observado afasia, alteracion motora y apraxia transitorias, entre otros sintomas.",

      "abstract": "Definition of stroke In epidemiological studies, stroke is defined by clinical findings and symptoms [1]: rapidly developed signs of focal (or global) disturbance of cerebral function lasting more than 24 hours (unless interrupted by surgery or death), with no apparent cause other than a vascular origin. This approach is supplemented with neuroimaging but even with advanced imaging techniques the diagnosis is based on clinical signs. Therefore, precise definitions of clinical signs are needed. WHO definitions are [1]: Definite focal signs: unilateral or bilateral motor impairment (including dyscoordination) unilateral or bilateral sensory impairment aphasis/dysphasis (non-fluent speech) hemianopia (half-sided impairment of visual fields) diplopia forced gaze (conjugate deviation) dysphagia of acute onset apraxia of acute onset ataxia of acute onset perception deficit of acute onset. Not acceptable as sole evidence of focal dysfunction: dizziness, vertigo localized headache blurred vision of both eyes dysarthria (slurred speech) impaired cognitive function (including confusion) impaired consciousness seizures. (Although strokes can present in this way, these signs are not specific and cannot therefore be accepted as definite evidence of stroke.) Neuroimaging studies are needed for classification of stroke by subtypes: subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage and brain infarction (necrosis). Although there may be large variations in stroke subtype distributions between populations, thrombotic and embolic strokes are responsible for about 80–85% of all strokes in the Indo-European populations, and as low as 65% in some Asian populations. Subarachnoid hemorrhage represents 5–10% of all strokes, and occurs more often in younger subjects, while both intracerebral and especially thrombotic and embolic stroke increase markedly with age.",

Cognitive and emotional disorders, problems in social adaptation, neurotic syndromes are normally targets in such cases. We work with patients having survived severe brain damage being in different states of consciousness: vegetative state, minimal state of consciousness, mutism, confusion, posttraumatic Korsaroff syndrom. Psychologist considers recovery of consciousness as the target besides traditional tasks. Construction of communication with patient is central part of such job, where the patient remains unable to contact verbally, yet it is impossible to consider potential aphasia. This is a non-verbal \"dialogue\" with patient created by psychologist with gradual development and involving other people and objects of environment. Inline with modern neuroscientific achievements demonstrating ability to recognize by patients with severe brain injury (A. Owen, S. Laureys, M. Monti, M. Coleman, A. Soddu, M.

A head injury might cause loss of motor control, sensory control, poor balance, and coordination. Cognitive activity, specifical metacognition, is highly affected, causing a lack of self-awareness of actions in patients with persistent long-term symptoms. Head injury in a young adult causes long-term difficulties in learning, memory problems abstract thinking, which causes massive difficulty in their learning performance in the later stage of life. Metacognitive strategy learning and cognitive rehabilitation in the later stage of brain injury improve the learning capabilities and abstract thinking and help them improve their self-awareness and thinking capabilities. Key message: Metacognition strategy training along with cognitive rehabilitation therapy improves the learning disability and abstract thinking in young adult with brain injury. Keywords: Metacognition, Strategy training, Head injury, Memory, Cognition rehabilitation, learning disability.",

      "abstract": "Definite diagnosis of cerebral palsy is usually possible during the first six months of life in the hemiplegic child, but in the paraplegic or quadriplegic it may not be clear until the second half of the first year or later. Diagnosis should include not only type, degree and extent of motor handicap, but also intelligence, personality factors, sensory deficits, seizures and other physical problems. Diagnosis depends on detecting deviations from normal growth and development, of being aware of a multitude of progressive and other lesions which may simulate, at least early, the \"static\" group of conditions characterized by motor deficit due to central nervous system disease. Management involves early positioning, use of special equipment (mainly improvised), sensory stimulation and experience, as well as motor training, evaluation of intelligence and special learning situations to assist in discrimination learning and lengthening of attention span. Nursery schools for mentally capable children from 18 months to 3 years of age assist in developing independence, maturity and growth of personality. Except for patients with very severe mental or physical involvement, competitive employment in adult life is not related so much to the physical handicap as to personality characteristics, traits which are formed in early years.",

      "title": "CAUSES AND MANAGEMENT OF STRESS AT WORK",
      "abstract": "tress has been defined in different ways over the years.Originally, it was conceived of as pressure from the environment, then as strain within the person.The generally accepted definition today is one of interaction between the situation and the individual.It is the psychological and physical state that results when the resources of the individual are not sufficient to cope with the demands and pressures of the situation.Thus, stress is more likely in some situations than others and in some individuals than others.Stress can undermine the achievement of goals, both for individuals and for organisations (box 1).Signs of stress can be seen in people's behaviour, especially in changes in behaviour.Acute responses to stress may be in the areas of feelings (for example, anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue), behaviour (for example, being withdrawn, aggressive, tearful, unmotivated), thinking (for example, difficulties of concentration and problem solving) or physical symptoms (for example, palpitations, nausea, headaches).If stress persists, there are changes in neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, autonomic and immunological functioning, leading to mental and physical ill health (for example anxiety, depression, heart disease) (box 2, fig 1). 1 Situations that are likely to cause stress are those that are unpredictable or uncontrollable, uncertain, ambiguous or unfamiliar, or involving conflict, loss or performance expectations.Stress may be caused by time limited events, such as the pressures of examinations or work deadlines, or by ongoing situations, such as family demands, job insecurity, or long commuting journeys.Resources that help meet the pressures and demands faced at work include personal characteristics such as coping skills (for example, problem solving, assertiveness, time management) and the work situation such as a good working environment and social support.These resources can be increased by investment in work infrastructure, training, good management and employment practices, and the way that work is organised.Historically, the typical response from employers to stress at work has been to blame the victim of stress, rather than its cause.Increasingly, it is being recognised that employers have a duty, in many cases in law, to ensure that employees do not become ill.It is also in their long term economic interests to prevent stress, as stress is likely to lead to high staff turnover, an increase in sickness absence and early retirement, increased stress in those staff still at work, reduced work performance and increased rate of accidents, and reduced client satisfaction.Good employment practice includes assessing the risk of stress amongst employees.This involves:c looking for pressures at work which could cause high and long lasting levels of stress c deciding who might be harmed by these c deciding whether you are doing enough to prevent that harm. c HOW STRESS IS CAUSEDThe degree of stress experienced depends on the functioning of two protective physiological mechanisms:c \"Alarm reaction\".When confronted with a threat to our safety, our first response is physiological arousal: our muscles tense and breathing and heart rate become more rapid.This serves us well when the threat is the proverbial bull in the field rushing towards us.We either fight or flee.Present day threats tend to be more psychological-for example, unjustified verbal attack by a superior at work.It is usually not socially acceptable to act by \"fight or flight\", and an alternative means of expressing the resultant emotional and physical energy is required.This falls in the arena of assertive communication.c \"Adaptation\".The second adaptive mechanism allows us to cease responding when we learn that stimuli in the environment are no longer a threat to our safety.For example, when we first spend time in a house near a railway line, our response to trains hurtling past is to be startled, as described above.Over time, our response dwindles.If this process did not function, we would eventually collapse from physical wear and tear, and mental exhaustion.",

As noted in Chapter 1, dysfunction of the human mind results in symptoms in three primary spheres: thinking (cognition), emotion (meaning), and motivation (ability to set and achieve goals). These disorders can also produce a variety of physical (or “neurovegetative”) symptoms that include changes in appetite, sleep, sexual function, and energy level, among others. Some people develop symptoms suggestive of other medical or neurological disorders, such as heart palpitations, shortness of breath, pain, and memory disturbances. Additionally, patients with serious medical and neurological disorders can develop psychiatric disorders (e.g., people with diabetes are prone to develop depression), with adverse effects likely affecting the outcome of both conditions.",

Auditory hallucinations are especially likely to swiftly be considered due to psychiatric illness. An elderly patient with chronic auditory hallucinations without other significant psychopathology nor other symptoms prompted reflection and literature review. Objectives To review differential diagnosis of auditory hallucinosis. Methods Pubmed search for terms: auditory and hallucinosis. Results Hallucinations should be evaluated according to: type, onset and evolution, association with physical and /or neurological symptoms, association with other hallucinations and/or other psychopathology, characteristics. Auditory hallucinations may present along a continuum from tinnitus, simple, verbal, musical. The Pubmed search retrieved articles pertaining to auditory hallucinations associated with: 1. Sensory deprivation; 2. Hearing loss, auditory Charles Bonnet syndrome; 3. Dementia, neurodegenerative disorders; 4. Brainstem lesions; 5. Other central nervous lesions: thalamus, temporal, other; 6. Epilepsy; 7. Tic disorders; 8. Alcohol use disorders; 9. Borderline personality disorder; 10. Others. Conclusions Patients presenting with auditory hallucinosis should be carefully evaluated to exclude non-psychiatric disorders.

When the baby is born, their drug supply stops and they go through withdrawal. Withdrawal signs depend on what drugs are in their system, how much they were exposed to and how they were used during pregnancy. The exact mechanisms behind the long-term effects of NAS/NOWS are not fully understood, but researchers believe some of these long-term effects may be due to brain development and changes in how neural pathways connect in the brain. Research shows that people with NAS/NOWS may be more likely to experience visual disturbances, hearing difficulties, impaired motor functions, short-term memory issues, speech delay and difficulties with executive functioning.",

      "title": "Doctor patient communication Content or process",
      "abstract": "In the doctor-patient interview, there is a tendency to think of a dichotomy between content or background (the patient's complaint, his symptoms, medical decision-making subject to evidence -evidence-based medicine (EBM)-, drug prescription, etc.) and the process or form of the interview (the modality of the doctor-patient relationship, empathy/assertiveness, sympathy, compassion, transference and countertransference, the placebo effect, etc.). This approach is as reductionist as the usual mind-body dualism. And the problem is that, as in the bio-psychosocial (BPS) approach, the holistic content-process approach to doctor-patient communication has not been integrated into the daily practice of general practitioners (GPs) with little time, who care for most patients with acute and chronic, physical and mental illnesses [1, 2]. General Medicine (GM) presents special characteristics that differentiate it from other medical specialties. In GM it is necessary to evaluate the presentation of symptoms, in addition to the symptoms themselves. That is, the reason for the consultation initiates or emphasizes important issues for the pat ient, and not just symptoms, in a communication context [3, 4]. GPs often assume that in consultation the patient will ment ion the most important symptoms and signs in relation to it, and that patients will spontaneously report all their fears and worries; neither of these assumptions is true (5). When a pat ient comes to the office, the GP must face a certain amount of uncertainty about the evaluation and optimal treatment of it. Uncertainty is frequently represented in terms of probability or normative reasoning, and EBM. But, the reason for consultation expressed by the patient is only a manifest content. The GP must transform or complete those ideas that are latent or initially hidden [6, 7]. Symptoms are often \"disorganized\", not readily recognizable, and can be presented by symbols, as does the arrangement of notes in a musical score. Perhaps the family doctor has to approach the symptoms as if they were \"music\": like a mysterious constellation; seeking order in disorder, or better trying to understand some of the disorder [8]. The symptom is an indicator of a process that is not always fully visible. The loss of internal balance manifests itself in the body in the form of a symptom. In addition, the symptom is not an enemy whose destruction should be the main objective, but can be an ally to find the disease. In reality, the symptom indicates what the patient “misses” (9). The GP try of knowing the latent material by means of “reading the patient’s manifest signs and symbols”. The messages of our patients contain “facts” and “feelings”, and we must be attent ive and understand the emotional messages. The reason for consultation / symptom / manifest problem that the patient initially expresses is a “symbolic representation” (with universal and particular symbols); and in addition, the doctor looks for what seems to be the cause of the patient's problem in the doctor-patient relationship itself [10]. The process of communication or presentation of the reason for the visit that the patient makes to the doctor is itself a content of the health problem, it gives information about the psychic life, and it can be a signal that tells the doctor which direction to take [11-13]. In order to fully understand the symptom we must distance ourselves from the usual valuations. It is convenient to replace an excessively analytical and rational thought, with another plastic, symbolic and analogical one. Illness is a system of interpretation; and to understand disease we have to see a system of relationships. The emotional response expressed by the patient has the effect of a linguistic transfer from social complexity to psychic complexity. Illness is expressed as a contrast –not as its own unequivocal entity, but as a contrast between relationship systems-, as in painting a contour, a line, appears from the contrast between two colours instead of how a line is actually drawn [14].",

It is characterized by a specific type of seizure called a spasm, which involves sudden, brief jerks of the arms, legs, or trunk. These spasms can occur in clusters and may be accompanied by other seizure types. The cause of WS is not clear, but it is thought to be related to abnormal brain development or damage. In some cases, it may be associated with genetic mutations or other underlying conditions such as Down syndrome or tuberous sclerosis. Early diagnosis and treatment are important, as untreated WS can lead to developmental delays and intellectual disability. In this article, a 2-year and 7-month-old male was diagnosed with WS; his hearing evaluation was carried out to assess the impact of syndrome on audition. Audiological test battery was used which reveals hearing sensitivity within normal limits in both the ears. Speech and language skills development were delayed.",

      "abstract": "Premature survivors are at increased risk for impaired neurodevelopmental outcome compared to full terms. These sequelae include cognitive abnormalities, mild fine or gross motor delay, cerebral palsy, vision and hearing losses, impairment increases with decreasing gestational age. Persistence of multiple abnormal neurologic signs in the first 12 to 18 months is ominous. Emergence of other findings (vision impairments, seizures, feeding issues delay of head growth) is associated with poor outcome. MRI is useful in predicting neurodevelopmental outcome at the equivalent of term gestation. Other neonatal complications as; bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, intraventricular hemorrhage, poor growth, presence of congenital anomalies are associated with an increased risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcome. Premature survivors are more likely to have specific psychological and behavioral problems including attention deficit hyperactivity syndrome, general anxiety, and depression. Individuals with birth weights below 1500 g are at greater risk for poor academic performance than those born with normal birthweight because of their impaired cognition, neurosensory defects, and behavioral and psychological problems. Neurodevelopmental outcome is assessed more accurately at school age than in early childhood due to the cognitive recovery over time and lack of accurate predictive assessment tools in early childhood. Survivors of prematures need to be assessed for neurodevelopmental impairment and, if impairment is present, be referred to educational programs and subspecialty care in order to provide the best possible outcome. ELBW infants without evidence of significant neonatal brain injury can recover when exposed to a nurturing home environment and comprehensive early intervention services.",

      "title": "Consequences of sleep deprivation",
      "abstract": "This paper presents the history of research and the results of recent studies on the effects of sleep deprivation in animals and humans. Humans can bear several days of continuous sleeplessness, experiencing deterioration in wellbeing and effectiveness; however, also a shorter reduction in the sleep time may lead to deteriorated functioning. Sleeplessness accounts for impaired perception, difficulties in keeping concentration, vision disturbances, slower reactions, as well as the appearance of microepisodes of sleep during wakefulness which lead to lower capabilities and efficiency of task performance and to increased number of errors. Sleep deprivation results in poor memorizing, schematic thinking, which yields wrong decisions, and emotional disturbances such as deteriorated interpersonal responses and increased aggressiveness. The symptoms are accompanied by brain tissue hypometabolism, particularly in the thalamus, prefrontal, frontal and occipital cortex and motor speech centres. Sleep deficiency intensifies muscle tonus and coexisting tremor, speech performance becomes monotonous and unclear, and sensitivity to pain is higher. Sleeplessness also relates to the changes in the immune response and the pattern of hormonal secretion, of the growth hormone in particular. The risk of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease increases. The impairment of performance which is caused by 20-25 hours of sleeplessness is comparable to that after ethanol intoxication at the level of 0.10% blood alcohol concentration. The consequences of chronic sleep reduction or a shallow sleep repeated for several days tend to accumulate and resemble the effects of acute sleep deprivation lasting several dozen hours. At work, such effects hinder proper performance of many essential tasks and in extreme situations (machine operation or vehicle driving), sleep loss may be hazardous to the worker and his/her environment.",

Regular physical activity improves quality of life, cognitive functions, mood state and physical capacity, and lowers the risk of many diseases and premature death. Physical activity affects proteins and gene expression through signalling mechanisms, e.g. epigenetic changes. The biological response to physical activity can be markedly different between individuals, to a large degree due to genetic mechanisms. Regular aerobic physical activity (endurance training) improves cardiac function, partly due to an increased stroke volume, and lowers blood pressure due to e.g. improved vasodilation, lower arterial stiffness and increased capillarisation.

      "title": "RELAÇÃO ENTRE A QUALIDADE DO SONO, PERCEPÇÃO CORPORAL E OS SINTOMAS MOTORES E SENSITIVOS EM PESSOAS COM ESCLEROSE MÚLTIPLA REMITENTE-RECORRENTE",
      "abstract": "A esclerose múltipla remitente-recorrente (EMRR) é uma doença neurológica autoimune, onde o sistema imunológico ataca a bainha de mielina do sistema nervoso central, causando inflamação que prejudica a transmissão dos impulsos nervosos. Caracteriza-se por episódios de surtos com exacerbação dos sintomas, como fadiga, fraqueza em membros inferiores e superiores, tremores e equilíbrio dificuldade para andar, perda de visão, entre outros, seguidos de remissões com recuperação parcial ou completa, que podem durar meses ou anos, durante os quais a progressão da doença é mínima ou ausente. A insônia ou baixa qualidade de sono pode ocorrer indiretamente como consequência da EMRR. Ou seja, um sintoma secundário que é acarretado pela presença dos sintomas específicos da doença e dos pseudo surtos. A Percepção Corporal (PC) pode ser definida de duas maneiras, como Imagem Corporal (IC) e Esquema Corporal (EC). A IC está relacionada ao aspecto psíquico, emocional, cognitivo, sociocultural, evolucionário, genético e neurocientífico, em relação a expectativa da imagem de seu corpo. O EC é a perspectiva que possibilita, por meio de mecanismos cinestésicos e proprioceptivos, o reconhecimento do corpo anatômico e da relação que este estabelece com o meio e com os objetos a sua volta. Diante destas definições, surgiu a oportunidade para relacionar a qualidade de sono com a percepção corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos. Sendo assim, o objetivo do estudo foi analisar a relação entre a qualidade do sono e a percepção corporal, pelo aspecto do esquema corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos da esclerose múltipla. Participaram 18 pessoas, entre 21 e 67 anos, que foram avaliados quanto à qualidade do sono pelo questionário de Pittsburgh, à percepção corporal pelo Teste de Askevold, e aos sintomas por meio de uma entrevista estruturada. Os resultados indicaram que todos os participantes com sono adequado foram classificados como hiperesquemáticos, enquanto 67% dos que apresentaram sono inadequado foram classificados como hipoesquemáticos. Além disso, indivíduos com sono inadequado mostraram uma distribuição equilibrada entre sintomas motores e sensitivos, enquanto aqueles com sono adequado relataram predominantemente sintomas sensitivos. A fadiga foi um sintoma relevante em 67% dos indivíduos com sono inadequado. Esses achados sugerem que a qualidade do sono pode estar associada à percepção corporal e à manifestação dos sintomas na EMRR, destacando a importância de intervenções que melhorem o sono para o manejo dessa condição.",

      "title": "Neuroimaging and psychometric assessment of mild cognitive impairment after traumatic brain injury",
      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can be serious partly due to the challenges of assessing and treating its neurocognitive and affective sequelae. The effects of a single TBI may persist for years and can limit patients’ activities due to somatic complaints (headaches, vertigo, sleep disturbances, nausea, light or sound sensitivity), affective sequelae (post-traumatic depressive symptoms, anxiety, irritability, emotional instability) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI, including social cognition disturbances, attention deficits, information processing speed decreases, memory degradation and executive dysfunction). Despite a growing amount of research, study comparison and knowledge synthesis in this field are problematic due to TBI heterogeneity and factors like injury mechanism, age at or time since injury. The relative lack of standardization in neuropsychological assessment strategies for quantifying sequelae adds to these challenges, and the proper administration of neuropsychological testing relative to the relationship between TBI, MCI and neuroimaging has not been reviewed satisfactorily. Social cognition impairments after TBI (e.g., disturbed emotion recognition, theory of mind impairment, altered self-awareness) and their neuroimaging correlates have not been explored thoroughly. This review consolidates recent findings on the cognitive and affective consequences of TBI in relation to neuropsychological testing strategies, to neurobiological and neuroimaging correlates, and to patient age at and assessment time after injury. All cognitive domains recognized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) are reviewed, including social cognition, complex attention, learning and memory, executive function, language and perceptual-motor function. Affect and effort are additionally discussed owing to their relationships to cognition and to their potentially confounding effects. Our findings highlight non-negligible cognitive and affective impairments following TBI, their gravity often increasing with injury severity. Future research should study (A) language, executive and perceptual-motor function (whose evolution post-TBI remains under-explored), (B) the effects of age at and time since injury, and (C) cognitive impairment severity as a function of injury severity. Such efforts should aim to develop and standardize batteries for cognitive subdomains—rather than only domains—with high ecological validity. Additionally, they should utilize multivariate techniques like factor analysis and related methods to clarify which cognitive subdomains or components are indeed measured by standardized tests.",

For adults with ADHD or learning disorders, the symptoms can affect work performance and social relationships. Whereas learning disorders affect processing of very specific skills, such as reading or math, ADHD symptoms include difficulty with attention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity. Research suggests that ADHD and learning disorders are associated with a longer recovery period after concussion, but it appears that this finding may be related to how these disorders affect performance on the tools used to track recovery. Because research studies on concussion often exclude participants with learning disorders and ADHD, much remains to be learned.",

If that discrete and sustained discharge occurs in the temporal lobe or limbic region of the brain, the condition is referred to as nonconvulsive complex partial status epilepticus (discussed in Chapter 10). If the discharge is ongoing in systems that subserve language function, an aphasia may result (see Chapter 11).

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONThe aim of this article is to emphasize and summarize pathographies of eminent composers, 77 of them, who were substance abusers. In this section we can divide them into three groups as follows: substance abusers who suffered from primary alcoholism, secondary alcoholism, and those who were alcohol and/or tobacco, drugs abusers. Most of them had different anxiety and depressive disorders (neurosis, panic disorder, cyclothymia, manic depressive disorder).1Substance abuse is the use of alcohol, tobacco and/or illegal drugs in a way that is harmful for health. Most of the composers mentioned in this article were alcohol abusers. Alcoholism is a syndrome of physical dependence on alcohol, whose sudden deprivation may cause withdrawal symptoms - tremor, anxiety, hallucinations and delusions (delirium tremens). Alcoholism impairs intellectual functions, physical skills, memory, judgment and social skills, such as conversation. Heavy consumption or alcohol abuse also causes following complications and diseases of different organs and systems, for example cardiovascular - cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure; nervous system - neuritis, funnicular myelosis, cerebral atrophy; gastrointestinal tract - gastropathy, ulcers, portal hypertension, acute and chronic pancreatitis, enteritis, cirrhosis of the liver etc. There are many substance abusers, but only a few of them (Dussek, Mysliveoek, Mussorgsky etc.) suffered primarily from alcoholism to such extent that their careers were interrupted and stopped because of alcohol abuse. Therefore they were unable to finish their creative work.11 In this journal we previously published pathographies of the following composers: J.C. Bach, W.F. Bach, Beethoven, Berlioz, Brahms, Debussy, Glinka, Gluck, Handel, Liszt, Mozart, Mussorgsky, Puccini, Ravel, Schonberg, Schubert, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky, Wolf.COMPOSERS AND RESULTS1. Pietro Marc Antonio Cesti(1623-1669) Italian composer and conductor who was born in Arezzo and studied with various local musicians. In 1637 he joined the Franciscan order. While he was in Volterra he turned more toward secular music, probably due to the patronage of the powerful Medici family. There he also came in contact with Salvator Rosa who wrote librettos for a number of Cesti' s cantatas. By 1650 Cesti' s calling as a monk and his success as a singer and composer of operas were coming into conflict so he was officially reprimanded. In 1652 he became a court member in Innsbruck. After holding a post somewhere in Florence as maestro di cappella, he entered the papal chapel in 1660. In 1666 he became Vice-Kapellmeister in Vienna. He was described as unstable, stubborn, quarrelsome and often seeking confrontation. He had frequent disagreements with other musicians. His frequent changes of living places were caused by his conflicting nature and connected with his alcohol abuse because of which he had problems with the society. His health was impaired because of alcohol abuse, so he died at the age of 46 in Venice as a result of complications of alcoholism, probably poisoned by his rivals in Florence.2-82. Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf(1739-1799) Austrian violinist and composer who was born in Vienna. He was a brilliant musician of great technical skills and soon became a member of the court chapels held by prince Sachsen - Hildburghausen, and later of another held by Bishop Adam Pataoic. Afterwards he was active in Breslau - Wroclaw and again in Vienna. He was a member of the royal orchestra and later a capelmeister in service of Bratislava Duke. He cooperated with J. Haydn and W.A. Mozart extensively. His musical drama »A doctor and a chemist« became very famous and was even compared to Mozart's »Figaro«. He was a master of »Singspiel«; he composed more than forty of them, and comic operas. He led a decadent life, eating and drinking excessively. He was one of the last composers living that kind of life. Later, he suffered from uric arthritis and hemorrhoids, what is more, he became almost paralyzed. …",

Affected family members (mother and sibling of the proband) also had a similar phenotype. Neuropsychology evaluation of proband and afflicted family members revealed moderate impairments in attention, executive function, short-term and episodic memory, and marked impairments in planning, abstract reasoning, language and visuospatial functions. Normal electroencephalogram, alpha-fetoprotein levels and somatosensory evoked potentials helped to delineate SCA21 from other differential diagnoses. Motor impairment, pyramidal signs, and sensory impairment are usually absent in SCA21.

      "abstract": "Introduction: Behavioral and emotional disorders are highly prevalent and heterogeneous common disorders in children and adolescents that include attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), adjustment disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive/compulsive disorder (OCD), posttraumatic stress disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, depression and others. These disorders are frequently associated with the negative outcomes in adulthood, substance abuse and dependence, early pregnancy, persistent health problems, increased aggression, impulsivity, hyperactivity, inattention, obsessions, compulsions, anxiety, suicidality, delinquency, and criminality. These disorders are multifactorial and heterogeneous, with a complex etiology and strong genetic component. No single deficit is sufficient to explain all clinical cases of these disorders. Various child-specific, environmental, demographic, psychosocial, psychiatric, cognitive, developmental and genetic factors, with the stress exposure or adverse early life experiences, and a complicated interplay of these factors, contribute to the development and maintenance of these disorders and antisocial, violent and suicidal behaviors. The neurobiological basis of these disorders is not clear, but it is assumed to involve particular gene mutations and altered functions of the main neurotransmitter (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin /5-HT/) and neuroendocrine (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis) systems. Materials and Methods: Platelet markers, monoamine oxidase (MAO-B) and 5-HT, and polymorphisms of the genes for catechol-o- methyl-transferase (COMT) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were determined in male and female children with depression, OCD, ADHD, and phobias. Children were further subdivided according to the gender and suicidal behavior. Clinical diagnoses and suicidal behavior were assessed according to the DSM-IV criteria, different clinical scales and the psychiatric interview. Results: Significant differences were found in platelet 5-HT concentration between healthy boys and girls, but not among suicidal and non-suicidal children. Significant differences in the frequency of the Val66Met BDNF genotypes between suicidal, non-suicidal and healthy groups were detected. The distribution of the Val158/108Met COMT variants, and platelet MAO-B activity, did not differ significantly between the studied groups. Discussion: Our results did not support the hypothesis that reduced platelet 5-HT concentration or lower platelet MAO-B activity or Val158/108Met COMT variants present the risk factors for suicidal behavior in children. The significant contribution of the Met/Val genotype of the Val66Met BDNF to the observed significance suggested that Val66Met BDNF might present a risk factor for suicidal behavior. This result should be confirmed on the larger sample. Since the clinical features of behavioral and emotional disorders are heterogeneous and complex, further research of the risk factors for suicidal behavior is important to identify and properly treat children and adolescents prone to suicidal behavior, in order to prevent suicidal behavior, suicidal attempts and completed suicides.",

      "title": "Iloperidone (Fanapt): An FDA-Approved Treatment Option for Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a debilitating and chronic mental illness that affects approximately 24 million people of all ages around the world. The usual onset is between 15 and 35 years of age,1 and about 1% of all Americans are affected.2 Approximately 25% of all beds in psychiatric hospitals are occupied by patients with schizophrenia, and 50% of psychiatric hospital admissions are a result of schizophrenia.3,4 This mental illness can be characterized by the presentation of psychosis, cognitive impairment, social withdrawal, and apathy, all of which lead to impaired functioning in school, self-care, recreational activities, work, parenting, and interpersonal relationships. Among the psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia is considered to be the most disabling illness.5 Symptoms can broadly be classified into three groups: \r\n\r\n\r\npositive: unusual perceptions or thoughts such as hallucinations and delusions\r\n\r\n\r\nnegative: a decrease or loss in the ability to speak, to find pleasure in everyday life, to express emotions, or to initiate plans. These symptoms are often mistaken for depression or amotivation; hence they are more difficult to recognize.\r\n\r\n\r\ncognitive: difficulty in organizing or planning, with impairments in executive functioning, working memory, and attention. These are considered the most disabling of the symptoms because they affect the patient’s ability to maintain a normal life.6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo general classes of medications are used to treat schizophrenia: first-generation (conventional) antipsychotic agents and second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic agents.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly used first-generation antipsychotic drugs are chlorpromazine (Thorazine, GlaxoSmithKline), haloperidol (Haldol, Ortho-McNeil), perphenazine (Trilafon, Schering), and fluphenazine (Prolixin, Apothecon). Although efficacious, these medications are associated with a high risk of causing extrapyramidal symptoms, including rigidity, tremors, dystonia, and restlessness.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, the first of the atypical agents, clozapine (Clozaril, Novartis), was approved in the U.S. Although clozapine is considered to have extrapyramidal symptoms as a rare side effect, it carries five black box warnings, the most serious being agranulocytosis. Many other atypical agents are known for their metabolic side effects such as weight gain and an increased risk of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Other atypical antipsychotic medications include risperidone (Risperdal, Janssen), olanzapine (Zyprexa, Eli Lilly), quetiapine (Seroquel, AstraZeneca), ziprasidone (Geodon, Pfizer), aripiprazole (Abilify, Bristol-Myers Squibb/Otsuka), paliperidone (Invega, Janssen), and asenapine (Saphris, Schering-Plough).6\r\n\r\nIn May 2009, the FDA approved iloperidone (Fanapt, Vanda) as an atypical antipsychotic agent for the acute treatment of patients with schizophrenia. In clinical trials, it was shown to be efficacious and safe. In this article, we review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of iloperidone in alleviating both the positive and negative symptoms of this disabling disease.",

      "title": "The Meaning of Stress, Anxiety and Collective Panic in Clinical Settings",
      "abstract": "The physician is often confronted with questions about the meaning of symptoms or diseases. One of the tasks of those practicing psychosomatic medicine is to delve into the answers to these questions. Anxiety is a common phenomenon in everyday practice, and it is evoked in the most different situations. The relationship of this kind of anxiety (i.e. when having to consider painful or life-threatening diseases or medical or surgical procedures) to both neurotic anxiety and normal anxiety (i.e. the one expressed in poetry or artistic creativity or present in the biographies of outstanding men and women who by no means could be considered as psychiatric cases) leads to define anxiety as the psychological equivalent of stress. Anxiety is the unspecific response to a threat induced by too sudden or too extreme variations in the environment (life changes, stressful situations, life events). Such mechanisms, so important for survival, can become self-destructive, paving the way for the appearance of diseases represented by unsuccessful coping mechanisms. The analogy with the diseases of the general adaptation syndrome of Selye (i.e. autoimmune diseases) and with reactions in collective panics in disasters becomes evident under this perspective. The physician has to face anxiety with the same attitude that he faces pain, that is to say, going beyond a consideration of its 'normality' (it is quite normal to feel chest pain in acute heart infarct), keeping in mind its role in survival. Most creative men and women are, as many psychohistorical studies have shown, individuals who have been able to find a solution to internal conflicts which were conflicts of the society in which they lived, leading to a solution of this same external conflict. The anxiety which is often expressed in this situation has an element of restlessness, which is lacking in anxiety and related disorders which are dominated by feelings of inability to cope expressed time and again as 'Dr., I can't' (go out in the street, in elevators, live, love, work, and so on).",

      "title": "Unmasking Cognitive Decline: A Case Report on the Diagnostic Challenges in Language Variant Frontotemporal Dementia",
      "abstract": "Aims: Language variant frontotemporal dementia (lvFTD) is a neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting language, often presenting with speech and comprehension difficulties, commonly in people aged 45–65 years. LvFTD presents a perplexing diagnostic challenge, often masquerading as primary progressive aphasia (PPA) while progressively dismantling communication and cognition. Despite growing recognition of lvFTD, a critical gap remains in distinguishing its early presentation with overlapping neurodegenerative syndromes, delaying accurate diagnosis and intervention. Methods: This case report highlights the challenges of diagnosing lvFTD in a patient with atypical early symptoms and the implications of late diagnosis on patient care and outcomes. Patient in her late 50s, with background of anaemia and hypothyroidism presented with memory issues, word-finding difficulties, and trouble understanding conversations which began in early 50s, initially attributed to menopause. Symptoms worsened over time, revealing frontal lobe atrophy on brain imaging and a psychotic episode, including auditory hallucinations and paranoid delusions. Following two self-harm attempts, detention under the Mental Health Act led to first mental health admission. Neurological investigations, including PET CT Brain, suggested a diagnosis of potential Logopenic Primary Progressive Aphasia (lvPPA) with mixed dementia and Lewy Body dementia (LBD). Neurologist review confirmed diagnosis of lvFTD. Antipsychotic trial undertaken with aripiprazole, only to stop as led to worsening behavioural symptoms. Subsequently started on mirtazapine, quetiapine, lorazepam and rivastigmine. Improvement noticed in symptomatology. Currently awaiting DAT scan for further evaluation and on waitlist of Young Onset Dementia Psychology. Results: This case underscores the complex diagnostic challenges in patients with overlapping neurodegenerative and psychiatric symptoms. The patient, in her late 50s, presented with progressive language impairment, memory issues, and psychotic features including auditory hallucinations and paranoid delusions. Neuroimaging revealed frontal lobe atrophy and significant asymmetrical hypometabolism in the left frontal, temporal and parietal lobes, findings suggestive of lvPPA. However, reduced tracer activity in the occipital cortices raised the possibility of mixed dementia, potentially co-existing with LBD. These overlapping features highlight the need for a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to refine diagnosis and optimize management strategies. Conclusion: Breaking through the diagnostic fog, this case exposes the intricate challenge of untangling overlapping neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. The patient’s progression from language deficits to memory loss and psychotic symptoms along with neuroimaging showing left hemispheric hypometabolism and frontal lobe atrophy, suggested lvPPA, potentially complicated by mixed dementia and probable LBD. She was diagnosed as lvFTD. This complexity calls for early multidisciplinary evaluation for prompt diagnosis and tailored intervention for improved patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Most of the idiopathic generalized epilepsies are considered as benign in childhood. Using literature data and some personal investigations, we screened the cognitive impairment and school difficulties observed in children with idiopathic generalized epilepsies, especially absence epilepsies, myoclonic epilepsies considered as non-severe, and generalized epilepsies with tonico-clonic seizures. In a controlled study concerning typical absence epilepsy, we have shown a lack of high or moderately elevated level of non-verbal and total IQ scores on Wechsler's tests (WISC III); we also observed a significant impairment of memory, a lengthening of school realisations, concerning motor skills and alertness and also hyperactivity and/or attention disorders, concerning 35 to 50% of cases. Most of these children present with school difficulties, of variable degree. These results show that the term \"benign\" is not appropriate in many cases of so-called benign idiopathic generalized epilepsies.",

      "title": "ADHD and Stress: The Role of Meditation to Reduce Stress, and Improve Brain Function and Behavior Regulation",
      "abstract": "While the use of alternative approaches such as yoga, meditation, exercise, special diets, and nutritional supplements for treating children with ADHD is becoming widespread, little is known about the effectiveness of many of these approaches.There is a growing body of research on the beneficial effects of meditation on health risks, psychosocial factors, and on brain development.However there is little published research about the use of meditation for ADHD. Stress, anxiety and ADHDADHD is associated with impaired executive function, specifically brain circuitry governing behavior (Bush, et al., 2005;Durston, et al., 2004;Zametkin, et al., 1993).Dysfunction of these circuits leads to impulsivity and lack of normal social inhibition.It also leads to impaired working memory, inability to focus attention, and impaired temporal organization.Stress interferes with executive function and behavior regulation (McEwen, 1998).Stressimpaired executive function is associated with impaired working memory, impaired impulse control, and lack of mental flexibility and coping strategies.Stress also dramatically compromises selective attention and the ability to sustain attention (Lupien, et al., 2005).www.intechopen.comCurrent Directions in ADHD and Its Treatment 196 In comparing symptoms of stress and symptoms of ADHD, there is a striking similarity.Recent research sheds light on the relationship between stress and ADHD.Vance, et al., demonstrated dysfunction of the right prefrontal regions of the brain in ADHD children (2007).This region is responsible for developing coping strategies, influencing the ability to handle stress.Chronic acute stress damages the body's ability to return to non-stress levels, leading to chronically elevated levels of cortisol, a biochemical marker of stress.In children with ADHD high cortisol levels impair executive function, self-regulation, and letter knowledge (Blair, Grange, & Razza, 2005).Chronic stress can originate not only from emotional causes but can also result from physical origins.Studies of premature birth and birth weight show an association between physical stress and risk of ADHD.Danish researchers found that babies born prematurely had up to 70% greater risk of ADHD.Similarly, babies born of low birth weight had 50-90% greater risk of ADHD, depending on the weight at birth (Linnet, Wisborg, Agerbo, Secher, Thomsen, & Henriksen, 2006).Early experiences of stress are believed to affect the level of responsiveness of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the autonomic nervous system.Young children exposed to chronic stress can become conditioned to higher levels of adrenaline.This raises the \"set point,\" making these children more vulnerable to stress, resulting in situations more easily triggering stress responses.",

There is also a description of disorders of written language (the dyslexias and dysgraphias), of calculation (acalculia), and of higher-order motor control (apraxia). This is followed by descriptions of the syndromes associated with disturbed right hemisphere functions: neglect phenomena, dressing and constructional apraxia, and complex visuoperceptual disorders (agnosias).

      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder of undefined etiology characterized by social, communication deficits, and restricted interests/repetitive or isolated behaviors. The determination of autism is made in early life as the patients create unusual or decreased social interaction and communication, together with stereotypic movement. In most patients, a delay in verbal and nonverbal communication is watched, whereas a few patients never accomplish valuable language. Patients with autism and epilepsy may develop any type of seizure and maybe all type of seizures. Interestingly, not absolutely understood relationship between each and a lot of research in progress concerning these relations. In patients with autism, some they do not develop seizures; however, abnormal paroxysmal electroencephalographic “EEG” activity can be seen in up to 30%. For that reason, important investigation of patients with autistic spectrum disorders, and any kids with language regression, should always include sleep recording EEG in order to exclude acquired epileptic aphasia (Landau-Kleffner syndrome). The complex relationship between autism and epilepsy provides a bridge to further knowledge of shared neuronal networks for both the autisms and the epilepsies We review the literature to elucidate the relationships between epilepsy and autism.",

      "title": "[Clinical practice guideline. Diagnosis and treatment of insomnia in the elderly].",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is the difficulty to initiate or to maintain sleep. It also has to do with waking up too early at least for a month. A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.El insomnio es la dificultad para conciliar o mantener el sueño; también consiste en despertar demasiado temprano al menos durante un mes. Un paciente con insomnio presenta consecuencias diurnas como fatiga, somnolencia, deterioro de la memoria, cambios en el estado de ánimo, en la concentración, así como en su desempeño social o familiar, entre otros. La asociación de este padecimiento con la salud física y mental es importante debido al impacto que tiene en la calidad y la esperanza de vida de los que lo padecen. Desafortunadamente, el insomnio suele pasar desapercibido o no tratarse, lo cual contribuye al empeoramiento de condiciones médicas y psiquiátricas. Esto se acentúa más en los adultos mayores, grupo por demás vulnerable. En relación con el tratamiento se recomienda aplicar la siguiente combinación: 1) la búsqueda y el manejo de causas secundarias de insomnio, 2) alguna terapia no farmacológica que incluya medidas de higiene del sueño, 3) tratamiento farmacológico. No es recomendable comenzar el tratamiento con un hipnótico sin haber descartado fármacos o enfermedades que provoquen o exacerben este padecimiento. Tampoco se recomienda el uso de neurolépticos, melatonina, antihistamínicos o benzodiacepinas de vida media larga. Las consecuencias incluyen limitación en las actividades de la vida diaria, pérdida de la funcionalidad, deterioro en la calidad de vida, incremento en la morbimortalidad, además del empeoramiento de las condiciones crónicas prexistentes.",

O bruxismo e classificado como primario ou secundario. O bruxismo primario nao esta relacionado a nenhuma causa evidente, com evolucao a partir do seu aparecimento na infância ou adolescencia para a idade adulta. Ja o bruxismo secundario esta associado com transtornos neurologicos, como na doenca de Parkinson; psiquiatrico, nos casos de depressao; outros transtornos do sono, como a apneia; e uso de drogas, como as anfetaminas. O diagnostico do bruxismo e baseado no relato de ranger de dentes ocorrido durante o sono associado a dor ou tensao nos musculos da face ao acordar. O desgaste anormal dos dentes e a hipertrofia do masseter sao sinais que ajudam no diagnostico. Nao existe tratamento especifico ou cura para o bruxismo do sono. Uma assistencia multiprofissional pode propor diferentes linhas de tratamentos: tratamentos farmacologicos, psicologicos e odontologicos. O tratamento odontologico para o bruxismo e baseado nos ajustes oclusais, restauracao da superficie dentaria, tratamento ortodontico e placas oclusais miorrelaxantes. Objetivos: Explanar sobre o bruxismo do sono e suas complicacoes no sistema estomatognatico. Metodo: Foi realizada uma busca de artigos nacionais e internacionais nas bases de dados Pubmed, Scielo e Google Scholar entre os anos 2012 a 2018 que usaram como descritores as palavras: Bruxismo e bruxismo do sono. Conclusao: O bruxismo do sono ocorre em atividades nao funcionais do sistema estomatognatico e e reconhecido como uma parafuncao do sistema mastigatorio. O aumento de forcas proporcionado pelo bruxismo leva a cargas extras em todo o sistema estomatognatico, sendo que, como possivel resultado dessa situacao, ocorram danos a articulacao temporomandibular (ATM), musculos, periodonto e oclusao. Portanto, cabe ao cirurgiao-dentista conhecer o tema e identificar essa situacao em pacientes para que se recomende o tratamento mais efetivo em cada um deles. Mesmo com o avanco dos estudos acerca do tema, e possivel apenas minimizar seus efeitos deleterios, nao sendo capaz de evitar ou paralisar o bruxismo, mas entende-se que alguns fatores diminuem sua intensidade, enquanto outros a aumentam. Todavia, existe uma dificuldade de compreensao e controle desta parafuncao devido a sua multifatoriedade.",

      "title": "Medications and Their Effects on Sleep",
      "abstract": "Abstract Many medications affect the central nervous system (CNS) and can alter the patterns of sleep and wakefulness. Others can induce sleep disorders (eg, nightmares, periodic limb movements of sleep or restless legs syndrome) or exacerbate them (eg, obstructive sleep apnea). Some agents can cause both insomnia and excessive sleepiness in different individuals, or in the same individual under different circumstances. These can be a primary therapeutic effect of the drug, a withdrawal effect, or an adverse reaction. Each medication possesses class and agent-specific effects on sleep. Alcohol’s effect on arousal and sleep is biphasic. Alcohol has both stimulatory effects (at low doses and on the rising phase of alcohol levels) and sedative effects (at high doses and on the falling phase of alcohol levels). Metabolism of alcohol occurs at a constant rate of 10 to 20 mg/dl per hour. Alcohol’s sedating effect can be additive with other agents such as benzodiazepines. Acute ingestion decreases sleep latency, increases non–rapid eye movement (NREM) stages 3 and 4 sleep, and reduces rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the first half of the sleep period (Table 16–1). It is metabolized quickly, and alcohol causes a rebound increase in the frequency of arousals and awakenings and an increase in REM sleep during the second part of the night. Nightmares and vivid dreams can occur. In addition, alcohol ingestion can cause worsening of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea by increasing upper airway resistance due to a decrease in pharyngeal dilator muscle tone.",

Unter Verhaltensstörungen oder „nicht-kognitiven Störungen” der Demenz versteht man ein weites Spektrum von Verhaltensweisen und Symptomen, die einerseits organisch durch die der Demenzerkrankung zugrunde liegende Schädigung des Gehirns bedingt sind, andererseits gut einfühlbare Reaktionen auf das Nachlassen der Gedächtnisleistung und der kognitiven Leistungsfähigkeit darstellen. Diese Verhaltensstörungen treten häufig bereits in frühen Stadien des Krankheitsverlaufs auf, noch bevor sich ausgeprägte Gedächtnisstörungen oder Störungen der Alltagskompetenz zeigen. Es sind vor allem sozialer Rückzug, Angst, Affektlabilität und Depressivität, aber auch Reizbarkeit, Impulsivität, Misstrauen oder Aggressivität. Es kann auch zu deliranten Episoden, ausgeprägten Verwirrtheitszuständen mit Desorientiertheit, Verkennungen und Wahnideen kommen.",

      "title": "RERE-Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics RERE-related disorders are characterized by neurodevelopmental problems with or without structural anomalies of the eyes, heart, kidneys, and genitourinary tract and mild sensorineural hearing loss. Hypotonia and feeding problems are common among affected individuals. Developmental delay and intellectual disability range from mild to profound. Behavior problems may include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, self-injurious behavior, and autism spectrum disorder. A variety of eye anomalies (coloboma, optic nerve anomalies, microphthalmia, and/or Peter's anomaly) and vision issues (myopia, anisometropia, astigmatism, exotropia, esotropia) have been reported. Congenital heart defects, most commonly septal defects, have also been described. Genitourinary abnormalities include vesicoureteral reflux, and cryptorchidism and hypospadias in males. Sensorineural hearing loss can be unilateral or bilateral. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of RERE-related disorders is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in RERE by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Feeding difficulties may require the use of feeding therapy and/or thickened liquids; in severe cases, a nasogastric or gastrostomy tube may be considered. Seizure disorders, abnormal vision and/or strabismus, hearing loss, congenital heart defects, gastroesophageal reflux, genitourinary anomalies, scoliosis, congenital hip dysplasia, developmental delay, and behavioral problems are treated in the standard manner. Surveillance: At least annual monitoring of developmental progress / educational needs and for scoliosis (until growth is complete). Annual (or as clinically indicated) ophthalmologic and audiologic evaluations. Routine follow up with a cardiologist and a urologist, as indicated for those who have anomalies involving these organ systems. Monitoring of seizure activity and behavioral issues as needed. Genetic counseling RERE-related disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and are typically caused by a de novo pathogenic variant. If the RERE pathogenic variant identified in the proband is not identified in one of the parents, the risk to sibs is low (~1%) but greater than that of the general population because of the possibility of parental germline mosaicism for the pathogenic variant. Once the RERE pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

Njegovi simptomi mogu se odraziti na govornom, psihičkom, fiziološkom i socijalnom planu. Neurogeno mucanje, kao stečeni oblik mucanja, rjeđe je i manje poznato područje, čije netečnosti nastaju kao posljedica oštećenja mozga, s moždanim udarom kao najčešćim uzrokom. Cilj ovog rada je, na osnovi novije literature, dati uvid u poznate etiološke čimbenike, simptomatologiju, diferencijalnu dijagnostiku te trenutne metode intervencije kod neurogenog mucanja. Mehanizam nastanka nije u potpunosti razjašnjen, ali brojni autori potvrđuju ulogu oštećenja bazalnih ganglija kod pojave mucanja. Često koegzistira s poremećajima poput afazije i motoričkih govornih poremećaja - dizartrije, apraksije i palilalije - što dodatno otežava dijagnostiku. Osim teškoća prilikom diferencijalne dijagnostike, zbog prisutnosti drugih poremećaja ima nesuglasica prilikom diferenciranja tipova mucanja, s obzirom na mišljenje da uočljivi simptomi nisu dovoljan distinktivni kriterij. U terapiji mucanja najčešće se primjenjuju bihevioralne metode, dok su lijekovi prisutni u manjoj mjeri zbog nuspojava i mogućnosti zlouporabe. Za detaljnije objašnjenje navedenog poremećaja potrebna su dalja istraživanja.",

      "abstract": "A drug can be defined as a substance other than food which may affect the constitution or function of a living thing through its chemical properties. In this sense, it may be possible to place organic solvents like bond, gas or thinner and narcotics like marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine or heroine under the category of drugs. These drugs are characteristic of having positive medicinal as well as side effects upon human being including but not limited to excitement, hallucinatory image, auditory hallucination, relaxation, sleeping, anorexia, nerve stability, schizophrenia, anaesthesia, brain damage, narcissism, etc. Abuse of drugs, however, would result in direct and indirect impact upon the society, family and industry as a whole by ruining of families, unemployment, loss of manpower, and catastrophic damage of physical and mental health of all people. Strong cling to drugs could also cause devastation of personality by abandoning relationship with family members and friends and even jobs, hobbies and culture and would eventually make addicts unsociable. Furthermore, abuse of drugs could be a cause for more serious phenomenon of social pathology such as drastic increase of inhuman violent crimes, crimes without specific motives, frequent burglary and theft to raise the money to buy drugs with. In contrast with the global trend to enforce the regulations for drug-related crimes, the Korean judiciary authorities keep on dealing leniently with offenders, especially when they are first timers, by only charging the fine not exceeding 50 million Won. To put use of drugs under control, it seems more effective to install and operate facilities which are dedicated to providing supports for drug addicts to get free from the cycle of crimes and return to the society. In sum, it would be extremely important to study the measures needed to prevent occurrence of drug-related crimes because the issue of addiction can not　rely on legal punishments alone. The legal system that imposes heavy penalty upon drug-related crimes may be effective to a certain extent in terms of crime prevention but has limit in itself. It is therefore most imperative to respond in a more active way to prevention of drug-related crimes by introducing the educational programs for drug addiction, by training experts who can treat drug addicts, not to speak of working out preventive measures from the perspective of criminal legislation and socio-cultural aspects as well.",

      "title": "FETAL ALCOHOL SPECTRUM DISORDERS",
      "abstract": "\"Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders\" is a collective term that describes the continuum of disabilities, from mild to severe, accompanying the teratogenic effects of ethanol on the developing fetus. At the severe end of the spectrum is the subset of individuals with growth restriction, a distinctive pattern of facial dysmorphology, and cognitive and/or neurobehavioral effects (fetal alcohol syndrome), and at the mild end of the spectrum are those individuals with neurobehavioral and cognitive deficits who exhibit minimal or no growth or physical stigmata (alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder). Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the leading cause of preventable developmental disabilities in the world. They occur much more commonly than previously recognized, with prevalence estimates from prospective school-based studies in the United States of 11.3–50.0 per 1000 children (~1–5%), and rates in special populations, such as the foster care system, as high as 169 per 1000 (~17%). An earlier diagnosis is associated with a better outcome and provides an opportunity to prevent the birth of another affected child in the family. Diagnosis, intervention, and prevention offer some of the greatest challenges to health care providers, families and their communities. Multidisciplinary diagnostic teams are available throughout North America and other parts of the world and can provide accurate and comprehensive assessments and management options for affected individuals. In this chapter, we discuss the evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of children and adults with this common range of disabilities.",

Recently this author has encountered a hitherto unnamed disorder which he calls the Blueberry syndrome, and which shares some features with autism, childhood psychosis and mental retardation, but also differs significantly from all of these. Its principal manifestations are lack of speech, low frustration tolerance, and aggressive response to invasion of personal space. Onset follows a normal pre- and perinatal period, with no evidence of brain damage or emotional disorder. There is mental retardation secondary to language deficits, but no social withdrawal, overwhelming anxiety, or obsessive need for sameness. The children come from the lower socioeconomic strata and from either intact or broken families. Etiology is unknown but may involve genetic mutations affecting development of the cerebral speech area. Treatment focuses on improving present satisfactions and functioning.",

      "title": "Aboulia: Where there is a will there is a way",
      "abstract": "Guest editor's notes: The differential diagnosis of aphasia can be described from two directions-(a) when aphasia is not present but is erroneously diagnosed. (b) when aphasia is present, but the diagnosis is missed. There are multiple examples both ways. This Letter describe one example of type (a) error. Sir, Akinetic Mutism, apathy, Aboulia describe diminished motivation relating to decreased expression of a behaviour[1] which can be in the form of motor or speech behaviour. Abulia is a syndrome of hypofunction which is characterized by lack of initiative, spontaneity and drive, apathy, slowness of thought (bradyphrenia), and blunting of emotional responses and response to external stimuli.[2] Distinguishing aboulia from inability to perform an activity due to cognitive, linguistic or physical disabilities[2] is important as it interferes with the diagnosis and management of the neurological population. Aetiology may be vascular, trauma, tumour, degeneration, drug-induced, Dementia, Fronto-temporal dementia, Anterior Cerebral Artery Infarctions, and disorders of the right hemisphere such as stroke and white matter diseases.[3] GR, a 43-year-old female, reported to the Neuroemergency care in March 2020 with complaints of continuous throbbing intense headache for 3 days. She became withdrawn, drowsy most of the day with minimal monosyllabic appropriate utterances. No known comorbidities. On examination, she was apathetic, dull, no aphasia or dysarthria, subtle pyramidal signs on the right with no evident signs of meningeal irritation. MRI of the brain [Fig 1a and b] with MRA and MRV showed acute thrombosis of deep cerebral venous sinus indicating Venous Infarct. Medical management was initiated with anticoagulants and anti-oedema measures followed by the endovascular intervention.Figure 1: (a) DWI MRI showing Bilateral Thalami, left Basal Ganglia restricted diffusion indicating an Acute Infarct. (b) T2 FLAIR Sagittal and Axial MRI – Hyperintensity in left Basal Ganglia and Bilateral Thalamus indicating oedema. (c) Anterior Cingulate Circuit for volitional behaviour[1]Subsequently, a detailed cognitive, speech, language and swallowing evaluation by Speech Language Pathologist (SLP) noted adequate consciousness, alertness, orientation to space and person and the right upper and lower limb weakness with reduced facial expressions. Oral mechanism examination with gag and velar elevation was normal. Cranial nerves for speech, hearing and swallowing were normal clinically. Language assessment using Modified Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) in the first language Tamil indicated her responses were slow, elicited with repeated questioning, and constant reminders to focus, paucity of spontaneous speech, slowness of thought, limited verbal fluency to single-word or two-word phrases with increased response time and preserved reading skills. Impaired writing due to right-sided weakness. Visual Neglect and Agnosia was ruled out. Speech was slow, monotonous with normal articulation, hypophonic with a breathy voice, and normal nasalance. Grade 1 (G-1, R-0, B-3, A-0, S-0) indicated Mild Dysphonia. Maximum phonation time could not be recorded, while cough efforts were strong. Bedside swallow evaluation was normal and was gradually started on oral feeds. VLS by ENT for persistent dysphonia with odynophagia indicated normal larynx and laryngopharynx. No prior history of anger burst out, depression or anxiety was reported. On follow-up, she was passive, poorly participating in conversations. She was unable to complete Mini Mental State Examination. A score of 4 on modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was given. Prior to admission, GR was a happy homemaker. Speech and Language evaluation was not conclusive of an apparent significant linguistic, cognitive or speech deficit. Although Dysarthria was ruled out, her voicing efforts were inadequate for verbal communication. Bradyphrenia and reduced spontaneous motor movements were conclusive of an extrapyramidal disorder. The finding of apathy was eliminated with a detailed evaluation which denoted aboulia. The lack of spontaneity and volitional behaviours is linked to the neural network that consists of the Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC), Supplementary Motor Area (SMA), Thalamus and Basal Ganglia with Dopamine as an important neurotransmitter.[4] However, aboulia may also be caused by subcortical lesions of the anterior thalamus,[4] caudate nucleus,[56] globus pallidus, internal capsule, frontal lobes,[4] Progressive Supra Nuclear Palsy (PSP).[4] Functional localization of aboulia involve disruptions in the network. Reciprocal connections with cingulate gyrus, other limbic structures and frontal cortex provide an interface between the decision-making process and the emotions. The connection between motivation and action is governed by the limbic striatopallidal connections. These are derived from the concepts of observation that the amygdala and hippocampal formation has afferent connections with limbic striatopallidal and projects to the rest of the basal ganglia in turn involved in eliciting and forming motor performances.[1] [Figure 1c] The diagnosis is done clinically. In Fisher's “Telephone test” the patient thought to respond better over a telephonic conversation than face to face.[2] [Table 1] Table 1: Common Clinical Features of Abulia considered based on the factor analysis[4]The clinical presentation of aboulia as a communication disorder is under reported and often ignored by clinicians skilled in diagnosing and rehabilitating linguistic, cognitive and communication disorders. Cerebral dysfunction such as delirium, language disorder such as Aphasia, mood disorder such as depression may co-exist in several conditions. Aphasias in subcortical strokes are presumably less. Since aboulia is commonly seen in subcortical involvement, clinicians should look for distinguishing aboulia from other disorders especially Aphasia. Primary care providers (PCPs) such as neurologists may be focused on motor recovery, which could be hindered due to an underlying unattended cause such as Aboulia presenting as a barrier to recovery in a patient, otherwise misdiagnosed as post stroke depression (25%-50%).[1] Dysfunction in a region out of the area of a lesion can occur in regions that are connected functionally (Diaschisis). A comprehensive Neurological, Neurocognitive and Language examination is of great clinical value in identifying, quantifying and treating Aboulia. A more commonly seen Parkinson's disease can cause aboulia.[37] Due to poor initiation and varied presentation, people with aboulia may even suffer from malnutrition and dehydration.[27] This state of diminished motivation can be partially or completely reversed with appropriate medical management and rehabilitation. Dopamine agonists have been stated effective in Aboulia.[89] Direct or indirect damage to the circuit that controls voluntary behaviours can present in the form of a communication disorder which is non-classical of aphasia, dysarthria or cognitive-communication disorder. Also, the disparity in the severity of a disorder and their speed of motor, language recovery may be additionally dependent on this factor. PCPs should involve Rehabilitation specialists such as SLPs playing a critical role in the evaluation and management of such complex patients and in turn help improve their quality of life. Since the management is complex and long term, involvement of multidisciplinary team of experts helped GR gradually progress to an mRS score of 1 with appropriate medical management and cognitive rehabilitation.

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics BCL11A-related intellectual disability (BCL11A-ID) is characterized by developmental delay / intellectual disability of variable degree, neonatal hypotonia, microcephaly, distinctive but variable facial characteristics, behavior problems, and asymptomatic persistence of fetal hemoglobin. Growth delay, seizures, and autism spectrum disorder have also been reported in some affected individuals. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of BCL11A-ID is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and laboratory findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in BCL11A identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is primarily supportive and dictated by symptoms. Standard antiepileptic medication for seizure disorder; standard treatment for abnormal vision and/or strabismus, sleep disturbance, scoliosis, joint laxity, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), constipation, and developmental issues. Surveillance: Assessment of growth parameters, feeding difficulties, GERD, constipation, scoliosis, developmental progress, and behavior at each visit. Monitor seizures as clinically indicated. Assessment of vision and eye alignment as needed. Genetic counseling BCL11A-ID is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; however, most affected individuals have the disorder as the result of a de novo BCL11A pathogenic variant. Once the BCL11A pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "title": "Sleep and the Athlete",
      "abstract": "Adequate sleep hygiene is increasingly recognized as a crucial part of athlete recovery, avoidance of overtraining or burnout, and optimization of health. Sleep impacts metabolic regulation and homeostasis and serves a vital restorative function (1). Sleep regulation occurs through an intrinsic sleep-wake cycle of optimal duration, coupled with a circadian rhythm that is influenced by environmental exposures, such as light and darkness. Other factors that affect sleep include exercise, diet/nutrition, supplements/stimulants, medications, travel, social/electronic media, and mental/physical health (2–4). In general, exercise favorably affects sleep quality and quantity (5). High-performance athletes, particularly adolescent and young adult athletes, are routinely exposed to greater physical, psychological, and neuromuscular stressors that require a delicate balance of recovery, including appropriate sleep (5). Athletes are at higher risk for sleep impairment for several reasons. Sleep deprivation is the most common sleep disorder, in general (6,7), and the frequency of both early morning and/or evening training sessions can decrease sleep duration, resulting in acute and cumulative sleep deprivation. A minimum of 7 h of sleep per day is ideal for optimal health in adults; adolescents require a minimum of 8 h of sleep per day (6,7) (Table). Traveling across time zones for competitions can have negative effects on circadian rhythms, particularly west to east travel. In general, it is prudent to allow at least 1 d for each time zone crossed for full resolution of jet lag symptoms (8,9). Additional studies have shown that between 50% and 80% of all athletes experience poor sleep quality during periods of heavy training and particularly on the nights before and after competition (5,10–12). Poor sleep quality and quantity can negatively affect cognitive and physical performance, perceived exertion, injury risk, and mental health (2–4). All of the above, along with increased pain, decreased task execution tolerance, and decreased cognitive and motor function (e.g., increased reaction times), are consistently correlated with increased injury risk in athletes (13–16). Daytime restorative napping, a common strategy that can reduce sleep debt, can improve short-term memory, alertness, and accuracy during reaction-time tests and should be incorporated, when necessary. Other sleep hygiene recommendations include maintaining consistent bedtimes, avoiding evening light exposure from technology and electronic devices, limiting caffeine intake, maintaining adequate hydration, and having a relaxation-focused bedtime routine (17,18).Table: National Sleep Foundation Sleep Duration Recommendations byAge (23).Athletes with mental health disorders and sport-related concussion (SRC) often display symptoms of disordered sleep. Sleep disturbance is a common complaint in concussed athletes with up to 50% reporting sleep-related issues, including insomnia, difficulty falling asleep, and impaired sleep quality. Sleep disturbance may hinder concussion recovery and can worsen psychiatric illness, memory, and social functioning (19). Unfortunately, inadequate sleep the night before neurocognitive concussion testing can lead to increased symptom scores, impeding return to play (20). Sleep quality and mental health impact each other (21). Sleep impairment can lead to increased stress, negative mood, and exacerbation of mental illnesses, such as anxiety or depression. Conversely, the presence of mental illness can cause sleep disturbances. Optimizing sleep appears to improve overall mental health (21,22). Compensatory strategies, restorative approaches, and cognitive rehabilitation should be incorporated into comprehensive treatment plans for SRC patients and athletes with mental health disorders. Good sleep hygiene that includes adequate sleep duration, quality, and timing appears to be a crucial factor in athlete health, performance, adaptation, recovery, and injury prevention. Athletes must increase their awareness of sleep importance and develop strategies to maintain proper sleep regulation throughout training and competition.",

      "abstract": "Participation in (paid) work is an important aspect of life. Work generates an income, leads to social contacts, may stimulate personal development, self esteem and identity. Work is generally good for health and well-being, provided the working conditions are alright. Musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) are a major cause of work disability. It is important for health professionals to realize that patients may not only suffer from pain and impairment but may also become work disabled, which has large consequenses. They should address work-related problems in their contacts with persons with MSD, to analyze the relation between work load and health condition. The work load may cause (or contribute to) symptoms and the course of the disorder. Conversely, the disorder may affect the work capacity, leading to reduced productivity (presenteeism) or sick leave (absenteeism). Modified work tasks, ergonomic improvements or use of supportive devices may decrease the job load; adequate clinical management of the disorder and graded activity interventions may improve the work capacity of the person. There is a lot of evidence on the management of work disability in low back pain; work disability in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis is increasingly getting attention in research and clinical practice. This session will present state of the art knowledge on this issue; participants will be invited to discuss possibilities and barriers for clinicians and researchers in preventing work disability in musculoskeletal disorders. <h3>Disclosure of Interest</h3> None declared",

      "title": "The Strategy of Clinical Procedure for Determining Brain Death",
      "abstract": "The various aspects of brain death have been subjects of close study by several professional committees, which have for the most part confirmed the 1968 guidelines and clinical protocols for determining that the brain is dead. The central considerations in the diagnosis of brain death are 1) absence of cerebral functions(unreceptivity and unresponsivity); 2) absence of brain stem functions including spontaneous respiration; 3) irreversibility of the state. To these is usually added evidence of catastrophic brain diseases. The absence of cerebral function is judged by the presence of deep coma and total lack of spontaneous movement and motor and vocal response to all visual, auditory, and cutaneous stimulation. The absence of brain stem function is judged by absence of spontaneous eye movements, midposition of the eye, and lack of response to oculocephalic and caloric (oculovestibular) testing; presence of dilated or midposition fixed pupils; paralysis of bulbar musculature(no facial movement or gag, cough, corneal, or sucking reflexes); absence of decerebrate responses to noxious stimuli; and absence of respiratory movements. As a final test of complete apnea, the patient can be disconnected from the respirator for a few minutes, allowing the PC02 to rise to 50 to 60 mmHg, as a stimulus to the medullary respiratory centers. The EEG provides confirmation of cerebral death, and most institutions still demand proof of electrocerebral silence, which be considered to be present if there is no electrical potential of more than 2 V during a 30-min recording. Other variable laboratory tests including cerebral angiography, isotope brain scan, transcranial Doppler, and evoked potential studies are occasionally performed as an ancillatory procedure when the results of the apnea test or the EEG are equivocal. The main difficulties that arise in relation to brain death are not the purely technical issues, but those involving the sensitive management of the family and other medical professionals. It is best not to embark on.",

      "title": "Psychological Responses to Sport Injury",
      "abstract": "In addition to the disruptive impact of sport injury on physical functioning, injury can have psychological effects on athletes. Consistent with contemporary models of psychological response to sport injury, aspects of psychological functioning that can be affected by sport injury include pain, cognition, emotion, and behavior. Part of the fabric of sport and ubiquitous even among “healthy” athletes, pain is a common consequence of sport injury. Postinjury pain is typically of the acute variety and can be exacerbated, at least temporarily, by surgery and some rehabilitation activities. Cognitive responses to sport injury include appraising the implications of the injury for one’s well-being and ability to manage the injury, making attributions for injury occurrence, using cognitive coping strategies, perceiving benefits of injury, and experiencing intrusive injury-related thoughts and images, increased perception of injury risk, reduced self-esteem and self-confidence, and diminished neurocognitive performance. Emotional responses to sport injury tend to progress from a preponderance of negative emotions (e.g., anger, confusion, depression, disappointment, fear, frustration) shortly after injury occurrence to a more positive emotional profile over the course of rehabilitation. A wide variety of personal and situational factors have been found to predict postinjury emotions. In terms of postinjury behavior, athletes have reported initiating coping strategies such as living their lives as normally as possible, distracting themselves, seeking social support, isolating themselves from others, learning about their injuries, adhering to the rehabilitation program, pursuing interests outside sport, consuming alcohol, taking recreational and/or performance-enhancing substances, and, in rare cases, attempting suicide. Psychological readiness to return to sport after injury is an emerging concept that cuts across cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses to sport injury.",

Only two closed head injury cases with focal contusions have been reported; we report two more, with diffuse damage and no focal signs. One patient's symptoms evolved soon after they were recognized. The other patient's unresponsiveness to spoken verbal stimuli persisted despite relatively preserved reading and speech, in a context of poor initiation and moderately severe cognitive impairment. Unrecognized, word deafness following head injury could lead to overestimation of coma duration if transient, and impede rehabilitation if chronic.",

      "abstract": "What is order, what is disorder? Consecution of temporal events and causality are normally regarded as prerequisites for understanding narratives. What happens when narratives become disorderly by violating the principles of consecution? One approach might be to look at narratives about disorder, or narratives where protagonists or narrators suffer from disorders. Amnesia, attention deficiencies, involuntary tics and compulsions (such as Tourette Syndrome symptoms), and other perception and communication related disorders, such as autism/Asperger's syndrome or certain forms of schizophrenia all pose challenges to narratives: interruptions, lacunae, disruptions, inversions, surpluses can all become narrative manifestations of these disorders. A proposition would be that by reading both fictional and non-fictional disorder narratives, we might gain insights into both the orders and disorders of brains and psyches and the workings of narratives as a medium of carrying meaning. keywords: Disorder, narrative, narratology, syndromes, Palahniuk, DeLillo, Haddon, Lethem, Goldberg, Lightman url: http://www.clas.ufl.edu/ipsa/journal/2006_soerensen01.shtml What is order, what is disorder? Consecution of temporal events (things happen in sequences which are easy to follow, flashbacks and -forwards are clearly marked, the end is marked as a specific type of event or closure, clearly distinct from beginnings and middles, etc.) and causality (cause precedes effect) are normally regarded as prerequisites for designing, following and understanding/interpreting narratives. But increasingly literary criticism has become interested in what happens when narratives become disorderly by violating the principles of consecution and causality. This paper continues this general research interest, but perhaps in a more context-fixated manner, rather like reinventing the wheel before one takes one's Corvette for a spin. . . One approach to the complex of interpreting narratives that violate schemata of consecution and causality might be, rather than fixating narrowly on plot, to look at narratives about disorder (theme/action), or narratives where protagonists or narrators suffer from disorders (character). Such disorders as amnesia, attention deficiencies, involuntary tics and compulsions (such as Tourette Syndrome symptoms), and other perception and communication related disorders, such as autism/Asperger's syndrome, and to some extent certain forms of schizophrenia and personality disorders all pose challenges to narratives: interruptions, lacunae, disruptions, inversions, surpluses can all become narrative and thematic manifestations of these disorders. Can non-sufferers of these disorders still decode such disturbed narratives? If so, why and how is that the case? Certainly I would claim that the increasing proliferation and popularity of those narratives must indicate an affirmative answer to those questions. Can we, then, maybe learn things from them that we cannot learn from more orderly narratives? A proposition would be that by reading both fictional and non-fictional disorder narratives, we might gain insights into both the orders and disorders of brains and psyches, and the workings of narratives as a medium of carrying meaning. This project has been an on-going concern of mine for some years now, as it offers a field of study that is both literary and cultural, as well as an in-road into the study of human psychology and its use of narratives as construction of self. It therefore suits my preferences for studying texts culturally and cultures in their textual manifestations. What I therefore wish to offer in this presentation is an initial charting of this terrain in its interdisciplinary form. It would be useful to have a history of disorder construction, both within the field of psychiatric and neurological diagnostics, and within the field of textual representation of such disorders. I cannot hope to give such an overview but I will give a sketch of some of the trends in such a double history and at least attempt to explain how we have come to the stage I claimed above that we find ourselves at, where a) there are more disorders than ever before and where b) certain cognitive implications of disorders seem to predominate over other, older symptom manifestations. …",

Intellectual error is identified as major cause of diseases and its role in the manifestation of psychosomatic diseases is well explained in Charaka Samhita. Smriti is the faculty of mind that plays an important role in perception of knowledge. It is one of the components of Pragya according to Ayurveda. It is the recalling capacity of the knowledge which is perceived by the brain from past experiences. The Smriti is determined by various factors like Prakriti, age, Ahara-vihara, repetition of events etc. The consideration of all the factors can provide better knowledge to improve smriti. If the person is not able to grasp or retain the present events or experiences, it is known as Smritivibhransha. Modern science considers various components of memory which includes recent &amp; past concentration, recalling, retention and recognition. Memory is the ability of an individual to record sensory stimuli, events, information, etc., retain them over short or long periods of time and recall the same at a later date when needed. Poor memory, lower retention and slow recall are common problems in today’s stressful life. Age, faulty diet, stress, emotions and other factors may lead mild cognitive impairment to memory loss. Ayurvedic science deals with various Herbo-mineral preparations &amp; procedures mentioned for excellence of memory. Key words: Smriti, Smritivibhransha, memory, Pragya, Ayurveda protocols.",

Examples given include circadian sleep–wake cycle disorders (such as the delayed sleep phase syndrome), obstructive sleep apnoea, narcolepsy, Kleine–Levin syndrome, sleep paralysis and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder.

Recent research points to the existence of functional subcortical-prefrontal circuits which regulate human behaviour. There is a link between subcortical dementia and functional or structural break of one or more cortical-subcortical connections.

      "title": "Non-Vocational Health-Related Correlates of Quality of Life for Older Adults Living with Multiple Sclerosis",
      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the most common neurological diseases in the world, affecting an estimated 2.3 million people worldwide, and 450,000 persons in the US (National Multiple Sclerosis Society [NMSS], 2014; Multiple Sclerosis Coalition, 2014). MS is a chronic demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), primarily affecting the brain and the spinal cord (Fraser, Kraft, Ehde, & Johnson, 2006). Although the etiology and mechanisms of the disease process are not yet fully understood, MS involves an autoimmune process that results in myelin deterioration and the development of CNS lesions or plaques. The cumulative effect on neural transmission can affect virtually every physical, sensory, mental, and emotional activity (Schapiro, 2003). The broad range of potential MS symptoms includes weakness, spasticity, sensory loss, pain, bladder and bowel problems, sexual dysfunction, cognitive impairment, mood disorders, visual abnormalities, fatigue, and others (Minden, Frankel, Hadden, Srinath, & Perloff, 2004). People with MS have frequently been found to report lower quality of life (QOL) than persons without disabilities and, in some studies, lower than persons with other chronic illnesses, including rheumatoid arthritis, epilepsy, and diabetes (Benito-Leon, Morales, Rivera-Navarro, & Mitchell, 2003; Pfennings, Van der Ploeg, Cohen, Bramsen, Polman, & Lankhorst, 1999; Rumrill, Roessler, & Fitzgerald, 2004; Sprangers et al., 2000). As QOL has increasingly become recognized as an important clinical and rehabilitation outcome, understanding the mechanisms by which MS affects QOL and psychosocial well-being has received increased research attention (Bishop, Stenhoff, & Shepard, 2007; Johnson, Amtmann, Yorkston, Klasner, & Kuehn, 2004). This growing body of research has clearly established that the impact of MS on QOL involves a complex interaction of physical, psychological, social, and environmental variables (Bishop, Rumrill, & Roessler, in press; Ghaem & Haghighi, 2008; Goksel et al., 2011; McReynolds & Koch, 2001; Rumrill et al., 2004; Schwartz & Frohner, 2005). Although QOL among persons with MS has received increased research attention in the past 15 years, the experience of older adults with MS has been essentially overlooked in this research. There is, however, good reason to expect that the experience of living with MS changes considerably as people age, and that the psychosocial and disease-related influences of MS on QOL may be experienced differently among older adults. There is a well-established relationship between duration of MS and increased disability (e.g., Minden et al., 2004), such that older Americans with MS can be expected to face more significant physical and cognitive limitations, mobility restrictions, and social isolation than younger adults with a shorter duration of the disease. In a recent national survey of more than 5,000 adults with MS in the United States, persons over the age of 50 were significantly more likely than younger adults to have fallen or been injured, to have been hospitalized related to their MS, to have been referred to an assisted living or long-term care facility, and to have experienced significant cognitive limitations in the prior two years. Further, persons over age 50 were significantly more likely to state that they are limited in their homes because their residence did not meet their accessibility needs (Bishop et al., 2013). As suggested by Minden et al. (2004), the large and rapidly expanding proportion of older adults in the US population includes a growing number of people living with MS. Improved understanding of the impact of QOL on older Americans with MS is, therefore, a critical and urgent matter for health care and human service professionals working with people with MS and their families. Age, MS, and Employment Although MS can occur at any age, initial symptoms are most often evident during early adulthood, typically between the ages of 20 and 40 (Krause, Kern, Horntrich, & Ziemssen, 2013; Schapiro, 2003), when individuals are in the most active phase of career development (Hartung, 2013). …",

      "title": "Digital dementia in the internet generation: excessive screen time during brain development will increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias in adulthood",
      "abstract": "Converging evidence from biopsychosocial research in humans and animals demonstrates that chronic sensory stimulation (via excessive screen exposure) affects brain development increasing the risk of cognitive, emotional, and behavioural disorders in adolescents and young adults. Emerging evidence suggests that some of these effects are similar to those seen in adults with symptoms of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the early stages of dementia, including impaired concentration, orientation, acquisition of recent memories (anterograde amnesia), recall of past memories (retrograde amnesia), social functioning, and self-care. Excessive screen time is known to alter gray matter and white volumes in the brain, increase the risk of mental disorders, and impair acquisition of memories and learning which are known risk factors for dementia. Chronic sensory overstimulation (i.e., excessive screen time) during brain development increases the risk of accelerated neurodegeneration in adulthood (i.e., amnesia, early onset dementia). This relationship is affected by several mediating/moderating factors (e.g., IQ decline, learning impairments and mental illness). We hypothesize that excessive screen exposure during critical periods of development in Generation Z will lead to mild cognitive impairments in early to middle adulthood resulting in substantially increased rates of early onset dementia in later adulthood. We predict that from 2060 to 2100, the rates of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) will increase significantly, far above the Centres for Disease Control (CDC) projected estimates of a two-fold increase, to upwards of a four-to-six-fold increase. The CDC estimates are based entirely on factors related to the age, sex, race and ethnicity of individuals born before 1950 who did not have access to mobile digital technology during critical periods of brain development. Compared to previous generations, the average 17–19-year-old spends approximately 6 hours a day on mobile digital devices (MDD) (smartphones, tablets, and laptop computers) whereas individuals born before 1950 at the same age spent zero. Our estimates include the documented effects of excessive screen time on individuals born after 1980, Millennials and Generation Z, who will be the majority of individuals ≥65 years old. An estimated 4-to-6-fold increase in rates of ADRD post-2060 will result in widespread societal and economic distress and the complete collapse of already overburdened healthcare systems in developed countries. Preventative measures must be set in place immediately including investments and interventions in public education, social policy, laws, and healthcare.",

      "title": "Insomnia in peri-menopausal and post-menopausal women and in some somatic diseases",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is becoming increasingly common in modern society and leads to significant issues for people’s health and well-being. Sex differences in sleep begin at an early age and continue throughout life. At the same time, women report poorer sleep quality and have higher risk for insomnia than men. Some studies show that men and women differ in their neurohormonal secretion, biological processes, and brain morphology. A significant number of women experience sleep difficulties in the approach to menopause and beyond, with the most common symptoms being difficulty in initiating sleep, short sleep duration, and poor sleep quality. The aetiology of sleep disorders in postmenopausal women isn’t yet still clear and seems to be different according to the specific symptoms of sleep disorder. However, potential factors include menopause itself, ageing, vasomotor symptoms, depression, anxiety, and many other diseases such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and psychosocial factors. Insomnia may occur alone or with other medical or mental health conditions. If left untreated, it may increase the risk for developing and worsening any of these conditions. Menopause is often associated with elevated risks of cardiovascular diseases. Insomnia is considered as an established risk factor for myocardial infarction, including in women. Sex differences have been detected in studies of sleep problems, with significant associations in women with regard to hypertension, the prevalence of dyslipidaemia, obesity, and diabetes. Diagnosis of insomnia is largely based on skilled history taking. Insomnia treatment is based on two strategies that may be used isolatedly or in combination: cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia and pharmacological treatment.",

      "title": "Synaptic and Neuroglial Pathobiology in Acute and Chronic Neurological Disorders",
      "abstract": "Pathology at the molecular and cellular level is the fundamental basis of disorders that effect the brain or spinal cord of humans. A pathophysiological event can target specific molecules and groups of cells, causing neuronal dysfunction and degeneration and resulting in acute and chronic neurological and behavioral disabilities ranging from memory loss to paralysis. For example, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with loss of forebrain neurons and the formation of brain lesions consisting of abnormal deposits of glial- or -neuronal generated amyloid β protein, possibly in response to gene mutations, synaptic perturbations, oxidative stress, or neuronal cytoskeletal defects (1–5). The degeneration of motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is associated with impairments in glutamate reuptake by astroglia (6,7), gene mutations in superoxide dismutase- 1 (8), and abnormal apoptosis of motor neurons that appears to be mediated by programmed cell death mechanisms (9,10). The nerve cell damage in adults and children that have experienced cardiac arrest, asphyxiation, strokes, and head or spinal cord trauma may be caused by failure of astroglial glutamate transport, excessive stimulation of glutamate receptors, abnormal activation or impaired function of intracellular signaling pathways, toxic generation of free oxygen radicals, and structural damage to target molecules within selectively vulnerable populations of neurons (11). Epidemiological studies reveal the impact that neurodegenerative disorders have on our society. For example, AD affects ~4 million adults (most are>65-yr-of-age) and is the fourth-leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for>100,000 deaths annually (12). ALS affects approx 30,000 Americans (4–6 people in 100,000) (13). Stroke is the third leading cause of death in industrialized populations and is a major cause of long term neurological disability (14).",

Severe mental retardation is a unique feature of the syndrome, together with microbrachycephaly and abnormal electroencephalographic findings with or without clinical seizures. The patients cannot speak or at most, they have a vocabulary consisting only of a few words. The genetic abnormality of AS has been located on chromosome 15q11-q13. Patients with AS mostly have deletions on the maternally derived allele (75–80%) while some of them show paternal uniparental disomy (~2%) or a rare imprinting mutation developmental disorder caused by deletion of the maternally-inherited chromosome 15q11–13. A 2.5-year-old girl is presented. Clinical suspicion of AS was raised at the age of 27 months when she presented with mental retardation and epilepsy, absence of speech, inability to gait and paroxysmal episodes of laughter. Moreover, she had facial dysmorphic features such as microbrachycephaly, mid-facial hypoplasia, macrostomia and a prominent mandible.

      "abstract": "Introduction. Parkinson?s disease belongs to the group of extrapyramidal neurodegenerative diseases and occurs as a consequence of the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the mesencephalon. Persons with Parkinson?s disease may experience a wide range of motor and non-motor symptoms. Material and Methods. A literature search was conducted using electronic databases on the Internet and electronic databases of Serbian libraries. Results. Speech disorders in Parkinson?s disease are classified in the group of hypokinetic dysarthria. Empirical data show that the basic characteristics of dysarthria in people with Parkinson?s disease are changes in voice quality, difficulties in articulating consonants, abnormalities in vowel production, monotonous speech, changes in speech rate, rough and breathy voice, increased voice nasality, reduced intensity of voice, involuntary pauses during speech, and palilalia. Methods used in the assessment of speech disorders include perceptual voice analysis, such as the overall dysphonia Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, Strain and Consensus Auditory Perceptual Evaluation of Voice scales, acoustic voice analysis (e.g., Multi-Dimensional Voice Program), and voice quality self-assessment methods (e.g., Voice Handicap Index and the Dysarthria Impact Profile). In the treatment of dysarthria, various behavioral methods of speech therapy are used, among which the Lee Silverman method is particularly important. Conclusion. Speech disorders in Parkinson?s disease manifest as altered patterns of respiration, phonation, resonance, articulation and prosody. The best results in the treatment are achieved by combination of medical, surgical, and behavioral therapy, through the cooperation of experts of different profiles as well as with family members of the patient.",

Parapsychological (psi) research also indicates that when individuals are exposed to techniques to alter the state of consciousness such as sensory homogenization, meditation, hypnosis, and psychedelic drugs, they exhibit stronger evidence of psi functioning than when they are in ordinary waking consciousness, particularly if they are prone to having spontaneous alterations of consciousness and/or have had a mental practice for a long time.

      "abstract": "Objectives: Electrical status epilepticus during sleep (ESES) is a type of EEG pattern seen in children with childhood-onset epileptic seizures and cognitive, language and motor regression. ESES has been associated with different etiologies, with or without structural abnormalities of the brain. To replace the term “ESES”, the recent Position Paper of the ILAE Taskforce on Nosology and Definitions introduced the term Epileptic Encephalopathy with Spike-Wave Activity during Sleep (EE-SWAS), which represents an activation of epileptiform activity, typically 1.5-2.5 Hz during NREM sleep, in a previously normal child and leads to cognitive and motor regression. Pathogenic variants in the TRIO gene are associated with autosomal dominant mental retardation type 44 (MRD44), which is characterized by mildly delayed global development resulting in variable intellectual deficits, learning difficulties, and variable dysmorphic features mostly represented by facial asymmetry, microcephaly, abnormalities of the fingers, and dental anomalies. Materials and methods: We present the case of a 13-year-old girl with onset of atonic seizures at the age of 3 who had undergone different types of antiepileptic drug (AED) therapies and was seizure-free 4 years later. She had an acquired impaired cognitive status as well as hemimegalencephaly, multiple hypopigmented patches on her legs and a large patch of hypopigmentation on the left side of her face extending towards the scalp (Becker’s nevus), dental anomalies (gingival hyperplasia, ogival palate), periventricular gliosis and electroencephalographic and (EEG) findings consistent with SWAS. Outcomes: Genetic testing confirmed a heterozygous variant of uncertain significance (VUS) of the TRIO gene, possibly associated with autosomal dominant MRD44. Although our patient presented with some phenotypic similarities to MRD44, her cognitive impairment improved with control of the SWAS pattern and AED adjustments. Conclusion: Association of structural anomalies of white matter, hemimegalencephaly, and encephalopathy with SWAS and a VUS mutation of the TRIO gene might suggest a different genetic neurocutaneous syndrome altogether.",

Unlike the incidence of Alzheimer's disease, which increases with age, frontotemporal dementia only rarely begins after the age of 75 and more often affects people in midlife. Based on consensus guidelines, three distinct clinical entities can be distinguished in frontotemporal dementia: frontotemporal dementia per se, primary progressive aphasia and semantic dementia. The core clinical phenotype of frontotemporal dementia per se consists of gradual and progressive changes in behaviour. The most common presentation is an early change in social behaviour and personal conduct, often associated with lack of inhibition, resulting in impulsive or inappropriate behaviour. In primary progressive aphasia, patients present with troubles in the expression of language, marked by problems using the correct word but with well-preserved understanding of word meaning. With progression of the disease, less and less language is used until the patient is virtually mute (non fluent aphasia). In semantic dementia, patients present with problems naming and understanding word meaning in the context of fluent, effortless and grammatically correct speech output (fluent aphasia). Both types of language disturbance occur in the setting of relative preservation of other cognitive domains, such as memory. All FTD patients have in common a circumscribed cortical atrophy of the frontal and/or the anterior temporal lobes although variations in the anatomical distribution of the pathology largely determine the associated clinical syndromes just mentioned. Pathologically, Pick's disease, corticobasal degeneration and familial frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) have been reported as the histological substrate of frontotemporal dementia. However, dementia of the frontal type and the motor neuron disease inclusion dementia (MNDID) are the most frequent neuropathological subtypes of frontotemporal dementia. Both are characterised by neuronal loss, astrocytic gliosis, laminar spongiosis affecting cortical laminae I-III and, in some cases, by an astrocytic gliosis and a cell loss in the striatum, the thalamus and the substantia nigra. Motor neuron disease inclusion dementia is further defined by the presence of characteristic ubiquitin-containing intracytoplasmic inclusions in granule cells of the dentate gyrus and in the cell somata and neurites of superficial neocortical neurons. By immunohistochemistry, these inclusions are found to react with anti-ubiquitin antibodies but not with antibodies to tau protein. However, the nature of the associated protein accumulating with ubiquitin in this disorder remains elusive. The recent finding of familial cases of frontotemporal dementia with ubiquitin-positive but tau-negative neuronal inclusions suggests that there might be a genetic background to this type of pathological process. In contrast to dementia of the frontal type and to motor neuron disease inclusion dementia, Pick's disease, corticobasal degeneration and FTDP-17 are characterised by abundant filamentous nerve cell inclusions made of the microtubule-associated protein tau.",

      "abstract": "Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a focal neurodegeneration of the brain affecting the language network. Patients can have isolated language impairment for years without impairment in other areas. PPA is classified as primary progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), semantic dementia (SD), and logopenic aphasia, which have distinct patterns of atrophy on neuroimaging. PNFA and SD are included under frontotemporal lobar degenerations. PNFA patients have effortful speech with agrammatism, which is frequently associated with apraxia of speech and demonstrate atrophy in the left Broca's area and surrounding region on neuroimaging. Patients with SD have dysnomia with loss of word and object (or face) meaning with asymmetric anterior temporal lobe atrophy. Logopenic aphasics have word finding difficulties with frequent pauses in conversation, intact grammar, and word comprehension but impaired repetition for sentences. The atrophy is predominantly in the left posterior temporal and inferior parietal regions. Recent studies have described several progranulin mutations on chromosome 17 in PNFA. The three clinical syndromes have a less robust relationship to the underlying pathology, which is heterogeneous and includes tauopathy, ubiquitinopathy, Pick's disease, corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, and Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies, however, seem to indicate that a better characterization of the clinical phenotype (apraxic, agrammatic, semantic, logopenic, jargon) increases the predictive value of the underlying pathology. Substantial advances have been made in our understanding of PPAs but developing new biomarkers is essential in making accurate causative diagnoses in individual patients. This is critically important in the development and evaluation of disease-modifying drugs.",

      "title": "AGMATINE AMELIORATES SOCIAL ISOLATION INDUCED OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR IN MICE",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is defined as recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses (obsession) and/or repetitive purposeful behaviors (compulsions). 13% of children and adults are suffering from this condition. There are evidences that increased OCD symptom severity has been linked with diminished quality of life [3] and also increased functional impairment. Social isolation is defined as a state in which the individual lacks a sense of belonging socially, lacks engagement with others, has a minimal number of social contacts and they are deficient in fulfilling and quality relationships.Social isolation (SI) causes a variety of behavioral changes like hyper-locomotion, anxiety, impulsivity, aggression. These behavioral abnormalities in rodents may be related to the symptoms in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism, schizophrenia, depression. In addition, Social isolation and OCD are associated with similar neurochemical changes like hypofunction of serotonin, dopamine and glutamate hyperfunction.These changes might be one of the causes for exacerbation of OCB in social isolation. Agmatine [4(amino butyl) guanidine] is an endogenous amine, widely present in mammalian brain and proposed as a novel neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.It is a metabolite of L-arginine via arginine decarboxylase and hydrolyzed to putrescine and urea by agmatinase. Recently, Agmatine is evidenced for anti-compulsive like effect . It has also been reported for its effectiveness in schizophrenia , addictive behavior , stress,anxiety [11] and depression . Besides this, Agmatine is evidenced for modulating levels of serotonin [13] as well as dopamine and glutamate levels .Incidentally, these neurotransmitters levels are altered in social isolation and OCD. [14] Hence, in the present study, the effect of agmatine was investigated in social isolation induced OCD in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental Animals Adult male albino Swiss mice (22–25 g) were group housed (n=6) under a standard 12 h light/dark cycle and controlled conditions of temperature (23 ± 2C) and humidity (55 ± 10%). Mice were acclimatized to laboratory conditions for 7 days before carrying out the experiments. The animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC) (SCOP/IAEC/2013/14/151). Drugs Agmatine sulfate was purchased from SigmaAldrich Ltd., USA. Drug solutions were prepared fresh and doses are expressed in terms of their free bases. Isolation condition Mice were housed singly in cages (21 x 38 x 14 cm) under a controlled 12-hour/12-hour light-dark cycle, Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric condition characterized by persistent intrusive thoughts (obsessions), repetitive ritualistic behaviors (compulsions) and excessive anxiety. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is classified as an anxiety disorder under DSM-IV-TR guidelines. In OCD, the levels of serotonin and nitric oxide decreased; whereas levels of dopamine and glutamate increased in brain. Environmental conditions such as isolation from social surroundings lead to anxiety and increased level of aggression. The present study was designed to examine the effect of agmatine in social isolation induced obsessive-compulsive behavior on marble burying behavior and locomotor activity. Agmatine (20, 40 and 80 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered in different groups of mice; activity was observed 30 min after dosing. Acute treatment of agmatine (40 and 80 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced marble burying behavior. Moreover, hyperlocomotion was observed in socially isolated animals and agmatine was found to attenuate the same without affecting basal locomotions. In conclusion, agmatine effectively decreases social isolation induced obsessive-compulsive behavior in mice.",

      "abstract": "Objective: Selective or \"picky\" eating (SE) refers to rejection of a wide range of familiar and unfamiliar foods based on aversions to their sensory properties. When severe, SE can cause symptoms of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), including weight loss, nutritional deficiencies, and/or psychosocial impairment. SE is highly prevalent in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared to both typical development and other developmental disorders. A possible explanation for the high prevalence of SE in ASD is the effect of core ASD symptoms, repetitive/restrictive behaviors (e.g., rigidity), and sensory sensitivity on feeding behaviors. These traits are found not only in ASD but also in other clinical groups and the general population, albeit often at subclinical levels. Identifying mechanisms of SE across various populations is critical to inform intervention approaches.Methods: In 263 unselected children ages 5–17, 534 unselected college students ages 18–22, 179 children with anxiety/obsessive spectrum disorders ages 5–17, and 185 children with ASD ages 4–17, we explored the unique contributions of sensory (i.e., oral texture and olfactory) sensitivities and rigidity as predictors of self/parent-reported SE.Results: In each sample, rigidity and oral texture sensitivity, controlling for olfactory sensitivity, age, and gender, emerged as significant, independent predictors of SE.Conclusions: This is the first study to highlight the importance of cognitive/behavioral rigidity to SE, and one of the first to illustrate the domain-specificity of the relationship between sensory sensitivity and SE.",

      "title": "Stress and immunity: minireview.",
      "abstract": "Stress, a state of threatened homeostasis, may be induced by various physical or psychological factors (stressors), including antigenic stimulation. Stressful experiences may affect both physical/psychological well being and immune functioning of humans and animals; the ongoing immune reaction may affect other physiological functions and psychological comfort. The molecular basis of these effects involves a network of multidirectional signalling and feedback regulations of neuroendocrine- and immunocyte-derived mediators. The consecutive stages of the multistep immune reactions might be either inhibited or enhanced owing to the previous and/or parallel stress experiences, depending on the kind of stressor and the animal species, strain, gender, or age. Therefore, the final results of stress-induced alteration of immune reactions are difficult to predict. The effect of a particular stressor on immune functions varies according to the previous stress experience of the individual (e.g. social confrontation, sterile saline injection) while various stressors may act in the same or in opposite ways on the same immune parameter. In general, the efficacy of immune response depends on the neuroendocrine environment on which it is superimposed. Conversely, neural and endocrine responses depend on the concurrent immune events upon which they are superimposed. It seems that the consequences of stress on the immune functioning are generally adaptive in the short run but can be damaging when stress is chronic.",

      "title": "Cognitive deficits in psychiatric disorders: Current status",
      "abstract": "Cognition denotes a relatively high level of processing of specific information including thinking, memory, perception, motivation, skilled movements and language. Cognitive psychology has become an important discipline in the research of a number of psychiatric disorders, ranging from severe psychotic illness such as schizophrenia to relatively benign, yet significantly disabling, non-psychotic illnesses such as somatoform disorder. Research in the area of neurocognition has started unlocking various secrets of psychiatric disorders, such as revealing the biological underpinnings, explaining the underlying psychopathology and issues related to course, outcome and treatment strategies. Such research has also attempted to uproot a number of previously held concepts, such as Kraepelin's dichotomy. Although the range of cognitive problems can be diverse, there are several cognitive domains, including executive function, attention and information processing, and working memory, which appear more frequently at risk. A broad range of impairment across and within the psychiatric disorders are highlighted in this oration. The oration summarizes the studies investigating cognitive processing in different psychiatric disorders. I will also discuss the findings of my own research on neurocognitive deficits in mood disorders, schizophrenia, obsessive–compulsive disorder, somatoform disorder, including studies on 'high-risk' individuals. Tracing the evaluation of neurocognitive science may provide new insights into the pathophysiology and treatment of psychiatric disorders.",

      "title": "Cognitive impairment in substance use disorders",
      "abstract": "Cognitive impairments in substance use disorders have been extensively researched, especially since the advent of cognitive and computational neuroscience and neuroimaging methods in the last 20 years. Conceptually, altered cognitive function can be viewed as a hallmark feature of substance use disorders, with documented alterations in the well-known “executive” domains of attention, inhibition/regulation, working memory, and decision-making. Poor cognitive (sometimes referred to as “top-down”) regulation of downstream motivational processes—whether appetitive (reward, incentive salience) or aversive (stress, negative affect)—is recognized as a fundamental impairment in addiction and a potentially important target for intervention. As addressed in this special issue, cognitive impairment is a transdiagnostic domain; thus, advances in the characterization and treatment of cognitive dysfunction in substance use disorders could have benefit across multiple psychiatric disorders. Toward this general goal, we summarize current findings in the abovementioned cognitive domains of substance use disorders, while suggesting a potentially useful expansion to include processes that both precede (precognition) and supersede (social cognition) what is usually thought of as strictly cognition. These additional two areas have received relatively less attention but phenomenologically and otherwise are important features of substance use disorders. The review concludes with suggestions for research and potential therapeutic targeting of both the familiar and this more comprehensive version of cognitive domains related to substance use disorders.",

Beim Älteren mit einer depressiven Störung kann die Fähigkeit zur Reflexion, zum verbalen Ausdruck und zum Dialog so stark beeinträchtigt sein, daß er die Antwort auf Fragen nach seiner Einstellung schuldig bleibt. In manchen Fällen wird der Untersucher festzustellen haben, daß depressive Alterspatienten die an sie gestellten Fragen ausweichend beantworten.

      "title": "Psychological Changes in the form of Aging",
      "abstract": "Aging is a normal biological process that entails permanent modifications in the physiological structures and functions of almost all physiological systems. The changes lead to reduced physical and cognitive performance and predisposition to chronic diseases. Cardiovascular aging, with stiffening of the arteries, loss of blood vessel compliance, and a decline in maximal cardiac output, is one of the most obvious changes and it may cause hypertension and cardiac workload increase. The respiratory system is affected by aging causing a loss in the alveolar surface area, decreased elasticity of lung tissues and decreased strength of respiratory muscles hence loss in the efficiency of oxygen exchange. Renal functioning is also impaired and a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) alters the body so that it cannot maintain a normal balance of fluid and electrolytes. The signs of musculoskeletal aging include muscle loss (sarcopenia), reduced bone density (osteopenia or osteoporosis), and loss of joint mobility, which lead to reduced mobility and the risk of fractures. Neurological alterations involve slowing the nerve conduction and lower neurotransmitter levels and mild impairments of the mind, but these are strongly different in different human beings. Endocrine changes include dropped levels of hormone production and sensitivity, e.g., decreased insulin sensitivity (likely to develop diabetes type 2), changes in thyroid activity, and reduced levels of sex hormones (e.g. estrogen and testosterone), affecting metabolism, mood and energy. Immunosenescence of the immune system occurs, which is reduced naïve T-cell production, dysfunction in the response to new antigens, and chronic low-grade inflammation (inflammaging), predisposing to infections and autoimmune diseases. Such physiological changes are regulated by genetics, lifestyles, diet, physical exercises, and exposure to the environment. The mechanisms and the course of such changes are important to understand to provide interventions to improve the quality of life, delay frailty and healthy longevity.",

Relatively common after unilateral lesions are anosognosia and anosodiaphoria—that is, the denial of, or unconcern about, a sensorimotor hemisyndrome.

The term misoplegia was coined by Critchley1,2 and refers to the morbid dislike or hatred of paralysed limbs in patients with hemiplegia. Minor manifestations of this condition may be restricted to verbal aggression towards a limb, but commonly misoplegia includes physical acts such as striking and beating the hemiplegic extremity.1–3 Although these verbal or physical acts of self-directed aggression are impressive, detailed case reports are rare.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION :\r\nCerebral Palsy (CP) is defined as a group of permanent disorders of the development of movement and posture causing activity limitation that are attributed to non-progressive disturbances that occurred in the developing fetal (or) infant brain. The motor disorders of CP are often accompanied by disturbances of sensation, perception, cognition, communication and behaviour by epilepsy and\r\nsecondary musculoskeletal problems. The incidence of CP is well raised above 2.0 per 1,000 live birth in the past 40 years. The Fetal brain injury that occurs during the prenatal, postnatal and neonatal period ends up in CP. The causes can be specified as: intra uterine exposure to infection, inflammation, disorders of coagulation, interruption of oxygen supply during birth, low APGAR score, seizures, low birth weight, pre term and non specific indicators of neonatal illness.\r\nCP can be classified based on the movements as hypertonic or spastic, ataxic, dyskinetic, mixed and hypotonic6. Based on the function, CP is classified as quadriplegic, diplegic, hemiplegic and monoplegic7. Spasticity is the most common movement disorder among the patients with CP 8. Spastic diplegia is most prevalent form of CP.\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY :\r\nThe study was aimed to find out the effect of PRE training on the functional out come in the spastic diplegic CP children.\r\nOBJECTIVES :\r\n1. To find out the effect of PRE training in the spastic diplegic CP on the gross motor function in the experimental group.\r\n2. To find out the effect of conventional therapy in the spastic diplegic CP on the gross motor function in the control group.\r\n3. To find out the effect of PRE training in the spastic diplegic CP on the mobility function in the experimental group.\r\n4. To find out the effect of conventional therapy in the spastic diplegic CP on the mobility function in the control group.\r\n5. To find out the effect of PRE training in the spastic diplegic CP on the strength in the experimental group.\r\n6. To find out the effect of conventional therapy in the spastic diplegic CP on the strength in the control group.\r\n7. To find out the effect of PRE training in the spastic diplegic CP on the spasticity in the experimental group.\r\n8. To find out the effect of conventional therapy in the spastic diplegic CP on the spasticity in the control group.\r\n9. To compare the gross motor functional outcome difference between the experimental and control group.\r\n10. To compare mobility functional outcome difference between the experimental and control group.\r\n11. To compare the strength gain between the experimental and control group.\r\n12. To compare the change in spasticity between the experimental and control group.\r\nMETHODOLOGY :\r\nStudy Design :\r\nA controlled Experimental study.\r\nStudy Setting :\r\nPhysiotherapy Outpatient Department, and Pediatric Inpatient\r\nDepartment of Sri Ramakrishna Multi Specialty Hospital, Coimbatore.\r\nSampling Technique : A Convenience sampling.\r\nSample Size :\r\nA total of 30 spastic diplegic CP children was selected on the basis of the selection criteria and conveniently allocated in two groups. The group A (experimental group) consist of 15 children and the other group B (control group)consist of 15 children.\r\nStudy Duration :\r\nThe study was conducted over a period of 1 year.\r\nTreatment Duration :\r\nThe treatment duration was 12 weeks.\r\nSelection Criteria :\r\na) Inclusion criteria :\r\n• Age: 4-10 years.\r\n• Both gender.\r\n• Able to accept and follow verbal instructions.\r\n• Ability to walk independently in indoors and outdoors with (or) without mobility aids.\r\n• Children with spastic diplegic CP under the Gross Motor\r\nFunctional Classification System (GMFCS) level I-III.\r\nb) Exclusion criteria :\r\n• Unstable seizures.\r\n• Any surgical procedures up to 3 months prior to the study.\r\n• Botulium toxin injection up to 6 months prior to the study.\r\n• Other cardio vascular and pulmonary disease which interferes the resisted training exercise.\r\nRESULTS :\r\nThe results confirmed the effect of PRE training was effective than the conventional therapy in the improvement of the gross motor function, mobility function and strength without the adverse effects of increasing spasticity. The result supported the previous studies which stated the PRE can improve the functional status without the adverse effect. Result of the study showed the relationship with the muscle strength and gross motor function25. The study determined that there was significant strength gain in the muscle targeted in the lower limbs, which was also stated in the other studies showed the direct relationship between the lower limb muscle strength and gait parameters. The gained strength of the lower limb muscles can improve the function by strengthened hip muscle stabilizing the pelvic motions in walking, the strengthened knee muscle can improved the degree of crouch gait and increased fast walking, the strengthened ankle muscle can improve the propulsive action of the foot in terminal stands phase34, decreased energy consumption by normalizing the abnormal joint position, and cardiovascular fitness gained after the PRE training36. All these factors contributed for the improvement in the gait parameters such as increased speed, increased stride length, increased cadence and increased single limb balancing during walking.\r\nCONCLUSION :\r\nThe study confirmed the effect of PRE training in the\r\nfunctional status of the spastic diplegic CP who are ambulating. The result of the study showed that the PRE for spastic dipelgic CP can increase the strength of the muscle thus improve gross motor function and mobility without the adverse effect of increased muscle tone.",

Treatment of mental disorder in the absence of any other diagnosable mental disorder should be based upon simple counseling with exploration of possible family or environmental stresses. Supportive treatment, along with relevant education for the patient when such problems or crises develop, is almost always helpful. Institutionalization or other infantilizing procedures are never necessary for the treatment of Borderline Intellectual Functioning per se.

      "abstract": "Acquired brain injury is an umbrella term that encompasses traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) and non-traumatic brain injuries. Approximately 150,000 Canadians will sustain an ABI on an annual basis. An ABI is damage to the brain that is not due to a congenital or degenerative disorder. Occurring after birth, ABI can be caused by a traumatic event or external force (e.g., motor vehicle accident, sports injury), or a non-traumatic event or internal factor (e.g., infection, tumour). Injury to the brain can result in temporary or permanent physical (e.g., movement issues, spasticity, chronic pain), cognitive (e.g., impaired speech, memory loss), and/or emotional (e.g., depression, anger issues) impairments.As 1 of the major physical impairments resulting from an ABI, muscle spasticity is often described as muscle over-activity and is characterized by ongoing muscle contractions that are partly due to a decrease in skeletal stretch reflex threshold. Occurring spontaneously or continuously, spasticity typically affects muscles in the neck and upper and lower limbs. Spasticity can result in a variety of musculoskeletal issues such as involuntary shaking, joint stiffness, muscle contracture, and limited range of movement. This debilitating condition may limit one’s ability to perform the activities of daily living, impact one’s quality of life, and require additional assistance from caregivers.The treatment of ABI-related spasticity can involve a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Non-pharmacological options may include casting and splinting to maintain positioning, stretching and strengthening to improve control of spastic muscles, and/or transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation to help reduce pain. Pharmacological options can be administered systemically (e.g., oral baclofen, tizanidine, clonidine, dantrolene sodium) or locally (e.g., injection of botulinum toxin type A [BoNT-A], phenol, baclofen). Botulinum toxin (BoNT), a neurotoxic protein produced by Clostridium botulinum bacteria, exists in multiple subtypes (i.e., A to G) and formulations.BoNT-A intramuscular injection is used to treat spasticity by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in activating skeletal muscles. BoNT-A injections result in temporary local paresis (i.e., partial paralysis) and may help to improve pain. BoNT-A is approved for various indications (i.e., not exclusive to spasticity), and is available as 3 formulations in North America: onabotulinum toxin A (Botox), abobotulinum toxin A (Dysport), and incobotulinum toxin A (Xeomin). Due to different manufacturing processes and pharmacological activities, these 3 formulations are not considered interchangeable products. This report focuses on onabotulinum toxin A, which will be referred to herein as Botox — its brand name.The body of evidence evaluating treatment options for spasticity after brain injury is limited in quality and quantity, and there is uncertainty regarding the clinical effectiveness of Botox for this population. Another 2021 CADTH rapid review report focused on the use of Botox for the treatment of spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis. The aim of this rapid review report is to summarize and critically appraise the relevant evidence on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and evidence-based guidelines regarding the use of Botox for the treatment of ABI-associated spasticity.",

      "abstract": "Dementia is a syndrome caused by the destruction of the brain, with loss of cortical\r\n functions as a result. It is manifested as a memory loss, cognitive disorder, orientation,\r\n understanding, counting disorder as well as the inability of judgment and studying. Dementia is a\r\n common name for a group of symptoms and it is not a single, specific disease. Disrupted brain\r\n function affects both the social and intellectual life of an ill person. There are more types of\r\n dementia that can be divided roughly by anatomical position of brain damage. Damage which\r\n occurs is progressive and irreversible, and thus dementia is a deadly, untreatable disease. It is\r\n very important to spot the symptoms and diagnose the disease early on so that a terminal phase\r\n of the disease could be delayed, and the patients could be as independent as possible. Persons\r\n with dementia, especially in the terminal phase, are dependent on other person's care. The\r\n advanced phase of dementia prevents adequate self-care, dressing, feeding, conduction of\r\n healthcare and communication with the surroundings. The most important role in the treatment\r\n of the patient with advanced dementia lies with palliative medicine and palliative care, and their\r\n purpose is not in extending a lifetime of the patient in the terminal phase, but rather the increased\r\n quality of life. Palliative medicine and care are not interested in the disorder of the patient, but\r\n rather in consequences of this particular disease, signs, and symptoms which decrease the quality\r\n of life for both patients and their families. The main interest of the palliative team is increasing\r\n the quality of rest of the patient's life, relief of the symptoms and ease of the mourning. In this\r\n process, the medical team plays a key role, and the nurse which spends most of the time with the\r\n patient is a center of that particular team. She helps the patient with preforming of his\r\n physiological needs, daily activities which add up to his quality of life or a peaceful death. The\r\n nurse has an irreplaceable role in giving psychological support and comfort to the patient and his\r\n family. She is responsible for planning, carrying out and the evaluation of healthcare for the\r\n patients with dementia, as well as respecting the patient as a person, preserving his dignity and\r\n acting by the principles of a holistic approach.",

The focal neurobehavioral syndromes covered here generally involve disconnections in gray matter regions, but most of these disorders also imply white matter pathology and include cerebral stroke, neoplasia, and demyelination plaques interrupting neural networks to produce deficit syndromes with negative symptoms. Most issues in the forensic psychiatry of the elderly involve capacity to willfully act (competency), capacity to understand (criminal issues, contractual issues, testamentary capacity), capacity to be aware and protect oneself (elder abuse, personal safety, ability to live alone), and capacity to behave according to societal norms (criminal responsibility, fitness for duty, sexual crimes, dangerousness).

Although the losses associated with advancing years, chronic disease and then entry into dialysis renders the psyche of elderly people frail, they do not strictly add in negative terms: their psychological reserve or resignation helps very elderly people to tolerate dialysis and its constraints. However, maintaining functional autonomy (ability to provide for one's fundamental needs and preserve leisure activities) while remaining independent to take decisions (particularly in controlling ways of receiving assistance) and preserving close relationships emerge as major determinant factors of the quality of life of very elderly dialysed patients. Added to the dependency due to dialysis, losses in these domains very often represent a turning point by changing the patient's identity, predisposing to the development of relationship problems, leading the patient to question his self-esteem or even resulting in psychological dependency, which itself adversely affects the quality of life. These mechanisms of psychopathology may not hide the possibility of an underlying dementia.",

      "title": "Exploration of sleep disorders in the elderly: which particularities?",
      "abstract": "There are many reasons to take into consideration the sleep disorders in the elderly. The sleep quality degrades with age and is strongly affected by medical conditions, intrinsic sleep disorders, or by a combination of these factors. Other age-related conditions such as severe dementia, dependence or living in institution worsen sleep disturbances in older people. When living alone elderly people, being cognitively impaired and medically disabled, may not be able to complain about sleep problems. Sleep disorders are thus underdiagnosed, unmarked, and insufficiently investigated in the elderly. In this heterogeneous population, sleep assessment should include a global geriatric approach and be individually adapted for each subject. The sleep interview must specially include medical comorbidities, medication uses, and aged-related changes of lifestyle such as retirement, loss of spouse, hospitalization or institutionalization. In the elderly with loss of autonomy, standard sleep assessment is not always adequate and must be replaced by shorter, simpler or observation-based tests such as the Sleep disorders inventory, Observation-based nocturnal sleep inventory, Observation and interview based diurnal sleepiness inventory. When sleep log is impossible, actimetry is an excellent alternative for studying sleep-wake rhythm. Ventilatory polygraphy is a simpler test for detecting sleep apnea than polysomnography. Utilization of sophisticated investigations should be discussed when the feasibility and usefulness is limited.",

En d’autres termes les sujets ayant des caracteristiques alexithymiques ont des difficultes a identifier et a exprimer le stress emotionnel par la verbalisation. L’alexithymie fut initialement consideree comme de survenue plus frequente chez les sujets souffrants de maladies dites psychosomatiques. Certaines etudes ont retrouve des anomalies du systeme immunitaire notamment de l’immunite a mediation cellulaire ou une hyperactivite du systeme sympathique ou une perturbation de la secretion des corticoides mais tres peu ont essaye d’avoir une approche psychoneuroimmunologique en integrant toutes ces voies (immunes et neuroendocrines) lors des investigations sur l’alexithymie. Les objectifs de cette these etaient d’explorer de maniere plus approfondie le systeme immunitaire en tenant compte de l’activite du systeme sympathique et des taux seriques de cortisol. Nous avons emis l’hypothese que les alexithymiques presenteraient une baisse de l’immunite a mediation cellulaire avec une chute de la secretion de cytokines de type 1 associee a une elevation des taux seriques de cortisol et une augmentation de l’activite du systeme sympathique. Lors d’une etude longitudinale, nous avons compare - entre un groupe de sujets alexithymiques et un groupe de sujets non alexithymiques – les concentrations seriques des sous-populations lymphocytaires (CD4, CD8), la production de l’interleukine 1 (IL-1), de l’interleukine 2 (IL-2), de l’interleukine 4 (IL-4) et de son recepteur soluble (sIL-4R) et de l’interleukine 10 (IL-10) par les lymphocytes actives par PHA ainsi que la reponse cardiovasculaire (frequence cardiaque et tension arterielle) et le taux serique de cortisol. Cinquante et une femmes âgees de 18 a 27 ans ont ete incluses (27 femmes alexithymiques et 24 non alexithymiques) en fonction de leur score a l’echelle de la Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). Sur les femmes initialement vues la premiere annee (n=38) 26 ont ete incluses a un an Initialement nous avons constate chez les alexithymiques une diminution significative de la production d’interleukine-1 (IL-1), d’IL-2, d’IL-4 produites par lymphocytes actives par Phytohemagglutinine A (PHA) ainsi que du ratio Th1/Th2 (IL-2/IL-10) avec une baisse du ratio de CD4/CD8 et du pourcentage de CD4 et de lymphocytes. Les alexithymiques presentaient une plus grande elevation de la pression arterielle sans modification du taux serique de cortisol. Un an plus tard il y avait toujours une diminution significative chez les alexithymiques comparativement aux non alexithymiques de la production d’IL-2, d’IL-4 et du pourcentage de CD4 avec une tendance a la baisse du ratio CD4/CD8. Bien que l’anxiete etait plus elevee initialement dans le groupe d’alexithymiques, les resultats persistaient a un an en depit d’un retour a la normal du niveau d’anxiete a l’echelle HAD. Ces resultats suggerent que les femmes alexithymiques pourraient presenter un systeme immunitaire affaibli avec une atteinte predominante de la voie Th1 de l’immunite mais non exclusive. Cette dysregulation immunitaire pourrait etre liee a une hyperactivite du systeme sympathique. Il pourrait y avoir chez les alexithymiques un facteur de vulnerabilite aux maladies infectieuses et a celles liees au stress.",

      "title": "Gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders re-visited",
      "abstract": "The importance of gastrointestinal motility and gut perception in medicine has been long recognized. Physiologically, these key functions ensure normal unperceived feeding and digestion, crucial aspects of health and wellbeing. Conversely, pathophysiological disturbances may produce digestive symptoms, which are common in the general population and may range from the simply annoying to the incapacitating. In fact, major disturbances may lead to malnourishment, metabolic imbalance and general deterioration of the body. Altered normal gut motility may also disrupt gut homeostasis, induce changes in the gut flora and facilitate bacterial translocation from the intestine to other viscera (Fig. 1). Clinical recognition of gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders is largely based on the anatomic localization of their symptomatic expression (1-4). Thus, dysphagia, reflux symptoms and chest pain are normally associated with esophageal or gastroesophageal disturbances. Upper abdominal pain or discomfort, early satiety, nausea and vomiting, and other dyspeptic-like symptoms are usually ascribed to dysfunction of the stomach and/or upper small bowel. Bloating is a somewhat mysterious symptom that may be generated by motor/sensorial disturbances throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Diarrhea and/or constipation usually result from small bowel and/or colonic disorders. Ano-rectal symptoms usually derive from dysfunction of the pelvic floor, distal colon or sphincteric structures. Traditionally, clinical conditions were divided into somatic gastrointestinal motility disorders: achalasia, gastroparesis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction and so on, and functional disorders: dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome and a myriad of clinical syndromes and descriptions. The distinction between both groups was largely based on whether a propulsive failure was or not demonstrated by conventional imaging tests. Thus, a patient with recurrent abdominal pain and distension could be categorized either as a chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction (if dilated loops of bowel were visualized on Xrays) or irritable bowel syndrome (if nothing obviously abnormal was found). Application of more sophisticated and discriminating diagnostic tests (intestinal manometry, barostat, etc.) and histology increasingly showed that Gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders re-visited",

Abnormalities in patients with conversion disorders are involuntary, whereas patients with the other two conditions are voluntary. Malingering, in particular, might be purposeful for personal benefits such as financial reasons and escape from jail. Common phenotypes of psychogenic neurologic diseases are motor paralysis, sensory loss, constriction of visual field, and seizures (psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, PNES). Clinical features common to all kinds of psychogenic neurologic disorders include incongruity with ordinary neurologic symptoms, inconsistency (variability) of nature, degree and distribution in time, change due to distraction to other stimuli or other matters, and the presence of psychogenic factors in the social or family background.",

The symptoms of psychoorganic syndrome have different types of neuropathogenesis: they may be caused by toxic, infectious, vascular and traumatic factors. The existing descriptions of speech disorders concentrate upon the damage to different brain areas, usually focusing first of all on dysfunctions of the communication process, i.e. the programming of verbal utterances. In the case of psychoorganic syndrome, interaction disorders do not arise from strictly linguistic difficulties, but are caused by disorders of the controlling function of the word. Psychoorganic syndrome is usually diagnosed in adults, while brain injuries in the developmental age usually lead to mental development disorders. Psychiatric literature therefore makes a distinction into three forms of psychoorganic syndrome: in adults 1) characteropathy and 2) dementia, and in children 3) oligophrenia. In speech therapy there are developed standards of diagnostic and therapeutic management in the case of oligophrenia and some forms of dementia, but there are still no procedures for diagnosis and therapy of interactions in other forms of dementia and characteropathic disorders.",

      "title": "Catatonia with Left Temporal Lesion on MRI: Crossing Borders",
      "abstract": "Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a combination of disturbed motor functioning and changes in thought, mood and vigilance. Two patterns - one consisting in catalepsy, posturing, mutism and negativism and a second consisting of echophenomenon, automatic obedience, verbigeration, and other stereotypies - have been abstracted. Catatonia has been associated with psychiatric disorders - schizophrenia and bipolar disorder for example - as well as secondary to various underlying medical conditions.It will be described a case report of a 55 years old woman with prior psychiatric history of hospitalization with an unspecified nonorganic psychosis (F29-ICD10), presenting features of catatonia - immobility with fixed posture and gaze (sometimes presenting posturing), an almost absence of spontaneous movements and speech, echophenomenon (echolalia, palilalia, coprolalia) erupting in a otherwise mute state and showing, on occasions, periods of purposelessness motor excitement and restlessness, verbigeration and screaming with a grim of terror. She was disoriented and performed poorly on the MMSE. No neurologic focal signs were disclosed other than prominent primitive reflexes. Prior to admission, her family reported a sudden mood change: she became irritable, argumentative, with delusional thought content of persecutory nature, grandiose ideas. Viral and immune-mediated encephalitis were discharged. The MRI scan showed a right temporal medial lesion (amygdala atrophy). It will be addressed the hypothetical relationship between the dramatic clinical presentation and the cerebral lesion, grounded on the scientific research regarding limbic encephalitis, catatonic symptoms and neurophysiology. It will also be underscored the clinical relevance of differentiated psychopathology of catatonia.",

Infant development occurs in an orderly and predictable manner that is determined intrinsically. It proceeds from cephalic to caudal and proximal to distal as well as from generalized reactions to stimuli to specific, goal-directed reactions that become increasingly precise. Extrinsic forces can modulate the velocity and quality of developmental progress.\n\n2. Each developmental domain must be assessed during ongoing developmental surveillance within the context of health supervision.Generalizations about development cannot be based on the assessment of skills in a single developmental domain (ie, one cannot describe infant cognition based on gross motor milestones). However, skills in one developmental domain do influence the acquisition and assessment of skills in other domains.\n\n3. Speech delays are the most common developmental concern seen by the general pediatrician, yet they often are not well understood or diagnosed expediently. A sound understanding of the distinction between an isolated speech delay (usually environmental and often can be alleviated) and a true language delay (a combined expressive and receptive problem that implies more significant pathology) will help the clinician refer appropriately for precise diagnosis and appropriate management.\n\n4. It is essential to understand normal development and acceptable variations in normal developmental patterns to recognize early patterns that are pathologic and that may indicate a possible developmental disability.\n\n5. Assessment of the quality of skills and monitoring the attainment of developmental milestones are essential to early diagnosis of developmental disabilities and expedient referral to early intervention programs.\n\n“Infant” is derived from the Latin word, “ infans ,” meaning “unable to speak.” Thus, many define infancy as the period from birth to approximately 2 years of age, when language begins to flourish. It is an exciting period of“ firsts”—first smile, first successful grasp, first evidence of separation anxiety, first word, first step, first sentence.

      "title": "Depression, women, and the workplace.",
      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder that causes much personal distress and difficulties in functioning at home and in the workplace. In the workplace, as elsewhere, depression can manifest as a variation in normal mood, as a symptom, as a disorder, or as a disease. Occupational health professionals are more concerned with clinical depression, a term used to signify any type of depression that causes significant personal distress and/or problems in functioning. Clinical depression is manifest in the workplace and adversely affects the employee's work satisfaction and performance. For most types of depression, women are at a higher risk than men. A number of events and variables related to women and depression were reviewed. Although the effects of some of these events, such as menopause, can be manifest in the workplace, they are not associated with an increased incidence of clinical depression. Other events, such as victimization (e.g., childhood sexual abuse or battering by an intimate partner), are associated with higher risks of depression in women. Women derive substantial satisfaction from interpersonal relationships but also are at greater risk for depression when strains and conflicts in these relationships occur. In the workplace women who have no difficulty in arranging for child care and whose spouses share in the care of children show lower rates of depression. When marriages are unhappy, women are three times as likely as men to be depressed. These findings speak to the importance of relationships to women. In the workplace, when women are depressed, problems with relationships are likely to be involved. Clinically depressed women are not difficult to identify in work settings. Dejected mood and loss of interest in usual activities are noticeable, along with numerous other symptoms that accompany depression. The effective treatment of depression depends on careful diagnosis and assessment. Both drug therapy and the more structured psychotherapies, such as cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal therapy, have demonstrated effectiveness in treating depression. For mild depression, pharmacotherapy is likely to be the treatment of choice. In cases in which the depressive symptomatology is moderate to severe, a combination of drug therapy and psychotherapy is likely to be the most effective treatment and to provide the best prophylaxis. Drug therapy seems particularly effective in promoting rapid reduction of vegetative and physical symptoms. Psychotherapy enhances coping skills at home and at work and also focuses on problem-solving, relationship difficulties, and dealing with stressors. In the area of prevention, occupational health practitioners currently can have the greatest impact in secondary prevention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), a clinical syndrome characterized by loss of semantic knowledge, is associated with neurodegeneration that starts in the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) and gradually spreads towards posterior temporal and medial frontal areas. At the earliest stages, atrophy may be predominantly lateralized to either the left or right ATL, leading to different clinical profiles with greatest impairment of word comprehension or visual/social semantics, respectively.We report the in-depth longitudinal investigation of cognitive and neuroanatomical features of JB, an unusual case of ATL neurodegeneration with relative sparing of left lateral ATL regions.Over the course of nine years, neurodegeneration progressed to involve bilateral temporo-lateral and frontal regions, resulting in a relatively symmetric and diffuse frontotemporal atrophy pattern. In parallel, JB developed greater behavioral, cognitive, and language impairments, as well as signs of motor neuron disease at her last evaluation. Episodic memory and socio-emotional processing deficits arose, likely secondary to semantic verbal deficits, while visuospatial processing, executive function, and non-semantic language abilities remained largely unaffected throughout the course of the disease.The details of this rare case of early medial more than lateral ATL degeneration are consistent with a bilateral organization of the semantic system and, crucially, with a functional dissociation between medial paralimbic and lateral neocortical temporal regions. Cases of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) such as JB, who initially do not meet current clinical criteria for svPPA and instead present with some features of behavioral variant FTD, highlight the need for specific criteria for the right temporal variant of FTD that we propose could be called semantic variant FTD.",

Behaviour during adolescence is driven by hormonal changes like increase in growth hormone, steroid hormones etc. There is pruning of neural pathways, such that the parts of brain that are most active during adolescence are best developed and those parts that are not utilized remain under-developed later on in adulthood. Common mental disorders during adolescence are emotional disorders like anxiety disorders, depression; conduct disorders like oppositional defiant disorders; hyperkinetic disorders and other psychotic disorders. Multiple tools or questionnaires are available to apply on adolescents and children for screening as well as diagnosing them with mental disorders like Rutter Child Scale A and Rutter Child Scale B, Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), K-SADS (Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia), ISC (Interview Schedule for Children), CAS (Child Assessment Schedule), CAPA (Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment), DISC (Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children) and the DICA (Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents) etc. Poverty, social disadvantage, violence, child abuse, academic failure are some of the risk factors associated with mental disorders. Prevalence of any psychiatric disorder in India is 11% and 8% among boys and girls respectively compared to US where it is 46% in the age group of 13-16 years irrespective of sex. nothing much has been achieved for adolescents under national mental health programme.

      "title": "Course and outcome of schizophrenia and their prediction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Studies conducted over many decades consistently demonstrate that schizophrenia presents a broad spectrum of possible outcomes and course patterns, ranging from complete or nearly complete recovery after acute episodes of psychosis to continuous, unremitting illness leading to progressive deterioration of cognitive performance and social functioning. Between these extremes, a substantial proportion of patients show an episodic course with relapses of psychotic symptoms and partial remissions during which affective and cognitive impairments become increasingly conspicuous and may progress to gross deficits. Although no less than one-third of all patients with schizophrenia have relatively benign outcomes, in the majority the illness still has a profound, lifelong impact on personal growth and development. The initial symptoms of the disorder are not strongly predictive of the pattern of course but the mode of onset (acute or insidious), the duration of illness prior to diagnosis and treatment, the presence or absence of comorbid substance use, as well as background variables such as premorbid adjustment (especially during adolescence), educational and occupational achievement, marital status, and availability of a supportive social network allow a reasonable accuracy of prediction in the short- to medium-term (2–5 years). One of the most striking aspects of the longitudinal course of schizophrenia is the so-called ‘terminal improvement’. A relatively high proportion of patients tend to improve substantially with ageing. What determines this long-term outcome is far from clear but the stereotype view of schizophrenia as an invariably progressive, deteriorating disorder does not accord well with the evidence. Similarly, a model of schizophrenia as a static neurodevelopmental encephalopathy decompensating post-adolescence under the influence of a variety of stressors fits only part of the spectrum of course patterns. In a significant proportion of cases, the disorder exhibits the unmistakable features of a shift-like process with acute exacerbations and remissions which may progress to severe deterioration or come to a standstill at any stage. Whether a single underlying pathophysiology can explain the variety of clinical outcomes, or several different pathological processes are at work, remains obscure. It has been suggested that the longitudinal course of schizophrenia should be seen as an open-ended, dynamic life process with multiple, interacting biological and psychosocial determinants. Obviously, such issues cannot be resolved by clinical follow-up studies alone, and require a strong involvement of neurobiological research in prospective investigations of representative samples of cases spanning the entire spectrum of course and outcomes. No such studies have been possible until recently, both because of the technical complexity of such an undertaking and because of the tendency to selectively recruit for biological investigations patients from the severe, deteriorating part of the spectrum. Overcoming such limitations will be essential to the uncovering of the mechanisms driving the ‘natural history’ of schizophrenia.",

The concept generally refers to the nature of an experience, resulting from persons interacting in the context of their environment, either through physiological overarousal or underarousal, with an outcome of psychological or physiological distress (bad stress outcome) or eustress (good stress outcome). Stressors range from minor to major, and can be positive or negative events. Generally stressors are life events, such as daily annoyances, pressures at home or on the job, marital discord and conflicts, emergencies, motor vehicle accidents, illness, and injury. Positive stressful life events and transitions include birth of a newborn, graduation ceremony, a family vacation, or a job promotion (Kaplan &amp; Sadock, 1998).",

      "title": "Theoretical Perspectives on Mental Health and Illness: Introduction to Part I",
      "abstract": "Mental health and mental disorder represent two different areas of theory, research, and policy implications, reflecting our common tendency to dichotomize healthy and sick, normal and abnormal, sane and insane. David Mechanic (2006) argues that the term “mental health” has no clear or consistent meaning, and in terms of the sociological literature, this is generally true. Mental health is not merely the absence of disease or disorder; it involves self-esteem, mastery, and the ability to maintain meaningful relationships with others. While most of us fall short of optimal well-being (or happiness), those who experience mental health problems or psychological distress have been the focus of most sociological research. However, definitions of mental health problems, illnesses, or disorders are also not so straightforward. Following Horwitz (2002b), “mental diseases” reflect underlying internal dysfunctions that have universal features (i.e. schizophrenia and to a lesser degree bipolar disorder). A valid “mental disorder” reflects some internal psychological system that is unable to function as it should, and this dysfunction is socially inappropriate. For most disorders, symptoms are not specific indicators of discrete, underlying diseases (such as schizophrenia), instead many conditions arise from stressful social conditions (such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders). Cultural processes shape the symptoms associated with mental disorders, and it is important to distinguish mental disorders from normal reactions to social stressors. Horwitz (2002b) uses the terminology of “mental illness” to refer to those conditions which a particular group has defined as a mental illness (and often point to behaviors that are deemed deviant, for example homosexuality in previous psychiatric classifications). For simplicity, we will use the term mental health problem or disorder in this introduction – but students should keep in mind the implications of using the term mental illness. In Chapter 1, Horwitz argues that sociological approaches regard mental health and mental health problems as aspects of social circumstances. He provides a very thorough overview of how various social conditions affect levels of mental health and mental health problems, and in turn how social contexts shape the definition as well as the response to mental health problems. Chapter 1 develops a framework for a sociological understanding of mental disorder and mental health problems and also directs the reader to other chapters in the volume that illustrate Horwitz's arguments.",

      "abstract": "This article will review types of perseveration from a neurolinguistic perspective. During the course of the article, continuous, stuck-in-set, and recurrent perseveration will be placed in contradistinction to several other types of repetitive behaviors commonly associated with neurogenic communication disorders. These include echolalia in mixed transcortical aphasia; conduite d'approche and conduite d'ecart in fluent aphasias; lexical and nonlexical automatisms in nonfluent aphasias; palilalia in neuromotor disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD); and sound, syllable, word, and phrase repetitions in neurogenic stuttering. When differentiating these phenomena from perseveration, it is helpful to consider the salient factors that condition observed behaviors in individual patients, such as overall speech fluency, inventory of available utterances, nature of eliciting tasks, and propositionality of responses. Information such as communication disorder diagnosis, underlying etiology, and known sites of lesion from each patient's total clinical profile may also assist with differentiation.",

      "abstract": "Ⅰ. Introducton In the preventive and therapeutic medical aspect, the progress of modern medical technology had been contributed to diminish the prevalence of the physically handicapped from the pregnant period to childhood. But recently severity and characteristic of the physically handicapped are more profound according to the causes of the congenitally and adventitiously hearing impaired Generally the physically handicapped are classified the visually handicapped who are divided the blind and the partially sighted, the hearing impaired who are divided the deaf and the hard of hearing, speech disorder, and nonsensory physically handicapped who are the orthopaedic handicapped and specific health problems. Among the category of this physically handicapped, the hearing impaired have nonfunctional hearing by impairement of auditory mechanism in which occures as the auditory stimulus travels through the outer and middle ear and electric mechanically transduced to a nerve impulse in the inner ear. The prevalence of the hearing impaired is slightly disminished in the developed country by the improved medical and public health services. However the prevalence of the adventitiously hearing impaired is more increased in the undeveloping and undeveloping country according to result of the negligence on the mother-child health. In these viewpoints, this study is to identify the variable causes of the adventt tiously hearing impaired, and through this identification to contribute to diminition of the adventitiously hearing handicapped in Korea. Ⅱ. Method 1) Subject: The subjects were 740 hearing impaired students who had above 27 dB in degree of hearing loss. They were assessed to audiological tests at the Hearing & Speech Clinic Center of the Korea Social Work College. 2) Procedure: The audiometry testing were implemented with Rion Co. Model AA-34 and AA-30 form. According to criterion of the American Standard Association, the hearing loss of the subjects were measured in level of 500㎐, 1000㎐, 2000㎐ and 4000㎐ for hearing loss of air conduction and bone conduction. As procedure of audiometric testing, ascending method was implemented by individual puretone threshold determination test. One of each subject was assigned to a separate soundproofing room at the Laboratory of Audiology in which was maintainted an indoor noise under 40dB and tracked his threshold for a timelimit of threeseconds. This procedure was repeated to change from 1000㎐ to high and to low frequency. And to identify the background of each subject related with socio-economic status and cause of hearing defect, this project team interviewed with parents of each subject. The cause of hearing defect in this study were classified the congenitally hearing impaired duted to only patterns of the inheritance and adventitiously hearing impaired who had hearing defect in the pregnat period, during the delivery, and after birth by accident or disease. Ⅲ. Summary & Conclusion 1. Cause of Hearing Defect The results of this survey on the causes of 740 hearing impaired students are as following: 1) Frequency of hearing defect according to the cause ⑴ Hearing defect related with the factors of the causes; The adventitiously hearing impaired who had been acquired through exohgenous causes were 90.08% and the causes of the pure heritance hearing impaired were 5%. Those who could not be defined with any causes were 4.19%. ⑵ Nature of the hearing defect; The sensory-neural hearing impaired were 44.32%, the conductive hearing impaired were 48.50%, and the mixed hearing loss patern were 7.16%. ⑶ Onset of the hearing defect; According to the age of onset of hearing loss, the identified causes during the pregnant period were 9.19%, the causes by the abnormal delivery were 9.32%, and the acquired hearing impaired after birhe were 73.1%. ⑷ Etiology of the hearing defect; The chronic purulence related with the otitis media were 26.76%, the disease of the auditoty tube were 9.19%, the otitis media and its effects were 4.86%, the premature birth were 4.73%, the meningitis were 2.84% the traumetic during the delivery were 2.30%, the infrected rubella during the pregnancy were 2.16%, the jaudice of the newborn were 1.89%, the mumps by the measles and adenoid were 1.76% of each, the typhoid were 1.22%, and the hearing defect by the syphilis were 1.08%. 2) Cause according to the nature of hearing defect ⑴ Causes of the conductive hearing loss;In the causes of the conductive hearing impaired, the puluance related with the otitis media were 55.15% (26.76%), the auditory tube disease were 18.94%(9.19%), The chronic otitis modia and its effects were 10.03%(4.86%), and the adenoids were 3.34%(1.62%). ⑵ Causes of the sensory-neural hearing loss; The cause of the congenitally hearing defect were 17.98%(7.97%), the cause during pregnancy were 18.90%(8.38%), the cause during the delivery were 21.04%(9.32%), and the cause of the adventitiously hearing defect after birth were 42.07%(18.65%). In the cause of the sensory-neural hearing defect according to etiology, the causes by the infected diseases after birth were 27.74%(12.30%), the infected diseases during the pregnancy by the maternity were 12.80%(5.68%), the premature birth were 10.67%(4.73%), the unknown feverish diseases were 5.18%(2.39%), the medicinal poisoning after birth were 4.57%(2.03%), and the jaundice of new born were 3.96%(1.75%). ⑶ The most causes of the mixed hearieg defect were chronic purulence related with the otitis media that formed 83.01% (5.95%). 3) Cause according to the onset of hearing defect ⑴ In the causes of the congenitally hearing impaired, the recessive inheritance by family factor were 45.58%(4.19%), the heredity disease and the deformed inner ear were 8.82% (0.81), the deformed middle-ear were 4.41% (0.49%), and the unknown causes were 41.17% (3.78%). ⑵ Causes of the hearing impaired during the pregnancy; In the causes of the hearing impaired who had been acquired during the pregnant period, the infection by maternity were 67.64% (5.68%), the drug intoxiceitions by maternity were 11.29% (0.95%), the toxmia during pregnancy were 9.68% (0.81%), the maternal abnormal metabolism were 4.84% (0.41%), the endocrine disorders by maternity were 4.84% (0.41%), and the irrudiated effects were 1.61% (0.14%). ⑶ Causes of the hearing impaired during the delivery; The premautre delivery were 50.72% (4.73%), the trauma were 24.64% (2.30%), the jaundice of the newborn were 20.29% (1.89%), and the cerebral paralysis were 4.35% (0.41%). ⑷ Causes of the acquired hearing impaired in after birth; The infrected diseases were 65.94% (12.30%), the drug intoxicatious were 10.87% (2.03%), the head trauma were 5.80% (1.08%), and the unknown feverish diseases were 17.40% (3.24%). 4) Socio-medical aspect of the hearing defect In the scio-medical aspect, the conductive hearing impaired who formed more than 60% were occupied in rural community, the low educational backround, the low socio-economic status, the male group, and the blue color group. The maternal age in delivery were 27.93 years in the normal hearing gpoup and 29.14 years in the hearing impaired group. Recently the prevalence of the conductive hearing impaired are slightly diminishing, however the acqired conductive hearing impaired had more prevalence rate in rural community. 2. Counterplan for the adventitiously hearing impaired To consider countereplan of the prevention, early diagnosis and educo-therapy for the adventitiously hearing impaired, a comprehensive master plan on the social welfare policy and the equal opportunity of medical service should be establihe precedently. 1) Equal opportunity of medical service and social welfare policy ① The itinerent medical service team who are constituted ofthe variable medical member should be utilize in rural community where have not established the medical service system. To accomplish this tesk, the family medicine personnel who could include the all medical field should be prepare to contribute in the unserviced medical area. ② The clients who could be consider as the cause of the handicap should be benefit the medical security and provide the public health services. 2) Improved health service for the child-mother and the establishment of health education in school ① To promote the mother-child health service should be eslablish the mother-child health center according to the local unit. ② In high school curriculum, the cause and prevention of the physically handicapped should be provide to instruct as a regular curricular. 3) Encounterplan for the child-centered medical service ① Research institute of child pathology attached at the general hospital should be establish to identify the adventitiously causes of hearing defect arised from the virus infection and public hazard diseases. ② The child-centered hospital should be establish to prevent, diagnosis, and treat the physically handicapped by the concerned professional member who are pathologist, otologist, audiologist, and speech therapist.",

      "abstract": "Abstract:NEW WAYS TO APPROACH THE DIAGNOSIS PROCESS OF ASDS BASED ON DSM-5Currently, it is our belief that autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a prenatal dysfunction of the Central Nervous System characterized by a series of observable symptoms the first three years of life. Psychologically speaking, the international community is in agreement regarding the fact that autism is understood as a disorder of intersubjectivity and social cognition. The speech and executive functions are affected. In addition, attentional difficulties (sustained and selective attention) are present, as well as learning and sensorial integration difficulties. The definition has been subject to conceptual changes and it is a difficult task to reach a consensus when it comes to agreeing upon a definition which includes the wide range of manifestations of autism. However, it is even more difficult to perform a diagnosis, as often ASDs overlap with other pathologies. For instance, with attentional deficit disorders, with or without hyperactivity (ADHD), with language disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD), intellectual disabilities (ID) and different personality disorders, among others. An added problem is how symptom manifestation changes throughout life. It is essential to adopt an evolutionary perspective throughout the whole diagnosis process and take into account environmental factors (diverse treatment, family involvement…). As there is a lack of biological indicators which clearly indicate what autism really is, nowadays the diagnosis is clinical although interdisciplinary collaboration plays a significant role (neurologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, speech therapists and educators, among others) to successfully reach a diagnosis. On the one hand, we need to avail of efficient classification systems scientifically recognised, and on the other hand, specific assessment tools for people with ASD, standardised and scientifically validated and with specific procedures to apply them avoiding any differences based on the examiner.Keywords: Autism. Autism Spectrum Disorders. Pervasive Developmental Disorders. DSM-5. Diagnosis. Resumen:Actualmente, estamos en condiciones de asegurar, que el autismo es un trastorno del neurodesarrollo causado por una disfunción prenatal del Sistema Nervioso Central que se caracteriza por una serie de síntomas observables en los tres primeros años de la vida. En el plano psicológico, la comunidad internacional está de acuerdo en que el autismo se entiende como un trastorno de la intersubjetividad y de la cognición social. Están afectados el lenguaje y las funciones ejecutivas. Además presentan dificultades atencionales (atención sostenida y selectiva), de aprendizaje y de integración sensorial. Si la definición ha sido objeto de cambios conceptuales y es tarea ardua unificar criterios a la hora de establecer una definición consensuada y que recoja el amplio abanico de manifestaciones del autismo, más difícil es aún la realización del diagnóstico, pues se solapan en muchas ocasiones los TEA con otras patologías, por ejemplo, con trastornos de déficit atencional con/sin hiperactividad (TDAH), con TEL, con trastornos obsesivo-compulsivos (TOC), con discapacidad intelectual (DI), con diferentes trastornos de la personalidad, etc. Otro problema añadido es cómo varía la manifestación de los síntomas a lo largo del ciclo vital. Es imprescindible adoptar una perspectiva evolutiva a lo largo de todo el proceso diagnóstico y tener presentes las influencias ambientales (tratamientos diversos, implicación familiar…). A falta de marcadores biológicos que indiquen con claridad que es el autismo, en la actualidad el diagnóstico es clínico pero juega un papel importante la colaboración interdisciplinar (neurólogos, psiquiatras, psicólogos, logopedas, educadores, etc.) para concluir con éxito el proceso de diagnóstico. Necesitamos disponer, por un lado, de sistemas de clasificación eficaces y con reconocimiento científico y, por otro lado, de instrumentos de evaluación específicos para las personas con TEA, estandarizados, validados científicamente y con procedimientos específicos para su aplicación que eviten las diferencias debidas al examinador.Palabras clave: Autismo.

Tidak seperti tipe skizofrenia lainnya (hebefrenik, paranoid, dan katatonik), skizofrenia simpleks sulit ditemukan dan ditentukan diagnosisnya. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) V menghapus diagnosis untuk skizofrenia simpleks, namun dalam Pedoman Penggolongan Diagnostik Gangguan Jiwa (PPDGJ) III dan International and Classification Diseases (ICD)-10 masih disertakan. Studi kasus ini membahas pasien yang didiagnosis skizofrenia simpleks dengan diagnosis pembandingnya episode depresif berat dengan gejala psikotik. Seorang laki-laki bernama AY, berusia 28 tahun, dan tidak tamat sekolah dasar tidak memiliki figur ayah. Klien AY pernah bekerja secara wajar serta menyukai lawan jenis. Kemunduran fungsi psikologis kemudian terjadi. Simtom negatif dari skizofrenia pada AY sangat menonjol, yaitu sedikit berbicara, afek datar, menarik diri dari pergaulan sosial, minat dan ambisi kurang, dan dorongan vitalitas rendah. AY memiliki ide atau pikiran-pikiran bahwa dirinya bersalah, berdosa, dan memandang sesuatu tampak kotor sehingga terdapat perilaku mencuci yang berulang-ulang. Hasil integrasi tes psikologi menjukkan tanda-tanda patologis, yaitu depresi, cemas berlebihan, dan gangguan afek. Dinamika psikologi AY menunjukkan beberapa pengalaman traumatik pada masa kecil yang direpres. Konflik yang berkembang dengan ibu sehingga menghasilkan kompleks antara ego alien dengan ego. Kata kunci: skizofrenia simpleks, simtom negatif, diagnosis, ego ABSTRACT Simple Schizophrenia is an unusual type of schizophrenia characterized by slow, progressive development of negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as inability to meet community demands, and overall performance degradation. Unlike other types of schizophrenia (hebephrenic, paranoid, and catatonic), simple schizophrenia is difficult to determine the diagnosis. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) V cleared the diagnosis for simple schizophrenia, but in the Mental Disorder Diagnostic Classification Guidelines (MDDCG) III and International and Classification Diseases (ICD) -10 are included. This case study discusses patients diagnosed with simple schizophrenia with a comparative diagnosis of severe depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms. A man named AY, aged 28 years, and did not finish primary school has no father figure. He has worked fairly and liked the woman. The decline of psychological function then occurs. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia in AY are very prominent, ie, little speech, flat affects, withdrawal from social intercourse, lack of interest and ambition, and low vitality drive. AY has ideas or thoughts that he is guilty, sinful, and looks at something so dirty that there is repetitive washing behavior. The integration result of psychological tests shows pathological signs, such as depression, anxiety, and affective disorders. The psychological dynamics of AY shows some traumatic experiences in childhood that are repressed. Conflict that develops with the mother so as to produce a complex between alien ego with ego.

      "abstract": "Spanje sodi med osnovne človekove potrebe. Kvalitetno in dovolj dolgo spanje je ključno v vseh življenjskih obdobjih. Pomanjkanje spanja lahko privede do poslabšanja posameznih kognitivnih funkcij, sprememb na socialnem in čustvenem področju ter poslabšanja telesnega zdravja. Pravzaprav ni področja človeškega delovanja, ki ga pomanjkanje spanja ne bi prizadelo. Otroci z motnjami avtističnega spektra (MAS) spadajo med ranljivejše skupine v smislu velike soobolevnosti, kamor sodijo tudi težave na področju spanja. Le-te še dodatno ojačajo avtistično simptomatiko, kar lahko vodi do slabše učinkovitosti intervencij za uravanavanje vedenja, učenja socialnih veščin in/ali govora oziroma komunikacije in posledično slabšega oziroma počasnejšega napredka posameznika na omenjenih področjih. Prav zaradi tega je nujno širjenje ozaveščenosti o motnjah spanja pri otrocih z MAS in hkrati njihovo razreševanje s pomočjo znanstveno dokazanih intervencij. Vedenjske intervencije za obvladovanje motenj spanja pri otrocih so se izkazale kot eden najučinkovitejših pristopov k uravnavanju motenj spanja tudi pri otrocih z MAS. Na tak način lahko posredno vplivamo na boljšo dojemljivost in sodelovanje pri otrocih z MAS pri drugih intervencijah, kar lahko vpliva na hitrejši in boljši napredek na posameznih področjih učenja (socialne veščine, govor oziroma komunikacija ipd.). Prepoznavanje in ustrezno zdravljenje motenj spanja pri otrocih z MAS je povezano s celokupno boljšo kakovostjo življenja otroka kot tudi celotne družine. V prispevku predstavljamo glavne značilnosti spanja pri otrocih z MAS, pomen ustreznega prepoznavanja motenj spanja ter poglavitne nefarmakološke in farmakološke pristope za obvladovanje najpogostejše motnje spanja pri otrocih z MAS, nespečnosti.",

The term,,autistic spectrum disorders\" was established as a result of the magnitude of the intensity of symptoms and their proportions observed in all types of pervasive developmental disorders. Asperger's Syndrome (AS) remains the most controversial diagnosis in terms of its place within autism spectrum disorders. AS if often described as an equivalent of High Functioning Autism (HFA) or as a separate spectrum-related disorder with unique diagnostic criteria. Another important issue is the relationship between AS and speech disorders. Although it is relatively easy to draw a line between children with classical autism and speech disorders, the clear cut frontiers between them still remain to be found. The main distinguishing feature is the lack of stereotypic interests and unimpaired social interaction observed in children with speech disorders, such as semantic-pragmatic disorder.",

Apraxias are higher motor dysfunctions that affect performance and the imitation of actions or action sequences as well as the appropriate use of objects. The observed deficits do not result from paresis, ataxia, dyskinesia, paraesthesia, or the impairment of language understanding or recognition of objects. The most complex forms of apraxia are the ideational and ideomotor apraxia syndromes. They are derived from lesions of the language dominant hemisphere, though the manifestation is bilateral. In rare cases, with a lesion of the callosal fibres, a unilateral ideomotor apraxia in the extremities ipsilateral to the language dominant hemisphere can be observed.",

Outcomes range from recovery to chronic disability. Subtle premorbid deviances in motor, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral domains exist. Continuous symptomatology, brain matter loss, cognitive deterioration, excess somatic comorbidity, and premature mortality are seen throughout the life span. The proportion achieving full recovery is small (13.5%) and appears to be stable over recent decades. Many aged individuals with schizophrenia have a favorable clinical and social course. A gap exists in the areas of health and adult creative potential between people with and without schizophrenia.

The management will move away from the outdated notion of \"medically unexplained symptoms\" to rely on: the acknowledgment of the painful, debilitating and involuntary nature of the symptoms; the proposal of a positive diagnosis acceptable by the patient and an explanatory model compatible with his or her representations, aimed at putting an end to dysfunctional health care utilization; the proposal of therapeutic objectives aimed at functional rather than symptomatic recovery; the negotiation of pharmacological (selective or mixed serotonin reuptake inhibitor if necessary) and non-pharmacological interventions, especially when it comes to limiting the factors that sustain the disorder; the coordination of the various healthcare professionals.Le diagnostic de trouble somatoforme doit reposer sur une démarche tout autant négative – éliminer un autre trouble psychiatrique ou non psychiatrique qui expliquerait mieux les symptômes – que positive, c’est-à-dire fondée sur la recherche de pensées, d’émotions ou de comportements caractéristiques et de facteurs biologiques ou psychologiques pouvant favoriser, déclencher ou pérenniser le trouble. Examens complémentaires et avis médicaux spécialisés ne doivent pas avoir pour seul but de rassurer le patient ; ils peuvent en effet s’avérer iatrogènes. La prise en charge doit se détourner de la notion désuète de « symptômes médicalement inexpliqués » pour s’appuyer sur : la reconnaissance du caractère pénible, invalidant et non volontaire des symptômes ; la proposition d’un diagnostic positif acceptable et d’un modèle explicatif compatible avec les représentations du patient, visant à mettre un terme à l’errance diagnostique ; la proposition d’objectifs thérapeutiques visant un rétablissement fonctionnel plus que symptomatique ; la négociation des moyens pharmacologiques (inhibiteur sélectif ou mixte de recapture de la sérotonine si nécessaire) et non pharmacologiques, en particulier la lutte contre les facteurs d’entretien du trouble ; la coordination des soins entre les divers intervenants",

MemoryDefects of memory are either in the registration of new experience (antegrade) or the recall of past experience (retrograde).In gross dementia the patient may lose the ability to repeat a series of numbers he has just heard.This immediate type of defect is also seen in dysphasia, or whenever attention or concentration is dis- tracted-as in depression or acute confusional states.Short term memory deficit is tested by inviting the recall of a few numbers and two or three names after five minutes of other conversation.The limbic system, including the mamillary bodies and hippocampus, must be intact for new experience to be registered and recent events recollected.In Korsakow's amnesia, where the main damage is in the mamillary bodies, antegrade amnesia-learning ability-is permanently damaged and several years ofexperience are lost.After head injury an antegrade defect is noted but this is temporary.The retrograde amnesia shrinks until minutes or seconds before the accident.Deep memory, including childhood events, can be retained and recalled when limbic structures no longer function.The long term memory is tested by asking for details of the patient and his family and about important people or events.Moments of great personal pleasure or poignancy can be recalled most clearly.",

It aims to determine the educational implications for children with Down syndrome, CHARGE syndrome, and Usher syndrome. The chapter recognizes several resources to support children who are d/Deaf or hard of hearing with disabilities due to genetic causes. There are three primary genetic inheritance patterns: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked. Down syndrome is an etiology of intellectual disability (ID), which may also cause hearing loss and visual impairments, along with other physical issues. In most cases, children with Down syndrome have a moderate ID. Tracheostomies, renal issues, genitourinary issues, growth deficiency, genital hypoplasia, bone issues, sleep apnea, and delayed puberty are among the health challenges experienced by the children. Individuals with Usher syndrome, regardless of type, experience visual impairments due to retinitis pigmentosa. Estimates of intellectual or other learning disabilities in individuals with Usher syndrome vary.",

The earlier observers of this condition, among them Berkhan,<sup>1</sup>in 1885, apparently assumed that it was related to a general mental defect and described such cases as partial imbeciles (halbidiote). A more or less complete inability to learn to read, particularly when it is associated as it often is with atrocious handwriting and poor spelling, naturally enough would incline the uncritical observer to assume that the child was, if not truly defective, at least not as bright as he should be to accomplish his school tasks. Very often the logic of this explanation forms a typical vicious circle. The child is said to be feebleminded because he cannot learn to read, and his inability to learn to read is said to be because he is feebleminded. Gradually,",

      "abstract": "Introduction Sexual disinhibition is uncommon in patients with schizophrenia and are included within the behavioral disorders along with others such as agitation, aggression, sleep disorders and circadian rhythm, due to multiple reasons: isolation, rejection, difficulty in personal relationships. Objectives We report the case of a male patient aged 58 with multiple previous admissions for behavioral alteration symptoms, including exhibitionism. He is referred as irritable, uninhibited and sleeping disorders. There is a risk of flight as he is difficult to be held so it is feared that he can be run over by a car. He shows a marked self-referentiality. Methodology The patient is admitted. He properly gets used to the rules of the Ward. Pharmacological adjustment is performed. During his admittance he shows no behavior disorders neither episodes of self or hetero aggression and poor impulse. He properly makes comments of what happened during his stay. He responds well to treatment prescribed. Sleep pattern is restored. Results Schizophrenia (undifferentiated) 295.90 (F.20.3); intellectual disability mild 317 (F70); neurocognitive disorder (possible). Conclusions This is unusual case because it is normal that the sexual function of such patients is adversely affected, not finding numerous cases of disinhibition in our medical consultation. This is due to the different aspects that are affected, biological (drugs), psychological and social levels. We have different therapeutic alternatives to address this problem. However, they may hinder sociability and patient rehabilitation. Disclosure of interest The authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.",

      "title": "Poor insight and psychosis",
      "abstract": "A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don't know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the metarepresentation theory. This theory includes the awareness of ones' goals, which leads to disorders of willed action, the awareness of intention, which leads to movement disorders, and the awareness of intentions of others, which leads to paranoid delusions. The theory of metarepresentation implies mainly output mechanisms, like the frontal cortex, while the input mechanism implies posterior brain systems, including the parietal lobe. There are many similarities between the disturbances of awareness seen in schizophrenia and those seen as a result of known neurological impairment. Neuropsychological models of impaired insight typically attribute the disturbance to any of a variety of core deficits in the processing of information. In this respect, lack of insight is on conceptual par with alogia, apraxia or aphasia in reflecting disturbed cognitive processing. In this direction, research have implicated the role of self-monitoring in disorders of awareness and many of the core symptoms of schizophrenia, and has been suggested that these symptoms are the result of a disturbance of a medial frontal system involving anterior hippocampus, cingulated gyrus, supplementary motor area, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Poor insight seems to be something more than a symptom or an epi-phenomenon and its mechanism may constitute a core factor into the psychosis process. Also, poor insight would be involves a common mechanism for many other mental disorders or even it would be an independent and trans-diagnostic factor into the human personality, probably like the dimension of psychotism.",

      "title": "[Adopted children: risk factors and neuropsychological problems].",
      "abstract": "In recent years there has been a striking increase in the number of transnational adoptions in our country, which follows the trend already observed in other developed European countries. Major contributing factors to this phenomenon have been the improvements in socioeconomic conditions in our country, the drop in the birth rate, with the corresponding decrease in the number of children available for adoption, and the disappearance of orphanages. This growing demand can be met by developing countries, in which the birth rate is still high and there are only limited chances of being able to maintain offspring. The children that are adopted come mainly from countries in Central and South America, Eastern Europe and Asia. Pathologies that can be expected in adopted children include general paediatric conditions, especially infections (which are often autochthonous ailments in their own country) and malnutrition, as well as neuropsychological and developmental disorders, such as psychomotor retardation, conduct and behavioural disorders, which sometimes stem from conflicts arising in the process of adaptation, communication problems, which occasionally reflect an autistic like disorder, and the problems deriving from the circumstances that condition the donation of the child for adoption (perinatal pathology, maternal drug addiction and withdrawal symptoms, maternal psychopathology.). The pathology, history and prognosis of the adopted child depend on several different factors that act in an accumulative fashion. The country of origin plays a decisive role in the type of pathology, according to the level of the health care system that exists there, the existence of adoption programmes that are regulated by law, etc. The child's age at adoption marks the difference in the optimisation of their development, if they have early access to a stable family unit. Having stayed in institutions and the length of time spent there is a risk factor for presenting a neuropsychological pathology. On many occasions the scarce information available about the child's medical history makes it more difficult to anticipate the appearance of certain problems. The existence of social risk factors in the biological families is a conditioning factor in increased morbidity. We describe a short series of adopted patients who were attended in our Neuropaediatric clinic, and we analyse the above mentioned conditioning variables and the most frequent pathologies.",

It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma. Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

In an era of increasing incidence and survival of patients with single or multiple organ failure, knowledge on both multiorgan crosstalk and the physiopathological consequences of extracorporeal organ support have become increasingly important. Immerse within the cross-talk of multiple organ failure (MOF), Acute kidney injury (AKI) may be a part of the clinical presentation in patients undergoing ECOS, either as a concurrent clinical issue since the very start of ECOS or as a de novo event at any point in the clinical course. At any point during the clinical course of a patient with single or multiple organ failure undergoing ECOS, renal function may improve or deteriorate, as a result of the interaction of multiple factors, including multiorgan crosstalk and physiological consequences of ECOS. Common physiopathological ways in which ECOS may influence renal function includes: 1) multiorgan crosstalk (preexisting or de-novo 2)Hemodynamic changes and 3) ECOS-associated coagulation abnormalities and 3) Also, cytokine profile switch, neurohumoral changes and toxins clearance may contribute to the expected physiological changes related to ECOS. The main objective of this review is to summarize the described mechanisms influencing the renal function during the course of ECOS, including renal replacement therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation/carbon dioxide removal and albumin dialysis.",

The bizarre features of dreams may be divided into three broad categories: discontinuities, incongruities and uncertainties. Discontinuities are interruptions in orientational stability; incongruities are inappropriate syntheses of mismatching plot elements; uncertainties are confusions of distinct conceptions. Dream bizarreness appears to be the manifestation of some state-dependent cognitive process which is probably rooted in REM sleep neurophysiology. In the waking state, our brain/minds are capable of remaining focused on the normal flow of ongoing information, and such features of life as plot and time unfold in a linear sequence. In REM sleep/dreaming, this function appears to be interfered with, and disparate elements of consciousness are suddenly interjected as the brain/mind cannot maintain its orientational focus in the usual way.",

La lesión, que puede ser vascular, infecciosa, tóxica o degenerativa, incide sobre dos circuitos que podrían estar funcionalmente relacionados: el cortex frontal medial con afectación del cíngulo anterior, o el daño en regiones talámicas y mesencefálicas relacionadas con la formación reticular activadora ascendente.El diagnóstico de mutismo acinético resulta a veces difícil de establecer, y suele confundirse con algunos tipos de afasias o estados de alteración de la conciencia, que tienen un abordaje clínico y un pronóstico notablemente diferentes. Con el objetivo de llevar a cabo un buen diagnóstico diferencial proponemos un protocolo clínico con una evaluación neuropsicológica breve de las funciones que pudieran estar diferencialmente afectadas en todos esos síndromes, como atención, praxias y lenguaje. Exponemos un caso de mutismo evaluado con este protocolo para demostrar su especificidad a la hora de distinguirlo de otras afecciones o síndromes",

      "abstract": "In the middle of the last century the term od infantilism was introduced in medical terminology denoting the retardation in physical and/or psychic development with the features characteristic of childhood and adolescent age. From that time on, numerous authors have described various forms of retardation in the development and psychic infantilism in various aspects has been put in the first place, such as: dysharmonious, organic, cerebrostenic, neuropathic, dysproportional, endocrine and others. The retardation in the development of the vegetative nervous system was defined as a special form of infantilism by I. Popov in 1976 who suggested the term \"vegetative infantilism\". Conception of the idea of vegetative infantilism has made the theoretic basis for the whole range of very heterogenous appearances in the developing age being manifested as the sequal of the retardation in the development of vegetative nervous system, such as: affective respiratory spasms, encopresis, urination in sleeping (enuresis nocturna), urination at an awakening stage (enuresis diurna), various disturbances in the function of the cardiovascular system, digestive tract and others.",

      "title": "Caregiving Experiences of Families Living with Patients with Schizophrenia: a Systematic Review.",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of the review is to determine the meaningfulness of caregiving experiences of families living with patients with schizophrenia. The specific review question is: - What are the experiences of caregivers who live with patients with schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is one of the most severe and chronic mental illnesses characterized by a disintegration of the process of thinking and of emotional responsiveness.1 It most commonly manifests as hallucinations, paranoid, bizarre delusions, or disorganized speech and thinking as well as significant social or occupational dysfunction.2, 3 Schizophrenia affects about 24 million people worldwide.2 It is among the top 10 causes of disability-adjusted life year globally.4 Likewise, impairments of cognition, language, motor development, and social behaviour impact to patients' lifestyle, sense of well being and satisfaction reflecting to their QoL (quality of life).5 Thus, the patients with schizophrenia require help and care from others.6 In addition, in many countries, current mental health care policy focuses on encouraging patients with schizophrenia or mental illness to return to the community to live with their family. Consequently, the families of patients with schizophrenia are often required to play the major role of taking responsibility for caring these patients.7 Care activities for patients with schizophrenia are difficult, often long-term responsibilities of the families. Hence, the families are confronted with a challenging situation8 in order to balance between providing good care for their relative with schizophrenia, others members in their family as well as themselves. In this way, families have many tasks such as ensuring that the patients take prescribed medications, get sufficient food and sleep, conducting other daily living activities, as well as preventing them from potentially dangerous behaviour.9 The families are also confronted with additional problems including financial problems and worry about the general health and recurrence of illness of the patients in addition to management of the patient's behaviour.9,10 Meanwhile, the families have to take other roles in their life and family, including financial, employment, social life, physical health, marital and family relationships, and daily household activities. Families' lives may be disrupted by providing more care activities than would normally be anticipated.9 As stated, care activities for patients with schizophrenia may have a significant impact on all aspects of individual lives as well as the entire family system and this may have a dysfunctional impact on the family.9,10,11,12 The difficulties experienced by the families of patients with schizophrenia can be categorized into objective and subjective problems. The objective problems refer to practical problems such as disruptions in family functioning and relationships, constraints in social, work and leisure activities, general health disturbances, and financial problems. The subjective problems refer to the psychological reactions of the families such as stress, burden, feeling of shame, loss, guilt, anger, depression, anxiety, embarrassment in social situation, and stigma.13 Both objective and subjective problems impact on health and functioning of the families of patients with schizophrenia. These are associated with reduced quality of life.14 However, overcoming difficulties in care-giving can provide a sense of inner strength and satisfaction as major life challenges to the families of patients with schizophrenia.15 Thus, there are also some positive experiences of living with schizophrenia patients such as feelings of worth and achievement, a closer relationship with the patient10, fulfillment of parental duties and self-knowledge.16 These positive experiences can assist families to accept their caring role.10 Therefore, experiences among families of patients with schizophrenia reflect special issues and problems within the family that impact on their own quality of life as well as the quality of care. Families express a need for both physical and emotional support in order to care and cope effectively with patients with schizophrenia.8,10,17 It appears essential to raise awareness of the plight of families of patients with schizophrenia so that they are able to receive suitable support according to their different service needs. It is important and necessary for health care providers or mental health professionals such as nurses to know and understand the experiences among families of patients with schizophrenia including caring tasks, feeling or attitudes, needs, coping and overcoming obstacles. This information and knowledge will help health care providers or mental health professionals to develop appropriate interventions that aim to help solve problems and serve the needs of the family of patients with schizophrenia.18 Caregiving experiences among families of patients with schizophrenia can be studied in a holistic and meaningful manner by using qualitative approaches. For example, a study of families from a metropolitan area in a south eastern state in the USA explored the experiences of 26 families who were living with a patient with schizophrenia.19 Those families volunteered to complete the questionnaire known as the descriptive from of the instrument which measures the psychosocial variables including family coping behaviours, family psychological distress, family social support, and patient behavioural problems that influence on family functioning in families providing care for a family member with schizophrenia. Through the written descriptive data, the reactions, experiences, and perceptions of those families yielded the value issues of caregiving experiences of families living with schizophrenia. Researchers independently generated lists of categories of those written answers. Themes were identified and agreed upon through an interpretive lens. In addition, the findings were sent to the participants to confirm the findings. The results showed the feelings, issues, and concerns of providing care for a family member with schizophrenia as five themes: 1) overwhelming feelings, 2) importance of medication, 3) legal system difficulties, 4) family and friends, and 5) mental health professionals.19 Another study explored the caring experiences of 10 carers who are family members lived with someone with long-term schizophrenia, within the cultural context of Taiwan.10 The carers were interviewed face-to-face followed the semi-structured interview guide. They were encouraged to express or share their feelings and perceptions about their caring experience. Then, field notes and transcripts from tape recorders were analysed through phenomenological approach. The results showed three themes including 1) burdens of caring, 2) emotional burdens, and 3) strategies of coping.10 Furthermore, there are other qualitative studies which focus on caregiving experiences of families of patients with schizophrenia that indicated the similar results such as tasks or care activities that families must do, negative or sometime positive feeling toward patients, burden20,21,22,23,24 coping or ways that families used to manage the difficult situation25, needs of families as well as help seeking behaviours24 for support them. However, there appears to be a deficit of systematic reviews on the caregiving experiences of families of patients with schizophrenia. There was only one systematic review on the needs of family caregivers of a person with depression that indicates the caregivers are not prepared for the impact of the illness and that they need information about the development of depression, training in communication skills, and understanding on the importance of antidepressants in controlling the disease.26 There is no previously conducted systematic review on to determine the meaningfulness of caregiving experiences of families living with patients with schizophrenia. This systematic review, therefore, aims to synthesis research findings concerning the subjective caregiving experiences of families of patients with schizophrenia. It will help health care providers or mental health professionals to know and understand the experiences among families of patients with schizophrenia including caring tasks, feeling or attitudes, needs, coping or help seeking behaviours or ways to solve problems. The outcomes of the review may serve as basis information for public health guidelines or frameworks which aim to promote quality of life and quality of care for the family of patients with schizophrenia. The overall aim is to increase quality of life of patients with schizophrenia. The Cochrane Library, Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Library database and CINAHL database have been searched and no previous systematic reviews on this specific topic were identified as published or underway. Inclusion criteria Types of participants The review will consider studies that include the family of person (18 years and older) with schizophrenia diagnosed for at least six months by any criteria based on the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Third Edition Revised (DSM-III-R), the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition Text Revision (DSM-IV TR), the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10), or confirmed by their attending psychiatrists. Non-schizophrenic patients such as patients with psychosis, depression, bipolar, dementia, alcoholism, and substance-related disorders will be excluded. The family is defined as key persons who live or who are in close contact with the patient or who provide care or have taken on role as the main caregivers for a family member with schizophrenia. The caregivers should be at least 18 years old who can be parents, siblings, spouses, children, or other relatives. This review will consider studies in any culture. Studies that explore experiences of patients with schizophrenia will be excluded. Caregiving experiences are defined as any subjective data that families expressed or shared about their feelings and perceptions related to their caring or living with their schizophrenia member including caring tasks, feeling or attitudes or beliefs, needs, coping or help seeking behaviours or ways to solve problems. Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest The review will consider qualitative studies that explore caregiving experiences of families of patients with schizophrenia that related to their caring or living with their schizophrenia member including caring tasks, feeling or attitudes or beliefs, needs, coping or help seeking behaviours or ways to solve problems. This review will include studies conducted in either hospital or community settings. Types of outcomes The outcomes of interest include but are not restricted to the following 1. Subjective accounts of families of patients with schizophrenia related to caregiving. 2. Attitudes, beliefs, or feelings of families toward living or caring a patient with schizophrenia. 3. Families' perceived caring tasks, responses, or actions to patients with schizophrenia. 4. Perceived needs of families of patients with schizophrenia. 5. Coping, help seeking behaviors, ways to solve problems of families of patients with schizophrenia. Types of studies The review will consider any qualitative studies that draw on caregiving experiences of families of patients with schizophrenia, using research methodologies including, but not limited to phenomenology, grounded theory and ethnography. Search strategy Prior to commencing the review, a search of databases, Cochrane and Joanna Briggs Institute library of systematic reviews will be conducted to ensure that there is no systematic review conducted on lived experiences among families of patients with schizophrenia. A comprehensive search strategy will be developed to find both published and unpublished studies in English and Thai languages from 1990-2010. A three step search strategy will be used in this review as follow: 1. An initial limited search of journals indexed in MEDLINE and CINAHL will be undertaken followed by an analysis of the text words contained in the title, abstracts, and subject descriptors / MeSH terms of relevant articles used to identify additional key words. In this review, initial English keywords to be used will be: lived experiences or experiences, meanings, attitudes, beliefs, feelings, views, tasks, caring tasks, caring activities, roles, responses, actions, family or families, relatives, caregivers, careers, parents or father or mother, spouse or wife or husband, siblings, son, daughter, child or children, schizophrenia, qualitative. In addition, initial Thai keywords to be used will be: krobkrua = family, phudola = caregiver, yat = relatives, prasobkan = experience, tatsanakati or jettakati = attitudes, kwamchua = belief, botbat = role or task, jittaphet = schizophrenia, wijuy cheang kunnaphab = qualitative research 2. All identified key words and the synonyms will be used for the extensive search by respective electronic databases. Individual search strategies will be developed for each database, adopting the different terminology of index thesauri if available. The databases to be searched include: -CINAHL -EMBASE -Cochrane Library -PubMed - Science Direct -Scopus -PsycINFO -ProQuest -www.thairesearch.in.th and tdc.thailis.or.th/tdc (database for Thai study languages) 3. Reference lists and bibliographies of retrieved articles will also be searched for additional relevant articles. In order to avoid publication bias, hand searching will also be undertaken in journals which are not listed on databases but are known to contain literature in this topic of investigation to ensure all relevant materials are captured. The relevant unpublished studies such as conference papers, research reports, and dissertations will be searched by the following sources: -MEDNAR -Dissertation International -Conference Proceedings In addition, content experts will also be contacted in order to provide other alternatives for securing relevant literature. All studies identified during the database search will be assessed for relevance to the review objectives and full reports will be retrieved for all studies that meet the inclusion criteria as assessed independently by two reviewers. Discrepancies in reviewer selections will be resolved by discussion prior to selected articles being retrieved. Those studies meeting the inclusion criteria will be subjected to critical appraisal using a standardised Joanna Briggs Critical appraisal instrument. Assessment of methodological quality Papers selected for retrieval will be assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardised a critical appraisal instrument from the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-QARI) (Appendix I). Any disagreements that arise between the reviewers will be resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. Data collection Data will be extracted from papers included in the review using the standardised data extraction tool from the JBI-QARI (Appendix II). The data extracted will include specific details about the interventions, populations, study methods and outcomes of significance to the review question and specific objectives. Data synthesis Research findings will, where possible be pooled using the Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-QARI). This will involve the aggregation or synthesis of findings to generate a set of statements that represent that aggregation, through assembling the findings (Level 1 findings) rates according to their quality, and categorising these findings on the basis of similarity in meaning (Level 2 findings). These categories are then subjected to a metasynthesis in order to produce a single comprehensive set of synthesised findings (Level 3 findings) that can be used as a basis for evidence-based practice. Where textual pooling is not possible the findings will be presented in narrative form. Conflicts of interest There is no conflict of interest regarding this systematic review.

      "abstract": "Depression and dementia can lead to generalised cognitive and memory dysfunction. Thus, differentiating these disorders is important and challenging. Pseudodementia is a term used clinically to describe symptoms that resemble dementia but are caused by other conditions (most frequently depression), rather than being recognised as an official diagnosis. Pseudodementia is characterised by a cognitive impairment that mimics dementia but which does not have its origin in neurological degeneration, deriving instead from functional psychiatric conditions. This condition is more commonly observed in older adults (particularly those over the age of 50 or 60 years), and its risk factors overlap with those for depression. Pseudodementia is essentially characterised by deficits in memory, executive function and speech and, therefore, can easily be confused with dementia, although there are aspects that allow its differentiation. Diagnosing pseudodementia can be difficult, especially as there is significant overlap between its symptoms and those of other conditions. However, it is important to recognise characteristic aspects of this disorder, as its correct identification is essential for proper treatment.",

      "abstract": "The term “acquired brain injury” refers to any type of brain damage that occurs after birth. Two main types of acquired brain injury are stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI). A stroke occurs when there is a blockage or bleed in the vascular system of the brain, while a TBI results from an external force to the head. Older adults are at a higher risk of both stroke and TBI; thus, overall incidence is increasing as the proportion of older adults in the population is growing. Stroke and TBI result in immediate and long-term cognitive changes. Impairments in the domains of language, attention, memory, executive functions, perception, and social cognition have been documented following stroke and TBI. However, strokes tend to cause focal or selective cognitive disorders, while cognitive deficits following TBI are widespread and can be generalized. Individuals who have suffered a stroke or TBI may also experience psychosocial changes; for example, symptoms of depression and anxiety are common. Functional outcomes, including independence in activities, are varied and are associated with a range of factors including age, injury severity, cognitive disorders, and psychosocial factors. To achieve optimal outcomes for individuals following stroke and TBI, and to reduce the impact of the injury on everyday functioning, a multidisciplinary rehabilitation process is recommended.",

      "title": "A Study on Emotional Intelligence, Family Environment, Mental Health Problems & Pro-Social Behavior",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONAdolescence is recognized as an age of difficulties caused by rapid physical, emotional, intellectual and social changes that accompany it. Adolescents struggle and face newly encountered obstacles such as awkwardness, self discovery, independence, educational demands and puberty. This period is a critical period and needs lot of emotional regulatory skill development.Emotional Intelligence is defined as a major part of an individual's character that includes abilities such as being able (i) to motivate oneself (ii) persist in the face of frustrations (iii) to control impulses for (iv) to delay gratifications (v) to regulate moods (vi) to keep distress from swamping the ability to think (vii) to empathize and (viii) to hope.People with low emotional intelligence display behaviors and characteristics like poor impulse control, low self esteem, depression and suicidal feelings, aggressive behavior and self harm, increased stress, increased alcohol and drug use and even personality disorder due to insufficient ability to manage their emotions. In contrast, high emotional intelligence has been linked with increased well-being such as greater satisfaction with life and increased happiness.Quality emotions and feelings help students give their best potential in the classroom. The students who think negatively cannot concentrate for a long time and have more difficulty in reaching their potential than others.Family system is where the child learns when and how to express feelings, manage conflict, and negotiate differences. The general climate of the family will teach the child certain norms, values, and interpersonal skills. Family in general and parents in particular, are the important support system (Cox and Cox 1979).Expressed emotion has emerged as an important variable in studies of family and psychopathology. It is regarded as a measure of environmental stress in the home. Perceived criticism negatively correlates with emotional intelligence. People who perceived their families to be critical of them also perceive their family to be less close, less adaptable and perceive themselves to have less social support. Perceived criticism positively correlates with income, education of the parents. Respondent who perceived their family's intensely emotionally involved reported more social support and higher cohesion and adaptability. Perceived criticism had a higher correlation with depression and anxiety. This findings support the view that Expressed emotion may be related to a range of psychological problems.Need & importance of the studyVarious factors contribute to mental health problems. Studies reviewed showed that some demographic variables such as gender, parental occupational levels and family income had an influence on mental health and emotional well-being of adolescent. Research evidence showed few dimensions of emotional intelligence, perceived family environment and low pro-social behavior contributed to mental health problems of adolescents.OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDYTo analyze the influence of demographic variables on emotional intelligence and perceived family environment.To analyze the relationship between emotional intelligence, perceived family environment and mental health problems and pro-social behavior in adolescence.METHODThe design adopted was expost facto and primarily descriptive in nature.Variables in the study were as follows:Independent variables - Demographic variables - gender, parental education, occupation, family income, emotional intelligence, perceived family environment.Dependent variables - Mental health problems, pro-social behavior.SampleSample was selected from three aided schools in semi urban areas. One was girls' school and the other two were co-educational schools. All the students from the IX standard who were present in these schools on the day of testing which totaled 761 students were included for the study. …",

      "title": "Central ocular motor disorders, including gaze palsy and nystagmus",
      "abstract": "An impairment of eye movements, or nystagmus, is seen in many diseases of the central nervous system, in particular those affecting the brainstem and cerebellum, as well as in those of the vestibular system. The key to diagnosis is a systematic clinical examination of the different types of eye movements, including: eye position, range of eye movements, smooth pursuit, saccades, gaze-holding function and optokinetic nystagmus, as well as testing for the different types of nystagmus (e.g., central fixation nystagmus or peripheral vestibular nystagmus). Depending on the time course of the signs and symptoms, eye movements often indicate a specific underlying cause (e.g., stroke or neurodegenerative or metabolic disorders). A detailed knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of eye movements enables the physician to localize the disturbance to a specific area in the brainstem (midbrain, pons or medulla) or cerebellum (in particular the flocculus). For example, isolated dysfunction of vertical eye movements is due to a midbrain lesion affecting the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle, with impaired vertical saccades only, the interstitial nucleus of Cajal or the posterior commissure; common causes with an acute onset are an infarction or bleeding in the upper midbrain or in patients with chronic progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and Niemann-Pick type C (NP-C). Isolated dysfunction of horizontal saccades is due to a pontine lesion affecting the paramedian pontine reticular formation due, for instance, to brainstem bleeding, glioma or Gaucher disease type 3; an impairment of horizontal and vertical saccades is found in later stages of PSP, NP-C and Gaucher disease type 3. Gaze-evoked nystagmus (GEN) in all directions indicates a cerebellar dysfunction and can have multiple causes such as drugs, in particular antiepileptics, chronic alcohol abuse, neurodegenerative cerebellar disorders or cerebellar ataxias; purely vertical GEN is due to a midbrain lesion, while purely horizontal GEN is due to a pontomedullary lesion. The pathognomonic clinical sign of internuclear ophthalmoplegia is an impaired adduction while testing horizontal saccades on the side of the lesion in the ipsilateral medial longitudinal fascicule. The most common pathological types of central nystagmus are downbeat nystagmus (DBN) and upbeat nystagmus (UBN). DBN is generally due to cerebellar dysfunction affecting the flocculus bilaterally (e.g., due to a neurodegenerative disease). Treatment options exist for a few disorders: miglustat for NP-C and aminopyridines for DBN and UBN. It is therefore particularly important to identify treatable cases with these conditions.",

The growing number of seniors and comparatively low attention given to this reality among the medical community makes the problem highly significant for the practical medicine. Solution requires in the broad medical community a deeper knowledge of gerontopharmacotherapy and of its specific features, including the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics in elderly organism. Non-geriatric physicians will face in their daily clinical praxis the questions of drug interactions and undesirable general and local side effects. Moreover, some foods, beverages or preservatives can influence the pharmacological effect.

      "title": "I paint, I sing, I dance; I also have a mental illness: The importance of personally meaningful leisure activities in recovery from severe mental illness",
      "abstract": "Individuals with severe mental illness (SMI) often have sedentary and secluded life. It leads to compounded psychological and physical effects in the form of feeling isolated, having an increased propensity for lifestyle-related illnesses, and the like.[1] It affects the perception of others also, which often manifests as a narrow and negative approach to the patient and their problems. This approach creates an impression that the patient and their issues are inseparable and that their life revolves around those problems. It leads to neglect and underestimation of the patient's abilities, hobbies, and likings. For example, a patient with schizophrenia may be perceived as someone with eccentricities (e.g., talks to self) who does not adequately involve in daily living activities and remains secluded. Unfortunately, a patient may imbibe these perceptions leading to self-stigma, which, in turn, can affect their overall functioning.[2] It is, therefore, imperative that intervention for mental illness has a strength-based approach that focuses on the person's abilities apart from the target to improve the symptoms. Motivating patients to engage in personally meaningful activities they enjoy can be a step in this direction. It does not only defocus the attention of the patient and the caregivers from a \"symptom only\" approach but also help make the patient active, participative, and involved in what interests them. Given this, therapeutic recreation is being advocated as one of the ways to promote health and wellness in individuals with mental illness.[3] Therapeutic recreation promotes positive behaviour, such as social connectedness and cooperation, by involving people in therapeutic residential camping, leisure activities, and the like. Involving people in such leisure and recreational activities can be an effective way of reinvigorating those self-soothing and enjoyable activities that get subdued in the inactive life of mental illness. Furthermore, patients can be involved in such goal-driven recreational activities that reduce the illness effects. For example, specially designed cognitively stimulating recreational activities can effectively reduce the cognitive impairments commonly observed in people with severe mental illness. Likewise, group activities can help enhance social skills, decrease apathy (and other negative symptoms), and improve interpersonal skills. THE RESEARCH EVIDENCE Of late, there has been a surge of interest in understanding the effectiveness of leisure activities in promoting the psychological and social well-being of people with mental illness. Research indicates that involvement in personally meaningful leisure activities can boost recovery and aid toward active living for people with mental illness.[4,5] For example, enjoyable leisure activities and perceived active living consistently correlate with a sense of well-being and recovery.[5–7] Therapeutic recovery camps, aiming to involve participants in physically and mentally challenging activities, have been found to lead to a sense of determination to overcome the challenges caused by mental illness.[3] Activities that involve adventure and fun (such as rock climbing, picnic, and skating) can be physically stimulating, weight reducing (a common requirement in mental illness due to metabolic abnormalities), and a boost to self-esteem.[8] Also, leisure activities can act as a protector from mental illness. For example, a sense of meaningful use of time through leisure activities is associated with lower depressive symptoms.[9,10] NOT \"ONE FIT FOR ALL\" Since recreational and leisure activities can significantly boost the psychological and social well-being of people with mental illness, these activities must be part of the overall intervention plan. While doing this, a few things need to be kept in mind. For example: The activities chosen must be personally meaningful for the individual. The contribution of leisure activities in recovery and active living largely depends on what meanings the patients gain from those activities.[4,5] Perception of an activity to be personally meaningful motivates the individual to engage and continue it. For example, realizing that doing yoga with friends brings a positive mood, helps companionship, and revitalizes spirituality can be a driving force for engaging in it regularly.[4] Iwasaki and colleagues suggest that leisure activities can be meaningful for an individual if they promote a sense of belongingness, autonomy, competence, and other factors.[5] Active living does not limit to some physical exercises; it also involves activities that augment body-mind-spirit harmony and promote emotional health, social connectedness, creativity, and so on.[11] Recreational and leisure activities should be planned in a manner that it incorporates the patient's needs. For example, a patient with cognitive deficits can be involved in such activities that are cognitively stimulating. Involving patients to work in groups to create Rangolis (an art in which an array of colors is precisely used to create designs on the floor) can be an enjoyable activity with the potential to improve attention. INDIAN SCENARIO Unfortunately, there is a paucity of research from India about the effectiveness of therapeutic recreational activities for people with SMI. It has significant implications; for example, even if some centers involve patients in recreational activities, they are not guaranteed to be effective. At NIMHANS, we have started a structured recreational program that involves patients in various leisure activities according to their choice. A preliminary study shows that the patients perceive the benefits of these activities in terms of the experience of positive emotions, opportunities for social interactions, and the like.[12] We need more research exploring the utility of various approaches to actively include patients and their caregivers in focused recreational and leisure activities, such as recreational camping for a longer duration. We must remember that symptom amelioration is not the sole target of working with people with mental illness. Recovery is a broader concept with a strength-based perspective to enable an individual to lead a meaningful life and utilize their potential to the fullest. Recreational activities can serve as an important medium to attain this goal. Financial support and sponsorship Nil. Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts of interest.",

      "abstract": "The lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a group of inborn organelle disorders, clinically heterogeneous, and biochemically characterized by accumulation of nondegraded macromolecules primarily in the lysosomal and other cellular compartments. Given the common and essential cellular function of the lysosomal system in different organs and systems, patients afflicted with these disorders present a broad range of clinical problems, including neurological problems, visceromegaly, and skeletal deformities. Onset of symptoms may range from fetal period to adulthood. The neurological problems include developmental delay, seizures, acroparesthesia, motor weakness, muscle wasting, behavioral/psychiatric disturbances, cerebrovascular ischemic events, and extrapyramidal signs. Patients may present with symptoms later that include psychiatric manifestations, are slowly progressive, and may precede other neurologic or systemic features. Most of LSDs are autosomal recessive; however, a few are X-linked with symptpmatic female carriers (e.g., Fabry disease). In most of them, the diagnosis is established by biochemical and/or molecular assays. In terms of management, disease-modifying therapies include enzyme replacement, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and substrate reduction therapy. Patients and their families require genetic counseling regarding reproductive risks, disease prognosis, and therapeutic options. Investigations of disease molecular mechanisms provide insights into potential targets for the development of therapeutic strategies. Supportive care has been the key and essential for most LSDs, resulting in substantial improvement in quality of life of patients and families.",

      "title": "Failure to Thrive/Growth Deficiency",
      "abstract": "Definition CLASSIFICATION AND TYPOLOGY Although the diagnosis of \"failure to thrive\" (FTT) is made frequently, both the meaning of the term and its value as a diagnosis remain debatable. Because any serious disease can cause growth failure, the term FTT has little diagnostic usefulness. Classically, the etiology of FTT has been divided into organic and nonorganic types, with nonorganic FTT defined as growth deficiency without a diagnosable medical etiology and organic FTT defined as growth failure caused by a specific medical illness. A number of authors have questioned the adequacy of this dichotomous view, suggesting the need for a third category: \"mixed\" etiology. In this group of children, chronic, mild problems, such as recurrent otitis media in concert with behavioral problems, result in aberrant behaviors, such as difficult temperament, sleep disorders, and altered eating behavior, which together impair growth. Even in cases in which the growth deficiency is primarily due to organic or nonorganic causes, the problems seen in the children are often multiple (eg, infants who have cardiac failure also have feeding disorders). Given the multiple contributory factors to FTT and the lack of diagnostic specificity of the term, we recommend that it be abandoned in favor of the term \"growth deficiency,\" which describes the presentation of this entity: An underweight, often stunted, undernourished child.",

      "abstract": "Background: Sleep is vital for adolescents’ physical and emotional development; however, sleep disturbances and disorders frequently occur in this age group and affect their health and well-being. In this review, we investigated the prevalence, etiology, diagnosis, clinical characteristics, and treatment of sleep disorders observed among adolescents.Current Concepts: The diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder among adolescents include difficulties in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or waking up too early and feeling unrefreshed, which are observed at least 3 days per week over 3 or more months. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia typically includes identifying and addressing negative thoughts and behaviors associated with sleep and establishing a consistent sleep-wake schedule. Delayed sleep phase syndrome is diagnosed in individuals in whom sleep onset and wake times are persistently delayed by 2 or more hours beyond the desired or existing sleep schedule, which leads to excessive daytime sleepiness or impaired functioning. Behavioral interventions comprise sleep hygiene education, relaxation techniques, and phototherapy. Symptoms such as pronounced snoring, apnea observed by others, and gasping or pauses in breathing during sleep may indicate sleep apnea. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy is an effective treatment strategy for sleep apnea. A history of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy suggests narcolepsy, and treatment options include pharmacotherapy, behavior modification, and lifestyle adjustments. Restless leg syndrome treatments include behavioral therapy, as well as anticonvulsant and dopamine receptor agonist administration.Discussion and Conclusion: Addressing sleep disorders is important to promote optimal health and well-being of adolescents and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Early detection, accurate diagnosis, and individualized treatment improve sleep and overall health outcomes and promote academic and social success.",

      "abstract": "Elective mutism is a relatively uncommon disorder characterized by consistent failure to speak in specific social settings, such as in school, despite speaking fluently in a variety of other situations. Elective mutism is a very debilitating disorder for the affected child, as well as for their families, with detrimental implications for the development of social skills and learning if not offered appropriate support and treatment. The most promising treatment results have thus by far been achieved through a combination of cognitive behaviour therapy and supportive cooperation between parents, the school, and the treating child psychiatrist, occasionally supplemented with pharmacological treatments such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The available literature on this disorder is still very limited and consists predominantly of case reports. In recent years, however, there has been a growing focus on the etiology and general understanding of the disorder. While still disputed, it has been suggested that elective mutism might be understood as an emotional disorder on a par with e.g. separation anxiety and social phobia. Studies looking at the long-term course of the disorder are urgently required to elucidate whether children presenting elective mutism will be more likely to suffer from emotional disorders in adulthood, and may also ultimately lead to improved treatments for this disabling psychiatric disorder of childhood.",

In a short period of time, ideas about sarcopenia transformed from geriatric syndrome to disease. Initially, sarcopenia was considered in the context of gradual age-related deterioration in the functioning of all physiological systems. Over the years, it became clear that it can develop a second time, as a consequence of various diseases and pathological conditions. To date, there have been no generally accepted diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia. There are several tests and tools available for screening sarcopenia, the choice of which depends on physical capabilities of the patient, capabilities of the medical institution, and the purpose for which it is detected (research or clinical practice). From the point of view of human health, sarcopenia increases the risk of falls and fractures; impairs the ability to perform daily activities; is associated with the progression of major diseases and cognitive impairments; leads to movement disorders; contributes to a decrease in the quality of life, loss of independence or a need for long-term care. The presence of sarcopenia increases both the risk of hospitalization and hospitalization costs. The aim of the literature review is to provide an analysis of up-to-date information on the causes, pathogenesis, screening, diagnosis, treatment, and consequences of sarcopenia, myosteatosis, and sarcopenic obesity. The search for literature containing information on relevant studies was conducted in PubMed and Google Scholar by the following keywords: sarcopenia, dynapenia, myosteatosis, sarcopenic obesity, nutritional status, malnutrition.",

      "abstract": "Many patients seen today use sophisticated capacities for psychological reflection and premature synthesis to ward off knowledge of more primitive conflict and islands of unintegration. They show a precocious talent for free association, a talent they perversely misuse. Similarly, they enjoy access to a rich fantasy life, even as they subtly impoverish it. Effective therapeutic work requires that they suffer „traumatization”—experiences of dedifferentiation that undermine their considerable capacity to know what they feel and think. Structural and process variables interact with content variables in complex and ambiguous ways. As a consequence, estimates of the authenticity and „fit” of personal and interpersonal experiences and behaviors of both partners in the therapeutic encounter become necessarily involved. Such factors may increase the possibility of misunderstandings, but also of more authentic and firmly grounded understandings. Similar issues are eventually revealed in these patients' early lives, where psychological and other formulaic understandings were prematurely applied to offset overwhelmedness and other unarticulable experiences; the patientapos;s talents for ambiguity, irony, self-soothing, or responsiveness to others were, in effect, exploited at the expense of full psychological growth. Versions of this clinical presentation may be increasingly common in a new generation of analyzable patients. Clinical work with them is facilitated by a synthesis of contemporary developmental, structural, and object relations theory.",

      "title": "A window into the mind-brain-body interplay: Development of diagnostic, prognostic biomarkers, and rehabilitation strategies in functional motor disorders",
      "abstract": "Background and aims Functional motor disorders (FMD) present a prevalent, yet misunderstood spectrum of neurological conditions characterized by abnormal movements (i.e., functional limb weakness, tremor, dystonia, gait impairments), leading to substantial disability and diminished quality of life. Despite their high prevalence, FMD often face delayed diagnosis and inadequate treatment, resulting in significant social and economic burdens. The old concept of psychological factors as the primary cause (conversion disorder) has been abandoned due to the need for more evidence about their causal role. According to a predictive coding account, the emerging idea is that symptoms and disability may depend on dysfunctions of a specific neural system integrating interoception, exteroception, and motor control. Consequently, symptoms are construed as perceptions of the body’s state. Besides the main pathophysiological features (abnormal attentional focus, beliefs/expectations, and sense of agency), the lived experience of symptoms and their resulting disability may depend on an altered integration at the neural level of interoception, exteroception, and motor control. Methods and materials Our proposal aims to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms of FMD through a three-stage research approach. Initially, a large cohort study will collect behavioral, neurophysiological, and MRI biomarkers from patients with FMD and healthy controls, employing eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to develop a diagnostic algorithm. Subsequently, validation will occur using patients with organic motor disorders. Finally, the algorithm’s prognostic value will be explored post-rehabilitation in one subgroup of patients with FMD. Results Data collection for the present study started in May 2023, and by May 2025, data collection will conclude. Discussion Our approach seeks to enhance early diagnosis and prognostication, improve FMD management, and reduce associated disability and socio-economic costs by identifying disease-specific biomarkers.

These should be investigated first. But if the degree or rate of decline raises suspicion for cognitive deterioration, it is prudent to consider the possibility that a neurologic condition may be presenting insidiously. Particularly if the symptoms seem progressive or there is involvement of other organ systems, further evaluation is warranted. Visual abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and liver involvement are among the symptoms commonly associated with some neurodegenerative disorders. Clinical course is important to consider, as a relapsing course will be more suggestive of an inflammatory/autoimmune etiology. A progressive course is more concerning for metabolic disorders, including leukodystrophies.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS) is an established condition in cats that shares many similarities with human Alzheimer's disease (AD), where cognitive decline ultimately results in dementia. Cats with CDS display behavioural abnormalities, including excessive Vocalisation, altered Interaction with owners (increased affection/attention), altered Sleep-wake cycles, House-soiling, Disorientation (spatial and/or temporal), alterations in Activity, Anxiety, and/or Learning/memory deficits (i.e., VISHDAAL). These cats develop neuropathologies, such as accumulation of β-amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau deposits. Because of its similarities to those in the brains of people with cognitive impairment and AD, the domestic cat could be a natural model for human dementia studies. It is important to diagnose CDS promptly in cats, ruling out other causes for these behavioural changes, to provide effective management. Interventions include environmental enrichment (e.g., easy access to key resources, calming pheromones), dietary supplementations (e.g., Senilife, Aktivait for cats, SAMe), specific diets (e.g., containing antioxidants, medium-chain triglycerides) and, potentially, medication (e.g., selegiline or propentofylline). This article reviews the literature about CDS in cats, its causes, neuropathology, clinical signs, diagnosis and potential management options. By doing so, it furthers our understanding of this condition and allows improved health, welfare and quality of life of affected cats.",

Primary impairment of episodic memory often results in reduced semantic and autobiographic memory. Neuropsychological performance predicts academic achievement and everyday life functioning while subjective memory complaints are highly correlated with depression. Memory impairment is also influenced by initial brain damage, developmental retardation and dynamic factors (e.g., seizure frequency, medication). Damage of functional tissue, low mental reserve capacity, and poor seizure outcome increase the risk for postsurgical memory impairment whereas functional release due to seizure freedom counteracts negative impact. Preliminary findings indicate that postsurgical training improves memory deficits and encourage further research.",

Performing such examinations with deaf patients is a far more complex task, especially with traditionally underserved deaf people who have severe language deficits in their best language or communication modality. Many deaf patients suffer language deprivation due to late and inadequate exposure to ASL. They are also language dysfluent, but the language dysfluency is usually not due to mental illness. Others are language dysfluent due to brain disorders such as aphasia. This paper examines difficulties in performing a mental status examination with deaf patients. Issues involved in evaluating for hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking are reviewed.

      "abstract": "The spectrum of neuropsychological features of familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) have seldom been reported, possibly because of (a) the rarity of this hereditary form of prion disease; (b) frequent delays in diagnosis, and; (c) the typically rapid demise of the patient, which affords little opportunity for comprehensive testing or serial analysis. Here we describe the neurobehavioral characteristics of a 48-year-old right-handed male (JD) who presented with complaints of poor depth perception, unsteady gait, and unusual sensory experiences in his face and neck. JD was followed serially over the final 4 months of his 5-month illness. Immediately following hospital admission, he underwent a neuropsychological evaluation that revealed moderate to severe impairment of delayed (30-minute) verbal memory, tactual performance in his right hand, and word-finding ability. In contrast, other abilities that are commonly classified within the verbal, visuospatial, and memory domains showed minimal or no compromise. Parallel studies of electroencephalographic activity revealed diffuse slowing and, later, 1-Hz rhythmical discharges over the left hemisphere, and mild prominence of the lateral ventricles and cerebral sulci on magnetic resonance imaging. Autopsy revealed spongiform changes and reactive astrocytosis, and genetic testing demonstrated a codon 200 mutation in the prion protein gene. These findings indicate that CJD can result in clinical manifestations compatible with multifocal asymmetric cerebral involvement before more diffuse neurodegeneration ensues, providing a strong impetus for the study of additional cases. This long-term understanding can help to determine whether the multiple loci of clinical involvement are specified by genetic or epigenetic factors, or both.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Treating a patient with epilepsy involves more than just treating seizures. Many patients have associated learning and cognitive problems that can lead to significant difficulties at school or work, such as reductions in attention, IQ, language and perceptual skills, executive functions including problem-solving, verbal and visual memory, and motor speed. Children with epilepsy, even those with normal intelligence, often experience educational difficulties more often than unaffected children. These educational problems tend to persist into adulthood and are sometimes manifested as underemployment. The causes of cognitive impairment in patients with epilepsy include the effect of ongoing seizures, underlying structural brain lesions, and the adverse effects of antiseizure medications.",

      "title": "Sleep and circadian difficulties in schizophrenia: presentations, understanding, and treatment",
      "abstract": "Abstract It is common in mental health care to ask about people’s days but comparatively rare to ask about their nights. Most patients diagnosed with schizophrenia struggle at nighttime. The next-day effects can include a worsening of psychotic experiences, affective disturbances, and inactivity, which in turn affect the next night’s sleep. Objective and subjective cognitive abilities may be affected too. Patients commonly experience a mix of sleep difficulties in a night and across a week. These difficulties include trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping at all; nightmares and other awakenings; poor-quality sleep; oversleeping; tiredness; sleeping at the wrong times; and problems establishing a regular sleep pattern. The patient group is also more vulnerable to obstructive sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome. We describe in this article how the complex presentation of non-respiratory sleep difficulties arises from variation across five factors: timing, mental state, need for sleep, self-care, and environment. We set out 10 illustrative patterns of such difficulties experienced by patients with non-affective psychosis. These sleep problems are eminently treatable with intensive psychological therapy delivered over approximately eight sessions. We describe key techniques and their typical order of implementation by presentation. Sleep problems are an important issue for patients. Giving them the therapeutic attention patients often desire brings both real clinical benefits and improves views of services. Treatment is also very likely to lessen psychotic experiences and mood disturbances while improving daytime functioning and quality of life. Tackling sleep difficulties can be a route toward the successful treatment of psychosis.",

      "abstract": "Many mentally retarded autistic children can understand the concept of object permanence, but, in comparison to developmental-age matched normal children, the behavioral strategies they employ in carrying out the Casati-Lezine Object Permanence Test are deficient and lead to failure. These deficiencies appear unrelated to interference of stereotypic or other bizarre behavior in task performance. Similar problem-solving deficiencies can be found in mentally retarded children who are not autistic, suggesting that the deficiencies themselves are less related to the social-communication deficits of autistic children, but more to the general problem-solving difficulties found in children with a lower developmental quotient. Nevertheless, the qualitative analysis of results shows a tendency in autistic children, despite their better developmental level, to use less coordinated and regular sequences to solve the task than normal or mentally retarded children.",

One of the important developments in the modern understanding of DDs is the establishment of a clearer link between trauma and dissociation. Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is the most popular, widely discussed, and recognized of the DDs. Pathological possession has been included as a symptom of DID in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). Dissociative amnesia represents the classical functional disorder of episodic memory. Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (DPDRD) involves lack of integration of one or more components of perception and characterizes by \"the presence of recurrent or persistent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both\". The symptoms of depersonalization and/or derealization frequently co-occur in a variety of other psychiatric disorders, primarily in patients with anxiety disorders.",

It is estimated that a causative diagnosis may be shown in approximately 10-37% of the cases, including, congenital rubella, tuberous sclerosis, chromosome abnormalities such as fragile X syndrome and 22q13.3 deletion syndrome, Angelman, Williams, Smith-Magenis, Sotos, Cornelia de Lange, Möbius, Joubert and Goldenhar syndromes, Ito's hypomelanosis, as well as certain cerebral malformations and several inherited metabolic disorders. The case of a 3-year old girl is described, who was considered as autistic according to the criteria established by the DSM-IV manual for psychiatric disorders. She showed a delay in psychomotor development since she was 18 months old; she pronounces very few words (10), points to some objects, does not look up and it is hard to establish eye contact with her. She has paradoxical deafness and therefore, does not respond when called or when she is given orders, she is beginning to walk. She has not convulsions. Laboratory tests showed an anion gap of 31.6 mEq/L, lactate: 2.55: mmol/L, pyruvate: 0.06 mmol/L, and elevated lactate to/pyruvate ratio: 42.5. Under optical microscopy a muscular biopsy showed a reduction of the diameter of muscular fibers. The study of energy metabolism showed a partial deficiency of complexes III and IV of the respiratory chain, which allowed us to conclude that this was a mitochondrial dysfunction with an autistic clinical spectrum.",

      "abstract": "The article considers research methods and features of the functional state of the vestibular apparatus and vestibular disorders in children with sensorineural hearing loss. We used the methods of analysis, generalization and systematization of data from domestic and foreign literature sources on methods of studying the vestibular apparatus in children with sensorineural hearing loss. It was determined that the function of balance and coordination of movements is one of the most complex, and consists of several analyzers - visual, vestibular, proprioceptive and tactile. When studying the physical development of children with this pathology, attention is paid to the formation of the main static-dynamic and coordination capabilities according to the age of the child. In children with congenital sensorineural deafness, and especially double deafness, there are signs of vestibular insufficiency and impaired translational control, movement and gait. This affects the development of gross motor functions, such as sitting and walking, to a lesser extent affects fine motor skills, if there are no layers of other pathologies of the central nervous system.&#x0D; The pathological process in the auditory analyzer changes the function of the vestibular apparatus, due to their close location in the labyrinth and innervation by one cranial nerve, and in turn changes in the vestibular apparatus contribute to the formation of motor disorders. Therefore, we can observe a certain general principle of operation of the auditory and vestibular systems. At children who have low vestibular stability any turns, inclinations, sharp change of a direction of movement causes imbalance of coordination and balance of movements. All these delays in physical development, according to many authors, are cumulative in character and are caused by the hearing defect itself, insufficient information from the environment, difficulty expressing thoughts and desires verbally, as well as the state of the motor analyzer and vestibular activity. Children with hearing impairment have an insufficient level of coordination development, physical development, static and dynamic balance, spatial orientation. Researches of the vestibular apparatus, namely the functions of coordination and balance are carried out in several categories: the research of tonic vestibular reactions, coordination of movements and static and dynamic balance. Researches of tonic vestibular reactions are performed on the following tests: the test with outstretched arms, Vodak-Fisher test, pointing test Barani, finger-nose test, Holmagi test. Researches of static and dynamic equilibrium are carried out on the samples of Romberg, Grahe, Oppenheim, walking in a straight line. When analyzing these samples, we can talk about the degree of violation of coordination and stato-dynamic balance.&#x0D; As a result of vestibular compensation, children with sensorineural deafness can catch up with their peers with normal hearing with the help of visual and somato-sensory systems, pyramidal and extra-pyramidal systems.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders, a common concern in modern society, seriously affect people's physical and mental health. Reported findings suggest that both acute exercise intervention and long-term regular exercise intervention can improve the disrupted sleep structure and normalize the duration and proportion of the different phases of sleep. Moreover, exercise intervention has a positive effect on the endocrine functions, the metabolic functions, the immune response, the autonomic nervous system, and cardiac functions during sleep. It is a non-medicative therapeutic strategy for improving sleep disorders. The specific type of exercise intervention (aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, or meditative movement) adopted is one of the moderating variables of exercise intervention programs. Different types of exercise improve sleep disorders by way of different mechanisms. Exercise volume and intensity are another moderating variable of exercise intervention programs. The optimal amount and intensity of exercise for different individuals to improve sleep disorders may vary. Exercise interventions implemented at the different times throughout a day can also have varying degrees of impact on sleep disorders and there is no consensus on the optimal exercise time for improving sleep quality at present. Herein, we summarized the mechanisms by which exercise intervention improves sleep disorders from four perspectives, including epigenetics, hyperarousal, human circadian rhythm, and body temperature regulation. In addition, we discussed the current gaps and prospects of research in this field, aiming to provide a theoretical basis for the development of exercise prescriptions for sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "Introduction In the university stage, the student is exposed to many psychological changes, pressures, and conflicts, which makes him resort to many non-consensual psychological defense mechanisms such as (repression, justification, projection, relapse, denial, delusional illness, reverse transference, daydreaming), which causes an imbalance in the personality and its psychological functions. This may lead to cognitive and mental distortions and physiological imbalances, and the appearance of symptoms that cause psychosomatic disorders that are not due to organic physiological imbalances or bacterial diseases, but rather as a result of imbalances in the psychological functions of the ego ,Which increases the symptoms of headache, vomiting, poor digestion, irritable bowel syndrome, shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, hormonal imbalance, facial redness, and others. Objectives 1.Identifying the degree of use of non-consensual psychological defense mechanisms among university students, and the differences in this according to the variable (gender and degree of academic achievement) 1. Revealing the correlation between the degree of use of non-consensual psychological defense mechanisms and the emergence of disturbed psychosomatic symptoms in the functions of (the respiratory system, the digestive system, the cardiac system, the muscular system, sleep disorders, and bodily disorders). Methods The correlational analysis approach was used to study the relationship between the variables of the study. The sample consisted of 300 male and female university students. A scale for psychological defense mechanisms was constructed, and a scale for psychosomatic disorders prepared by Diop (2011) was adopted, and its psychometric properties were verified. Results The responses in the degrees of non-consensual psychological defense mechanisms were varied, with a high degree in (justification, projection, repression, and delusional illness) and a moderate degree in (relapse, daydreaming, denial, and reverse transference). Differences appeared between males and females in favor of males, while differences in academic grades were in favor of the lowest grade. The results also showed a statistically significant correlation between psychological defense mechanisms and the appearance of psychosomatic symptoms, as it was high in disorders (respiratory system, cardiac system, muscular system, sleep disorders), and moderate in (emotional disorders and somatic disorders). Conclusions There is a positive correlation between the degrees of use of non-consensual psychological defense mechanisms and the emergence of psychosomatic disorders, in the functions of several bodily systems and behavioral and emotional disorders.

      "abstract": "The mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) disorders are a group of rare, inherited lysosomal storage disorders. In each of the 11 MPS (sub)types, deficiency in a specific lysosomal enzyme (1 of 11 identified enzymes) leads to accumulation of glycosaminoglycans, resulting in cell, tissue, and multi-organ dysfunction. There is great heterogeneity in the clinical manifestations both between and within each MPS type. Somatic signs and symptoms include short stature, coarse facial features, skeletal and joint abnormalities, cardiorespiratory dysfunction, hepatosplenomegaly, and vision and hearing problems. In addition, patients with MPS I, II, III, and VII can have significant neurological manifestations, including impaired cognitive, language, and speech abilities, behavioral abnormalities, sleep problems, and/or epileptic seizures. Hydrocephalus is a frequent finding in patients with MPS I, II, and VI. Spinal cord compression can develop in almost all MPS disorders. Effective management and development of therapies that target these neurological manifestations warrant a profound understanding of their pathophysiology and progression in the different MPS types and best practices for evaluation and treatment. In order to obtain expert opinion addressing these topics we performed an online survey among an international group of experts with extensive experience in managing and treating MPS disorders. The results of this survey provide important insights into the management of neurological manifestations of MPS in clinical practice and are a valuable addition to current evidence.",

Human exposure to aerosols from ichthyotoxic cultures (> or = 2000 cells/ml) has been associated with narcosis, respiratory distress with asthma-like symptoms, severe stomach cramping, nausea, vomiting, and eye irritation with reddening and blurred vision (hours to days); autonomic nervous system dysfunction [localized sweating, erratic heart beat (weeks)]; central nervous system dysfunction [sudden rages and personality change (hours to days), and reversible cognitive impairment and short-term memory loss (weeks)]; and chronic effects including asthma-like symptoms, exercise fatigue, and sensory symptoms (tingling or numbness in lips, hands, and feet; months to years). Elevated hepatic enzyme levels and high phosphorus excretion in one human exposure suggested hepatic and renal dysfunction (weeks); easy infection and low counts of several T-cell types may indicate immune system suppression (months to years). Pfiesteria piscicida is euryhaline and eurythermal, and in bioassays a nontoxic flagellated stage has increased under P enrichment (> or = 100 micrograms SRP/L), suggesting a stimulatory role of nutrients. Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellates have been tracked to fish kill sites in eutrophic estuaries from Delaware Bay through the Gulf Coast.

      "title": "Optic Nerve Hypoplasia and Autism: Common Features of Spectrum Diseases",
      "abstract": "Autism is a developmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, problems in verbal and nonverbal communication, and stereotyped or repetitive activities and interests. Rather than a single condition, autism is today generally regarded as consisting of a spectrum of pervasive developmental disorders that together are known as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) is a congenital condition characterized by underdeveloped optic nerves and neurological impairment involving endocrine dysfunction and developmental delay, with or without brain malformations that are visible by way of neuroimaging tools. Increasing in prevalence, ONH is now the leading single ocular cause of blindness in children in the developed world, affecting 10.9 per 100,000 births (Patel, McNally, Harrison, Lloyd, & Clayton, 2006; Hatton, Schwietz, Boyer, & Rychwalski, 2007). Clinical observations and recent reports indicate a high frequency of ASDs in children with ONH (Ek, Fernell, & Jacobson, 2005; Parr, Dale, Shaffer, & Salt, 2010). In children with ONH, there are additional characteristics of ASD beyond those attributable to visual impairment alone, such as echolalia and stereotypic motor movements. We argue that ONH, like ASDs, should be considered a spectrum disorder to account for the range of severity in outcomes and symptoms associated with this condition. In addition, we believe the similarities in the two conditions illustrate the possibility of a shared neurodevelopmental origin. Comparing the similarities in these conditions may lead to a greater understanding of the risk factors contributing to either condition, as well as potential clinical outcomes, as the relationship is further explored. ASD AND BLINDNESS It is not surprising that ASDs are prevalent in children with ONH when one considers that published data indicate ASDs are overrepresented in the visually impaired population, with prevalence estimates as high as 1 case of autism in every 4 visually impaired persons (Brown, Hobson, Lee, & Stevenson, 1997), compared to 1 out of 110 in the general population (Rice, 2009). The behaviors and characteristics of children with vision impairment that resemble those of children with ASDs, including echolalia, pronoun reversal, stereotypic motor movements, and delays in developing pretend play, are often attributed to the vision impairment itself (Andrews & Wyver, 2005). These behaviors may be termed blindisms, since they are explainable in the context of vision impairment. (For example, rocking or spinning may provide needed vestibular stimulation in a child with limited mobility due to lack of vision; language development and social interactions may be impaired in congenitally blind children due to their lack of concrete experiences and visual models.) The similarity of these blindisms to autistic-like behaviors, coupled with the absence of autism diagnostic measures designed for use with people who are blind or visually impaired, complicates the diagnosis of ASDs in children who are visually impaired. Thus, the debate concerning whether true autism is prevalent in children who are visually impaired remains unresolved. ASDs AND ONH Most reports of ASDs in children with vision impairment (ASDVI) are limited to children who have severe congenital blindness regardless of any cause (Brown, Hobson, Lee, & Stevenson 1977; Ek, Fernell, Jacobson, & Gillberg, 1998). There are a few reports focused specifically on children with ONH. In a group of 13 Swedish children with ONH and blindness, 6 had ASDs and 3 had autistic-like conditions. The remaining 4 children did not fall on the autism spectrum (Ek, Fernell, & Jacobson, 2005). Parr and colleagues reported in a sample of 83 children with ONH and severe vision impairment (with acuities of worse than 6/30), 31 (37%) had social, communicative, and repetitive or restricted behavioral difficulties. …",

      "title": "Oropharyngeal Airway Three-dimensional Changes after Treatment with Myobrace in Class II Retrognathic Children.",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor-in-ChiefSeveral scholars pointed out the relationship between the function of muscle and teeth (1). The effects of breathing on facial growth and occlusion of the bite have been identified in various papers (2, 3). A breathing disorder occurs after upper airway blockage during sleep, it has not only nighttime symptoms such as snoring or apnea but also daytime symptoms such as behavioral disorder, excessive daytime sleepiness, concentration issue, memory, and cognitive function. Sleep is a physiological phenomenon essential for performing basic human functions and is important for normal growth and development, and for maintaining emotional health and immunity. Among various sleep disorders, Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) is a common medical problem for children (4). Among the sleep disorders, obstructive sleep apnea has been reported in Korean children and adolescents based on polysomnography, relative to other sleep disorders. Sleep-disordered breathing can be prevented myofunctional therapy, the neuromuscular toning and re-education of oral, facial, and pharyngeal muscles (lips, tongue, cheeks, face, and throat) through a series of activities which helps normalize the developing or developed, head and neck structures and function, with orthodontic treatment (5,6). A recent research literature review shows myofunctional therapy for those whose tongues block their airway during sleep can reduce these choking events by approximately 50% in adults and 62% in children and those lowest blood oxygen saturations, snoring, and sleepiness outcomes improve in adults (7).We now have the evidence-based studies to validate the success of treating patients collaboratively with a variety of disorders (e.g., orthodontic disorders, sleep apnea, orofacial pain) but, until recently, there were not enough studies using oral appliance and myofunctional therapy of Korean children and adolescents. Since cephalometric radiography was introduced by Broadbent to evaluate the craniofacial morphology, as recently reported (8), to evaluate the size of the airways and tongue in patients with sleep apnea, it is widely used, but, not be evaluated in three dimensions.Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a useful nondestructive method for 3D reconstruction that can be used to visualize and measure the morphological structures of hard and soft tissue on face. 3D models reconstructed from CBCT and tomographic images can display the precise anatomical structure of Oropharyngeal space. In addition, CBCT is useful for establishing realtime clinical diagnoses of patients and treatment plans (9). Programs that accurately measure complex structures of 3D models mathematically are available, but no studies have attempted to measure the Oropharyngeal space area using CBCT technology. So, our study was conducted to evaluate three dimensional changes after Myobrace (Myofunctional Research Co, Australia) appliance treatment for the children with OSAS symptoms (Fig. 1, 2). Our study confirmed the increase of oropharyneal airway dimension using Myobrace (Fig. 3). We excluded the sleep symptoms of the participating patients.Although the majority of childhood obstructive sleep apnea is due to hypertrophy of adnexaadenoid, there is no correlation between the magnitude of hypertrophy and the severity of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. …",

      "title": "NSDHL-Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics The NSDHL-related disorders include: CHILD (congenital hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform nevus and limb defects) syndrome, an X-linked condition that is usually male lethal during gestation and thus predominantly affects females; and CK syndrome, an X-linked disorder that affects males. CHILD syndrome is characterized by unilateral distribution of ichthyosiform (yellow scaly) skin lesions and ipsilateral limb defects that range from shortening of the metacarpals and phalanges to absence of the entire limb. Intellect is usually normal. The ichthyosiform skin lesions are usually present at birth or in the first weeks of life; new lesions can develop in later life. Nail changes are also common. The heart, lung, and kidneys can also be involved. CK syndrome (named for the initials of the original proband) is characterized by mild to severe cognitive impairment and behavior problems (aggression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and irritability). All affected males reported have developed seizures in infancy and have cerebral cortical malformations and microcephaly. All have distinctive facial features, a thin habitus, and relatively long, thin fingers and toes. Some have scoliosis and kyphosis. Strabismus is common. Optic atrophy is also reported. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CHILD syndrome is established in a proband by identification of an NSDHL pathogenic variant that results in loss of functional NSDHL protein. The diagnosis of CK syndrome is established in a proband by identification of a hypomorphic NSDHL pathogenic variant that results in partial loss of functional NSDHL protein. Management Treatment of manifestations: CHILD syndrome. No one therapy described to date appears to ameliorate the cutaneous findings for every reported individual with CHILD syndrome. Lactic acid 12% skin creams or lotions can reduce itching, and urea skin creams can reduce dryness. Treatment of an inflammatory nevus by grafting skin obtained from a contralateral unaffected region has been successful. Oral aromatic retinoids (etretinate) used to ameliorate cutaneous symptoms have been found to be of limited use and not well tolerated. Topical statins may be beneficial for the treatment of inflammatory nevus. Scoliosis and joint contractures are treated with braces and/or corrective surgery. CK syndrome. Behavior modification and/or drug therapy to control aggression and help with ADHD symptoms; anti-seizure medication to control seizures. Surveillance: CHILD syndrome. Monitoring for new cutaneous lesions and musculoskeletal deformities such as scoliosis and joint contractures. CK syndrome. Monitoring for the effectiveness of AEDs in controlling seizures and for the development of scoliosis/kyphosis. Genetic counseling The NSDHL-related disorders are inherited in an X-linked manner. No affected male has reproduced. CHILD syndrome is usually male lethal during gestation. Affected females have a 50% chance of transmitting the NSDHL pathogenic variant in each pregnancy; however, the expected live born distribution of persons at risk for CHILD syndrome is 33% unaffected females, 33% affected females, and 33% unaffected males. CK syndrome is diagnosed in males. Heterozygous females have a 50% chance of transmitting the NSDHL pathogenic variant in each pregnancy; males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will have normal physical features, intellect, and brain imaging but may display behavioral problems such as irritability and aggression. Testing of at-risk female relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk for an NSDHL-related disorder are possible if the pathogenic variant has been identified in the family.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nWHO defines dementia as a “syndrome due to\r\nDisease of brain, usually of a chronic progressive nature, in which\r\nThere is disturbance of multiple cortical functions, calculations,\r\nLearning capacity, language and judgement. Consciousness is not\r\nClouded. Impairments in cognitive functions are commonly\r\nAccompanied, and occasionally preceded by emotional control,\r\nSocial behaviour and motivation”.\r\nDementia is defined as “ the development of\r\nMultiple cognitive deficits that include memory impairment and at\r\nLeast one of the following: aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or a disturbance\r\nIn executive functioning, where executive functioning involves\r\nSelection of key information and behaviours for problem solving and\r\nThe inhibition of inappropriate responses”(DSM IV, TR).\r\nThe most common causes of dementia in\r\nIndividuals older than 65 years of age are: Alzheimer’s disease,\r\nVascular dementia and mixed vascular and Alzheimer’ s disease, of\r\nWhich Alzheimer’s disease accounts for approximately 60% of all\r\nDementias. The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease is 3 to 5% of\r\nPeople older than 65 years of age and as much as 50% of people\r\nOlder than 85 years of age. The female to male ratio is approximately\r\n2:1.\r\nPatients with Alzheimer’s disease display\r\nCharacteristic cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms over the course\r\nOf the illness. Neuropsychiatric symptoms may be prominent at\r\nPresentation or emerge later in the course. Almost all patients are\r\nAffected at some point in their disease.\r\nNeuropsychiatric symptoms in\r\nAlzheimer’s disease have significant consequences. Disorders such\r\nAs depression, anxiety, and psychosis clearly affect the quality of life\r\nOf the patient. Besides being a source of considerable stress,\r\nCaregiver burden and potential injury, such disturbances are\r\nAssociated with increased use of psychotropic medications, patient\r\nAnd caregiver abuse. Non-cognitive symptoms are associated with an\r\nIncreased risk for institutionalization, which carries with it financial\r\nConsequences for the individual and for society.\r\nCharacteristics of Neuropsychiatric symptoms\r\nIn Alzheimer’s disease include the following:\r\n They may be the sentinel event heralding the onset of\r\nAlzheimer’s disease.\r\n Several types of symptoms may occur simultaneously,\r\nFluctuate and recur over the course of illness.\r\n They tend to become more frequent as the disease progresses.\r\n They are associated with rapid cognitive decline and worsen\r\nFunction.\r\n They may lead to institutionalization.\r\n Importantly, these Neuropsychiatric symptoms may improve\r\nWith cholinergic therapy, disease modifying therapy and\r\nPsychotropic agents.\r\nThe Neuropsychiatric symptoms play an\r\nImportant role in the diagnosis and management of Alzheimer’s\r\nDisease.

Functional Neurological Symptoms (FNS) manifest as neurological symptoms such as tremor, weakness, seizures and cognitive or sensory disturbance, but the clinical examination points away from an organic cause and investigations fail to find one. FNS are involuntary and unwanted and are clinically significant because of associated disability. Functional seizures are one of the most common functional neurological presentations.

In autism, there is a marked reduction in, or oddity of, social communication, and an increase of repetitive and stereotyped behaviours. In psychoses, including schizophrenia and catatonia, there is disordered testing of reality (resulting in hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech), and deficits in volition (involving apathy, social isolation, and lack of initiative). These are described as they present in children and young people, together with their prevalence and the coexistent problems of emotion and behaviour that occur frequently. The longitudinal course is considered up to the transition into adult life. Potential causes and pathophysiology are considered in so far as they apply specifically to these disorders.",

      "abstract": "A stressor above a threshold magnitude, or multiple stressors applied simultaneously, cause an organism to alter its behaviour and physiology, with the aim of maintaining homeostasis. The adaptive changes that occur are coordinated and mediated by the stress system in the central nervous system (which includes corticotrophin-releasing hormone and noradrenergic neurons in the hypothalamus and brainstem, respectively), and its peripheral limbs, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the autonomic (sympathetic) system. Controlled or self-driven challenges to homeostasis and a normally functioning stress system are crucial for normal development and preservation of self and species. In childhood and adolescence, appropriately functioning neuroendocrine responses to stressors are necessary to allow growth and psychosexual maturation to progress normally. Maladaptive neuroendocrine responses, i.e. dysregulation of the stress system, may lead to disturbances in growth and development and cause psychiatric, endocrine/metabolic and/or autoimmune diseases or vulnerability to such diseases, not only during childhood and adolescence, but also in adulthood.",

      "abstract": "The relevance of the work is due to the fact that the professional activities of law enforcement officers in wartime conditions have become as close as possible in terms of content to the performance of combat missions. In this context, the issues of violations of law enforcement officers' adaptation to a new extreme professional environment have become relevant. The purpose of our work was to identify the most informative markers of law enforcement officers' maladaptation in conditions of participation in combat operations. Maladaptation in the work is presented as a violation of a person's adaptation to environmental changes, which is manifested by inadequate reactions to the nature of stimuli. The most common psychological phenomena that indicate a breakdown of compensatory mechanisms of the psyche and precede maladaptive disorders are: nervous demobilization syndrome, stressful search activity, torpid reaction, which manifests itself in a boring, disoriented state; reaction of dissociation of subject and object, indefinite temporary state, illusion of false invulnerability (frivolity, reckless actions, etc.), pseudo-primitivism (indifference, passive submission and apathy), delusion of grandeur in miniature, experience of loss of the future (feeling of inner emptiness and meaninglessness of existence), temporary addictive behaviour (aggressiveness, use of alcohol and drugs, etc.). It has been established that the psychological state of police combatants is influenced by a number of factors, the timely processing of which significantly reduces the level of maladaptive disorders. Such factors include the lack of combat experience and appropriate behavioural patterns, knowledge of what to do in a particular combat situation, necessary developed skills and abilities, clear organization, and, conversely, the presence of a negative example from a commander or reference persons, death, injury of colleagues, and personal level of response.",

Emotional and behavioural disorders often occur in people with ID. Emotional and behavioural disorders (EBD) are characterised by aggressive, auto-aggressive and delinquent behaviour. The occurrence of EBD is influenced by various biological, ecological, social and personality factors.\r\nArts therapies, as a subtype of art therapy, turned out to be useful in dealing with people with ID associated with EBD. The goal of arts therapies is to improve the quality of people's lives, which includes many areas of life for an individual. For people with ID, it is particularly effective, because it offers communication along the other path and offers the possibility of developing its own identity through the development of the painting style. Arts therapies is characterised by the triangular relationship which includes a participant, an art product, and a therapist. Their mutual relationship is significant. Arts therapies has certain phases and structure of therapeutic meetings. It can be individually, collectively or combined. Different art therapy techniques and activities are used according to the participant's characteristics and goals that we want to achieve. Knowing and adapting art materials is essential, primarily when working with people with ID. It is crucial to know the development of artistic expression and the specificity of the development of artistic expression in persons with ID.\r\nIn the empirical part, we used three case studies to determine the impact of arts therapies in the treatment of people with ID associated with EBD. The influence of arts therapies was observed in the areas of self-image, autonomy, self-initiative and perseverance, communication, social interaction and specific behavioural areas specific to individual EBD. In the study were involved three people with moderate ID associated with mild EBD, with between 18 and 37 years of age. In determining the initial and final condition, we used the standardized Adaptive Behavior Scale form The American Association for Mental Deficiency (AAMD) (Igric in Fulgosi-Masnjak, 1991) and questionnaire customised by 'Evaluation List of Aid with Art' (Evalvacijski list Pomoci z umetnostjo) from the author E. Bizjak (2007). The scales and the questionnaires were filled by a professional who personally knows participants. The research showed that arts therapies has positive effects on participants, especially in the areas of challenging behaviour, autonomy and self-image. Arts therapies also had a positive impact on the areas of self-initiative and perseverance, social relations and communication. It has been concluded that for significant changes in this population, it would be necessary to carry out arts therapies for a more extended period, at least two years or more.",

      "title": "Consanguinity and Mental Disorder",
      "abstract": "One difficulty which hinders the advance of psychiatry is that the facts of a mental disorder are not easy to describe and to record accurately. Many of the descriptive words used, such as “depression”, “confusion”, are taken from common speech and carry with them vague meanings. Out of sympathy with the sufferer, we tend to read our own emotions into the clinical picture. Moreover, because a disorder of thought and behaviour is a disorder of adaptation to living, the description of a mental disease involves not only the recording of the symptoms, but also a description of the circumstances and life-setting in which they occur. Another difficulty lies in the great variation in the clinical pictures of mental disorder. These vary so much that a diagnostic label such as affective psychosis or schizophrenia does not convey, and indeed is not intended to convey, an idea of a specific disease. These difficulties are somewhat more marked in the investigation of mental disorder in contrast to the investigation of mental defect. The statement that a patient is a Mongol or a cerebral diplegic conveys the idea of a fairly definite clinical syndrome, whereas a statement that a person suffers from schizophrenia calls up a much less clear mental picture. It seems that the only way out of this difficulty is to give a short statement of the clinical facts about each psychotic whom one discusses.",

      "title": "Concussion in Sport",
      "abstract": "Concussions affect millions of athletes of all ages each year in a variety of sports. Athletes in certain sports such as American football, ice hockey, rugby, soccer, and combative sports like boxing are at higher risk for concussion. Direct or indirect mechanical forces acting on the skull and brain cause a concussion, which is a milder form of brain injury. Conventional neuroimaging (e.g., computerized tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) for concussion is typically negative. Concussions involve both neurometabolic and subtle structural damage to the brain that results in signs (e.g., loss of consciousness [LOC], amnesia, confusion), symptoms (e.g., headache, dizziness, nausea), and functional impairment (e.g., cognitive, balance, vestibular, oculomotor). Symptoms, impairment, and recovery time following concussion can last from a few days to weeks or months, based on a variety of risk factors, including younger age, female sex, history of concussion, and history of migraine. Following a concussion, athletes may experience one or more clinical profiles, including cognitive fatigue, vestibular, oculomotor, post-traumatic migraine (PTM), mood/anxiety, and/or cervical. The heterogeneous nature of concussion warrants a comprehensive approach to assessment, including a thorough clinical examination and interview; symptom inventories; and cognitive, balance, vestibular, oculomotor, and exertion-based evaluations. Targeted treatment and rehabilitation strategies including behavior management, vestibular, vision, and exertion therapies, and in some cases medication can be effective in treating the various concussion clinical profiles. Some athletes experience persistent post-concussion symptoms (PCS) and/or psychological issues (e.g., depression, anxiety) following concussion. Following appropriate treatment and rehabilitation strategies, determination of safe return to play is predicated on being symptom-free and back to normal levels of function at rest and following exertion. Certain populations, including youth athletes, may be at a higher risk for worse impairment and prolonged recovery following concussion. It has been suggested that some athletes experience long-term effects associated with concussion including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). However, additional empirical studies on the role of concussion on CTE are needed, as CTE may have multiple causes that are unrelated to sport participation and concussion.",

      "title": "Virtual autism among children: A leading hazard of gadget exposure and preventive measures",
      "abstract": "Dear Sir, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder involving social communication challenges, repetitive behaviors, and restricted interests, with varying symptom severity. \"Virtual autism\" is excessive device use. The prevalence was estimated at 61.9/10,000 globally in 2012, and more than 2 million people may have ASD in India.[1] The study explores \"virtual autism,\" its causes, and protective measures, emphasizing a balanced approach to child development in the digital age. Understanding Virtual Autism Virtual autism describes symptoms in children due to excessive digital device use, including social withdrawal, communication issues, physical inactivity, attention problems, and developmental delays.[2] Consequences and Potential Risk Extensive screen time may lead to negative outcomes for children. They are as follows: Impaired Social Skills: Excessive screen time limits crucial face-to-face social interactions for skill development. Language and Communication Delays: Extended screen exposure may cause language and communication delays. Reduced Physical Activity: Prolonged screen use leads to a sedentary lifestyle linked to health issues, including obesity. Sleep Problems: Screens before bedtime disrupt sleep patterns, leading to sleep issues. Attention Difficulties: Some studies suggest excessive screen time may cause attention difficulties. Emotional and Behavioral Issues: Prolonged exposure to certain screen content, like violence, can negatively affect children emotionally and behaviorally.[3] Limitations and Controversies of VR/Technology in ASD Privacy Issues: Sensitive data collection in VR raises privacy and security concerns. Over-Reliance on Tech: Debate questions impact on holistic development. Skill Transfer: VR may struggle to transfer skills to real-world scenarios. Long-Term Effects: Uncertainty in VR's impact on autism therapy. Balanced Approach: Requires ethics, efficacy, inclusivity in ASD care.[4] Preventive Measures Preventing \"virtual autism\" requires a holistic approach involving parents, educators, and policymakers. Key steps include setting screen time limits, selecting age-appropriate content, promoting physical activity, nurturing in-person relationships, and teaching digital literacy. The following tactics and preventive actions are described in the paper: Screen Time Limits: Establish age-appropriate screen time standards, ensuring a balanced mix of digital and non-digital activities for children. Educational Content: Promote educational materials fostering cognitive growth and critical thinking. Digital Literacy: Teach technology and internet safety for informed decision-making. Parental Supervision: Actively engage in monitoring and discussing internet activities with children. Physical Activity: Encourage exercise and outdoor play to counteract sedentary screen time. Professional Guidance: Seek help from experts when signs of virtual autism appear. Parental and Educational Roles: Emphasize parental involvement, open communication, and healthy technology use.[5] Policy Implications The paper addresses policymakers' role in regulating and raising awareness about children's gadget exposure, highlighting potential policy measures like age-appropriate content rules, advertising limitations, and public health campaigns. Conclusion \"Virtual autism\" raises concerns about technology's impact on children. This paper emphasizes the need to recognize risks from extended screen time and promotes proactive prevention involving parents, educators, and policymakers. Ongoing research and evidence-based guidelines are crucial to understanding technology's impact on child development, ensuring a balanced digital environment for children.

A nivel biologico las alteraciones que se producen en el organismo debido a la malnutricion y las conductas purgativas deben ser tenidas en cuenta para no confundir las manifestaciones psicologicas debidas a alteraciones somaticas con trastornos de la personalidad, ni con interacciones familiares disfuncionales. Por otro lado el abordaje puramente somatico es necesario, ya sea normalizando las constantes vitales, recetando farmacos psicotropos, o regulando una dieta adecuada. A nivel psicologico las alteraciones de la personalidad previa, una deficiente autoimagen y baja autoestima que se asientan sobre una base depresiva, se ven incrementadas por las conductas alimentarias disfuncionales. Estas alteraciones psicologicas deben ser estudiadas en detalle para incluirlas como objetivo terapeutico (Espina, 2003). A nivel social, la moda de la delgadez y el exito en la sociedad occidental, hace que personas susceptibles sean mas vulnerables a padecer trastornos alimentarios. Por otro lado, las relaciones familiares pueden tener unas caracteristicas, especialmente la dificultad de autonomizacion de sus miembros y las alteraciones de la comunicacion, que son terreno abonado para la aparicion de trastornos alimentarios en personas susceptibles. Estos factores, junto con acontecimientos vitales estresantes (separaciones, perdidas, fracasos...), pueden jugar un papel etiologico y, cuando el TCA esta establecido, actuar como factores de mantenimiento (Espina, 1998a).",

How the cognition progress to dementia is a key to be explored. The cognitive impairment shows two profiles: cortical (memory encoding, visuospatial abilities, and language) and subcortical, with a dysexecutive syndrome that includes deficits in recognition memory, attention processes, and visual perception as well as visual hallucinations and cognitive fluctuations. Behavioral problems such as apathy, anxiety, depression, and impulse control disorders take a significant part in the loss of autonomy and progression of the disease. To detect the risk of Parkinson’s disease dementia development, the integral evaluation of patients in all stages of the disease should consider the interplay of genetic and epigenetic factors, motor subtypes, and non-motor symptoms (NMS) in order to implement different therapeutics and supportive strategies when they are likely to have efficacy.",

Maintenance and restoration of sexual function, of which pregnancy is a consequential part, is a goal of neurological rehabilitation (1). In practice, however, professional attention to the sexual problems of people with disabilities (and perhaps in women with disabilities in particular) is often inadequate, delayed or non-existent. When undertaken, an assessment must take sensitive account of a patient's history, personality and social setting. It may be difficult to return to a pre-existing relationship following the acquisition of physical disability. For example, following a brain injury there may be personality change, unstable mood, and fatigability. Following a spinal injury there will be a change or loss in mobility, sexual responses and sensory functions. New sexual and relationship problems may not resolve spontaneously with time, and may become entrenched and unmanageable unless addressed expertly and appropriately in a timely way.",

The study of the cognitive and behavioral effects in simulated driving conditions has shown the negative impact of sleep deprivation on driving performance, with impairments that are proportionate to the magnitude of the sleep restriction and the time of driving. The negative effect of sleep deprivation is usually associated with that of circadian factors as well as that of pathological (sleep disorders) and/or pharmacological or toxic factors. In the case of uncomplicated sleep deprivation, two countermeasures have been shown to be effective: caffeine and/or a short nap. Their use must be tailored to the need of each individual driver.

      "abstract": "Abstract Dementia is broadly defined by DSM-V as cognitive decline from a previous level that impacts the patient's functioning at work or play. This broad definition does not provide information about the underlying disease process, an aspect of clinical care that is of increasing importance, as therapeutic development inches closer to effective disease-modifying treatments. The most common neurodegenerative dementias include Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia, and Parkinson's disease dementia. Although rare, the prion diseases constitute an important group of dementias that should be routinely considered in the evaluation. Over the last two decades, advances in neuroimaging, biomarker development, and neurogenetics have not only led to a better understanding of the biology of these diseases, but they have improved our awareness of less common clinical subtypes of dementia. As such, to best define the disease process, the evaluation of a patient with cognitive decline requires attention to a myriad of disease aspects, such as the primary symptom at onset (memory, language, visual perception, praxis, etc.), the age at onset (younger or older than 65 years), the rate of disease progression (weeks to months or years), the cognitive and behavioral profile (neuropsychological assessment), and involvement of physical findings. We present here three cases that highlight the decision-making process in the evaluation of patients with atypical presentations of dementia.",

      "title": "Disturbed Balance of Inhibitory Signaling Links Hearing Loss and Cognition",
      "abstract": "Neuronal hyperexcitability in the central auditory pathway linked to reduced inhibitory activity is associated with numerous forms of hearing loss, including noise damage, age-dependent hearing loss, and deafness, as well as tinnitus or auditory processing deficits in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In most cases, the reduced central inhibitory activity and the accompanying hyperexcitability are interpreted as an active compensatory response to the absence of synaptic activity, linked to increased central neural gain control (increased output activity relative to reduced input). We here suggest that hyperexcitability also could be related to an immaturity or impairment of tonic inhibitory strength that typically develops in an activity-dependent process in the ascending auditory pathway with auditory experience. In these cases, high-SR auditory nerve fibers, which are critical for the shortest latencies and lowest sound thresholds, may have either not matured (possibly in congenital deafness or autism) or are dysfunctional (possibly after sudden, stressful auditory trauma or age-dependent hearing loss linked with cognitive decline). Fast auditory processing deficits can occur despite maintained basal hearing. In that case, tonic inhibitory strength is reduced in ascending auditory nuclei, and fast inhibitory parvalbumin positive interneuron (PV-IN) dendrites are diminished in auditory and frontal brain regions. This leads to deficits in central neural gain control linked to hippocampal LTP/LTD deficiencies, cognitive deficits, and unbalanced extra-hypothalamic stress control. Under these conditions, a diminished inhibitory strength may weaken local neuronal coupling to homeostatic vascular responses required for the metabolic support of auditory adjustment processes. We emphasize the need to distinguish these two states of excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in hearing disorders: (i) Under conditions of preserved fast auditory processing and sustained tonic inhibitory strength, an excitatory/inhibitory imbalance following auditory deprivation can maintain precise hearing through a memory linked, transient disinhibition that leads to enhanced spiking fidelity (central neural gain⇑) (ii) Under conditions of critically diminished fast auditory processing and reduced tonic inhibitory strength, hyperexcitability can be part of an increased synchronization over a broader frequency range, linked to reduced spiking reliability (central neural gain⇓). This latter stage mutually reinforces diminished metabolic support for auditory adjustment processes, increasing the risks for canonical dementia syndromes.",

      "abstract": "DISORDERS that simultaneously involve several organ systems can produce confusing clinical pictures, and the combination of oronasal bleeding, visual impairment, and altered sensorium is particularly striking in this regard. Nevertheless, this is the picture that can be produced by an increased serum viscosity.<sup>1,2</sup>The bleeding characteristically occurs from the nose, mouth, or gums but may stem from the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract. Postoperative oozing is also common. Ocular symptoms range from partial to complete loss of vision due to retinal hemorrhages, venous changes, or even papilledema. The neurologic disturbances, often known as the Bing-Neel syndrome, include headache, dizziness, true vertigo, deafness, nystagmus, diplopia, ataxia, paresthesias, and postural hypotension. Less often, congestive heart failure or renal impairment is seen. The main cause of the hyperviscosity syndrome is increased viscosity of the serum (as in macroglobulinemia or myeloma), although increased numbers of cells (polycythemia or leukemia) or increased resistance of cells",

      "abstract": "Hearing loss is a common problem encountered in ENT practice. Recognition of hearing loss as a problem by the patient usually occurs when speech frequencies are affected or when there is a sudden hearing loss. Hearing loss following head trauma or head injury is a major medical problem in adults (Bergemalm P-O&Borg.E. 2001) as well as children (Hough JVD &Stuart WD, 1968). The loss may go unnoticed when the speech frequencies are not affected. Sensorineural hearing loss at high frequencies is a frequent finding associated with head injuries (H.Alexander Arts). Hearing impairment can be due to central or peripheral causes, middle ear or cochlea being the most common site of peripheral injury. The most pronounced injury is fracture of temporal bone (Dahiya.R &Keller J.D, 1999). In both clinical and animal experimental studies it has been shown that there are various sites of pathology ranging from hair cell damage and degeneration of the organ of corti, ischemia of the 8th nerve to damage of central auditory pathways (due to compromise of blood supply to the inner ear ) either partly or totally. In most cases hearing impairment dissipates during subsequent post traumatic period, but some times it may persist or progress.",

Karya Tulis Ilmiah Studi Kasus, Program Studi DIII Keperawatan, Jurusan Keperawatan, Politeknik Kesehatan Kemenkes Riau. Pembimbing (I) Ns. Nia Khusniyati M, S.Kep, M.Kep (II) Hj. Melly, SST, M.Kes.\r\n\r\nDiabetes Mellitus adalah suatu keadaan dimana tubuh bisa menghasilkan hormon insulin sesuai kebutuhan atau tubuh tidak bisa memanfaatkan secara optimal insulin yang dihasilkan, sehingga terjadi lonjakan kadar gula dalam darah melebihi normal. Pada penderita diabetes mellitus terutama yang sudah bersifat kronik dapat terjadi gangguan atau komplikasi berupa neuropati diabetik, protein uria, kelainan koroner. Pada kerusakan sistem saraf dibagi tiga kelompok yaitu kerusakan sistem saraf perifer, kerusakan saraf otonom, kerusakan saraf motorik. Kerusakan sistem saraf perifer pada umumnya dapat menyebabkan kesemutan, nyeri pada tangan dan kaki, serta berkurangnya sensitifitas atau mati rasa. Sehingga penderita diabetes mellitus lebih tinggi resikonya mengalami masalah kaki yaitu sirkulasi darah kaki ke tungkai yang menurun, berkurangnya perasaan pada kaki, berkurangnya daya tahan tubuh terhadap infeksi. Pada umumnya penderita diabetes mellitus terlambat untuk menyadari bahwa terjadi luka pada kakinya disebabkan gangguan sirkulasi pembuluh darah yang menyebabkan luka tersebut sukar untuk sembuh dan akan menjadi ulkus atau gangren. Tujuan dari penulisan ini adalah mahasiswa mampu memberi asuhan keperawatan secara komprehensif dengan metode kasus yang dilakukan terhadap Ny. J pada tanggal 30 Maret sampai 01 April 2020. Hasil studi kasus ini menyebutkan bahwa Ny. J mengalami diabetes mellitus tipe 2 dengan ulkus diabetik dengan empat masalah keperawtan yaitu nyeri, hambatan mobilitas fisik, kerusakan integritas kulit, resiko infeksi. Evaluasi selama menjalani perawatan nyeri yang dirasakan hilang, nyaman dalam beraktifitas, luka pada kaki pada fase maturasi (penyembuhan). Saran untuk perawat di UPT puskesmas sungai pakning terutama perawat di ruangan rawat inap untuk dapat menerapkan asuhan keperawatan klien diabetes mellitus tipe 2 dengan ulkus diabetik secara komprehensif yang memperhatikan kesembuhan pasien secara teratur. Saran untuk penulis selanjutnya adalah studi kasus ini dapat dikembangkan lagi untuk penulis selanjutnya pada asuhan keperawatan yang lebih rinci lagi untuk menghasilkan asuhan keperawatan yang lebih berkualitas dan bermanfaat bagi pasien. \r\n\r\nKata kunci : Diabetes Mellitus, Ulkus Diabetik, Nyeri, Hambatan Mobilitas, Kerusakan Integritas Kulit, Resiko Infeksi",

      "title": "Neurogenic stuttering in children",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Neurogenic stuttering is a fluency disorder caused by the coordination inability of all articulation muscles involved in speech production. It can be present in adults and also in children. Present research shows that it is caused by lesions in the frontal, parietal and temporal lobe, by damage to the brain steam, basal ganglia, and cerebellum and because of white matter damage of the frontal lobe tract in both hemispheres. Compared to developmental stuttering, neurogenic stuttering is characterized by specific speech symptomatology, further difficulties and neurologic pathology. Aim: Distinguishing neurogenic stuttering from developmental stuttering using logopedic and neurological diagnostic methods. Methods: a/ initial logopedic diagnostics in relation to specific symptomatology; b/ acoustical voice and speech analysis (phonation and diadohocinetic); c/ psychological assessment; d/ neurological assessment Results: A multiannual team work of logopedists and neurologists resulted in the recognition of children with atypical speech dysfluency and confirmed neurological pathology, accompanied by difficulties that need different therapeutic procedures. In contrast to developmental stuttering, in neurogenic stuttering there is no consistency in the occurrence of dysfluency. Dysfluency can appear in every position in a word, in all word categories including spontaneous speech, automatic speech and singing. Acoustical analysis indicates varying laryngeal muscle enervation. Neurologocical diagnostics indicate cortical, subcortical, pyramidal and extrapyramidal pathology. Conclusion: The results of this paper confirmed the necessity of a team approach in the diagnostics and therapy of early childhood dysfluency in speech. Not all dysfluency in speech is stuttering. There is no need to wait until the age of four or five years for speech to become fluent without any intervention. In early childhood 5% of children stutter, and in about 3% of cases it disappears spontaneously. In the remaining 2% there are many children whose stuttering is a symptom of some other pathology.",

      "title": "A Neural Network Approach for Early Detection of Parkinson’s Disease from Speech Data Using Linear and Nonlinear Dynamic Features",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder brought on by the depletion of the substantia nigra's dopamine-containing cells, which plays an important role in movement. Bradykinesia (slowness of movement), akinesia (impairment of voluntary movement), tremor, and speech impairment are other symptoms. Typically, 80% of the striatal dopamine has been depleted and 60% of the nigrostriatal neurons would have died by the time the condition is recognised. Speech issues are seen in 89% of patients with PD. The voice of the affected individual alters; they either talk quietly or struggle to make words. A husky voice results from the afflicted face, mouth, throat, and neck muscles. They have trouble communicating. Lowered intensity, suppressed pitch, slight accurate utterance, stumbling, maundering, vocal tremors, monotony in conversation, harsh voice, sternness and stiffness in the laryngeal and ribcage muscles, and fast bursts are characteristics of the speech disorder. Currently, the doctor's domain expertise is used to identify the disease condition. Numerous assessments are made, and further therapies are advised. There is a need to discover the pattern when data is increasing at a rapid rate so that the patterns may be automatically recognized by a non-invasive technology and the condition can be simply and affordably diagnosed. The voices of those who have Parkinson's disease and who are age and gender-matched were compared in this study using dynamic voice features, including jitter, shimmer, RPDE, PPE and DFA. We propose a method that makes use of neural network approach to determine whether a person is healthy or Parkinson's disease patient. The accuracy value for the suggested method was found to be 98%. We also evaluate the proposed model using the SVR technique with hyperparameter optimization to calculate the Mean error and determine the degree of correlation of the features selected for the proposed work.",

      "abstract": "Apresentacao: A Esquizofrenia e um transtorno psiquiatrico complexo de evolucao cronica, caracterizado por uma alteracao cerebral que dificulta o correto julgamento sobre a realidade, tendo sintomas classificados como positivos (por exemplo, alucinacoes e delirios) ou negativos (dificuldades de expressar sentimentos e emocoes e pobreza no discurso). E subdividida em cinco tipos: hebefrenica, paranoide, catatonica, residual e indiferenciada. Neste estudo abordaremos a Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica. A Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica, tambem conhecida como desorganizada, e caracterizada por uma acentuada regressao de comportamento, tendo como principais sinais e sintomas estao a infantilidade, discurso incoerente, enfraquecimento intelectual, perturbacao dos afetos, ideias delirantes, alucinacoes, pensamento desorganizado, gesticulacao exagerada, comportamento irresponsavel e imprevisivel, com tendencia ao isolamento social. Geralmente, comeca a ser percebida dos 15 aos 25 anos de idade. A causa ainda nao e totalmente definida, mas hoje sabe-se que se trata de uma doenca quimica cerebral que decorre de alteracoes nos varios sistemas bioquimicos, que sao os neurotransmissores, e vias neuronais cerebrais. Nessa conjuntura, o presente trabalho faz uma analise acerca do diagnostico de Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica de uma jovem assistida pelo Centro de Atencao Psicossocial Infanto Juventil de Imperatriz – MA e tem por objetivo conhecer o contexto da Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica, compreendendo os fatores que ocasionam influencia sobre a mesma, alem de conhecer a realidade da pessoa com Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica, bem como contexto familiar e alteracoes sociais que esta pode vim a causar, entender o processo de acompanhamento e tratamento da paciente realizado pela equipe multiprofissional do CAPS IJ, com destaque para a Enfermagem e elaborar problemas e intervencoes, visando a melhora na qualidade de vida da paciente. Desenvolvimento: O estudo realizado e descritivo, do tipo relato de caso, pois segundo Parente (2010), tem como caracteristica a descricao detalhada, contendo caracteristicas importantes sobre sinais, sintomas e outras caracteristicas do paciente e relata os procedimentos terapeuticos utilizados, bem como o deslanche do caso. A coleta de dados foi realizada no Centro de Atencao Psicossocial Infanto Juvenil - CAPS IJ, na cidade de Imperatriz – MA, no dia 27 de Setembro de 2017, com observacao da consulta de Enfermagem com a mae e revisao do prontuario da paciente, entrevista direta com a enfermeira e assistente social da unidade, e ainda com busca eletronica e literaria, incluindo artigos cientificos na lingua portuguesa, para uma abrangente revisao. Foi consultado o prontuario da mesma a fim de compreender as principais causas do ocorrido e propor intervencoes para melhor qualidade de vida. Para a construcao dos diagnosticos/problemas e intervencoes de enfermagem foi utilizado o NANDA 2015-2017 e NIC, para estudos de medicacoes utilizou-se o AME e manual da ANVISA. Resultados: Com a busca desenvolvida, acerca das informacoes e historico da paciente soube-se que a mesma possui 20 Anos, e estudante, reside na cidade de Imperatriz – MA, com pais divorciados e uma irma com 15 anos, foi diagnosticada em 2013, aos 15 anos, com Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica (CID 10 F20.1). A mae da paciente relata que teve parto normal de 7 meses, porem laborioso – ocorrido na recepcao do hospital, tendo em decorrencia deficiencia na oxigenacao cerebral (hipoxia neonatal) e convulsao. A paciente teve crescimento retardado, veio a andar apenas com 3 anos e falou as primeiras palavras com 4 anos de idade, mas apresentava boa socializacao. Apresenta retardo mental, relata a equipe multiprofissional do CAPSIJ que ouve vozes, ve um homem com capa preta, tem delirios, convulsoes, dificuldade no controle dos esfincteres, apresenta alteracoes na compreensao, alteracoes no humor, dificuldade motora, fala desconexa, em contexto fora da realidade, relata que nunca viu o pai, informacao que, segundo a mae, nao e verdadeira. Fala em namoro, mas de forma infantilizada, grita muito, nao tem paciencia em escutar, possui baixo nivel de atencao e gosta de pintar e ouvir musicas, se ocupando assim, por vezes, durante o dia inteiro. A paciente iniciou acompanhamento apos inicio dos primeiros sintomas na Associacao de Pais e Amigos dos Excepcionais – APAE, tendo de inicio as seguintes hipoteses diagnosticas: Epilepsia (CID 10 G40), Retardo Mental moderado (CID 10 F71), Transtornos Mentais e Comportamentais associados ao puerperio (CID 10 F53), Transtorno Psicotico Agudo e Transitorio (CID 10 F23) e Esquizofrenia (CID 10 F20). Em seguida foi encaminhada ao CAPS IJ onde em 2013, aos 15 anos, L.G.S foi diagnosticada com Esquizofrenia do tipo Hebefrenica (CID 10 F20.1) e iniciou acompanhamento e tratamento com  equipe multiprofissional da Unidade, com atendimentos psiquiatrico, com nutricionista, enfermeira, assistente social e psicologa, e atualmente tambem participa de oficinas de arte e teatro, que a paciente relata que gosta, mas tem aversao aos grupos de adolescentes, pois diz que sao mais velhos e a mesma prefere se relacionar com criancas. Atualmente, tendo 20 anos e com tratamento medicamentoso, acompanhamento com equipe multiprofissional e participacao em oficinas, obteve melhora do quadro, melhora na socializacao, o que possibilitou tambem diminuicao na medicacao, passando a ser iniciado com a mesma o processo de alta da Unidade de Atendimento, com comparecimento da paciente de 15 em 15 dias para interacao social e acompanhamento com a equipe ate que esteja pronta para a alta. Fez-se levantamento das medicacoes utilizadas pela paciente e de diagnosticos de Enfermagem, como: • Atividade de recreacao deficiente, caracterizado pelo tedio, relacionado a atividades de recreacao insuficientes. confusao aguda, controle de impulsos ineficaz, comunicacao verbal prejudicada•            Interacao social prejudicada, caracterizada por funcao social prejudicada, interacao disfuncional com outras pessoas, relacionado ao conhecimento insuficiente para de como fortalecer a reciprocidade, disturbio no autoconceito, isolamento terapeutico e processos de pensamento perturbados, sindrome de estresse por mudanca, risco de automutilacao e risco de violencia direcionada a si mesmo. Fez se tambem o levantamento de intervencoes, que foram: Aplicar arteterapia, praticar musicoterapia, estipular terapia socioambiental, utilizar brinquedos terapeuticos e administrar medicacao quando prescrito. Consideracoes Finais: Em suma, o referido estudo possibilitou como ferramenta fundamental para conhecimento na pratica em relacao as principais alteracoes e especificidades de um paciente com Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica, trazendo um olhar critico para a importância da equipe de enfermagem nos cuidados e acompanhamento do paciente acometido, assim abrindo a concepcao para uma analise sobre a patologia, alem disso, possibilitou a capacidade de realizar uma pesquisa cientifica em bases de dados e literaria, que e primordial para a formacao academica.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY The usual tests for very poor vision (i.e. counting fingers and reporting the examiners' hand movements) are unsuitable for young children who frequently do not understand the ‘sighted’ language used by the examiner. Many visually handicapped children have additional neuro‐developmental abnormalities, including defective eye movements, visual field defects, spatial disabilities, mental retardation, impaired hearing and language disorders. The stycar Panda test reported here uses sets of large white letters and other symbols on black grounds for the child to name, copy or match. It provides more reliable information about the visual competence of children with very poor vision. The testing procedure is described. RÉSUMÉ Le ‘STYCAR Panda test’ pour enfants présentant des déficits graves de la vision Les tests habituels pour vision très limitée (compter les doigts ou décrire les mouvements de main de l'examinateur) ne sont pas adaptés aux jeunes enfants qui frèquemment ne comprennent pas le langage ‘visuel’ utilisé par l'examinateur. Beaucoup d'enfants handicapés visuels présentent des anomalies de développement d'origine neurologique supplé‐mentaire, incluant un défaut des mouvements oculaires, des altérations du champ visuel, un dèficit visuospatial, un retard mental, une atteinte de l'ouie et des troubles du langage. Le stycar Panda test décrit dans l'article utilise des séries de grandes lettres blanches et d'autres symboles sur fond noir que l'enfant doit nommer, copier ou apparier. Ce test fournit des informations plus fidèles sur l'aptitude visuelle des enfants à très faible vision. La technique d'utilisation du test est décrite. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Der STYCAR Panda Test für Kinder mit schweren Sehstörungen Die gewöhnlichen Sehtests für deutiche Sehbehinderung (z.B. Finger zählen und die Handbewegungen des Untersuchers beschreiben) sind für kleine Kinder ungeeignet, da diese häufig die angewandte Zeichensprache nicht verstehen. Viele Kinder mit Sehstörungen zeigen gleichzeitig Störungen in der neurologischen Entwicklung wie pathologische Augenbewegungen, Gesichtsfeldeinschränkungen, Schwierigkeiten bei der räumlichen Wahrnehmung, geistige Retardierung, Hörstörungen und Sprachschwierigkeiten. Der stycar Panda Test, über den hier berichtet wird, bedient sich Gruppen großer weißer Buchstaben und anderer Symbole auf schwarzem Untergrund, die das Kind benennen oder zusammenstellen muß. Er gibt zuverlässigere Informationen über die Sehfähigkeit der Kinder mit sehr schlechter Sehkraft. Der Testablauf wird beschrieben. RESUMEN El test de STYCAR Panda para niños con dificultad visual grave Los tests usuales para casos de visión muy pobre (p.ej. contar dedos y decir como mueve las manos el examinador), no van bien para niños jóvenes que frecuentemente no entienden el lenguaje ‘visual’ utilizado por el examinador. Muchos niños con déficit visual, tienen además anomalías de desarrollo neurológico, incluyendo movimientos visuales defectuosos, defectos en el campo visual, fallos en la habilidad espacial, retraso mental audición alterada y alteraciones del lenguaje. El test de stycar Panda aportado aquí utiliza unos conjuntos de grandes letras blancas y otros simbolos sobre fondo negro para que el niño nombres, copie o una. Proporciona una información más fiable acerca de la compentencia visual del niño con visión muy pobre. Se describe el modo de aplicación del test.",

To make the diagnosis there must be abnormalities in either or both attention and activity which are excessive compared with the norm for a child of that age or developmental level, have been present from an early age (at least seven years but often identifiable by three years) and are pervasive, ie present in more than one area of a child's life (home, school, social situations etc). Medically the status of this diagnos is is that of a syndrome or disorder, not a disease, and none of the described behaviours is exclusive to the diagnosis. It also presents as a spectrum disorder, with less and more severe degrees, but it should be noted that the DSM IV classification requires evidence of clinically significant impairment of function. There are three main groups of symptoms: overactivity, inattentivenes and impulsivity.",

ASD is known to have no satisfactory treatment options till now except Cognitive behavior therapy, Play therapy, Speech therapy, Holding therapy, Music therapy etc. In Ayurveda, ASD can be related to disease Unmada. Main clinical findings: A 3 year old male child was presented with delayed milestones, not making eye contact, not responding to sounds, no focus, no attention, less response to commands, drooling, frequent falls while walking and with making of random unintelligible sounds. Diagnosis: Childhood Autism. Interventions: Shirodhara and Shashtika Shali Pinda Sweda as Panchakarma interventions along with Shamana Chikitsa were selected for present case study. Outcome: There was improvement seen in eye contact, staring, speech and drooling. Patient starts to walk 15-20 steps without fall. Improvement was seen in sincere listening to words. Stability and movement of neck increased.  Conclusion: The present case report shows improvements in various aspects of childhood Autism with Panchakarma interventions and oral Ayurvedic medications.

Methods: A child of eleven years old diagnosed Autistic Spectrum Disorder, who presents psychotic symptoms, is described. The relationship between Autistic Spectrum Disorder and Schizophrenia are revised in literature. Results: Longitudinal studies demonstrate that Autistic Spectrum Disorders develop Schizophrenia in rate not higher than for the general population. Differential diagnosis between Schizophrenia and Autistic Spectrum Disorder can be complicated. Some symptoms of autistic spectrum can be misinterpreted as psychosis. Autistic Spectrum Disorders can talk out loud to themselves and they have sensory stereotypes  which can be misinterpreted as hallucinations. Some beliefs and perceptions can be idiosyncratic and interpreted as psychotic. Some thought disorders (loose associations and illogical thinking) were not due to comorbid symptoms of schizophrenia, but pragmatic language abnormalities. Both disorders can present negative symptoms (social isolation, decrease emotional expression) and disorganization. Conclusion: Differentiating between the symptoms of autistic spectrum and Schizophrenia can be very complicated. Knowledge of abnormalities in development and the wide variety of manifestations of autistic spectrum will be needed to make a differential diagnosis with Schizophrenia.",

      "title": "SINTOMAS DEPRESSIVOS EM ACADÊMICOS DE UMA UNIVERSIDADE PÚBLICA NO OESTE DO ESTADO DO PARÁ, RELATO DE EXPERIÊNCIA",
      "abstract": "Apresentacao : A depressao e um disturbio do afeto e/ou do humor, que e caracterizado por sintomas como, piora do sono, do apetite, da auto-estima, pela tristeza, sentimento de culpa, entre outros. O individuo depressivo tem dificuldade em descrever experiencias emocionais positivas, sendo pouco aberto a sentimentos otimistas. Alem disso, na depressao nao existe apenas queixa de tristeza, mas tambem ha mudancas de humor que culminam em crises frequentes de explosao de raiva, que levam ao desgaste da saude fisica e emocional, prejuizos no convivio social, na aprendizagem e ideias e/ou tentativas frequentes de suicidio. Esse transtorno e considerado uma pandemia e a terceira maior causa a nivel global de doencas. Sao inumeros os fatores que podem contribuir para o desenvolvimento da depressao, como por exemplo, o baixo suporte social, a presenca de eventos estressantes, pensamentos negativos, problemas financeiros, entre outros. Alguns dados encontrados nos universitarios nesta pesquisa, sao considerados elevados, no que tange ao processo depressivo, e ganham maior destaque ainda quando comparados com a populacao em geral. Isso e possivel, pois e nessa fase academica que se exige muito esforco do adolescente ou jovem adulto, onde o mesmo deve aprender a lidar com uma gama de responsabilidades que estarao presentes em sua vida futura, tanto como academico, quanto como profissional. Estes incluem a adaptacao de cumprimento de prazos e horarios, a distância dos pais e demais familiares, a falta de motivacao para os estudos, dentre outros conflitos internos e/ou externos. Diante dessas informacoes, o objetivo deste trabalho consiste em relatar a presenca de sinais e sintomas depressivos encontrados em academicos de uma instituicao de ensino superior em Santarem- PA, atraves de uma escuta qualificada. Desenvolvimento : Este estudo trata-se de um relato de experiencia acerca das vivencias durante uma acao em saude que ocorreu no dia 24 de abril de 2017 desenvolvida por academicos de enfermagem da Universidade do Estado do Para (UEPA) Campus XII-Santarem, a acao foi baseada na metodologia ativa da problematizacao segundo o Projeto Politico Pedagogico (PPP) do curso de enfermagem da UEPA para a Atividade Integrada em Saude que e um momento em que o academico de enfermagem integra todos os eixos da grade curricular do semestre, escolhendo assim um tema a ser abordado, assim como o publico, que foi composto de academicos dos cursos contemplados na universidade: enfermagem, musica, educacao fisica, medicina e fisioterapia. A tematica foi abordada atraves de acao educativa em saude, organizada pelos academicos do curso de enfermagem com diversos topicos como: alimentacao, avaliacao de risco para o desenvolvimento de doencas cronicas, avaliacao de medidas antropometricas e, nesta atividade, avaliacao da saude mental com a investigacao da existencia de sintomas depressivos. Durante a acao os academicos de enfermagem, em um primeiro momento, distribuiram folders contendo informacoes sobre a depressao e, posteriormente conversaram individualmente com cada academico que, de forma voluntaria, concordaram discutir sobre sintomas que, de acordo com o CID-10, poderiam estar sentindo. Durante a conversa os sintomas investigados foram: fadiga aumentada ou perda de energia fisica e mental, perda de interesse e prazer, classificados como sintomas fundamentais; apetite diminuido, atividade diminuida, auto-estima e autoconfianca diminuida, concentracao e atencao diminuida, sentimento de culpa e inutilidade, pensamentos e/ou atos lesivos ou suicidas, sono perturbado, visao pessimista do futuro, classificados como sintomas episodicos. Alem disso, a acao contou com a ajuda de um psicologo que atendeu os participantes que apresentaram sintomas graves da depressao. Os participantes que apresentaram maior necessidade foram orientados a buscar tratamento efetivo com intervencao de psicologo. Resultados : A maioria dos entrevistados mostraram-se bastante interessados no assunto e nao demonstravam muita timidez, apresentaram-se bem a vontade e com disposicao para dialogar, o que de certa forma surpreendeu a equipe, que esperava uma resistencia por parte dos academicos, com isso observou-se facilitacao do trabalho para a equipe dos entrevistadores. Apos a entrevista, os academicos de enfermagem, organizadores da acao, detectaram uma alta incidencia de sintomas fundamentais e episodicos em um numero significativos dos universitarios, o que pode ser considerado uma situacao preocupante. No decorrer da acao, muitos academicos participantes, relataram o quanto consideravam acoes desse genero, importantes na universidade, por sentirem-se sobrecarregados pelas atividades academicas, desorientados, desanimados e com pensamentos pessimistas. Podem ser classificados como poucas as acoes voltadas para os academicos, sobretudo, os academicos da area da saude, ja que eles sao os principais responsaveis por promoverem esse tipo de acoes e que acabam deixando de se cuidar, nao lembrando-se que tambem precisam de cuidado e atencao. Deste modo, e inegavel a grande satisfacao de poder contribuir de alguma forma para esta comunidade e acredita-se que, todos os academicos tiveram uma boa oportunidade de serem ouvidos de forma mais qualificada por um profissional apto a lhe dar orientacoes essenciais que visem a prevencao diagnostica, alem de recuperacao e promocao da saude mental. Consideracoes Finais : Apos a acao em saude, alguns academicos que se ausentaram no dia em que a acao ocorreu procuraram a equipe afim de, saberem se haveria outra acao semelhante, alegando que gostariam de serem ouvidos ou ate mesmo referindo interesse de um amigo (a) na consulta psicologica. Essa experiencia aponta para a necessidade de que academicos na area da saude devem cuidar da saude mental de forma frequente sem negligenciar as tensoes e o estresse advindos da propria universidade, antes de serem lancados no mercado de trabalho. Alem da necessidade de acompanhamento psicologico para os academicos nas proprias universidades, sejam elas publicas ou privadas, no decorrer da formacao afim de manter a saude mental e de prevenir, diagnosticar ou ainda tratar quadros depressivos e outras doencas mentais que podem comprometer seu rendimento academico e a sua saude geral, visando reduzir dados crescentes relacionados a sintomatologia da depressao em universitarios. Essa experiencia mostrou que mesmo em cursos da area da saude, a saude mental ainda e pouco debatida, precisando assim, de uma atencao tanto dos academicos com sua propria saude, como da instituicao de ensino, promovendo um espaco e profissionais capacitados que possam auxiliar enquanto o academico estiver em formacao.",

Other symptoms and comorbidities may be manifested, according to the different clinical presentations and severity levels. ASD diagnosis can be performed by two years of age; however, certain diagnostic challenges may lead to a late diagnosis and significant intervention delay. Studies have shown that early diagnosis and interventions have a positive impact on the child's development, acquisition of social or language skills, and overall quality of life. This review aims to explore the appropriate implementation of standardized, efficient diagnostic methods and criteria at primary care routine consultations, and prompt interventions that must follow in high-risk children.",

      "abstract": "Internet technologies have made rapid progress, bringing convenience to our daily life. On the other hand, Internet overuse (IOU) and Internet addiction (IA) have reportedly become serious health and social problems across the globe. Recently Internet gaming disorder criteria have been proposed in the section of Conditions for Further Study of DSM5. Many surveys have reported that many IOU & IA patients have contracted other mental disorders and exhibit some psychiatric and physical symptoms (e.g., weight loss, reduced ability to exercise, nutrition disorder). Attention Deficit Hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), sleeping disorders, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, and phobic anxiety disorder are extremely common comorbid mental disorders (CMD) with IUD & IA. Because CMD breaks the usual rhythm of the activities of daily living of IOU & IA patients (e.g., eating meals and sleeping), and prevents the affected patients from participating in social activities (e.g., going to schools or work, participating in sports or other hobbies), CMD causes exacerbation of all IOU & IA symptoms. It has been reported that effecting a cure of some aspects of CMD often leads to the relief of IOU & IA. The diagnosis and the treatment of CMD are therefore very important.",

      "title": "Clinical and Pathogenetic Delineation of Early-Onset Ataxia",
      "abstract": "Ataxia, a neurological symptom characterized by loss of coordinated movements, can be genetic, acquired, or idiopathic. Ataxia is clinically classified into Early-Onset Ataxia (EOA) and Late-Onset Ataxia (LOA), based on symptom-onset before or after 25 years of age. The phenotype of ataxia may also be present in other movement- and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as dystonia and Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD). Dystonia is characterized by involuntary muscle contractions causing abnormal postures or repetitive movements. DCD is a descriptive term involving children with coordination impairments unexplained by an underlying neurological disorder. EOA, LOA, dystonia and DCD may all present with similar coordination impairments. Moreover, ataxia and dystonia co-occur in 65% of children and young adults with coordination impairments of various etiology. This frequent co-occurrence limits the uniform clinical recognition of EOA compared to other disorders associated with impaired coordination, including LOA, dystonia and DCD. Also, this co-occurrence suggests the existence of a pathogenetic and clinical continuum between these four conditions. This thesis focuses on genetic EOA and explores its relationship with LOA, dystonia and DCD. The first part explores the underlying genetic, anatomical, and biological pathways of these four conditions. The second part focuses on the challenging clinical and diagnostic distinction of coordination impairments described as DCD from other neurological disorders, including EOA, LOA and dystonia. The findings of this thesis point to shared pathogenetic mechanisms and reveal the presence of a unified clinical continuum between EOA, LOA, dystonia and DCD. These data advocate for a unified diagnostic approach in pediatric movement- and neurodevelopmental disorders, through the implementation of genetic and neuroimaging assessments. This may improve patient care through earlier disease identification and disease-specific interventions.",

      "title": "A solution to overcome speech disorder of patients using Brain Neuron EEG Signals",
      "abstract": "Speech disorders are neurodevelopmental disorders such as Stuttering, Dysarthria, Dysphonia and Aphasia associated with left inferior frontal structural anomalies that involve repeating or prolonging a word, syllable or phrase, or stopping during speech and making no sound for certain syllables. Most of the people who are suffering from speech disorders encounter difficulties in professional communication. Since people are busy with their day to day life, it is not practical to spend more time in consulting a doctor or do speech therapies for their medical issues. The speech therapist generally charges a significantly much higher rate for a single speech therapy practice, which the patient needs to practice at least twice or more for a week to get a better result. In an economy like Sri Lanka, people with average income cannot afford such an amount of money. Therefore, an innovative desktop application for speech disorder patients to overcome this problem has arisen. The main aim of this application is to reduce the speech imperative percentage of speech disorder patients via capturing the electroencephalogram feed of speech motor (Broca's area) using brain neuron O1, O2, C3, C4, F3, F4, F7, F8 electrodes and analyzing it to identify speech imperative issues. This system identifies the current impact on the left hemisphere of the brain (Broca's area) using EEG neurofeedback. Using speech voice analysis, the system provides the user to measure the articulation interference of the speech process. Self-Learning video tutorials are available for the clinical practices and treatments are available as prolong, relaxing, and humming exercises. Patients can track down the improvements daily or monthly by the rating system which makes the system unique among all other systems and the result can be directly sent to the desired consultant/neurophysiologist by the system itself. Patients can save time and the total cost of a therapy fee by using this system.",

Attention disorders manifest themselves in the form of the following behavioral patterns: distractibility with disorganization of behavior and problems with stable focus on a task, which are not associated with a decrease in intelligence and lack of understanding of the proposed tasks. Hyperactivity is understood as excessive motor activity, fussiness, restlessness, or verbosity that is not adequate to accepted norms. Impulsive behavior involves quick, hasty, thoughtless, hurried actions that carry a high risk of serious harm and injury. Due to the great heterogeneity in the severity of clinical manifestations, this pathology tends to be diagnosed late, often with the start of schooling.",

Its evaluation belongs to the workday routine of social physicians. Special difficulties arise if chronic pain disorders are to be evaluated, especially in chronic \"nonspecific\" cases, i.e. in the absence of biomedically relevant signs. Employment-related performance is conceptualised as a multidimensional construct with several latent variables. It integrates and extends the domains of \"impairments\" and \"disabilities\" of the International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities, and Handicaps (ICIDH) of WHO. Three basic dimensions are distinguished: one comprising biomedical, the other psychological, the third function-related variables. They are specified within a multidimensional model of employment-related performance. This includes different components of the perception and appraisal of pain, concomitant bodily complaints (e.g. vital exhaustion), psychological impairments as helplessness or anxiety, special facets of the pain behaviour, and functional limitations and allows an estimate of the chronification and prognosis of the pain problem. Some diagnostic measures are still inadequate in respect of established clinimetric standards. In particular, assessment of functional limitations requires further development and research.",

The most common of these cognitive effects is drug-induced sleepiness occurring during waking. Unfortunately, the terminology describing daytime sleepiness, generally considered to be 'the subjective state of sleep need,' is poorly defined, interchangeably including such contextual terminology as sleepiness, drowsiness, languor, inertness, fatigue, and sluggishness.2 Waking consciousness is not a univariate state, changing cyclically during the day from focused alertness, to states characterized by associative thought, drowsiness, and even 'altered' states such as meditation, hallucination, or hypnosis.3 The subjective behavioral complaint of 'sleepiness' often does not accurately reflect the results of tests for physiological sleepiness.4 The effects of sleepiness on daytime performance can be assessed by tests of complex reaction and coordination, or by tests that assess complex behavioral tasks likely to be affected by sleepiness (i.e. tests of driving performance).5 These data have been shown to correlate with epidemiological studies demonstrating that several groups of drugs known to induce daytime sleepiness are associated with increased rates of automobile accidents (e.g. sedating antihistamines, long-acting benzodiazepines, and sedating antidepressants).6,7 Such performance tests have not generally been used for the assessment of daytime performance for a majority of drugs noted to induce sleepiness as a side effect.",

Serotonin regulates a variety of physiological functions, including food intake, reward, reproduction, sleep-wake cycle, memory, cognition, emotion, and mood (Charnay and Leger, 2010). Consistently, dysfunctions of the serotonergic system are involved in the development or progression of mental disorders including autism, insomnia, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, or Alzheimer's disease (Charnay and Leger 2010). Many of these diseases (e.g., autism, schizophrenia, depression, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease) present with concomitant impairment of olfaction (and memory), often accompanied by a reduced volume of the olfactory bulb (OB; Figure 1A) and hippocampus. These functional impairments may result from distorted adult neurogenesis in the respective neurogenic niches, as OB and hippocampal dentate gyrus are the two major areas of the adult mammalian brain where adult-born cells are generated throughout life. A wide range of studies documents the involvement of adult-born cells in short- and long-term olfactory memory; perceptual, associative, and fear learning, etc. (summarized in Lepousez et al., 2015; Fomin-Thunemann et al., 2020).Figure 1: Region-specific effects of serotonergic signaling on adult neurogenesis.(A) Scheme of the mouse head showing the location of the nasal cavity, olfactory epithelium, olfactory bulb (OB), and the cortex. (B) Magnification of the area, delineated by the broken line in A, showing olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs, orange) within the olfactory epithelium projecting to the OB and terminating in the glomeruli. Adult-born cells (green) arrive in the OB after migration along the rostral migratory stream (RMS) from the subventricular zone (SVZ). Serotonergic fibers (red) originate from the dorsal and medial raphe nuclei in the brain stem and target adult-born cells in the SVZ (1), RMS (2), and OB (3). OC: olfactory cortex; LV: lateral ventricle. (C) Upper panel: close-up of the three framed areas in B. Left: In the SVZ, radial glia-like cells (B cells) give rise to transient amplifying cells (C cells), which then generate neuroblasts (A cells). Middle: in the RMS, neuroblasts migrate along the glial sheets to the OB. After arrival, they switch to radial migration. Right: In the OB, neuroblasts mature to become granule (GCs) and juxtaglomerular (JGCs) cells. EPL: External plexiform layer; GCL: granule cell layer; GL: glomerular layer; MCL: mitral cell layer; ONL: olfactory nerve layer. Lower panel: serotonin (5-HT) receptors involved in serotonergic signaling in the respective region.Interestingly, adult neurogenesis and olfactory memory are positively modulated by fluoxetine, an antidepressant drug and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (Siopi et al., 2016). Cumulative evidence points towards a specific role for serotonin in adult neurogenesis, as it has been shown that serotonin modulates the fate and functional state of adult-born cells throughout the entire life. Serotonergic projections innervate both the hippocampus and OB (Charnay and Leger, 2010), as well as their respective neurogenic niches, the subgranular zone and subventricular zone (SVZ) (Soumier et al., 2010; Garcia-Gonzalez et al., 2017). Serotonergic fibers innervating the OB originate from the dorsal and medial raphe nuclei and primarily innervate the superficial glomerular layer of the OB (Figure 1B and C), with sparser innervation of granule and mitral cell layers (Petzold et al., 2009; Fletcher and Chen, 2010). Interestingly, the serotonergic innervation of the glomerular layer of the bulb is not homogeneous, as the density and thickness of innervating serotonergic fibers vary between adjacent glomeruli. Within the neurogenic niche in the SVZ, serotonergic inputs run along the wall of the lateral ventricle (Tong et al., 2014). Here, the radial glia-like cells (B cells) give rise to transient amplifying cells (C cells), which then generate neuroblasts (Figure 1C). Serotonin promotes the proliferation of B and C cells in the SVZ (Brezun and Daszuta, 1999; Soumier et al., 2010; Tong et al., 2014). The thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) is often used for identification of newborn cells, as it incorporates into the DNA of dividing cells and can later be visualized using immunohistochemistry. Lesioning serotonergic terminals or inhibition of serotonin synthesis leads to a substantial decrease in the number of BrdU-positive (BrdU+) adult-born cells in the SVZ (Brezun and Daszuta, 1999), while an infusion of the serotonin-releasing drug fenfluramine into the lateral ventricle of adult mice significantly increases the number of BrdU+ adult-born cells and doublecortin-positive neuroblasts in the SVZ (Tong et al., 2014). Consistently, 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptor agonists increased, while 5-HT2C receptor antagonists decreased cell proliferation in the SVZ of adult mice (Tong et al., 2014). Besides, serotonin application induced depolarising inward currents in B cells, which were partially blocked by 5-HT2C or 5-HT5A receptor antagonists. The co-application of 5-HT2C and 5-HT5A receptor antagonists completely abolished serotonin-induced currents in B cells (Tong et al., 2014). Collectively, these data highlight the importance of serotonin in controlling proliferation and neurogenesis in the SVZ. After leaving the SVZ, adult-born cells - called neuroblasts at this developmental stage - migrate along the RMS towards the OB (Figure 1B and C). Migrating neuroblasts express Ca2+-permeable 5-HT3A receptors and serotonergic fibers, projecting along the RMS, have been shown to control velocity and directionality of neuroblast migration in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Garcia-Gonzalez et al., 2017). Moreover, a constitutive 5-HT3A receptor knockout presented with thinner RMS, smaller OB, and reduced density of parvalbumin- and calretinin-positive interneurons in the granule cell and the external plexiform layers (see Figure 1C for a schematic illustration of the OB layers). Upon arrival in the OB, neuroblasts change from tangential to radial migration (Figure 1B and C) and move towards the OB surface to become GABAergic interneurons in the granule or glomerular cell layers. Ninety percent of these cells become granule cells, while 5–10% migrate into the glomerular layer to become periglomerular or to a lesser extent short axon cells (Lepousez et al., 2015). The latter are collectively referred to as juxtaglomerular cells (JGCs). During the pre-integration phase, i.e. after arrival to the glomerular layer but before the integration into the local circuit (Liang et al., 2016), functional properties of adult-born JGCs differ from those of resident cells. Thus, adult-born JGCs show lower spontaneous ongoing activity, higher odor sensitivity, greater responsiveness to a larger number of odorants, and increased structural plasticity. When adult-born JGCs mature (approximately at 7–8 weeks after birth), their spontaneous and odor-evoked activities and structural plasticity become more similar to those of resident juxtaglomerular cells (Fomin-Thunemann et al., 2020). However, many adult-born cells do not survive the maturation process and undergo apoptosis ~15–45 days after their birth. Interestingly, daily treatment with the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin significantly increased BrdU+ cell survival in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus while the same treatment decreased survival of BrdU+ granule cells in the OB (Soumier et al., 2010). Taken together, these observations suggest that starting from their generation in the respective neurogenic niche and until their full maturation, the development of adult-born hippocampal and OB interneurons is controlled by the serotonergic inputs. But do adult-born cells preserve their privileged serotonergic inputs beyond their maturation, i.e. at times, when their functional properties are supposed to align with those of surrounding resident cells? Our data obtained in mature adult-born JGCs (Fomin-Thunemann et al., 2020) suggest that this might be the case: after application of the nonselective 5-HT2/5-HT7 receptor antagonist methysergide onto the OB surface of awake mice, we observed a significant and selective decrease in the ongoing activity of mature (> 8 week-old) adult-born JGCs. Surprisingly, the same treatment did not influence resident cells. This suggests that despite their abundance in the glomerular layer, serotonergic fibers preferentially target adult-born cells. What could be the functional role of this privileged connection? Serotonergic projections to the OB were shown to play a key role in selective filtering or attenuation of sensory inputs. Indeed, inhibition of serotonin receptors in general, and 5-HT2C receptors in particular enhanced odor-evoked responses in axons of olfactory sensory neurons projecting from the nose to OB glomeruli, whereas activation of 5-HT2C receptors inhibited these responses (Petzold et al., 2009). This effect was shown to be mediated through presynaptic GABAB receptors and was similar across all examined odorants and glomeruli, with stronger responses being affected to a greater extent than weaker responses. The authors suggested that this effect could be mediated by a subpopulation of GABAergic JGCs that express 5-HT2C receptors and respond to activation or inhibition of 5-HT2C receptors with a respective increase or decrease in odor-evoked Ca2+ signaling (Petzold et al., 2009). In addition to suppressing transmitter release from presynaptic terminals, GABAergic JGCs also contact and inhibit the postsynaptic targets of olfactory sensory neurons - mitral/tufted cells. Interestingly, not all JGCs analyzed by Petzold et al. (2009) were serotonin-responsive, suggesting that this property might be restricted to mature adult-born cells, as described above (Fomin-Thunemann et al., 2020). By controlling their ongoing spontaneous activity (Fomin-Thunemann et al. 2020), serotonergic inputs likely contribute to tonic presynaptic inhibition in the glomerular layer of the OB. Interestingly, serotonin-mediated reduction of sensory-evoked responses was also reported for visual and auditory systems (Petzold et al., 2009), suggesting that the ability of sensory gain control represents a general property of serotonergic inputs. Serotonergic raphe neurons are active during awake resting states, including grooming and rhythmic movements, but not during attentive states of sensory acquisition or sleep (Jacobs and Fornal, 1991; Petzold et al., 2009). Thus, depending on the internal state of the animal and external - environmental - stimuli, serotonergic projections from the brainstem, targeting mature adult-born cells, might influence the strength of the perceived sensory stimulus. Serotonin-responsive adult-born JGCs therefore might serve as coincidence detectors between the internal state of the animal (e.g., arousal, attention, expectation) and sensory inputs from the environment. In this scenario, activation of serotonergic inputs would help to filter irrelevant information, adjust the gain of the system to odor detection/perception, and to maintain responses of mitral/tufted cells within a normal dynamic range. Moreover, the overall reduction of sensory-driven responses during wakefulness might help to reduce the system's noise and to select salient information important to learn or memorize. In the olfactory system, serotonergic signaling was shown to play an important role in the formation of short-term memory and associative conditioning (Fletcher and Chen, 2010). For instance, in neonatal rats, odor-preference learning was impaired when serotonergic inputs were depleted. In adult rats, reducing or blocking serotonergic signaling impeded discrimination of previously learned odorants as well as learning of new tasks (Fletcher and Chen, 2010). In conclusion, serotonergic inputs support major steps of adult neurogenesis in both neurogenic niches of the mammalian brain, including cell proliferation, migration, and survival. Moreover, even after full integration of adult-born cells into the surrounding neural circuitry and maturation therein, serotonergic inputs convey unique functional properties to adult-born cells, enabling them to play a distinctive role in integrating environmental stimuli in a brain state-specific manner.

Core features include abnormal movement and posture due to impairments in coordination and/or muscle tone. CP is not an etiologic diagnosis. Rather, it is a descriptive term based on an individual's clinical picture. Among children diagnosed with CP, there is great heterogeneity with respect to etiology, type of impairment, and severity of impairment. Brain disturbances that lead to CP may occur prenatally, perinatally, or in the young child during brain development and maturation. Although the brain disturbances leading to CP are not progressive, the clinical picture is not static. Clinical features of CP evolve with time, development, learning, motor training, and therapy. The disorder can potentially lead to poor growth of a limb, contractures and poor range of motion, pain secondary to spasticity, inability to complete voluntary movements, neglect of a limb, inability to complete activities of daily living, and poor participation in the community.",

La compleja relacion entre los trastornos del neurodesarrollo y la epilepsia es de menor importancia que los factores comunes que incluyen la genetica, la cognicion, la funcion motora y del lenguaje. Las encefalopatias epilepticas estan asociadas a una regresion o una ralentizacion del funcionamiento cognitivo, del lenguaje o de la conducta, y la hipotesis de trabajo aceptada es que esta es una consecuencia directa de las crisis o de la actividad epileptiforme interictal, y no de la enfermedad asociada.

      "title": "Assistenza al paziente affetto da demenza: approccio infermieristico al wandering",
      "abstract": "PROBLEMA: le demenze costituiscono sempre di piu un problema rilevante di sanita pubblica rappresentando una delle maggiori cause di disabilita nella popolazione generale ed hanno un considerevole impatto socio-sanitario. L’Organizzazione Mondiale della Sanita, gia da qualche anno ha introdotto le demenze tra le sue priorita. Tra le diverse forme di alterazioni comportamentali, causate dalle demenze (irrequietezza, aggressivita fisica e verbale, manierismi e movimenti ripetitivi, alterazioni ciclo sono veglia, pedinare, spiare) una di particolare interesse e rappresentata dal wandering (vagabondaggio). Attualmente, nel contesto clinico, gli episodi di wandering vengono trattati prevalentemente mediante la contenzione chimica (somministrazione di terapia farmacologica) oppure nei casi di reale pericolo si procede alla contenzione fisica. Viene quindi spontaneo chiedersi: esistono modalita assistenziali alternative per trattare in modo specifico il problema, prendendosi cura della persona e migliorare la sua qualita di vita?\r\nSCOPO: Individuare secondo le evidenze scientifiche le terapie non farmacologiche (art therapy, stimolazione cognitiva, Rot o Reality Therapy, musicoterapia e Doll Therapy) piu efficaci nel trattamento, o miglioramento, del disturbo del wandering nell’assistito demente, rispetto alla contenzione fisica e farmacologica.\r\nCAMPIONE: sono stati presi in considerazione gli articoli di ricerca che hanno coinvolto gli assistiti di eta maggiore ai 65 anni, diagnosticati con una qualsiasi forma di demenza e che manifestano il sintomo comportamentale del wandering. Assistiti che vengono trattati con terapie farmacologiche, con la contenzione fisica e terapie non farmacologiche in un contesto ospedaliero o nelle case di cura.\r\nMETODI E STRUMENTI: i criteri di selezione utilizzati non hanno previsto restrizioni in merito al disegno di studio. Si e proceduto ricercando tutti gli studi free full text che comparassero i metodi di contenzione fisica e chimica negli episodi di wandering con tutta una serie di trattamenti non farmacologici, o che riguardassero in maniera separata i diversi tipi di trattamenti farmacologici e non farmacologici, per gestire detto fenomeno. La ricerca e stata condotta consultando le seguenti banche dati: MedLine, EBN Guideline, GoogleScholar, PubMed,Cinahl, Scopus. Non e stato utilizzato alcun limite attinente alla lingua.\r\nRISULTATI: sono stati reperiti 13 studi, in seguito all’applicazione dei criteri di inclusione, 9 sono stati gli studi inclusi nel lavoro di revisione:1 studio randomizzato doppio cieco, 2 revisioni della letteratura, 2 case report, 2 studi pilota,1 studio osservazionale e 1 studio qualitativo. La provenienza degli studi inclusi e piuttosto eterogenea: 1 proveniente dal South Dakota, 1 studio dalla Gran Bretagna, 1 dall’Italia, 1 dalla Germania, 1 da Praga (Repubblica Ceca), 2 dal Seoul (Corea del Sud),1 dall’Australia e 1 dal Singapore.\r\nDISCUSSIONE: i lavori inseriti in questa revisione della letteratura, seppure nella loro debolezza metodologica, portano ad evidenziare un’importante uso della contenzione farmacologica e fisica negli assistiti con demenza che presentano il sintomo comportamentale del wandering. Sia la contenzione farmacologica che quella fisica, rappresentano, attualmente la metodica di prima scelta per poter gestire al meglio l’agitazione/iperattivita motoria e il wandering negli assistiti anziani con demenza in un contesto ospedaliero o nelle case di riposo. In letteratura vi e una carenza degli studi che trattano, in maniera specifica l’importanza, l’uso e l’efficacia/inefficacia dei trattamenti non farmacologici.\r\nCONCLUSIONI: la letteratura, mostra chiaramente il fatto che non tutti i sintomi comportamentali della demenza possono essere trattati mediante l’uso dei farmaci, prevalentemente antipsicotici e benzodiazepine, e che la contenzione fisica ha effetti altamente inabilitanti ed e controindicata nel trattamento del “vagabondaggio”. Quindi, in assenza di risposte terapeutiche risolutive diventa molto importante prendersi cura della persona malata per migliorarne la qualita di vita. Un miglioramento della qualita di vita o comunque un miglioramento del wandering si e potuto nottare nell’uso della bambola terapeutica, durante gli interventi di musicoterapia e di interventi nei quali il soggetto era impegnato. Dagli studi, risulta evidente che i trattamenti non farmacologici, rispetto alla contenzione chimica e fisica, non producono effetti collaterali.",

      "abstract": "Cognition is the process of identifying, selecting, interpreting, filtering, and using information that makes sense.It encompasses a complex function concerning the domains of memory, executive, attention, perception, language, and psychomotor.Consequently, impaired cognitive function in adulthood might potentially lead to a decrease in the function of daily activities, increase the injury risk, require the attention of caregivers, and increase death risk.In adulthood, this function is affected by education level, physical activity, sedentary behaviour, stress, disease history, history of head injury, and Body Mass Index (BMI).Physical activity plays an important role in brain health across all age groups, specifically among young adults, which is the peak of changes in certain cognitive abilities.Furthermore, it consists of sedentary behaviour, as well as very mild, mild, moderate, heavy, and very heavy physical activity.Watching television, sitting in front of a computer, driving a vehicle, sitting at work, playing, sitting while listening to songs are physical activities that include sedentary behaviour.Prolonged sedentary time potentially affects areas of cognitive function causing weaker executive function and slower processing speed.Currently in Indonesia, the adult age group above 18 years is still dominated by obesity and malnutrition problems.Meanwhile, both high BMI and obesity are associated with low-grade chronic inflammation and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, which explains the detrimental effects of cognitive function.This indicates a high BMI causes lower cognitive performance in the areas of attention and impulsivity compared to individuals with a normal value.The purpose is to review the effect of sedentary behaviour and BMI on-cognitive decline in-young adults.Journal searches are conducted by researchers by looking from various sources such as PubMed / NCBI, google scholar, science direct by entering the initial keyword sedentary behaviour, which is then followed by other keywords namely cognitive, body mass index, and young, adults.The result of this review is the effect of sedentary behaviour on the cognitive decline is due to different physiological responses at the molecular level in obese individuals or others with excess BMI which decreases cognitive function through several mechanisms such as low-grade chronic inflammation, brain structural changes, and changes in leptin levels.Conclusion based on a literature review is sedentary behaviour and higher BMI can decline the cognitive function.",

These observations suggest that memory stores in senile dementia remain outside the destructive action of the senile atrophic process, in any case until the expressive speech is preserved. Storage of the information acquired before the appearance of the symptoms of dementia is unlikely to depend on the degree of its personality importance. Before it becomes strongly manifest, senile dementia does not prevent the stamping on the person's memory, at least of part of new information (possibly, of only emotionally significant). Such material may also be stored in the patients' memory even in case of pronounced dementia. Difficulties in active reproduction of the ideas available in memory stores can already be seen at the early stages, becoming more remarkable as the disease progresses.",

      "title": "Post-Traumatic Effects of a Disability on the Sensory System and on the Psyche of Parents",
      "abstract": "The birth of a disabled child is generally associated with a break in continuity among the different types of psychic perceptions held by parents and the failure of normal prediction (anticipatory system concerning the child’s responses) which foresee and give meaning to situations. The emergence of the meaning of an affective experience is thus disrupted in the parents due to reciprocal difficulties in understanding and anticipating the feelings of the other. This makes it difficult if not impossible to invest the child libidinally and it disturbs the process of attachment to the disabled child. The experience of disability can be understood as a veritable trauma which carries with it a derailing of the state of consciousness–momentarily, over a long period, or intermittently–for the parents of children afflicted with chronic diseases or disabilities. This includes a dissociative process which makes it difficult to put in place perceptions of the real child (in the place of, or in continuity with the anticipated imaginary child) and the integration between various levels of perception. The author proposes a procedure for assisting the parents in two different directions: (a) The creation of a common perceptive base between the parents and caregivers and (b) The psychological assistance of parents throughout the therapeutic period and/or throughout rehabilitation. The author also proposes a treatment program, either for the child or for the parents along four dimensions: (1) Relations, parental perceptions, treatment; (2) Biological damage–capacities; (3) Resources–objectives; (4) Communication–information.",

Delirium is usually brief and reversible. It is defined as an impairment in consciousness (i.e., reduced awareness of the environment) and memory (i.e., reduced recent memory). It is a topic of particular medical interest currently. Amnestic disorders are rare and characterized as disorders of memory. Dementias are frequently progressive, and chances of recovery are rare except for several uncommon illnesses. Dementias are characterized by impairment in consciousness and inattention, orientation, memory, and other intellectual or cognitive functioning. Because many of these dementing disorders (Alzheimer’s, Pick’s, and Lewy body diseases) have neurological findings previously described at autopsy, historical review is provided.",

Asi mismo se interrelaciona con multiples problemas tanto fisicos, como psicologicos y sociales que pueden agravar o ser causa a su vez de las alteraciones del sueno. Reconocer los problemas del sueno y clasificarlos adecuadamente permite determinar la necesidad o no de estudios complementarios, seleccionar el manejo mas adecuado en forma individual, recomendar el manejo no farmacologico (terapia cognitivo conductual, manejo del ambiente), y si fuera necesario, determinar el tipo de farmaco mas adecuado en funcion de la asociacion existente con otras patologias (enfermedad pulmonar obstructiva cronica [EPOC], depresion, ansiedad, sindrome de piernas inquietas, etc.).

This article reviews the most recent and relevant contributions on cognitive, neuropsychological and behavioural outcomes, and the neuroradiological findings in extremely and very preterm infants. In the first 2 years of life, cognitive impairment is common: it has an incidence of 30–40% and a higher prevalence than neuromotor and neurosensorial impairments. Recent studies report that even preterm infants with no major disabilities at preschool age perform more poorly than term peers in multiple neuropsychological domains, such as language, attention, memory, visuomotor and visuospatial processing and executive functions.The incidence and severity of problems increase with decreasing gestational age. A delayed acquisition of neuropsychological functions and/or the occurrence of behavioural problems at preschool age are likely to be predictive of the high rate of cognitive deficits at school age and in adolescence. Neuropsychological functions across multiple developmental domains should be assessed longitudinally during routine follow-up checks.",

      "abstract": "76 children are studied--66 from the literature and 10 from a personal series--who developed epileptic seizures, paroxysmal EEG abnormalities and language deterioration after a period of normal development of language. The clinical features of the fits, the age at which the seizures appear and disappear, the age of the EEG normalization and the normal clinical and radiological examinations were reminiscent of partial benign epilepsies of childhood. Shortly after the language deteriorates, the awake EEG exhibits slow spikes that are diffuse or predominate in the temporal areas, sometimes asymmetrically. During sleep, the paroxysmal abnormalities are clearly bilateral and continuous or subcontinuous. Spontaneously or under medications, the intensity of the paroxysmal abnormalities decreases before clinical improvement occurs. In comparison with the mutism resulting from acquired hearing loss, it is suggested that the language disturbances in these children result from a functional disorganization of the language centers due to the important intercritical EEG abnormalities. In some children, these functional disturbances could result from a benign epilepsy. This view leads to discuss the prognosis and the therapeutic possibilities.",

Acoustic analysis of the patient's speech during interview reveals that the duration of pauses, independent of other linguistic or paralinguistic measures, correlates strongly with the clinician's impressions of the patient's flat affect and alogia. Pausing is less related to associality and other aspects of the negative syndrome. The hesitations appear to reflect a word-finding difficulty that, together with neuropsychological evidence of compromised performance on word fluency tasks, suggests a specific speech generation difficulty. The significant relationship between pausing and both flat affect and alogia suggests that the two negative signs share phenomenal and psychometric properties. The examination of speech generation mechanisms may provide an informative avenue for study of schizophrenic psychopathology. Acoustic analysis reveals processes that are not apparent to the clinician and may provide a useful basis for clinical assessments and research.",

The poor performance of movement skills marks developmental coordination disorder (DCD), and this defect affects the child's activities of daily living in innumerous ways. The ability of the child in the execution of the motor task is substantially below that expected for a child's chronological age and intelligence. DCD affects the child's ability in performing both gross and fine motor skills. Performing the Variety of motor tasks is impaired, and the child is isolated socially and emotionally. These children experience frequent academic failure because of their poor handwriting skill. Despite having IQ more significant than 70, these children experience academic failure. As because of their motor coordination difficulty, these children avoid peer group interaction. They were termed as clumsy and awkward, by their teachers and often by their peer group. Thus they were avoided by their peer group children. This recurrent isolation becomes permanent for children with DCD, and they tend to isolate themselves from everybody. As they become isolated, these children are more prone to psychological distress. As because of poor social interaction and participation in green land play along with peer group children, they were at high risk for obesity and other related disorders. Awareness of the importance of participation in a physical activity needs to be delivered for all the parents of children with and without DCD. Benefits of green land play need to be understood by the parents for further facilitation of children's engagement in physical activity sessions.",

Its clinical manifestations and severity of impairments vary from mild to severe. The core symptoms are frequently accompanied by a spectrum of neurobehavioral derangements, including hyperactivity, aberrant sensitivity to sensory stimulation, anxiety, mental retardation, seizures, selfinjury, sleep disturbances, and upset to change in routine. The etiology of autism is thought to involve an interaction between genetic susceptibility, mediated by multiple genes, and environmental factors. Epidemiological studies find a four times higher incidence of autism in boys than in girls. Because the primary diagnostic criteria of autism are abnormal behaviors, rather than biochemical or neuroanatomical factors, the use of animal models in the study of autism is unavoidable, as this is the only way to study behavioral defects within the context of the whole organism.",

He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

Polysomnography studies of ASD children showed most of their abnormalities related to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep which included decreased quantity, increased undifferentiated sleep, immature organization of eye movements into discrete bursts, decreased time in bed, total sleep time, REM sleep latency, and increased proportion of stage 1 sleep. Implementation of nonpharmacotherapeutic measures such as bedtime routines and sleep-wise approach is the mainstay of behavioral management. Treatment strategies along with limited regulated pharmacotherapy can help improve the quality of life in ASD children and have a beneficial impact on the family.

      "abstract": "Introduction1.1 Target groups of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells which are responsible for controlling voluntary movement.Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is a variant of ALS that affects the corticospinal upper motor neurons, limiting movement.ALS/PLS patients, as well as patients disabled from other degenerative diseases or brain injuries, have difficulty with everyday motor behaviors such as moving, swallowing, and speaking.In the later stages of disease, some patients may completely lose motor function and become totally 'locked-in' (Hayashi and Oppenheimer, 2003).Loss of motor function significantly affects patients' quality of life (QoL) (Mockford et al., 2006; Bromberg, 2008;Williams et al., 2008;Lule et al., 2009) and increases the financial burden for the cost of care (Mutsaarts et al., 2004).One important component of quality of life being addressed repeatedly by patients, specifically as the disease progresses, is the ability to communicate.A braincomputer interface (BCI) or brain-machine interface (BMI), has been proposed as an alternative communication pathway, bypassing the normal cortical-muscular pathway (Joseph, 1985;Kennedy et al., 2000).BCI is a system that provides a neural interface to substitute for the loss of normal neuromuscular outputs by enabling individuals to interact with their environment through brain signals rather than muscles (Wolpaw et al., 2002;Daly and Wolpaw, 2008).Recent years have featured a rapid growth of BCI research and development owing to increased societal interest and appreciation of the serious needs and impressive potential of patients with severe motor disabilities (Birbaumer and Cohen, 2007;Daly and Wolpaw, 2008).The majority of BCI-related publications have studied performance in healthy volunteers and focused on the development of signal processing/computational algorithms to improve BCI performance (Bashashati et al., 2007).Practical BCI clinical applications for the potential patient users, however, are still limited (Birbaumer, 2006a). Worldwide research on Electroencephalography (EEG)-based BCIThe BCIs using invasive signal methods to record intracortical neuronal activities have shown great promise in direct brain control of external devices in primates, for example, to restore self-feeding by controlling a 3-D robotic arm (Velliste et al., 2008).However, due to www.intechopen.com",

Normal development involves the early establishment of a secure attached relationship. From this solid base, the child can develop a sense of self whilst psychologically separating and individuating. Problems developing a secure attachment, or with separation and individuation, can lead to insecure ambivalent attachments and problems with development of identity and sense of self. If these problems progress into adulthood, there will be a poor sense of self, poorly formed identity and associated problems with self-esteem. Relationships may be associated with avoidance, intense ambivalence, or with loss of identity and individuality.",

      "abstract": "A large group of children suffering from difficulties in learning appear to do so on the basis of a constitutional genetic neurochemical dysfunction. Every emotionally disturbed or behavior problem children or slow learner should be examined for the soft neurological signs that reflect a developmental lag of the cerebellar-ARAS pathways. In my clinical experience 80 percent of such children have dysdiadochokinesis, which on continuation, augments seizure activity of the Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex. This activity is caused by a deficiency of GABA (an inhibitory chemical transducer) which is genetically endowed. Remedial programming and special education efforts can indeed be rewarding if this chemical deficiency is repaired via chemotherapy. Aside from those children with a biochemical basis for learning disability, there is a small group of children with intact neurological equipment who present a picture of psychogenic learning impediment. The importance of psychological factors in learning or reading disabilities should be reconsidered in light of the present knowledge of the neurophysiological correlates of learning and memory (early negative conditioning; oppositionalism; intolerance for anxiety; threat to omnipotence; fear of learning; negative symbolic associations to specific items; deflection of attention by intrapsychic conflict; retardation of secondary process thinking; lack of motivation). Children with emotional disorders are almost always markedly deficient in the necessary skills and requisite knowledge commensurate with their ages and will not automatically catch up as a result of therapeutic intervention alone. The neurochcmically impaired slow learner improves readily with GABA-enhanciny chemotherapy and maintains the improvement beyond the conclusion of a six-months' course.",

Desarrollo. El insomnio es un trastorno que se presenta como una dificultad para iniciar o mantener el sueno. La etiologia del insomnio infantil presenta causas multifactoriales. Para poder comprender y diagnosticar el insomnio en la infancia es necesario conocer los mecanismos que intervienen en la genesis de la vigilia y del sueno y considerar la existencia de otros tipos de trastornos. El insomnio se presenta como un desequilibrio entre la inhibicion de los sistemas que mantienen el estado de vigilia y de aquellos otros encargados de activar los sistemas generadores del sueno. En el nino, este desequilibrio depende de la situacion de inmadurez funcional propia de cada edad. El insomnio infantil aparece, mas que como una falta de sueno, como una falta de adecuacion entre el ritmo y la necesidad de sueno propia del nino y su entorno familiar y social. La causa mas habitual del insomnio es ambiental, conductual y de orden psicologico. Ante esta situacion, el diagnostico del insomnio infantil se basa en determinar un diagnostico diferencial con parasomnias, trastornos motores del sueno y del despertar. Conclusiones. El insomnio infantil plantea problemas para identificar sus causas, para diferenciar entre el autentico insomnio y otros trastornos del sueno y para su resolucion, debido a la influencia que el ambiente y la conducta del nino tienen sobre el sueno.",

The diagnosis is essentially clinical and is based primarily on history-taking and observation of the child over a period. There are several standardized screening tools and scales available to help make a diagnosis. Children with autism often present with speech delay and this has to be distinguished from other conditions. ASD is often associated with comorbid conditions which have to be identified to tailor the treatment program for each child. It is important that the parents or caretakers of the child are involved in the process of assessment and diagnosis and that their misconceptions and fears are addressed.",

Evidence has accrued suggesting that sleep disturbances are important pathways contributing to the mood disorders. The risk of depression is increased by preexisting insomnia, sleep problems interfere with depression treatment success, and in depressed adults treating the depression and insomnia is markedly better relative to treating depression alone. An evidence base is growing for the use of psychosocial treatments for sleep disturbance in youth. We describe the protocol we have developed for treating insomnia in depressed youth. Potential advantages for delivering psychosocial treatments for sleep disturbance, over medication treatments, are reviewed. We also discuss the importance of working with parents, the slight tip toward eveningness with the onset and progression through puberty, and the role of technology (cell phones, video games, etc.) in contributing to sleep disturbance.",

On the other hand, there were motor disorders, affecting movement but leaving cognition intact.

The division was stronger in the Anglo-Saxon countries than in Continental Europe, with its tradition of linking neurology and psychiatry.\n\nSince then, …",

A consensus paper of the German Association of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy (DGPPN) explains four possible scenarios of manifestation of such kind of damage, corresponding to somatic illnesses: evidence of structural brain lesions (rare), subjective suffering (sufficient, but not necessary), impairment of functioning in important areas of life, and severe impairment of social participation (e. g. by dangerous behaviour against others). This view corresponds with the WHO's bio-psycho-social concept of health.",

Various fields of research have given evidence to their maladaptiveness as ways of dealing with threatening stimuli. It has been found that defences can lead to insensitivity to danger signals, lowered coping capacity to life stresses with increased vulnerability to “psychosomatic diseases”, delay in seeking help for somatic symptoms, denial of death in dying patients, their relatives and medical attendants, and delayed or complicated grief reactions.",

The marked changes concern not only the outern appearence, but also its intrapsychic representations, the body image.

This is particularly the case if, in addition, nearly infantile disturbances in the socialisation or conflicts specific for this life period are, or have been, present. They can in the sense of a disposition lead to the manifestation of more or less severe crisis in adolescence. These crises interfere not only with the body image, but in many cases with the somatic functions as well. In the study three general aspects of this developmental problem are discussed as far they are relevant in the therapy of psycho-somatic disturbances in adolescents. 1. The implication of the adolescent phase in the course of psycho-somatic diseases. 2. Diseases which mainly occure in adolescence and are predominantly confined to this life period or are mainly influenced by it. 3.

Physical dependence, the inability to self-care in fulfilling urgent biological needs leads to a feeling of helplessness and is accompanied by depressive, neurotic reactions to the disease. Restoration of impaired functions after a stroke has a long period and the success of recovery depends, on the one hand, on the volume and location of the brain lesion, the severity of motor and cognitive impairments, on the other hand, on the position of the patient himself, the attitude of the patient’s personality to the disease and adherence to treatment. A patient’s stay in a hospital is associated with the social expectations of the staff for certain behavior of the patient: fulfilling the instructions of the attending physician, partnership with staff (physical therapy methodologist, speech therapist, occupational therapist, etc.), the patient’s activity, the formation of healthy lifestyle attitudes (giving up smoking, alcohol, fatty food, etc.), which can be called psychological conditions for rehabilitation. However, not all patients are ready to fulfill these rehabilitation conditions, which are targets for psychological correction. The tasks of psychological assistance should be focused on developing adherence to treatment, forming cooperative relationships with staff, and healthy lifestyle attitudes, which can contribute to restorative treatment and the prevention of recurrent stroke. Psychological assistance during individual and group work should be focused on providing emotional support, setting realistic and understandable goals for the patient, adequate to the patient’s capabilities, both in a hospital and clinic, which can ensure his active inclusion in the treatment process.",

The four most common causes of dementia are Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body dementia, vascular dementia and fronto-temporal dementia. The common presentation of dementia in people with ID includes memory loss and deterioration in speech, personality and behavioural changes, disorientation and functional deterioration. The diagnosis of dementia requires evidence of a definitive change in cognitive functioning such as impairment in memory, language ability (aphasia), ability to perform complex tasks (apraxia) and orientation in time and place. A number of medications are used in delaying the progress of dementia as in general population. Evidence base for the use of medication in people with ID is currently limited. Psychotropic medications have only a limited role in the management of neuropsychiatric symptoms in people with ID and dementia.",

      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition for which there is no known cause or cure. Autism is a highly variable disorder, the most prominent difficulties of which include aberrant behavior, poor social skills and disrupted communication skills. Evidence suggests that the prevalence of ASD is steadily rising and this has led to widespread speculation and research concerning the causes of the disorder. Following about 50 years of intensive study, researchers now believe that autism is a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur. Some of these distinct neurological causes are the focus of this review. We focus on findings that suggest that children with ASD have larger overall brain volumes and differences in brain growth trajectory. By adulthood those with ASD have anatomical and functional abnormalities in prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, temporal lobe, and the limbic system. Impairments in these areas, as well as under-connectivity between and within these brain regions, can lead to range of interrelated deficits in interpersonal interaction such as problems remembering and identifying people, the inability to perceive social cues, and misunderstanding nonverbal communicative cues such as gestures, facial expressions, and emotional prosody. A mechanistic understanding of the underlying neurology of ASD is a prerequisite before new therapeutic tools can drive functionally atypical brains in corrective directions. Recent studies investigating the neural response to treatment in autism are briefly reviewed. These highlight the need to study the neural basis of and response to treatment in ASD.",

This article suggests that by adopting the enactive approach to perception—according to which perceiving is a way of acting—we may be able to improve our understanding of the traumatic experience and the factors which result in the development of post-traumatic symptoms. The central argument presented in this paper is that when the options of flight or fight are unavailable as a coping/defense mechanism, one freezes (freeze response). In this situation, the ability to master one’s movements is damaged and, in radical cases, the ability to move is lost altogether; as a result the sensorimotor loop may collapse. This, in turn, leads to distorted perception and, in consequence, memory disorders may develop.",

Most cases are characterized by severe intellectual disability, absent speech, motor delays, and autism spectrum disorder. Many have abnormal brain imaging, dysmorphic facial features, and medical comorbidities: myopia, constipation, epilepsy, and apneic spells. The present case study expands existing understanding of this disorder by presenting a unique phenotype with higher cognitive abilities and fewer medical comorbidities. Methods: The present case study reports on a 13-year-old, Caucasian male with a recent diagnosis of PTHS following genetic testing (i.e., whole exome sequencing). He was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation to document his neurocognitive functioning to assist with intervention planning. Results: Evaluation of intellectual, attention/executive, memory, visual-motor/fine-motor, academic, adaptive, and emotional/behavioral functioning revealed global impairment across all areas of functioning. However, he demonstrated abilities beyond what has been detailed in the literature, including use of full sentences, capacity to learn and solve novel problems, basic academic functioning, and independent ambulation. Conclusions: Children with PTHS may demonstrate a spectrum of abilities beyond what has been documented in the literature thus far. Failure to recognize this spectrum can result in late identification of an accurate diagnosis. ( JINS , 2018, 24 , 995–1002)",

The behavior includes movements, emotional, perceptual or dreaming experience, frequently containing manifestations of autonomic nervous system. Parasomnias are devided into primary (ocurring etiher in NREM or REM sleep) and secondary (following organic system disease manifested during sleep). Primary parasomnias are further devided into those that appear during NREM, REM or states of consciousnes that do not respect boundaries between wake and sleep. Parasomnias represent an example of \"dissocitaion of sleep stages\" with the overlaping of wakefulness and NREM sleep (confusional arousals, somnambulism and night terrors) or wake and REM sleep (REM sleep behavior disorder parasomnia). NREM parasomnias are a significant clinical problem that appears with functional reorganization of the brain as it transits throuh different states of consciousness. Aside from the above dissociation there are other physiological phenomena that render behavior more complex during sleep such as 1) activation of locomotor centers during sleep, 2) sleep intertia (confusion and desorientation during transition from sleep to wakefulness) and 3) instability of sleep stages (rapid oscilation(s) between seleep and wake).",

      "title": "Dissociative Tendency, Anger Expression, and Frontal Activation During a Verbal Fluency Task",
      "abstract": "Dissociation in adolescence has been described as a part of severe psychopathology with a complex comorbidity or serious trauma including sexual abuse (e.g., Chu and Dill, 1990; Sar et al., 2006). In contrast, it is also possible for healthy subjects to experience nonpathological (nonclinical) dissociation including daydreams or defense from strong stressors (de Ruiter et al., 2006). It is important to clarify the etiology of dissociative experiences. For example, a lack of integration of consciousness, amnesia, derealization, or depersonalization, and some neural mechanisms underlying dissociation could be reasonably hypothesized as core features of dissociative disorders (DD). Particularly, self-reference related regions such as the medial prefrontal or ventral frontal area might be involved in identity diffusion or multiple identity disorder (Reinders et al., 2003). Actually, recent advances in neuroimaging technology enable us to explore the brain functioning of dissociation. Although it is ideal to examine a patient with DD who is experiencing dissociation in vivo, it is simultaneously intrusive to induce pathological dissociation using reminders or stressors. According to the spectrum of dissociative experiences, another option would be to examine nonclinical dissociation or dissociative tendencies in a typical setting. Dissociative experiences usually begin in childhood, and less than 8% of the DD diagnoses are made in adolescents between the ages of 12 and 19 (Kluft, 1984). Some of the experiences are not subjectively distressful; therefore, dissociation might be underestimated as a clinical phenomenon (Foote et al., 2006). Furthermore, recent campus mental health professionals in Japan have often indicated that a trend for defence mechanism is “to dissociate from repression” in young adults (e.g., Takaishi, 2000). Based on these assumptions, the present study focused on nonclinical dissociative tendencies and investigated frontal functioning during a cognitive task in healthy university students. Aggression or impulsivity is another important mental health topic in youth including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or childhood bipolar spectrum including temper dysregulation disorder. Impulsivity is related to the loss of response inhibition, particularly to the lack of frontal functioning (e.g., Chamberlain and Sakahian, 2007). A recent study concluded that slower cortical thinning in the prefrontal cortex during adolescence is characteristic of ADHD, providing neurobiological evidence for the",

This deletion results in haploinsufficency for the gene retinoic acid-induced 1 (RAI1), which is responsible for the major features of the syndrome. Heterozygous mutations of RAI1 also cause the Smith–Magenis syndrome phenotype in a small subset without deletions. The diagnosis is based on the clinical recognition of a unique and complex pattern of physical, developmental, and behavioral features, many of which are subtle in early childhood, becoming more distinctive with advancing age. There are characteristic craniofacial features, which appear to coarsen with age. Other common features include dental, minor skeletal, ocular, middle ear and laryngeal abnormalities, hoarse voice, marked early expressive speech, and language delays with or without hearing loss. Infantile hypotonia with failure-to-thrive and short stature are common in those with deletion. The degree of intellectual functioning is quite variable, and there is a striking neurobehavioral phenotype, including a chronic sleep disturbance associated with an inverted circadian rhythm of melatonin.",

En la version mas reciente del Manual Diagnostico y Estadistico de Trastornos \nMentales, se describe al autismo como un conjunto de modificaciones de la conducta que incluyen decremento en \nla interaccion social, decremento en las habilidades de comunicacion verbal o respuestas inapropiadas durante la \nconversacion, manifestaciones de conductas repetitivas o estereotipadas, carencia de empatia para entablar \nrelaciones afectivas y obsesiones inapropiadas sobre objetos especificos. Todo esto acompanado de una habilidad \ncognitiva que va desde altos niveles de inteligencia hasta alteraciones intelectuales severas. Por ello, ahora se \nreconoce al autismo como un abanico de conductas agrupadas bajo el concepto de Trastorno del Espectro \nAutista. Sin embargo, hay otros espectros, como aquel que esta directamente relacionado con las bases neurales. \nEn esta revision se describen las diferentes metodologias para diagnosticar conductualmente al autismo, las \ncomorbilidades que se presentan, las regiones del sistema nervioso central afectadas, y el papel que juegan las \nneuronas espejo y la glia; con ello se percibe que la etiologia del autismo puede presentarse en alguna de estas \nregiones. A pesar de que los temas no son exhaustivos, tienen el proposito de proponer que el Trastorno del \nEspectro Autista, que se basa en la conducta, tiene un segundo espectro: aquel que va de la conducta a la neurona",

      "abstract": "The main criteria for the diagnosis of delirium are a change in cognitive function with rapid onset of symptoms and/or fluctuating sensorium, impairment of attention and development of perceptual disturbance. Disorientation to time and place, and disturbance of the sleep–wake cycle are also common features (American Psychiatric Association 1994). The clinical picture in a developing delirium is often characterised by new onset: • social withdrawal • restlessness • anxiety (or an increase in anxiety) • irritability • insomnia • nightmares (Jacobson & Leuchter 1996) There is a lack of consensus about the factors that are likely to precipitate a delirium. The most significant risk factors for Levkoff et al (1992) are ageing, dementia, sensory impairment, ill-health and being in institutional care. However, the use of physical restraints, malnutrition, more than three medications, presence of an indwelling bladder catheter, and ‘any iatrogenic event’ were identified by Inouye and Charpentier (1996). They also propose sleep deprivation, sensory impairment, existing cognitive impairment, poor hydration and nutritional status and immobility as risk factors (Inouye & Charpentier 1996). Some of the risk factors identified clinically are: • large number of medications • drug and alcohol use / misuse or withdrawal • dehydration and poor nutrition • hepatic or renal dysfunction • electrolyte disturbance • sensory impairment • sleep deprivation • existing cognitive impairment / brain damage • pain • respiratory / cardiovascular disease • infection • immobility Stephen Harding MMHN CCMH CertPsych CredMHN RN, Lecturer, School of Nursing and Midwifery, University of South Australia Email: sharding@netspace.net.au Continuing Professional Development Managing delirium in older people",

      "title": "A Conceptual Review on Insights of Pakshaghat (Hemiplegia) in Ayurveda",
      "abstract": "Pakshaghata is a clinical entity that is classified as the umbrella of substantial Vata vyadhi which includes the eighty varieties of Nanatmaja Vata Vikara, also referred to as Vata dominant vikruti (illness). Loss of voluntary function on one side of the body is termed as Pakshaghata. By stating that morbid Vata beholds either side of the body, dries up the Sira (Nerve) and Snayu (Tendon) of that section and brings Cheshta-Nivrutti (lack of movement), Ruja (pain), and Vaakstambha (unable to speak), Pakshavadha (Pakshaghata) explains. Among the disorders of Madhyama Roga Marga, or Marma-Asthi-Sandhi Marga, is regarded as Pakshaghata. Hemiplegia can be used to interpret Pakshaghata's description. Hemiplegia is often associated with stroke, among other factors. A stroke involves an abrupt loss of blood flow to part of the brain, causing ischemia and neurological issues like weakness, sensory loss, or speech difficulties. Strokes are a major cause of hemiplegia, accounting for 9.94% of all deaths in India, with an incidence of 200 per 100,000 people. This rate is rising in developing countries like India. Stroke is not a single disease but a group of disorders, often leading to severe, long-term disabilities affecting both body and mind. In managing Pakshaghata, Ayurvedic practitioners recommend various treatments including Snehana (oleation), Sweda (sudation), Mrudu Samshodhana (mild purification), Mastishkya Shiro Basti (head treatments), Nasya (nasal therapy), Upanaha (poultice), and Basti (enema) based on Vyatyasa Chikitsa Siddhanta (principle of variable treatment). The purpose of this study is to review Pakshaghata (hemiplegia) in a systematic manner and to illustrate the efficacy of several Ayurvedic treatments for the disease.",

In the healthcare field, sufficient sleep is imperative to ensure optimal patient care. Sleep deprivation can result in greater procedural errors, which places the clients at risk. Insufficient sleep negatively affects the nervous system, resulting in poor brain function. Because of the cognitive decline that is associated with sleep deprivation, academic performance is often decreased. In order to combat the phenomenon of sleep deprivation, positive lifestyle behaviors and sleep hygiene should be maintained. For students, academic and financial demands can contribute to physiological stress, which may cause impaired sleep quality. In particular, poor sleep quality, insomnia, and daytime sleepiness are reportedly prevalent in college students. Therefore, it is crucial that the effects of sleep deprivation in university students be further studied and interventions to alleviate the problem be explored.",

      "title": "Disability and mental illness are different entities and should be assessed separately",
      "abstract": "The acceptance of the conceptual position presented by Üstün and Kennedy is of great importance for psychiatry and for medicine as a whole. Disability — whether defined as a functional impairment in terms of the DSM-IV or as a limitation of an individual's activities as is done in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) 1 — must be assessed separately and not as a part of the individual's mental illness. It would be wrong to make the diagnosis dependent on the presence or absence of disability. Disability is produced by mental disorder, but it also depends on simultaneously present comorbid diseases or impairments. The latter is becoming a consideration of growing importance. A significant proportion of people with mental illness also suffer from physical illnesses and it is therefore difficult if not impossible to assess to what an extent the disability is caused by the mental disorder and to what extent it is produced by the comorbid conditions. Disability must refer to the person who suffers from a disease (or diseases), lives in a particular setting, receives a particular treatment and has personality traits that define the way in which he or she will live with a disease. Assets that a person with a disease might have — be it an artistic gift or access to wealth — will also affect the occurrence and severity of disability. The realization that the disability is linked to the person and not to the disease is of significance in developing rehabilitation services, in assessing the levels of support that society will offer to the disabled person and in determining what treatment can be offered if a disease occurs. Psychopathological findings define diagnosis but must be complemented by other assessments if they are to help in the estimation of \"caseness\" relevant to the provision of services or the estimation of needs for them. \"Caseness\" will be defined taking into account the psycho-pathological findings, the disability and the distress that the individual presents and relates to his or her medical/psychiatric condition. Persons with a particular psychiatric diagnosis can become \"cases\" for the mental health services when their disability is more pronounced (e.g., because of changes of the environment) or when their distress is enhanced (e.g., by learning about the prognosis of their condition). In clinical work and for research purposes, the assessment of the presence of a disorder, of disability and of distress must be accompanied by an estimate of their severity. The severity of the disease is usually assessed with reference to the numbers and the frequency of occurrence of symptoms, the severity of disability by the type and number of activities in which the individual cannot take part, and the severity of distress on the basis of analogy with states that the distressed individual and the diagnostician both know and have experienced. Severity can be measured as a dimension or as a feature that divides into several operationally defined categories. The same is true for disability and for distress, but not for the psychopathological symptoms, which must have features that make them recognizable as being qualitatively different from normal functioning. Severity of distress and severity of disability are usually correlated with the severity of the clinical syndrome, but this is not always the case. Distress might be linked to the vision of the future rather than to the level of disability or the severity of the clinical condition. The possibility that a black wart might be a melanoma will cause great distress although there are no limitations of activity and no certainty that the wart contains cells that are malignant or that it will be growing rapidly. The severity of disability might be linked to the severity of the clinical picture, but this is also not so for most of the time a person has a disease — with the exception of the most severe states of the disorder, for example in profound dementia or in a coma. People with a variety of psychopathological symptoms are often living in their community, with little or no limitation of their activity. The usefulness of the framework presented above for research purposes depends on the possibility of measuring syndromes, disability, distress and their severity in reliable and valid ways. The development of instruments that will help researchers to do this is clearly a major challenge for the ICD and the DSM committees. The usefulness of the same framework for clinical practice will depend on making the need for these measurements explicit and on training practitioners in making the necessary assessments. Practitioners have used the four dimensions mentioned above in dealing with people who came to ask for their help ever since medicine has been invented. A study of the way in which clinicians are operating may give precious information about their methods of assessment, which, when combined with results of research using valid and reliable assessment instruments, might allow the creation of training programmes that will make the classification of diseases accepted and used as a basis for research and for practice.",

      "title": "SP0030 Reasons for delay in help seeking at the onset of symptoms",
      "abstract": "<h3></h3> Early intervention following the onset of chronic illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and Sjogren's syndrome can improve disease prognosis, reduce illness related disability and improve patient quality of life. Therefore, it is vital that the time between symptom onset and treatment is short, however, many patients experience long delays. The period of time between an individual's first detection of a bodily change and the first consultation with a healthcare professional is known as patient delay, while the time between first consultation and been referred to a rheumatologist for treatment is known as healthcare professional delay. Patient delay can be attributed to a range of barrier to consultation, these include contextual barriers (e.g. geographical location, financial barriers and availability of health services), individual barriers (e.g. demographic characteristics and health literacy) the nature of symptom onset (e.g. intermittent symptoms or the experience of a symptoms commonly associated with many conditions such as fatigue) and psychological barriers (e.g. perceptions of illness, the normalising symptoms interpretation of symptoms and fear and worries about wasting the doctor's time). Many interventions to reduce patient delay focus on educating the public about the typical symptoms associated with a specific illnesses in the hope that greater awareness will lead to better recognition of early symptoms. These interventions are based on the premise that the general public may hold misrepresentative stereotypes of what it is like to experience an illness or may even have no stereotypical belief (also known as a prototypical belief) to compare their current symptoms to. There is very little evidence about the evolution of early symptoms over time and how patients appraise these early symptoms and then decide to seek help. Furthermore, the non-specific nature of early symptoms for many rheumatological conditions can also be a significant barrier to patients recognising that symptoms are indicative of a chronic illness. For example, patients may attribute symptoms to stress, ageing or a temporary condition and actively choose not to seek help. Therefore, we must explore patients beliefs about symptom experience and not just focus on their beliefs about specific illnesses. Understanding early symptom presentation and the way that early symptoms are interpreted by patient is important for the development of robust help seeking interventions. However, interventions to promote prompt help-seeking based on symptom presentation must also take in to account for contextual, individual and psychological barriers which may interact with individual perceptions of early symptoms. Understanding the factors which lead to patient delays and healthcare professional delays across rheumatological conditions can ensure that interventions to reduce delay are developed using a robust evidence base. Evidence based interventions such be multifaceted and may include the development of public health information (e.g posters, tv campaigns etc), the development of robust online information and challenging mis-information online, addressing health inequalities which may lead to delay (e.g. increasing the accessibility of health services and promoting health literacy in hard-to-reach communities) and developing educational information for healthcare professionals. <h3>Disclosure of Interest</h3> None declared",

      "title": "La Realidad Virtual como Herramienta Terapéutica en Niños con TDAH",
      "abstract": "La Realidad Virtual como Herramienta Terapéutica en Niños con TDAH&#x0D; &#x0D; El TDAH es una trastorno neurobiológico descrito como un patrón continuo de inatención y/o hiperactividad-impulsividad que impide al niño realizar las actividades diarias. Los niños con TDAH también pueden experimentar dificultades para mantener la atención, la función ejecutiva (habilidad del cerebro para comenzar una actividad, organizarse y llevar a cabo tareas) y la memoria de trabajo (aquella que permite mantener la información temporalmente y manipularla durante un periodo corto de tiempo). &#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; Los niños con TDAH presentan multiples síntomas y todos ellos tienen un gran impacto en las áreas de funcionamiento del niño (académica, familiar y social). Algunos de esos síntomas son: dificultades para mantener la atención, para seguir instrucciones, parece no escuchar, comete errores por descuido, incapacidad para permanecer sentado mucho tiempo, hablar en exceso, le cuesta esperar su turno, interrumpe a los demás. &#x0D; En la última década, muchos autores han demostrado que las tecnologías de realidad virtual se utilizan cada vez más tanto en el área educativa como en el área de rehabilitación. &#x0D; La Realidad Virtual (RV), es una tecnología que simula un entorno imaginado o real, como un aula, una habitación o un parque. Al usar esta tecnología, los usuarios pueden interactuar y comportarse como lo harían en el mundo real.&#x0D; “Según la última versión del Manual Diagnóstico y Estadístico de los Trastornos Mentales (DSM-V), el TDAH afecta aproximadamente al 5% de los niños\"&#x0D; Los sistemas de RV se caracterizan por la interacción y la inmersión. La interacción entre la persona y el sistema de RV se logra a través de muchos canales sensoriales (vista, oído, tacto y olfato). La inmersión es el grado en que la persona se siente envuelta dentro del sistema. &#x0D; Gracias a estas características la realidad virtual tiene tres ventajas fundamentales en la rehabilitación de niños con TDAH: &#x0D; Por un lado, la flexibilidad, la cual permite individualizar el tratamiento ya que el terapeuta puede controlar el programa para adaptarlo y graduarlo según las necesidades del niño. Por otro lado, la seguridad, ya que es una de las principales preocupaciones de los padres. Los niños con TDAH pueden no tener desarrolladas las habilidades cognitivas necesarias para entender situaciones peligrosas y detectarlas. La RV ofrece entornos realistas y seguros. Por último, la generalización del aprendizaje de un entorno (colegio) a otro (casa) muchas veces es un reto para los terapeutas. Gracias a la RV el niño puede realizar las actividades en un entorno simulado facilitando la transferencia al entorno real. &#x0D; En definitiva, los sistemas de realidad virtual proporcionan al terapeuta un equilibrio entre la flexibilidad y el control del programa de tratamiento. El realismo del entorno simulado ofrece al niño el aprendizaje de habilidades de manera segura y además permite que estas habilidades se transfieran a su vida cotidiana. &#x0D; La RV no sólo es útil en el tratamiento del niño con TDAH si no que tiene también la capacidad de realizar algunas pruebas neuropsicológicas de una manera más fiable, como es el caso de la prueba de rendimiento continuo ( “Continous Performance Test” o CPT por sus siglas en inglés), prueba muy utilizada tanto en la práctica clínica como en la investigación del TDAH que evalúa la atención sostenida y selectiva y la impulsividad. &#x0D; Numerosos estudios concluyen que la RV mejora la memoria, la función ejecutiva y los diferentes tipos de atención (atención focalizada), la atención sostenida, la atención selectiva, la atención alternante y la atención dividida) en niños con TDAH. &#x0D; Dependiendo del tipo de interacción entre el niño y el sistema existen distintos tipos de sistemas de RV. Sistemas de gestos, sistemas basados en el sistema táctil y sistemas enfocados en la retroalimentación. &#x0D; Por un lado, los sistemas con interacción basada en gestos son aquellos que han incorporado cámaras que capturan el movimiento o los gestos del niños de manera que el niño interacciona en tiempo real con los objetos virtuales. Por otro, los sistemas con interacción basada en el sistema táctil, que constan de dispositivos como ratones, joysticks o pantallas táctiles. Por último, los sistemas de interacción enfocada en la retroalimentación, que utilizan la RV como el medio para proporcionar un refuerzo. &#x0D; “La Realidad Virtual es una herramienta útil para la evaluación y tratamiento de niños con TDAH ”&#x0D; La RV se puede aplicar a niños con otras patologías muy frecuentes en poblaciones pediátricas como la parálisis cerebral o el autismo, donde la RV ayudará a mejorar déficits motores que afectan a las funciones de las extremidades superiores e inferiores y al control postural en el caso de la Parálisis Cerebral (PC) y dificultades en la socialización y comunicación en el caso del Trastorno del Espectro Autista (TEA). &#x0D; En definitiva, la RV permite que los niños puedan aprender y desarrollar habilidades específicas para ellos en un entorno seguro para después transferirlo a un entorno real y además estar en un proceso de continuo aprendizaje gracias a la posibilidad de adaptación y graduación del programa por parte del terapeuta.&#x0D;",

We will review the most recent epidemiological, electrophysiological, genetic and pathological research on this topic. From these data, a comprehensive model for SIDS has been proposed: the death would result from the combination of three factors (a prenatal vulnerability, a critical developmental period and an exogenous postnatal stress) and three potential mechanisms (deficiencies in breathing, autonomic and sleep-wake controls). As arousal represents the last chance of survival when an infant is exposed to a life-threatening challenge during sleep, failure to arouse could be involved in the final pathway of SIDS. An infant could be vulnerable to SIDS because of a deficiency in cardio-respiratory or in sleep/wake behaviour controls during sleep. Genetic, metabolic, nutritional or toxic prenatal brainstem injury could be responsible for these deficits. The infant s vulnerability lies latent until he/she enters the critical developmental period from 2 to 6 months when significant changes in sleep-wake, breathing and autonomic controls occur. The accident has a greater probability of occurring when the infant is exposed to an infection, or an unfavourable environmental factor which enhances the immature cardio respiratory and sleep/wake behaviours of the infant.

Unani scholar and researcher clear that Sleeplessness increases with age due to increase formation of melancholic humor in advance stages. Sleep strengthens vital force (Quwā Haywāniyya), pneuma (Rūh), and promotes proper digestion of food. Sleep provides Freshness of organs by abolishing tiredness and prepares the body for further work which is necessary for normal health and maintenance of the power of body [1]. Insomnia leads to stress, fatigue, anxiety, excessive resolution of body fluid which leads to reduction of defensive mechanism of the body thus it leads to health deterioration. In this review paper we aims to define insomnia, what are the causes of insomnia, sign and symptoms of insomnia, complications and basic principle of management.",

      "title": "Multiple Sulfatase Deficiency",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Initial symptoms of multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD) can develop from infancy through early childhood, and presentation is widely variable. Some individuals display the multisystemic features characteristic of mucopolysaccharidosis disorders (e.g., developmental regression, organomegaly, skeletal deformities) while other individuals present primarily with neurologic regression (associated with leukodystrophy). Based on age of onset, rate of progression, and disease severity, several different clinical subtypes of MSD have been described: Neonatal MSD is the most severe with presentation in the prenatal period or at birth with rapid progression and death occurring within the first two years of life. Infantile MSD is the most common variant and may be characterized as attenuated (slower clinical course with cognitive disability and neurodegeneration identified in the 2nd year of life) or severe (loss of the majority of developmental milestones by age 5 years). Juvenile MSD is the rarest subtype with later onset of symptoms and subacute clinical presentation. Many of the features found in MSD are progressive, including neurologic deterioration, heart disease, hearing loss, and airway compromise. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of multiple sulfatase deficiency is established in a proband with low activity levels in at least two sulfatase enzymes and/or biallelic pathogenic variants in SUMF1 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Progressive hydrocephalus, seizures, spasticity, spine instability or stenosis, eye anomalies, cardiovascular disease, hearing loss, poor growth, dental anomalies, developmental delays, and respiratory issues are managed in the standard fashion. Obstructive sleep apnea may be treated with adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy, although affected individuals have a higher surgical complication rate; ventilator support (CPAP, BiPAP) can also be considered. Precautions are needed during anesthesia to address airway maintenance, as progressive upper airway obstruction and cervical spine instability are common. Poor bone health may require supplementation with vitamin D and encouragement of weight-bearing exercises. Alternative routes for nutrition (tube feeding) are frequently necessary. Surveillance: Monitoring of head circumference at each visit; serial brain/spine imaging, as needed based on symptoms; cervical spine imaging prior to any procedure that requires neck extension. At least annual vitamin D level, eye examination with intraocular pressure measurement, EKG, echocardiogram, and audiology evaluation. Abdominal ultrasound, sleep study and pulmonary function tests, neuropsychiatric testing, and assessment of blood and urine acid-base balance as clinically indicated. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Neck hyperextension (including hyperextension used for intubation) because of the risk of spinal cord compression; foods that are a choking hazard. Genetic Counseling Multiple sulfatase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% change of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible using molecular genetic techniques if the pathogenic variants in the family are known.",

      "abstract": "Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is classified into several types. However, syndromes that do not belong to these typical types of PPA have been reported, such as cases where only progressive apraxia of speech (AOS) is present in the early stages of the disease. Moreover, there have been a few case reports of patients with progressive word deafness complicated with logoclonia as a speech disorder. Herein, we report a case of degenerative disease with phonological paraphasia, AOS, impaired speech sound cognition, and logoclonia with disease progression. The written language comprehension of the patient was superior to that of spoken language, and she could communicate in writing. She was neurologically normal; had no apraxia, agnosia, or memory impairment; and was independent in activities of daily living. Although she had moderate hearing loss, her speech-related hearing loss was disproportionately high. In analyses of brain imaging, dilation of the left Sylvian fissure, atrophy, and hypoperfusion of the superior temporal gyrus were prominent, and hypoperfusion of the left lateral frontal lobe was observed. Cerebrospinal fluid examination suggested that Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology was unlikely, and decreased uptake was observed on a dopamine-active transporter scan. Word deafness was thought to be the most likely cause of the dissociation between spoken and written language in our patient. Our case and previous studies suggested that there is a syndrome presenting word deafness and speech movement disorders among patients with progressive communication disorders as a different entity from PPA. Although patients with this syndrome may experience agrammatism, inner language disorders are generally not as severe, and disorders in areas closer to the primary area, such as the motor and auditory areas, as well as cortical and subcortical disorders, are involved in this syndrome.",

People with the APD do not have hearing impaired, but can not hear and understand voice sounds, especially in a noisy environment, and achieve normal limits results on standard audiological tests. The cause of the APD is not exactly established, and is estimated to affect 2-5% of the children's population. The PSP can coexist with various other disorders, such as language difficulties and learning difficulties, but it is never the consequence of these difficulties. The aim of this work is to collect and summarize the relative literature that describes and describes therapeutic procedures in hearing disorders. APD assessment and therapy require a multidisciplinary approach. It is essential to start with a comprehensive intervention immediately after setting up a APD diagnosis because the difficulties a child may have can significantly undermine communication, learning, and social development. The primary goal of the therapy is to increase the ability to use the information presented in the auditory modality. PSP therapy includes auditory training, adaptation of the environment, and application of compensation strategies.",

This chapter describes the mental phenomena prior to their becoming part of the formulation of particular disorders, but for convenience and coherence some common syndromes, such as mania, are used to draw together the associated phenomena. A hierarchy moving from feelings through emotions, moods, and affective state to temperament involves increasing complexity in terms of state of mind and usually to an increasing duration of that state. Delusion involves abnormal beliefs that arise in the context of disturbed judgements and an altered experience of reality. Depersonalisation and derealisation are assumed to arise from a disruption in the functions of consciousness to create amnesia, dissociative identity disorder and depersonalisation disorder.

      "abstract": "Peripheral deafness may be inherited or acquired, congenital or later-onset, and sensorineural or conductive. The most commonly observed forms are inherited congenital sensorineural, acquired later-onset sensorineural (ototoxicity, presbycusis) and acquired later-onset conductive (chronic otitis externa/media). In most dog and cat breeds inherited congenital sensorineural deafness results from perinatal degeneration of the stria vascularis, the vascular bed of the outer wall of the cochlear duct, which leads to hair cell degeneration. The strial degeneration appears to result from the absence of melanocytes, but their function in this structure is unknown. Ototoxicity may result from any of a large number of drugs and chemicals that directly or indirectly destroy cochlear hair cells. The effects are dose-dependent and in rare cases reversible. The most commonly recognized ototoxic drugs are the aminoglycoside antibiotics. Presbycusis, the ageing-related progressive hearing loss unattributable to other causes, is sensorineural but may also include mechanical changes in the tympanum and ossicles. Hearing aids may be accepted by some dogs as long as some residual function remains. Breeds reported to have been affected by congenital sensorineural deafness are listed and those with the highest prevalence are noted. Methods for diagnosis of deafness are described.",

      "abstract": "To the Editor: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) classically presents as Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome (recurrent falls, gait disturbance, parkinsonism with poor response to levodopa, supranuclear gaze palsy).1 Rarely, cortical symptoms of PSP dominate the initial clinical presentation, with movement difficulties occurring at a later stage in the clinical course. One of the cortical presentations is primary progressive aphasia (PPA) in the form of progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) or apraxia of speech (AOS).2-4 Herein is reported an individual with PSP presenting initially as semantic dementia (SD). A 72-year-old man presented with a 2-year history of memory impairment. He was occasionally unable to recall what he was doing. There was no impairment in basic or instrumental activities of daily living. Over the next 6 months, he had progressive deterioration in language function. His speech was fluent but characterized by marked anomia with circumlocution. He also had difficulty understanding words in the newspaper and had dyslexia and dysgraphia. Physical examination (PE) showed no focal neurological deficit or parkinsonism. Vitamin B12, folate, thyroid function test, and Venereal Disease Research Laboratory were unremarkable. Computed tomography of the brain was normal. His Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was 28 (2 marks deducted for orientation). Formal assessment by a speech therapist showed impairment in confrontation naming and word comprehension. There was no impairment in repetition or multistep command comprehension. Positron emission tomography (PET) of the brain showed bilateral anterior temporal lobe hypometabolism (Figure 1A). Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB) imaging showed no amyloid burden (Figure 1B). He was diagnosed with SD and encouraged to have more conversation at social gatherings and to practice object-naming exercises at home. Over another 6 months (1 year after initial presentation), he experienced recurrent falls (3–4/month). The falls were nonsyncopal and mostly occurred when he attempted to turn around. His wife noted that he was having difficulty looking down. PE revealed a mask-like face, low blinking frequency, and supranuclear downward gaze paresis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed midbrain atrophy and tegmental atrophy (Figure 1C,D). A review of the brain PET showed hypometabolism over the midbrain region (Figure 1A). He was diagnosed with PSP and referred to a geriatric day hospital for fall prevention. The initial clinical and radiological features (PET-PIB) support an initial diagnosis of SD.5 Postural instability, supranuclear gaze palsy, and typical MRI findings supported the ultimate diagnosis of PSP.6, 7 Previously reported presenting language disturbances for individuals with PSP were mostly PNFA with AOS.2-4 PFNA is characterized by agrammatism, phonemic paraphasia, and effortful speech, with preservation of word comprehension and object knowledge.5 AOS is characterized by effortful halting speech with inconsistent speech sound errors and distortion.4, 5 To the knowledge of the authors of the current letter, there was no previous report with imaging support of PSP presenting with SD. This case illustrates the lack of sensitivity of current diagnostic criteria of PSP (including National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and Society for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and the Neuroprotection and Natural History in Parkinson Plus Syndromes diagnostic criteria) in clinically diagnosing PSP with atypical presentation (e.g., language impairment).8 Perhaps addition of subclassification of atypical PSP (e.g., PPA) as the initial presentation should be added in future diagnostic criteria of PSP. Geriatricians should be aware of PSP in individuals with PPA, which may help to minimize the risk of falls and of aspiration from dysphagia using intervention measures such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, home modification, and swallowing training. The limitation of this case report is the lack of pathological confirmation. PSP is a tauopathy. From previous pathological studies of SD, 70% had ubiquitin-positive but tau-negative inclusion pathology, and 25% had tau-positive inclusion pathology.9, 10 Although only a minority of individuals with SD had tau inclusions, it is possible that individuals with PSP may present with SD. Previous autopsy studies found that individuals with atypical PSP had pathological changes in the neocortex in addition to the more-typical sites, including subcortical and brainstem structures and the precentral gyrus.3 The manifestation of SD described herein may be because of pathological involvement of the bilateral anterior temporal lobes, as reflected in the brain PET. In summary, PSP may present initially with language impairment in the form of SD in addition to the more often reported PNFA or AOS. Individuals with PPA in the form of SD or PFNA should be closely monitored for clinical features of PSP. Conflict of Interest: The authors have no financial or any other personal conflict to report.

      "abstract": "Key-words Disease name and synonyms Definition/Diagnosis criteria Excluded diseases Differential diagnosis Etiology Clinical description Genetics Diagnostic methods Frequency Genetic counseling Antenatal diagnosis Management including treatment Unresolved questions References Abstract Microcephaly is defined by an occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) below -2 standard deviation (SD) for age and sex. Severe microcephaly refers to an OFC < -3SD. Microcephalia vera (MV) and microcephaly with simplified gyral pattern (MSG) are genetic forms of isolated congenital microcephaly (< -3 SD at birth), with no extracerebral malformation. Their incidence has been estimated between 1/25 000 and 1/50 000 births. In MV, the brain is abnormally small because of a reduced number of neurons, but is keeping (sub) normal gyral pattern and has no other gross pathological abnormality. Mental retardation is usually moderate and in most cases, patients have no systematized neurological defects or seizures. Brain weight typically is < 500 g (1/3 normal) and OFC is between 24 and 29 cm at birth (normal OFC being higher than 32 cm). MSG has been misdiagnosed as MV or lissencephalies in the past. This disorder is defined by congenital severe microcephaly, reduced number and shallow appearance of gyri, and normal to thin cortex. Five types of MSG have been delineated on the basis of MRI and neurodevelopmental findings, but MV and MSG are likely to represent a continuous phenotype. Mental retardation ranges from mild and moderate (type 1) to severe (types 2 to 5). Pyramidal signs may be observed. Some forms (types 2 to 5) are associated with early-onset seizures and a poor prognosis. MV and MSG are due to abnormal neuronal and glial proliferation. In both types, the cortex is of normal (2.5 mm to 4 mm) or reduced thickness and has normal cytoarchitectonic appearance, with 6 layers of neurons, which contrasts with microlissencephalies or lissencephalies with microcephalies, characterized by an abnormal cortical thickness and an anarchic cytoarchitectony. MV and MSG are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. To date, no locus has been associated with MSG. Eight loci have been associated with MV and among those, three genes have been identified, MCPH1, ASPM, SLC25A19.There is no specific treatment for MV and MSG.",

The language loss is often characterized by a severe disturbance of auditory language comprehension (verbal auditory agnosia) combined with a substantial disruption of expressive language. Comorbid behavioral disturbances commonly involve hyperactivity and attentional problems but sometimes encompass a more pervasive pattern of difficulties resembling an autism spectrum disorder. Now one the most frequently described forms of acquired aphasia in children, LKS has had a profound influence on both neurological practice and cognitive neuroscience.

      "abstract": "Abstract Cognition is the action or faculty of knowing—knowledge—implying consciousness. The complex faculty is taken to include orientation, attention, memory, language functions, gnosis, visual perception, comprehension, abstraction, reasoning, constructional praxis, judgement, and new learning. Definitions of dementia emphasize memory loss, the presence of other cognitive disturbances, a progressive course, and the presence of diffuse brain disease. Thus the DSM-IIIR criteria for probable Alzheimer’s disease require the presence of dementia; deficits in two or more areas of cognition; progression; normal consciousness; and the absence of other diagnosable pathologies. The diagnosis is supported by progressive deterioration of specific cognitive skills; impaired Activities of Daily Living and inappropriate behaviour; positive family history; normal cerebrospinal fluid; normal electro-encephalography (EEG) or non-specific changes only; and CT evidence of cerebral atrophy. But to require the absence of other pathologies begs the question as to the diagnosis and makes the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease one of exclusion. In this chapter, we will survey briefly those conditions which fulfil many of the criteria for Alzheimer’s disease but exhibit physical signs or other clinical features which disallow that diagnosis. As there are so many of them, those occurring less frequently are included in an appendix at the end of this chapter.",

The response of a maculopathy is the formation of a scotoma that can be relative or absolute with difficulty or impossibility to read, write and see the normal activities of daily life. The visually impaired person therefore has an insufficient level of visual ability to perform daily activities, work or leisure activities that are usual for individuals of the same age, sex and sociocultural status. A more or less serious low vision and a visual disability are thus created. The visually impaired person is able to use the eccentric visual residue in the preferential retinal network.

      "title": "What Is Personality Disorder?",
      "abstract": "What Is Personality Disorder? Hanna Pickard (bio) The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 689) defines personality disorder (PD) as: A. An enduring pattern of experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of an individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas: 1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events); 2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response); 3. Interpersonal functioning; and 4. Impulse control. B. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations. C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood. E. The enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder. F. The enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., head trauma). Unlike schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other Axis I conditions, PD is not conventionally understood as an illness or disease. Rather, as the name implies, it is a disorder of the personality: an ‘enduring pattern of experience and behavior.’ Metaphorically speaking, it is a condition that is internal to the kind of person someone is, a part of who they are. It is not an external condition that befalls them. Very roughly, personality is the set of characteristics or traits that make us the kind of person we are: the ways we are inclined to think, feel, and act in response to particular circumstances, as well as more generally. All of us have one. PD occurs when the set of characteristics or traits that make a person the kind of person they are causes severe psychological distress and impairment in social, occupational, or other important contexts: the ways a person is inclined to think, feel, and act do them harm, directly or via the effects they have on relationships, work, and life more generally conceived. Diagnosis of a PD requires that these characteristics or traits be long-standing, pervasive, difficult to control or change, and markedly different from cultural expectations. Equally, the distress and impairment caused must be sufficiently extreme to warrant clinical attention: the person needs clinical care and help. Nonetheless, all of us possess characteristics or traits that sometimes incline us to think, feel, and act in ways that cause us distress and adversely affect our social, occupational, or other functioning. PD lies on a continuum with normal human personality. The broad category of PD is currently divided into three subcategories or ‘clusters.’ Cluster A comprises paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal PD. These are more colloquially known as the odd [End Page 181] and eccentric or ‘mad’ PDs. Cluster B comprises narcissistic, borderline, histrionic, and antisocial PD. These are more colloquially known as the dramatic, emotional, and erratic or ‘bad’ PDs. Cluster C comprises obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, and dependent PD. These are more colloquially known as the anxious and fearful or ‘sad’ PDs. A person cannot be diagnosed with any particular PD unless there is clinically significant distress and impairment. But, given that this condition is met, which kind of PD they have depends on what kind of personality they have–on the nature of the problematic pattern of experience and behavior. Stepping back and considering the wider context, the picture painted of PD is bleak. PD is associated with genetic factors (Jang and Vernon 2001) and also environmental conditions (Paris 2001). These include dysfunctional families, where there is breakdown, death, institutional care, and parental psychopathology; traumatic childhood experiences, with high levels of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse or neglect; and social stressors, such as war, poverty, and migration. There are high levels of comorbidity among PDs, and between PDs and psychotic disorders, eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse (Moran 2002). Finally, there is also a strong association between PD and violence and crime, self-harm, and suicide (Moran 2002). As this picture...",

      "abstract": "Online dictionaries provide a suggestive translation for the burnout concept: \"The tubes burned out easily and had to be constantly replaced...\".This is the sequence of events that leads to the syndrome: the depletion of one's own intellectual energy, usually directly tied to the profession one has, presumably exerted with great passion and dedication, after a long lasting effort.The most accurate definition, including the eventual prophylactic actions to be taken, is based on the context in which this syndrome manifests: the surpassing of one's resistance to professional effort and of one's capability to recuperate (1,17).Its manifestation, perceived by others and by the affected individual consists of behaviors and feelings, more or less subjective, noticed by the individual and/or those around him/her.The most common symptoms overlap those found in various types of depression: fatigue, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, irritability, depressed mood, lack of pleasure and motivation for daily activities concerning -surprisinglythose linked to professional activity.Other symptoms are included in the psychosomatic category: headaches, lumbago, gastrointestinal problems, breathing difficulties, loss of appetite, various cenesthetic complaints.If we use the word symptoms we must include our description in the biological model, which is not necessary the case here.Official psychiatric classifications do not recognize burnout as a form of depression.International Classification of Diseases (ICD 10, 1992) (2) includes this syndrome in the last chapter (amongst \"Factors influencing health status and contact with health services\" codes Z00-Z99, in \"Problems related to life management difficulty\" code Z73.0 together with other \"problems\", such as \"Accentuation of personality traits\" including type A behavior pattern, \"Lack of relaxation and leisure\", \" Stress, not elsewhere classified\", \"Inadequate social skills, not elsewhere classified\", \"Social role conflict, not elsewhere classified\", ranging from Z73.1 to Z73.5), all of which do not refer to nosological entities, but to particularities varying with context and eventually with the individual's psycho-social vulnerability.We can thus define burnout as a cumulation of psychological symptoms, more or less interchangeable with the psychiatric equivalents, already indexed among the diagnostic criteria of some psychiatric disorders (exhaustion depression, stress disorders etc.) (3).It is true that, given time, these psychological symptoms and disfunctions can translate to actual depressive symptoms.Because burnout is, in fact, a surpassed work-related state, it is wise to be aware that the onset of the symptoms might show a change in the individual's professional life.This means that the professional act, which one performs with a",

The SMI term has traditionally been defined in terms of diagnosis, duration, and disability. Specifically, the term refers to mental disorders that carry certain diagnoses, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression; that are relatively persistent; and that result in comparatively severe impairment in major areas of functioning, such as vocational capacity or social relationships.",

In cases of intrapartum asphyxia, the duration of oxygen deprivation may vary and is critical to the ensuing insult to the infant’s vital organs and, especially, to the brain. Oxygen deficiency at tissue level (hypoxia, see Box 60.1) is often accompanied by glucose and nutrient deprivation, and is further compounded by pre-existing or complicating factors in the mother, especially pyrexia, and in the infant such as sepsis or congenital anomalies, the concomitant degree of metabolic derangement (e.g. extent of hypoglycaemia or metabolic acidosis), and the time to delivery and effective resuscitation. All of these factors will potentially compound any hypoxic injury and the extent of any ensuing brain damage, described as hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE, Box 60.1). Attempts to assign an HIE ‘grade’ may help to correlate early symptoms and signs with the degree and likelihood of long-term sequelae [2], although accurate prognostication of asphyxial brain damage remains difficult.",

Each boy presented in early infancy with visual unresponsiveness, which spontaneously resolved. This delayed visual maturation was accompanied or followed by severe autistic impairment, general developmental delay, hypotonia and clumsiness. Subsequent progress has been unexpectedly favourable, with striking improvements in language, play, social interest and social competence. Widespread, patchy delay in brain maturation could possibly account for this combination of delayed visual maturation and autism, with a good prognosis. RÉSUMÉ Maturation visuelle retardée et autisme L'article décrit trois garcons présentant un désordre développemental complexe, avec jusqu'à ce jourun relativement bon pronostic. Chaque garcon avait présenté durant la première enfance une absence de réponse visuelle, ayant disparue spontanément par la suite. Ce retard de maturation visuelle s'accompagnait de troubles autistiques sévères, d'un retard global de maturation, d'une hypotonie et d'une maladresse. Les progrès ultérieurs ont étè favorables de facon inattendue, avec une amélioration frappante du langage, du jeu, de I'intérèt et de la compétence sociale. Un retard de maturation cérébrate, avec des localisations précises et en grand nombre, pourrait expliquer cette association de retard de maturation visuelle et d'autisme, avec bon pronostic. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Verzögerte visuelle Reifung und Autismus Es werden drei Jungen mit einer mehrschichtigen Entwicklungsstörung beschrieben, die, soweit man das bisher beurteilen kann, eine relativ gute Prognose zu haben scheint. Im fruhen Kindesalter zeigten die Jungen keine Reaktion auf visuelle Reize, was sich spontan änderte. Diese verzögerte visuelle Reifung war begleitet Oder gefolgt von schweren autistischen Symptomen, allgemeinen Entwicklungsverzögerungen, Hypotonie und Ungeschicklichkeit. Der weitere Entwicklungsfortschritt war unerwartet gut, mit bemerkenswerten Besserungen in Sprache, Spiel, sozialen Interessen und sozialem Verhalten. Eine ausgedehnte fleckige Hirnreifungsverzögerung könnte die Ursache fur diese Kombination von verzögerter visueller Reifung und Autismus mit guter Prognose sein.

Typically, these events cause neurological complications (i.e., epilepsy).Objective: cognitive function estimation in TSC children considering severity and nature of clinical course of the disease. 15 children with tuberous sclerosis (i.e., experimental group) and 46 children with normal development (i.e., control group) aged 6-16 years old underwent neuropsychological examination. As a result, polymorphic disorders of higher mental functions were revealed in TSC children. Neuropsychological deficit (p&lt;0.05) was detected. Namely, voluntary attention and memorization impairments were found in TSC children with normaldevelopment. Operational thinking disorders, immaturity of dynamic and kinesthetic movement basis, somatosensory gnosis, optical spatial or quasi-three-dimensional imaging, as well as insufficient oral/aural and semantical memorization were mentioned in TSC children with mental retardation. Regardless of mental development, TSC children demonstrate neurodynamic activity disorder (p&lt;0.05) presented by slow task performance, increased exhaustibility and attention fluctuation. According to comparison between research findings and clinical course data, severity of cognitive disorders substantially depends on epilepsy onset age because early onset results in more severe developmental disorder (p&lt;0.05). Since tuberous sclerosis is a dynamic disease with new potential symptoms arising over a lifetime, neuropsychological testing will provide timely mental status qualification and development of corrective actions to activate the cognitive activity of a child.&#x0D; Keywords: tuberous sclerosis, children, higher mental function (HMF) developmental disorders.",

      "abstract": "Pharmacological concerns need epidemiological elucidation\n\nPatients with depressive disorders could be more liable to accidents than others for several reasons. These include impaired attention and concentration (often due to preoccupation with morbid or worrying thoughts); anxiety, which usually accompanies depression; irritability; agitation or retardation; fatigue after sleepless nights; and weakness due to insufficient food intake. In addition, depressed patients may take risks with little regard to the consequences, make suicidal gestures or attempts that go wrong, and take alcohol or other substances that impair functioning to relieve distress. In keeping with these considerations are the reductions in performance in tests of cognitive and psychomotor function in depressed patients.1\n\nIf depression causes or contributes to accidents in these ways then therisk of accidents might be expected to fall as the disorder improves in response to treatment with antidepressant drugs (or other treatment). On the other hand, the unwanted effects of antidepressants may adversely affect cognitive and psychomotor function (especially in those with pre-existing cerebral impairment), thereby increasing the risk of accidents. This is particularly the case in patients who do not respond to treatment and thus are impaired by both the depression and the drug. Drug induced effects may be clinically obvious, with, for example, somnolence due to oversedation; mild effects may be evident only on formal psychometric testing.

A range of psychological variables and concepts have been shown to play important roles in pain perception, maintenance and exacerbation of pain, disability, and response to treatment. The role of operant conditioning [learning] and cognitive factors [i.e., beliefs, perceptions of control, coping strategies] on the maintenance and exacerbation of pain and disability are reviewed. Particular attention is given to the effects of psychological factors on behavioral responses and physiological activity associated with pain. It is suggested that rather than viewing the pain experience as either organically-based or psychologically-based that both of these factors need to be viewed as contributors to the perception and response to pain.",

      "abstract": "Dementia is increasing as nations’ populations across the world age and older adults survive in increasing number. Dementia has various etiologies and forms of expression thus accurate diagnosis is always a challenge. Detection of any adult-age cognitive impairment in health care settings is difficult in general but can be especially challenging among adults with neuroatypical or neurodivergent conditions (NACs). Most clinical guidelines/protocols applicable to the general population for assessing mild cognitive impairment or dementia do not include considerations when assessing adults with NACs. This article addresses the obstacles to early detection and assessment of adults with NACs and recounts what one national group undertook to raise awareness of this obstacle. These conditions often present assessment challenges as adults with NACs often have problems with comprehension, oral communication, motor task performance, recognition of assessment related visuals, and comfort in testing situations. Clinicians assessing adults with NACs face challenges due to an inappropriateness of using standardized dementia assessment measures, are often untrained or unfamiliar with discerning pre-existing conditions from new cognitive impairment and are uninformed as to how to adapt the testing situation. The investigation into NACs and dementia assessment lead to a series of recommendations to raise awareness among clinicians, seek to enlist professional organizations in adapting existing instruments, and increase research into NACs and dementia.",

Unfortunately, the areas of life that have been ignored may be those that are most important to individuals, and may also be the most sensitive to the first signs of developing disability. The ability to perform valued life activities, the wide range of activities that individuals find meaningful or pleasurable above and beyond activities that are necessary for survival or self-sufficiency, has strong links to psychological well-being - in some cases, stronger links than functional limitations and disability in basic activities of daily living. A broader assessment of disability has great potential for interrupting the disablement and distress process, thereby improving the quality of life of individuals with arthritis. Assessment of the effects of arthritis, pain, or other chronic health conditions should expand beyond assessment of functional limitations and disability in basic activities to include assessment of disability in advanced, valued activities.",

Variando em graus de gravidade, que se manifesta por dificuldades na linguagem receptiva e expressiva, incluindo processamento fonologico, na leitura, escrita, ortografia, caligrafia, e por vezes em aritmetica. Dislexia e uma condicao hereditaria associada a diversas anormalidades neurologicas em areas corticais visuais e auditivas. Uma das mais influentes teorias para explicar os sintomas dislexicos e a chamada hipotese magnocelular. Segundo esta hipotese, a dislexia resulta de processamento de informacoes visuais anormais, devido principalmente a disfuncao no sistema magnocelular. Esta dissertacao explora esta hipotese comparando quinze individuos com dislexia e quinze controles, com idades compreendidas entre os 18 e os 30 anos atraves de dois testes visuais de atencao. Ambos os experimentos avaliam tempo de reacao a estimulos que apareciam em toda tela do computador, enquanto os individuos permaneciam instalados, com a cabeca apoiada por um chin rest e com os olhos fixos em um alvo central. O experimento I consistiu de estimulos (pequenos circulos) brancos apresentados em um fundo preto. No experimento II, a mesma metodologia foi utilizada, mas agora com os estimulos (pequenos circulos) verdes sobre um fundo vermelho. Os resultados foram analisados levando em consideracao os quadrantes onde os estimulos foram apresentados. Pacientes e controles nao diferiram em relacao ao tempo de reacao a estimulos apresentados no campo visual inferior, em comparacao ao quadrante superior de um mesmo individuo. Considerando todos os quadrantes, dislexicos tiveram tempo de reacao mais lento no experimento I, mas apresentaram tempos de reacao semelhantes aos controles no experimento II. Estes resultados sao compativeis com anormalidades no sistema magnocelular. As implicacoes destes achados para a fisiopatologia da dislexia, bem como para o seu tratamento devem ser mais discutidos.(AU)",

      "abstract": "The article lays out a theoretical analysis of the problem with diagnosing apathy in today's research. Apathy is a state characterized by a simultaneous decrease in the behavioral, cognitive and emotional concomitants of goal-directed behavior due to loss of motivation [15]. Behavioral changes lie in a declining everyday problem-solving effectiveness at home or work. Cognitive changes result in reduced cognitive functioning and a lack of plans and life strategies. Emotional changes manifest in a decrease in affective response to events that previously elicited either a positive or negative emotional response. Diagnostic criteria, or the 'gold standard' for apathy, identify behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and social symptoms of apathy that cause clinically significant disorders in personal, social, professional, or other important areas of life. The differential diagnosis of apathy involves its clinical distinction from syndromes such as delirium, dementia, depression, abulia, akinesia, and demoralization. The review can be useful for psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and all practitioners who interact with people at risk of developing apathetic states.",

Delirium is distinguished from dementia (with which it may coexist, as dementia is a major risk factor for delirium) by its speed of onset (over hours or days) and reversibility with correction of the underlying cause.

The main considerations in the differential diagnosis in preschoolers with inadequate language are hearing loss, mental deficiency, dysphasia, and autistic spectrum disorders. Attention to the child's ability to engage in symbolic play and communicate meaningfully is the key to this often baffling differential diagnosis. With the exception of definitive assessment of hearing, classic medical investigations are seldom informative because structural brain lesions and metabolic errors are much rarer etiologies than prenatal and genetic influences on brain development. While many children improve with age, the underlying deficit(s) usually persists. The role of the physician is to detect the developmental problem, give the parents a correct diagnosis, refer the child for appropriate investigation and intervention, and provide follow-up and counseling. Early diagnosis is essential for effective remediation. (<i>AJDC</i>1988;142:1119-1124)",

      "abstract": "To review the origin, development and present state of autism, pervasive developmental disorders, progress in diagnostic tools, genetic advances, neurobiological bases, the possible causes of the increased prevalence of autism and the present treatment of the autistic condition.Autism is a neurobiological, life-long disorder characterized by abnormal social skills, deficient verbal and not verbal communication, symbolic and imaginative play, reasoning and related complex behaviour. Autism is 4 times more frequent in males. 70% are mentally retarded (30% mild and the rest moderate and severely retarded). Approximately 25% have convulsions and around 65% inspecific EGG abnormalities. Other conditions like ADHD, anxiety, depression may be associated. RMN: increased subarachnoidal spaces, moderate ventricular enlargement, 20% have megaloencephaly. PET and 31 PMMR show increased glucose metabolism and decreased functional links with association cortex. Mental level and language are the best prognostic indices for outcome. Pathology: reduced size of nerve cells in hippocampus, subiculum, sections of the amygdala, mamillary bodies, medial septal nucleus, decreased size of cerebellar hemispheres, posterior vermis, VI VII neocerebellar lobules. Evolution: in a small group about 9-31% live independently, 11-50% attend college.Autism is a disorder of multi-factorial origin with a genetic polygenic component and the influence of environmental elements. Treatment with risperidone improves symptoms.",

      "title": "Consciousness in Non-REM parasomnia episodes",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sleepwalking and related parasomnias are thought to result from incomplete awakenings out of Non rapid eye movement (Non-REM) sleep. Non-REM parasomnia behaviors have been described as unconscious and automatic, or related to vivid, dream-like conscious experiences. Similarly, some observations have suggested that patients are unresponsive during episodes, while others that they can interact with their surroundings. To better grasp and characterize the full spectrum of consciousness and environmental disconnection associated with behavioral episodes, 35 adult patients with Non-REM sleep parasomnias were interviewed in-depth about their experiences. The level of consciousness during parasomnia episodes was reported to be variable both within and between individuals, ranging from minimal or absent consciousness and largely automatic behaviors (frequently/always present in 36% of patients) to preserved conscious experiences characterized by delusional thinking of varying degrees of specificity (65%), often about impending danger, variably formed, uni- or multisensory hallucinations (53%), impaired insight (77%), negative emotions (75%) and variable, but often pronounced amnesia (30%). Patients described their experiences as a dream scene during which they felt awake (‘awake dreaming’). Surroundings were either realistically perceived, misinterpreted (in the form of perceptual illusions or misidentifications of people) or entirely hallucinated as a function of the prevailing delusion. These observations suggest that the level of consciousness and sensory disconnection in Non-REM parasomnias is variable and graded. In their full-fledged expression, Non-REM parasomnia experiences feature several core features of dreams. They therefore represent a valuable model for the study of consciousness, sleep-related sensory disconnection and dreaming.",

Most cases are due to a loss of cochlear hair cell function and are well mediated by communication courtesy and modern amplification technology. Severe hearing loss is generally due to cochlear problems or age-related diseases and may require speech reading, assistive listening devices, and cochlear implants, depending on the degree of loss. Presbycusis may seriously impair communication and contribute to isolation, depression, and possibly dementia. Accurate diagnosis and prompt remediation are widely available but are frequently underused.

      "abstract": "Common causes of memory loss in older people are mild cognitive impairment, the various types of dementia, and psychiatric illness, mainly depression. Around 10% of patients with mild cognitive impairment progress to dementia each year. Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60-80% of cases. Other common types of dementia are vascular, fronto-temporal, Lewy body, Parkinson's, and mixed type dementia. There is evidence to suggest that dementia pathology is established before the onset of symptoms, and thus mild cognitive impairment can be considered as a predementia stage. NICE guidance suggests examination of: attention, concentration, short- and long-term memory, praxis, language and executive function. Particular attention should be paid to any signs of neglect, state of dress, agitation or poor attention. Dysphasia and difficulty in naming objects is often present. Mood symptoms (including suicidal ideation) may be primary or comorbid. Abnormal thoughts and perceptions should be probed for, as psychotic symptoms are common. Primary care options for cognitive testing include the General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition or the Abbreviated Mental Test Score. Physical examination should include observation of gait, inspection for tremor; examination for rigidity, bradykinesia, frontal release signs, upper motor neurone lesions, pulse and BP. Structural brain imaging can improve diagnostic accuracy, exclude other pathologies and act as a prognostic marker of dementia progression but the overlap in structural changes between the dementias makes imaging alone insufficient for diagnostic purposes. NICE guidelines recommend referral to a memory clinic for patients with mild cognitive impairment, those at high risk of dementia, such as patients with learning disabilities, Parkinson's disease, or patients who have had several strokes.",

      "title": "Aggression and Violence",
      "abstract": "In this chapter, we cover aggression associated with psychiatric, neurological, and general medical conditions. The focus is on hostile behaviors that threaten or inflict harm. Definitions of aggression, violence, and related terms used in this chapter are in Table 6–1 . Although most aggression involves intent to harm, the definition we use does not require it because clinically important aggressive behavior can occur in the absence of demonstrable intent—such as in patients with cognitive disorders. We set aside behaviors that may be characterized as agitation, such as yelling, screaming, and other nonthreatening outbursts; oppositional and resisting behaviors; intrusiveness; and fidgeting, pacing, and other hyperkinetic actions. We also do not address community violence or criminality. Terms used in this chapter Aggression Hostile, threatening, and violent actions directed at person(s) or object(s), sometimes with no (or trivial) provocation Violence Overtly aggressive actions directed at person(s) or object(s) Domestic violence Behaviors directed against an intimate partner, ranging from verbal abuse to threats and intimidation to sexual assault and violence Agitation A state of pathologically intense emotional arousal and motor restlessness Disinhibition A state in which the individual's capacity for preemptive evaluation and restraint of behavioral responses is decreased or lost Impulsivity A state characterized by a proneness to act without thought or self-restraint; a habitual tendency toward \"hair-trigger\" actions Irritability A state of abnormally low tolerance in which the individual is easily provoked to anger and hostility Psychiatrists mainly encounter aggression and violence when patients present for treatment in acutely ill states. Aggression may present as a complication of delusional psychoses, dementia, delirium, intoxication, personality disorders, and even adjustment disorder. It may complicate nonpsychiatric illnesses because it can develop when patients feel disregarded, dissatisfied, frustrated, confused, frightened, disenfranchised, thwarted, or angered by perceived mistreatment. Aggression can be perpetrated by men or women and by individuals of any age (except early infancy). It is seen in all patient care settings—outpatient clinics, inpatient units, rehabilitation programs, residential and custodial care facilities, nursing homes, and emergency departments (EDs). Aggressive behavior can result in involuntary confinement (in hospitals and jails), disruption of clinical and custodial care environments, longer hospital stays, and physical injury to patients, their caregivers, and their health care providers. Family members, home health aides, and health professionals who are repeatedly exposed to aggression generally experience demoralization, which adversely affects the quality of care the patient receives. In this chapter, we focus on aggression and violence in the medically ill, beginning with the frequency, correlates, risk factors, and causes of aggressive and violent behaviors in diverse clinical settings, with reference to the host, agent, and environment causal model. We also discuss elder abuse and intimate partner violence, which are not necessarily manifestations of illness but are important causes and correlates of psychiatric and medical morbidity (we do not address child abuse). We review the evaluation, case formulation, and differential diagnosis of aggression and the management of aggressive behavior in the general hospital, including the ED.",

Systemic asphyxia resulting from a disruption in placental gas exchange occurs perinatally in 2–4 per 1000 full-term infants. Approximately 15–20% of infants who develop brain damage subsequently die during the newborn period, and up to 25% of survivors exhibit permanent neurological disabilities. Neurologic abnormalities, such as movement disorders (e.g., ataxia, choreoathetosis, diplegia, or dystonia), epilepsy, and developmental delay, are possible lifelong consequences that occur following perinatal HI. Preterm or term HI infants have damage in the forebrain and brain stem, with basal ganglia and somatosensory systems showing selective vulnerability. The mechanisms for this brain damage and the resulting neurologic disorders in newborns are still not understood. Unfortunately, no treatments for the prevention or amelioration of this neurologic injury are available for infants and children who have suffered HI.",

      "abstract": "The article pinpoints the importance of recognizing affective disorders in the mentally retarded population, especially in those individuals with profound to moderate mental retardation. They cannot easily say how they feel and how they think, even if they have a language. People with mental retardation are very dependent on other people, both for having a good life and for being seen if they do not. They may or may not be genetically disposed for affective disorders. They may react with an affective illness on psychologic traumas or changes in their lives. In an affective disorder we often see changes in vegetative functions, such as appetite, sleep, motor activity, and voice. We can also see changes in behavior, such as isolation, episodes of whining, and diminished self-care skills. The author underlines how important it is for the doctor to use what he knows about affective disorders and to be able to see it through overshadowing symptoms. If the behavior of a mentally retarded individual changes over a period of time and he/she cannot express his/her feelings and thoughts, the doctor must talk with persons who know him/her well, see the mentally retarded person, and examine him/her somatically, including the ears and eyes. The doctor must finally consider whether the behavior and the vegetative symptoms may be indicative of depressive or manic illness. It is important that reliability and validity studies are done in diagnosing affective disorders among mentally retarded people.",

      "title": "The ICSD-3 and DSM-5 guidelines for diagnosing narcolepsy: clinical relevance and practicality",
      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disease manifesting as difficulty with maintaining continuous wake and sleep. Clinical presentation varies but requires excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) occurring alone or together with features of rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep dissociation (e.g., cataplexy, hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, sleep paralysis), and disrupted nighttime sleep. Narcolepsy with cataplexy is associated with reductions of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin due to destruction of hypocretin peptide-producing neurons in the hypothalamus in individuals with a specific genetic predisposition. Updated diagnostic criteria include the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and International Classification of Sleep Disorders Third Edition (ICSD-3). DSM-5 criteria require EDS in association with any one of the following: (1) cataplexy; (2) CSF hypocretin deficiency; (3) REM sleep latency ≤15 minutes on nocturnal polysomnography (PSG); or (4) mean sleep latency ≤8 minutes on multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT) with ≥2 sleep-onset REM-sleep periods (SOREMPs). ICSD-3 relies more upon objective data in addition to EDS, somewhat complicating the diagnostic criteria: 1) cataplexy and either positive MSLT/PSG findings or CSF hypocretin deficiency; (2) MSLT criteria similar to DSM-5 except that a SOREMP on PSG may count as one of the SOREMPs required on MSLT; and (3) distinct division of narcolepsy into type 1, which requires the presence of cataplexy or documented CSF hypocretin deficiency, and type 2, where cataplexy is absent, and CSF hypocretin levels are either normal or undocumented. We discuss limitations of these criteria such as variability in clinical presentation of cataplexy, particularly when cataplexy may be ambiguous, as well as by age; multiple and/or invasive CSF diagnostic test requirements; and lack of normative diagnostic test data (e.g., MSLT) in certain populations. While ICSD-3 criteria reflect narcolepsy pathophysiology, DSM-5 criteria have greater clinical practicality, suggesting that valid and reliable biomarkers to help standardize narcolepsy diagnosis would be welcomed.",

Parasomnias are classified according to the type of sleep in which they occur, namely non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep parasomnias (1). The first includes disorders of arousals, namely confusional arousals (and their recently identified variants of sleep-related abnormal sexual behaviors), sleep terrors, and sleepwalking. REM sleep parasomnias include REM sleep behavior disorder, recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, and nightmare disorders. Other parasomnias include sleep enuresis, sleep-related groaning, exploding head syndrome, sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep-related eating disorder. The latter shares many features with the disorders of arousals, being frequently associated to sleepwalking. Hence, parasomnias comprise a variety of abnormal sleep-related movements, behaviors, emotions, dreaming, and autonomic phenomena that emerge from sleep as an expression of an anomalous central nervous system activation during sleep.",

      "abstract": "One of your patients, a 24 year old student, has recently recovered from a first episode of functional psychosis. At a pre-discharge meeting with the patient and his relatives, they inquire about the long term outcome, in particular about the chances of a recurrence in the next few years.\n\n“Prognosis” concerns the prediction of future events. The main form of the prognostic question is usually “what is the likelihood of this particular outcome in a patient with this disorder?” In mental health, prognostic questions may be about the medium to long term outcome of an illness—or they may be about the short term likelihood of a serious adverse event—for example, homicide or suicide. We may also ask if there are any characteristics of the patient that make it more likely that they will have a particularly good or bad outcome. These prognostic factors can be demographic (eg, age or sex), disease specific (presentation and symptomatology), or the presence of other conditions (comorbidity).1 Prognostic factors are distinguished from risk factors for the disease because they are determinants of what will happen after development of the illness rather than deteminants of whether the patient will develop the disorder.\n\nTreatment is one form of prognostic factor, although a special form in that it can be manipulated to improve the likelihood of a beneficial outcome. The fact that treatment can be manipulated also means that it can be studied experimentally in randomised controlled trials. It is either impossible or unethical, however, to randomise most prognostic factors, and therefore alternative study designs are required. The aim of the alternative study design is the same as a randomised trial—that is, to provide an unbiased estimate of the effect of the prognostic factor. When randomisation is not possible, a cohort study is usually the most reliable …",

      "abstract": "Disorders of growth and pubertal development in the teenage years present as a spectrum of abnormalities embracing common normal variants, less common disease states, and rare disorders increasingly recognised and understood as genetic in origin. This brief review is intended to provide a guide to the diagnosis of problems presenting most commonly in adolescent/teenage children, to help with initial assessment and management and to stress the need for referral to appropriate endocrine or other specialist services. Long-term management of individual diagnoses is beyond the scope of this article (references are provided for further reading). In order to focus on the teenage child, precocious puberty (by definition, before the age of 8 years in girls and 9 years in boys) is not discussed, but readers can seek guidance from a recent review 1. Delayed grow th and puberty Pubertal delay is the commonest problem seen. It is usually associated with apparent poor growth ‐ but not necessarily with short stature, as growth rate is intimately related to pubertal development. What may seem to be growth failure is an inevitable consequence if a child is later than average with timing of onset of puberty (as are 50% of children!). The clinical problem is to decide whether development is abnormal, in terms of being late with the onset of puberty or of failing to progress to completion of puberty at a normal rate (arrested puberty). Growth delay is common and usually there is no underlying pathology (boys in particular may none the less benefit from treatment), whereas arrested pubertal development is a major cause for concern. By convention, delayed puberty is defined as lack of puberty at an age +2 standard deviations (SD) above the population mean (boys: 14 years; girls: 13 years) 2 . The mean time to progress from puberty onset in boys to adult testicular volume is 3.2± 1.8 years (mean ± SD), and in girls from onset of breast development to menarche is 2.41.1 (mean ± SD) years. Thus, if 4‐ 5 years have elapsed from puberty onset without completion, investigations should be made. Delayed puberty may be classified as primary delay (constitutional) or secondary delay (underlying chronic illness). Children with failure to enter puberty because of a disorder of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis may also be divided into two groups, having either hypogonadotrophic or hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism",

      "title": "Current Issues of Medical Support of Innovative Scientific and Pedagogical Projects",
      "abstract": "The modern education system is characterized by the introduction of new, specialized, and author's programs, which are highly variable, accompanied by the intensification of the educational process, increasing the total workload, reducing physical activity, and deteriorating the structure of the daily routine of students. Such changes in the organization of the educational process lead to an increase in the level of pathological lesions, asthenoneurotic reactions, and symptoms of dysfunction of somatic systems. A particularly vulnerable category of students is gifted children, who on the one hand, experience discrimination at school due to the partial lack of differentiated learning, focus on the average student, and excessive unification of programs that do not take into account individual learning opportunities. On the other hand, intellectually gifted children showed a decrease in overall reactivity and tension of adaptation mechanisms, greater susceptibility to acute infectious diseases, the presence of autonomic disorders, hypotension and syncope, more often registered pathology of the gastrointestinal tract, musculoskeletal system, and allergies conditions than at the \"average intellectuals\". Therefore, this category of students needs a special approach and a deeper study of the impact of elements of the learning process on their health. Two separate areas of research have been formed by now. They are related to the study of psychological and pedagogical aspects of teaching children on innovative educational technologies, on the one hand, and the state of health of schoolchildren, on the other hand. However, only a few studies have been conducted where these two areas are combined and the direct impact of the educational process on new educational projects on disorders in morphofunctional, psychoemotional, and general health of students is determined, risk factors of the educational process are identified and recommendations for the prevention of school maladaptation are provided. Conclusion. Information analysis of scientific sources on current issues of education and medical care for gifted children and adolescents shows the interest of society in conducting further medical and pedagogical research to develop preventive measures to preserve their health. There is an urgent need for hygienic optimization of educational activities, proper regulation of innovative pedagogical technologies, development of appropriate guidelines for the prevention of school maladaptation",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT Acquired brain injury is one of the most common causes of long-term disability in childhood and traumatisms are the most prevalent cause. Diffuse axonal injury is associated with poor neuropsychological outcome. In contrast to early focal lesions, young age confers no advantage in the outcome of severe diffuse brain injury. Plasticity is incomplete for structural and functional deficits in children. The traditional view of enhanced reorganization of function after localized brain injury it can't be applied in early severe diffuse brain injury. In the paediatric population where the central nervous system is in a rapid state of growth, developmental factors may mask the difficulties and deficits in certain skills may not be evident until that skill is expected to emerge at a certain age. CONCLUSION Like in adults the neuropsychological domains more affected in childhood are psychomotor speed, memory, attention and executive functioning. In childhood neuropsychological deficits will affect learning and adaptive behaviour. Sometimes deficits will be cumulative over time.",

      "abstract": "Sensory deprivation speeds up the degenerative changes normally associated with aging and enhances the loss of functional cells in the central nervous system. Since it connotes reduction or absence of stimulation of the five senses, it involves the patient's physical activity, social relationships, intellectual status and overall \"value system.\" Geriatric patients with various illnesses are particularly vulnerable to sensory deprivation, which becomes increasingly pronounced as physical or mental deterioration progresses. All cells require stimulation for continued growth and activity; lack of stimulation leads to atrophy, with secondary physical or psychosocial abnormalities. Depression acts as a negative reinforcement of stimuli, and anxiety acts as a blocking mechanism. The goal of rehabilitation is to maintain and strengthen the patient's social values and to preserve mental and physical motility. The recommended procedure involves assessment of medical, psychologic and social factors, and determination of whether organic disease is present. A specific treatment plan to meet the individualized needs of each patient is then established so as to minimize sensory deprivation and maximize physical and mental functioning. Re-evaluation (physical and psychologic) at regular intervals establishes a pattern not only for individual comparison but for comparison with results in untreated control groups.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This paper reviews the spelling and writing deficits associated with the major forms of dementia.In dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT), the finding of surface dysgraphia is typical, although not universal, and with disease progression non-phonologlcally plausible errors often increase; additional difficulties with handwriting are common. Surface dysgraphia is a predictable feature in semantic dementia, but In contrast to DAT, the mechanics of handwriting are usually preserved. In patients with posterior cortical atrophy [Including some (atypical) DAT patients], spatial dysgraphia is an early symptom. Spelling and writing disorders have been documented, although not thoroughly studied, in other forms of dementia (e.g. vascular, frontal, dementia with Lewy bodies, etc.). Research on dysgraphia in dementias associated with movement disorders (e.g. cortico-basal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, Huntington's disease, etc.) has focused mainly on problems with writing, which is often poorly formed, but spelling impairments have also been observed. The precise characteristics and prevalence of spelling disorders in these diseases are, however, unknown as there has been little systematic study. Additional investigations, which assess both central (linguistic) and peripheral aspects of writing, and which include a longitudinal component, will help to elucidate the nature and progression of dysgraphia in different types of dementia.",

TSRD include disorders found in children age 6 and under (reactive attachment disorder, disinhibited social engagement disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD] &amp;lt; 6) and those described for individuals who are older than age 6 (PTSD, PTSD with dissociative symptoms, acute stress disorder, adjustment reactions, and other specific TSRD, e.g., complicated grief). Treatments for children under age 6 primarily focus on caregiver–child dyads. Post-trauma symptoms such as those described for PTSD with dissociative symptoms, complicated grief, and complicated trauma require alterations in proven trauma-focused methods. In addition to appropriately timed processing of the trauma, treatments for youths are best when they are multifaceted (also include, for example, focus on support systems and relationships; self-skills, e.g., regulation, coping; and other age, symptom, and trait-related factors). For children, treatment methods often include creative methods as well (e.g., drawings, storytelling).",

      "abstract": "Age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) refers to bilaterally symmetrical hearing loss resulting from aging process. Presbycusis is a complex phenomenon characterized by audiometric threshold shift, deterioration in speech-understanding and speech-perception difficulties in noisy environments. Factors contributing to presbycusis include mitochondria DNA mutation, genetic disorders including Ahl, hypertension, diabetes, metabolic disease and other systemic diseases in the intrinsic aspects. Extrinsic factors include noise, ototoxic medication and diet. However, presbycusis may not be related to the intrinsic and extrinsic factors separately. Presbycusis affects not only the physical, cognitive and emotional activities of patients, but also their social functioning. As a result, patients' quality of life deteriorates, compounded by various symptoms including depression, social isolation and lower self-esteem. Presbycusis is classified into six categories, as based on results of audiometric tests and temporal bone pathology, established by Schuknecht (1993): sensory, neural, metabolic or strial, cochlear conductive, mixed and indeterminate types. Among these, metabolic presbycusis is the mainstay of presbycusis types. Age-related changes also develop in the central hearing system. Functional decline of the central auditory system, caused by aging, reduces speech-understanding in noisy background and increase temporal processing deficits in gap-detection measures.

      "abstract": "Medieval terminology for mental health was a complex matrix of identifiers from legal, medical, and social sources and included terms for many mental, emotional, neurotic and psychotic conditions recognized today. Intellectual disability was one of those categories, especially in the legal realm, with the most-often used term being <italic>idiota</italic>. Governmental officials that became aware of properties in distress (unplanted, squatters ruining a site, etc) relieved individuals identified as <italic>idiota</italic> of their responsibilities and placed them into wardship with guardians, who not only cared for the wards but also their properties. The process of examination and civil ‘diagnosis’ of ability encompassed an individual’s intelligence, memory, cognitive ability, discretion, and, at times, appearance. The medieval terms, while not ‘intellectual disability’, certainly described differences in intellectual ability and used vocabulary appropriate for separate conditions, identifying a faulty memory, weak intelligence, difficult time managing property or goods, issue with coping day-to-day, or inability to have discretion. Medieval legal and administrative arms of the crown and local towns each used their own standards to judge competency and intelligence, yet all of them recognized the same wide variety of intellectual conditions and categories of symptoms for intellectual disabilities and other mental health conditions.",

      "abstract": "Introduction We know the coexistence of traumatic factors (loss of affective relationships, experiences of abuse, extreme risk situations, etc.) is common in psychiatric pathologies in which level of stress experienced exceeds normal capacity of the person, favoring the appearance of dissociative or excision mechanisms. A common mistake is to pathologize them and try to eliminate them. Objectives The objective of this paper is to study trauma and defense mechanisms involved, in order to carry out a better approach. Methods A bibliographic search was performed from different database (Pubmed, TripDatabase) about trauma, mechanisms involved and the construction of identity. Results We know neural pathways mature asymmetrically in evolutionary development (functions related to attention, concentration and executive function having special importance) and thus, traumas occurred in moments of greatest vulnerability such as early childhood, can damage and interfere with the correct integration of neural processes, producing disproportionate and unnecessarily maintained alert responses (common basis for many pathologies such as borderline personality disorder or traumatic psychosis). In response to this, reactive mechanisms are produced (such as dissociation or cleavage) that are not necessarily pathological and therefore, we should not always intervene by eliminating them because they often function as a protective factor, allowing to preserve functioning and favoring recovery. Conclusions In conclusion, we need a better understanding of mechanisms involved in trauma, executive function and the alarm system beyond anxiety reactions, trying to understand the function of symptom without eliminating it, but evaluating whether there are healthier alternatives can be promoted for the complete recovery of the patient.

      "title": "Non‐physical approaches to counteract age‐related functional deterioration: Applications for rehabilitation and neural mechanisms",
      "abstract": "Abstract Normal and pathological ageing are associated with several motor impairments that reduce quality of life and represent a general challenge for public healthcare systems. Consequently, over the past decades, many scientists and physiotherapists dedicated their research to the development and improvement of safe and costless methods to counteract the progressive decline of motor functions with age. The urgency of finding new and easy to implement methods is even more paramount in case of acute pathologies (e.g. stroke or hip surgery). The frailty of older population makes it difficult or even impossible to use traditional physical therapy at an early stage after the occurrence of a pathology. To that purpose, non‐physical approaches such as cognitive training (e.g. memory, attention training) and mental techniques (e.g. motor imagery) have grown in popularity for the elderly. Such methods, involving individual and/or group exercises, have shown particular effects on increasing or maintaining cognitive functions, as well as physical performances. Improving the motor function (especially in older age) requires an improvement of motor execution, i.e. the pathway from the brain motor areas to the muscle but also higher cognitive control. The present work reviews different non‐physical interventions that can be used as a complementary approach by asymptomatic or frail older adults, and the effects thereof on functional performance. The use of cognitive training or motor imagery protocols is recommended when physical practice is limited or not possible. Finally, insights into the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms are proposed.",

      "abstract": "Dementia refers to a state of cognitive impairment in the presence of impaired language or physical function that cannot be attributed to delirium or any other medical, neurological or psychiatric condition. Dementia manifests in a variety of forms, namely, Alzheimer disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia, frontotemporal lobar dementia, Lewy Body dementia (LBD) or dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), vascular dementia, and dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease (PDD). Commonly observed and often overlapping symptoms of the various forms of dementia include deterioration in memory and adverse changes in mood, behaviour, communication, judgement and reasoning., An estimated 402,000 Canadians aged 65 years and older are living with dementia, with this number expected to increase as the population ages and expands.Treatment options for symptoms of dementia include, but are not limited to, antipsychotics, antidepressants, carer education, psychological interventions, physical exercise, gait cueing, environmental modification, music, simulated presence, occupational therapy, physical therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, deep brain stimulation, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).ECT refers to the use of short pulses (i.e., pulses lasting less than 2 milliseconds) of electricity to produce a generalized seizure in a symptomatic patient. The impetus for using ECT as a potential treatment option for dementia comes from past observations of positive outcomes in patients with severe psychiatric disorders ranging from schizophrenia to major depressive disorder. Concerns remain however, about adverse effects of ECT and the probability of relapse in those who respond to the treatment.This review aims to summarize published evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness and safety of ECT for the treatment of the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia in older patients, along with relevant guidelines.",

      "abstract": "Beim Landau-Kleffner-Syndrom (LKS) handelt es sich um eine Erkrankung, die ausschlieslich im Kindesalter auftritt, allerdings kann ein eindeutiger Krankheitsbeginn nicht genau definiert werden. \r\nDie klassische Definition geht von einer normalen Sprachentwicklung beim Kind aus, das dann plotzlich oder innerhalb von Monaten die rezeptiven und produktiven Sprachfahigkeiten verliert. Diese sprachlichen Storungen sind mit einem auffalligen epilepsietypischen EEG-Befund und moglichen epileptischen Anfallen verbunden. Die intellektuellen Fahigkeiten bleiben meist erhalten. Neuere Untersuchungen haben dem Krankheitsbild des LKS Verhaltensstorungen und psychomotorische Stor\\-ungen hinzugefugt. Der atiologische Hintergrund der Erkrankung ist bis zum heutigen Wissensstand noch nicht eindeutig geklart worden. In aktueller Zeit werden aber vermehrt metabolische Veranderungen im Gehirn als mogliche Ursache fur das LKS diskutiert. Der Verlauf der aphasischen Storungen und der EEG-Veranderungen ist durch Schwankungen gekennzeichnet. Die Prognose hinsichtlich der aphasischen Storungen beim LKS ist komplexer, wahrend die Anfalle und die EEG-Veranderungen mit der Zeit sistieren. Bis heute sind noch keine einheitlichen Therapiekonzepte fur das LKS beschrieben worden.\r\n\r\nDie Aphasie im Kindesalter anderer Atiologien weist bezuglich ihres Charakters Unterschiede zu der Aphasie beim LKS auf. Beide Aphasien sind durch ihr heterogenes Symptombild gekennzeichnet. Obwohl in der Literatur immer wieder Zuordnungen zu Aphasiesyndromen bei Erwachsenen erfolgen, ist eine einheitliche Zuordnung der Aphasien im Kindesalter und auch der Aphasie beim LKS zu ungenau. Daraus ergibt sich eine dringende Forderung, die aphasischen Defizite bei Aphasien im Kindesalter und beim LKS genauer zu untersuchen.",

      "abstract": "Exposure to overwhelming stress often determines how people subsequently organize their perceptions of themselves and of others. Traumatic experiences at different developmental levels have different effects on cognitive, affective and biological self-organization. Acute or chronic exposure to trauma may be expressed as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), dissociative disorders, somatic disturbances and alterations in perception of self and others. These disorders involve (a) the involuntary repetitive re-living of the trauma in thoughts, images, somatic states or behaviors, (b) attempts to avoid dealing with reminders of the past, (c) problems with the modulation of physiological responses to subsequent stress, and (d) a loss of capacity to engage in love and work with pleasure and satisfaction. The display of extremes of emotional distress, or of bizarre or disorganized behaviors, easily obscures the fact that current problems may have their origins in past trauma. The recognition that many psychiatric patients organize much of their lives around repetitive patterns of re-living and warding off traumatic memories, reminders and affective states, may help clinicians understand their symptoms as misguided attempts to regain a sense of control and safety, rather than as bizarre behaviors that need to be merely controlled. Since safe attachments appear to be the primary way in which children learn to regulate internal state changes, the negotiation of interpersonal safety needs to be the first focus of treatment. Since the labeling and categorization of emotional states is one of the principal areas of functioning that is disrupted by developmental trauma, treatment needs to include learning how to use words to understand and interpret feelings in general and stressful events, in particular. Since distrust and lack of social safety are critical parts of developmental trauma, structure and predictability are essential. Identifying specific trauma-based perceptions and expectations and learning how to negotiate the fulfillment of one's emotional needs are critical aspects of effective treatment.",

      "abstract": "Psychological changes or rather the recovery from psycho-somatic diseases at old age can point out a chronic failure of solutions. This means that in the course of their individual life people have not found satisfying solutions for conflicts and identity endangering stress. The result of such a process often means an advancement of diseases in old age. This is the reason why it is very important-especially for aged and/or care-needing people-that concepts are developed in the field of geriatric nursing that provide solutions for life that has been \"misunderstood\". But the old-peoples-care, which is oriented one-sidedly on physical deficiency, prevents the process of reconciling with lived and not lived life. The consequence is that certain forms of diseases in correspondence with changes in behavior leading to aggression, apathy, depression etc. are supposedly (medically) \"cured\" or \"stagnated\" by the use of neuroleptica. The possibility of a self-responsible, positive life-mastering is suppressed. The questions for the causes of psychological changes at old age remain unasked, and they are simply called \"mental and physical stagnation caused by old-age\". In practice, this means that the geriatric system rather supports illness than health and self-determination at old age.",

Fragmentation and repetitive arousals/awakenings characterize the sleep of persons with dementia. Confusion, agitation, and wandering can occur at night (“sun downing”), further contributing to sleep disruption (Box 10–1). Sleep complaints may be due primarily to the underlying dementia or to related sleep-disordered breathing, periodic limb movements of sleep, or secondary depression. Reversal of the sleep-wake rhythms can be seen with patients complaining of nocturnal insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness. Polysomnography may demonstrate decreases in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time and REM density. Sleep efficiency is reduced. Management includes proper sleep hygiene practices (eg, avoiding caffeine, maintaining a regular sleep schedule, and eliminating daytime naps), and treatment of concurrent depression and medical disorders, including pain syndromes, that might contribute to sleep disturbance. Short-term use of hypnotics, such as zolpidem, zaleplon, or eszopiclone, may be tried for insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Nemaline myopathy is a rare disease with an incidence of 1 in every 50,000 live births. It is the most prevalent of the congenital myopathies, a heterogeneous set of neuromuscular disorders present at birth or manifesting at a very early age, which affect the skeletal muscles and give rise to weakness, hypotonia and psychomotor retardation, although cognitive development remains normal.To review the studies conducted to date on the communication difficulties and dysphagia of children with nemaline myopathy and their possible management based on speech therapy.All the children presented dysphagia, with severe feeding problems during the first three years of life that nevertheless are somewhat mitigated as time goes by. In 50% of cases a gastrostomy will be used, although some oral ingestion is maintained in many of them. Nemaline myopathy gives rise to a clearly dysarthric pattern. The weakness of the muscles involved in ventilation and of the face, with a limited ability to close the mouth, leads to hypophonia, nasality and marked unintelligibility. Studies conducted on treatments based on speech therapy suggest that, in the most disabling cases of dysarthria, alternative systems of communication should be used in the first years of life so as to eliminate the frustration caused by the lack of meaningful expression. Later, communicators based on written language can be used. In the remaining cases, the aim must be to improve speech intelligibility.Speech therapy can contribute to improve the quality of life of these children with two types of treatment: management of their dysphagia and improvement of their communication problems through speech or technical aids. These is insufficient scientific evidence of the effectiveness of these treatments.Dificultades de comunicacion y lenguaje en niños con miopatia nemalinica.Introduccion. La miopatia nemalinica es una enfermedad rara con incidencia de 1 de cada 50.000 nacimientos vivos. Es la mas prevalente de las miopatias congenitas, un conjunto heterogeneo de trastornos neuromusculares presentes en el nacimiento o de muy temprana manifestacion, que afectan a la musculatura esqueletica, y que provocan debilidad, hipotonia y retraso psicomotor, pero con desarrollo cognitivo normal. Objetivo. Revisar los estudios sobre los problemas de comunicacion y disfagia de niños con miopatia nemalinica y los posibles abordajes desde la logopedia. Desarrollo. Todos los niños presentan disfagia, con graves problemas para la alimentacion durante los tres primeros años que se mitigan con el tiempo. El 50% usara gastrostomia, aunque muchos de ellos mantengan alguna ingesta oral. La miopatia nemalinica provoca un patron de habla claramente disartrico. La debilidad de la musculatura de la ventilacion y de la cara, con limitacion para cerrar la boca, conlleva hipofonia, nasalidad y acusada ininteligibilidad. Los estudios sobre tratamientos logopedicos sugieren que, ante la disartria mas incapacitante, deberian usar sistemas alternativos de comunicacion, en los primeros años de vida, para eliminar la frustracion de la falta de expresion util, y beneficiarse de comunicadores basados en el lenguaje escrito mas adelante. En el resto, el objetivo debe ser mejorar la inteligibilidad del habla. Conclusiones. La logopedia puede aportar dos tipos de tratamientos para mejorar la calidad de vida de estos niños: el abordaje de la disfagia y la mejora de las dificultades de expresion a traves del habla o de ayudas tecnicas. No hay suficiente evidencia cientifica de la eficacia de estos tratamientos.",

      "title": "Effects of behavioural traits and the endogenous opioid system in neuropathic pain manifestations",
      "abstract": "Introduccion El dolor neuropatico es definido como el dolor que es iniciado o causado por una lesion o disfuncion primaria en el sistema nervioso (Merskey and Bogduk, 1994). El dolor cronico es un trastorno complejo que incluye manifestaciones nociceptivas, emocionales y cognitivas que muestran una alta variabilidad interindividual dependiente de multiples factores, incluyendo los rasgos de personalidad de los pacientes (Asghari and Nicholas, 2006; La Porta et al., 2016). Dentro de las manifestaciones nociceptivas, el dolor neuropatico, se desarrollan signos sensoriales anormales como dolor espontaneo, alodinia e hiperalgesia (Bridges et al., 2001). El dolor neuropatico esta frecuentemente asociado con desordenes afectivos como ansiedad y depresion. Tambien se ha establecido una relacion entre el dolor y deficits cognitivos como el problemas de memoria y aprendizaje (Kodama et al., 2011; Low et al., 2012; Ren et al., 2011). El sistema opioide endogeno esta altamente relacionado con la modulacion de las funciones fisiologicas que son afectadas por el dolor neuropatico, ademas de su mas conocida funcion que es la induccion de analgesia endogena (Le Merrer et al., 2009).\nObjetivos Los objetivos de este trabajo fueron: validar en ratones, diferentes paradigmas conductuales para medir las manifestaciones emocionales y cognitivas del dolor neuropatico inducido por la ligadura parcial del nervio ciatico; evaluar la influencia de rasgos conductuales especificos sobre las manifestaciones nociceptivas, emocionales y cognitivas del dolor neuropatico y explorar la influencia de las preproencefalinas en las manifestaciones nociceptivas, emocionales y cognitivas del dolor neuropatico.\nMetodos y Resultados Primero, modelos clasicos de comportamiento fueron validados para evaluar las manifestaciones emocionales y cognitivas del dolor neuropatico. Despues, evaluamos la influencia de los rasgos especificos de comportamiento, asi como el papel de la preproencefalinas (Penk) en las manifestaciones del dolor neuropatico inducido por ligadura parcial del nervio ciatico en ratones. Se observo que era posible detectar las manifestaciones del dolor neuropatico dependientes del tiempo a traves de paradigmas clasicos utilizados para evaluar comportamientos como la ansiedad, la depresion y la funcion cognitiva. Se identificaron los genes Pdyn y Gadd45 en amigdala como biomarcadores de la influencia de los rasgos de ansiedad y depresion en las manifestaciones del dolor neuropatico. La delecion de Penk produjo un efecto techo en el desarrollo de ansiedad y deficits cognitivos producidos por el dolor neuropatico. Este efecto techo se relaciono con el mantenimiento de la expresion de Pdyn, KOR, Npas4 y Nr3c1 en la amigdala y con la disminucion en la expresion de Nr3c1 en el hipocampo, respectivamente. \nConclusiones En la presente tesis, a traves de paradigmas clasicos de comportamiento, se detecto la influencia de rasgos especificos de comportamiento y el papel de las preproencefalinas en las manifestaciones nociceptivas, emocionales y cognitivas asociadas a dolor neuropatico. Estas manifestaciones fueron sensibles principalmente a la ansiedad y depresion. Finalmente, se identifico la preproencefalina como un componente esencial para el desarrollo de los cambios fisiologicos y comportamentales inducidos por el dolor neuropatico. \nReferencias Asghari, A., Nicholas, M.K.

      "abstract": "The brain reciprocally communicates with the rest of the body via neural, endocrine, immune, and other systems. This is crucial for coordinating the complex behavioral and physiological responses needed to cope with the many challenges of life. The Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) is a key brain structure involved in assessing rewards and threats, as well as activating appropriate responses. This is a dynamic process that depends on evolving needs and challenges. Important challenges include illness or injury. These typically involve inflammation and pain, which evoke neuroinflammatory processes in the brain to drive sickness behaviours. In the short term, sickness behaviours are considered adaptive, as they promote convalescence (e.g. low mood; lethargy, fatigue, social withdrawal), and enhanced threat appraisal (e.g. anxiety) to combat increased risk/vulnerability associated with sickness. Chronic inflammation, however, appears to remodel the system to inappropriately activate threat-coping responses, resulting in depressive and/or anxious phenotypes. These mood disorders are particularly pronounced in diseases and disorders associated with gut dysfunction, which feature chronic inflammation and altered ACC function. We propose that chronic inflammation remodels ACC physiology such that it errantly predicts heightened danger based on a mental model (a.k.a &amp;lsquo;schema&amp;rsquo;) of the world. This evokes chronic activation of threat-coping systems, including endocrine signaling (e.g. adrenaline), and anxiety. Inflammation can be driven by brain systems involving ACC, leading to a feedback-cycle that self-reinforces pathological states. This theory accounts for a wealth of clinical and preclinical data that implicate the ACC in disorders of mood and gastrointestinal function, and reveals a key player in the gut-brain axis that may represent a novel therapeutic target.",

Specifically, major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric condition in which diagnostic criteria require five or more depressive symptoms, one of which must include either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure. Other depressive symptoms include significant weight loss, sleep changes (i.e., insomnia or hypersomnia), psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, diminished ability to think or concentrate, and recurrent thoughts of death. MDD is also distinguished from normal symptoms of sadness by criteria for symptom severity and duration: symptoms of depression must have been present during the same two-week period, be present all or most of the time, and represent a change from a previous level of functioning.",

      "abstract": "Acquired brain damage in children is not uncommon, head injuries being the most frequent cause. Brain injury may also occur during the very vulnerable periods of rapid growth of the foetal brain from prenatal trauma/strokes, during a difficult birth, or postnatally from strokes, infections (e.g. meningitis and encephalitis), metabolic disturbances (e.g. phenylketonuria), treatment (e.g. central nervous system (CNS) surgery or radiotherapy for leukaemia) or toxins (e.g. alcohol and valproate). This paper concentrates on the assessment of and interventions following acquired brain injury sustained after the first 2 years of life, that is, after a period of relatively normal development when there has been an expectation that a child will follow the usual trajectory in development and learning throughout childhood and adolescence. Acquired brain injury in younger children tends to have global and profound effects, for instance, from CNS radiation (Said et al , 1989) or head injury (Levin et al , 1995). Injury in older children may result in more specific or focal problems depending on the mechanism of injury.",

PCS is controversial insofar as it has been attributed to emotional reactions, physiological responses, symptom exaggeration, secondary gain, attentional disorder, dysfunction of informational processing and mental speed, diffuse axonal injury, cranial nerve injury, emotional reaction to being injured, and so forth. The site of noncerebral trauma has been described by the Abbreviated Injury Scale as head or neck, face, chest, abdomen or pelvic contents, extremities or pelvic girdle, external. Neurobehavioral and adaptive dysfunctions after an accident are diverse and complex. There are characteristic sensorimotor and cognitive symptoms, for example, dizziness, visual and balance symptoms. The spectrum of injuries caused by a concussive event creates adaptive difficulties in coping with the social and physical environments.",

Estas lesiones desencadenan la liberacion de endorfinas o neurotransmisores como la serotonina que producen sensacion de bienestar. La etiologia esta asociada a multiples factores, entre ellos los desordenes geneticos donde la deficiencia mental es caracteristica, como el trastorno de Lesch Nyhan, el sindrome de Cornelia de Lange, el sindrome de Rett, el sindrome de Rubeola Congenita y el sindrome del Cromosoma X Fragil. Asi mismo, en otras condiciones como el espectro autismo, tambien se pone en evidencia este tipo comportamiento. Muchas de las manifestaciones de autolesividad se producen con los dientes para lacerar mucosas y otras areas, generando lesiones importantes, las cuales el odontologo debe estar en capacidad de diagnosticar y tratar. Diversos protocolos han sido aplicados como tratamientos dependiendo del caso y su complejidad. Estos varian desde el manejo farmacologico, la modificacion de conducta o la restriccion fisica.

El procesamiento musical se inicia a nivel periferico en el sistema auditivo, y a nivel central se divide en diferentes regiones cerebrales que se ocupan del analisis de la organizacion melodica y temporal, ademas del analisis del repertorio. Por lo tanto, es necesaria una gran red neuronal cortico-subcortical ascendente y descendente, entre ambos hemisferios y ademas conexiones hacia el cerebelo, que permiten la creacion de la percepcion musical. Los trastornos de la percepcion musical se pueden clasificar a grandes rasgos, en amusia y alucinaciones musicales. La amusia, en terminos generales, es la perdida especifica de la percepcion musical, que puede ser congenita o adquirida. Un grupo creciente de pacientes con amusia adquirida son la mayoria de los usuarios de implante coclear. Por otro lado, las alucinaciones musicales son descripciones verbales de experiencias sensoriales acusticas de tipo musical que no estan explicadas por un estimulo externo y estan presentes en pacientes con patologia neurologica y psiquiatrica, pero tambien en personas con sordera profunda bilateral. Actualmente, existen disponibles algunos instrumentos para evaluar las alteraciones de la percepcion musical, siendo la bateria de Montreal para la evaluacion de amusia, una de las pruebas musicales mas utilizadas que permite estimar las habilidades perceptuales y de memoria en adultos y recientemente tambien en ninos.

The necessity to act, and the urgency of the act in adolescence has been observed as well in adolescents that have health problems as in adolescents in good health. It is not possible to separate the acts that are symptoms of a pathological organization from the acts that are an expression of a normal psychology, but there is a tendency to conceive as psychopathological that which comes into conflict with, and that which is a transgression to, the laws of the social environment, and the biological laws. It is important for the clinical physician to know the social projections on the adolescent. In certain cases, the act is a play out of the fantasy organization of the adolescent and is a reflection of the personality of the subject: in other cases the symptom-acts are a summary of a past relationship, towards which it expresses an ending or a split; the act in an adolescent is all the more a symptom that it is isolated from a relationship.",
