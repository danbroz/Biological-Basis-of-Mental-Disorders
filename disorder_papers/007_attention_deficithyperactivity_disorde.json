      "title": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: implications for the classroom teacher",
      "abstract": "This article is the culmination of field observations, discussions with classroom teachers and a review of the existing research base for meeting the classroom needs of students with attention deficit hyperactive disordered needs. Specifically the article describes strategies that classroom teachers can utilize to better meet the attention needs of their students with attention deficit hyperactive disordered needs. Every strategy is discussed in terms of how the strategy should be implemented and this discussion is followed by a heading in which current research findings that relate to the strategy are briefly discussed. ********** Students labeled attention deficit hyperactive disordered (ADHD) display many characteristics that make the sustaining of attention problematic (Welton, 1999). Some of these characteristics include but are not limited to: (1) often fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork; (2) often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork; (3) often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly; (4) often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities; and (5) often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort such as schoolwork or homework (Accardo, Blondis, Stein, & Whitman, 2000). However, in order to fully understand these characteristics, it is important to first understand the different parts that make-up the process of attention. For example, the process of attention demands that the learner focus that is pick or select something that needs attention. However, in order for the learner to be able to sustain or pay attention for as long as the required task demands, the learner must be able to resist or avoid things that remove his or her attention from where it needs to be. Depending upon the classroom situation, the learner may also need to shift or to move his or her attention to something else when the task demand requires slight modification. In this article, several strategies will be described that can be used by the teacher to better engage the attention of students with ADHD in his or her classroom. These strategies were created after several periods of observing students with ADHD and after several meeting with three classroom teachers that had students labeled as having ADHD in their classrooms. Strategy #1: To increase the use of positive reinforcement This strategy calls the classroom teacher' s attention to the frequency in which the student with ADHD receives negative comments or even punishments. When observing a student labeled ADHD, it was quite common to witness the teacher berating the student for his or her lack of focused attention, talking out of turn as well as participating in distracting behaviors like the clicking of a pen or the bending of a paper clip. However, once the teachers were shown the frequency in which they had delivered negative comments and we had an opportunity to discuss the replacement of these negative comments with positive verbal reinforcement (such as, You keep improving!; Wow, you have completed half of the page, I know you'll get the rest done by the end of the period!; Sensational effort, keep up the good work!). The teachers were truly amazed at the effort the students demonstrated in response to the positive comments was well as a decrease in the frequency in which negative behaviors occurred. Current Research Findings The use of positive verbal praise goes a long way toward fostering better self-esteem for learners with ADHD (McCluskey & McCluskey, 1999). A student's self-esteem or self-worth is fostered when the teacher creates a classroom environment in which the student with ADHD feels his or her efforts will be recognized. Through such recognition, the student with ADHD can perceive that they have competencies and that they will succeed at school-related tasks. …",

This book explains to professionals and parents how EF develops in kids, what EF difficulties look like, and what creative and effective interventions can meet their needs. Executive functions involve mental processes such as: * Working memory-holding several pieces of information in mind while we try to do something with them-for example, understand and solve a problem or carry out a task. * Response inhibition-inhibiting actions that interfere with our intentions or goals. * Shifting focus-interrupting an ongoing response in order to direct attention to other aspects of a situation that are important for goal attainment. * Cognitive flexibility-generating alternative methods of solving a problem or reaching a goal. * Self-monitoring-checking on one's own cognitions and actions to assure that they are in line with one's intentions. * Goal Orientation-creating and carrying out a multi-step plan for achieving a goal in a timely fashion, keeping the big picture in mind.",

      "title": "Understanding the Role of Alcohol during Rape: The Perfect Storm of Attention, Emotion, &amp; Expectancies",
      "abstract": "Sex offenders and violent offenders in general that were intoxicated at the time of their offense often claim that they were too intoxicated to know 1) what they were doing at the time of the offense and 2) therefore unable to recall the details of the offense situation the next day. What the literature has to say contradicts the claims of sex offenders or violent offenders who claim they were \"out of control\" and that they do not recall what they did in the offense situation. Alcohol use (mild to moderate consumption) appears to result in 1) alcohol myopia; 2) increased attentional focus on the more salient emotions (whether negative or positive); 3) improved creative thinking and improved attention to the activity at hand; 4) decreased frontal lobe activity (e.g., lack of concern about consequences or morals); 5) is impacted by alcohol expectancies; and 6) does not prevent an individual from being able to recall activity that occurred while intoxicated when provided cues.",

      "title": "The psychological assessment of reading",
      "abstract": "Why do we need to assess literacy? Often because we, as professionals (either psychologists or specialist teachers), are called upon to do so. Usually it is because a child is experiencing (or is perceived by parents and/or teachers to be experiencing) some difficulties in learning to read, write or spell. We have to establish: (1) whether there really is a difficulty (not just an imagined problem); (2) the extent of the difficulty, should it exist; (3) the most likely cause, or causes, of the difficulty, and finally, (4) we are usually asked to recommend ways of putting things right. Causes are important, because they affect the recommendations one would make regarding appropriate help or support for the child. Many children with poor literacy skills are referred for assessment (whether privately or within the state system) on suspicion of dyslexia. Some are indeed found to have dyslexia, while others are often found to have been deprived of appropriate teaching (most commonly phonics tuition) or to lack the practice which is essential for basic literacy skills to become fluent. If the cause seems to be lack of appropriate teaching, simply recommending certain educational input may not be a sufficient remedy if the child's teacher does not have the appropriate skills or the child's school does not have the appropriate resources.",

      "title": "Funciones ejecutivas y procesos atencionales de aprendizaje en estudiantes universitarios",
      "abstract": "Las funciones ejecutivas se asocian a todos los aspectos relacionados con la regulacion y la supervision voluntaria de la conducta (Salthouse, Atkinson, y Berish, 2003; Stuss y Knight, 2002), y estan ligadas a los procesos atencionales, especialmente ante la ejecucion de tareas novedosas.\r\nDesde una perspectiva cognitiva, se pueden diferenciar dos tipos basicos de tareas o actividades: por una parte, aquellas que se pueden llevar a cabo de manera automatica; y por otra, las que requieren el control y la supervision de la accion. Este segundo tipo de tareas requeriran la participacion, en mayor o menor medida, de los mecanismos o procesos vinculados a la atencion y a las funciones ejecutivas. Desde la perspectiva del desarrollo podemos observar como los ninos van siendo cada mas capaces de controlar por si mimos sus propias acciones, respuestas y regular su propia conducta (autorregulacion de la conducta) o como pasan de una moral heteronoma a una moral autonoma. Esta capacidad de autorregulacion de la conducta va ligada al desarrollo de procesos cognitivos de orden superior (memoria de trabajo, planificacion, inhibicion de respuestas automaticas...), relacionados todas ellos con un mismo constructo, Funciones ejecutivas. El objetivo de este articulo es analizar como se ha conceptualizado este constructo, centrandonos en uno de las paradojas que ha dominado la literatura en la ultima decada. Desde esta perspectiva se consideran las Funciones ejecutivas como una unidad y al mismo tiempo integrada por una diversidad de funciones independientes. Esbozaremos, de forma mas concreta, las lineas generales del modelo jerarquico propuesto por Miyake y colaboradores. Para estos autores las tres dimensiones que integran las Funciones ejecutivas son: flexibilidad atencional, control inhibitorio y memoria de trabajo. En coherencia con este modelo, analizamos el sustrato neurologico en el que se sustentan. Finalmente, comparamos diferentes teorias del desarrollo de las Funciones ejecutivas con el modelo jerarquico propuesto por Miyake y colaboradores.",

      "title": "Goal Commitments and the content of thoughts and dreams: basic principles",
      "abstract": "A few empirically supported principles can account for much of the thematic content of waking thought, including rumination, and dreams. (1) An individual's commitments to particular goals sensitize the individual to respond to cues associated with those goals. The cues may be external or internal in the person's own mental activity. The responses may take the form of noticing the cues, storing them in memory, having thoughts or dream segments related to them, and/or taking action. Noticing may be conscious or not. Goals may be any desired endpoint of a behavioral sequence, including finding out more about something, i.e., exploring possible goals, such as job possibilities or personal relationships. (2) Such responses are accompanied and perhaps preceded by protoemotional activity or full emotional arousal, the amplitude of which determines the likelihood of response and is related to the value placed on the goal. (3) When the individual is in a situation conducive to making progress toward attaining the goal, the response to goal cues takes the form of actions or operant mental acts that advance the goal pursuit. (4) When circumstances are unfavorable for goal-directed operant behavior, the response remains purely mental, as in mind-wandering and dreaming, but still reflects the content of the goal pursuit or associated content. (5) Respondent responses such as mind-wandering are more likely when the individual is mentally unoccupied with ongoing tasks and less likely the more that is at stake in the ongoing task. The probability of respondent thought is highest during relaxed periods, when the brain's default-mode network dominates, or during sleep. The article briefly summarizes neurocognitive findings that relate to mind-wandering and evidence regarding adverse effects of mind-wandering on task performance as well as evidence suggesting adaptive functions in regard to creative problem-solving, planning, resisting delay discounting, and memory consolidation.",

      "title": "Understanding Developmental Coordination Disorder",
      "abstract": "Almost every adapted physical education teacher, recreation therapist, or general activity leader knows at least one individual (and more likely knows several) who has difficulty learning sport skills, whose movements appear dissimilar from peers, and/or who doesn’t do well when playing games and sports. That same individual may have difficulty with fine motor skills, have very hard to read hand writing, and may look clumsy when performing daily tasks. This individual lacks coordination. It may be that this lack of coordination is the result of a concomitant disability, inadequate opportunities to develop motor skills, or just lack of effort. However, lack of coordination may also be a result of the individual having a developmental coordination disorder.Any individual experiencing coordination problems may feel left out, inadequate, unhappy, frustrated, and embarrassed by his or her ineptness. These feelings can result in said individual’s withdrawal and/or refusal to join in and participate in physical activity. Lack of coordination can also lead to that individual being disruption in an attempt to shift attention from away from his or her lack of competence. This individual may be “labeled” lazy, slow, clumsy, stupid, or troublemaker, but no matter what the label, the individual has a problem. Lack of coordination can have lasting effects in all areas of daily life. For the physical education student with a developmental coordination disorder, frustration can lead to refusal to participate and future negative attitudes about physical activity. Lacking coordination in motor activity can also, in later life, lead to complete aversion to leading an active lifestyle. But, while general assumptions regarding who has a developmental coordination disorder, who is uncoordinated due to a disability, and who is just having transitory difficulty mastering a skill, can be made, it is important for physical education, recreation, and sport professionals to be able to distinguish the specifics of developmental coordination disorder in order to provide appropriate and timely intervention. This article explores determination of developmental coordination disorder, causes of chronic coordination problems, how a lack of coordination relates to other disabilities, and how lack of remediation can have a negative lasting effect on an active lifestyle. Most important, this article will include techniques for activity professionals to use to assist a student with developmental coordination disorder in mastering physical activity and sport skills. These techniques are equally appropriate for implementation in one-on-one situations and large classes, as well as with sports teams.Subscribe to Palaestra",

      "abstract": "When speakers produce \"I don't knows\" in ordinary conversation, they claim insufficient knowledge about the matters at hand. Analysis of diverse conversational environments reveal, however, that speakers'claims nevertheless accomplish a variety of subtle actions. \"I don't knows\" may be strategically and ambiguously deployed across the following achievements: (a) marking uncertainty and concerns about next-positioned opinions, assessments, or troubles; (b) constructing neutral positions, designed to mitigate agreement and disagreement, by disattending and seeking closure on other-initiated topics (e.g., moving toward completing stories or working to avoid troubling issues); and (c) postponing or withholding acceptance of others'invited and requested actions. By examining moments where insufficient knowledge claims are contingently used as a resource, understandings of proactive yet delicately managed interactional conduct are forwarded. Such conduct is shown to be anchored in ordinary conversations but adapted in similar yet distinct ways within institutional interactions such as courtroom cross-examination.",

      "title": "Hyperactivity Level: Development of a Nursing Outcome Label",
      "abstract": "PURPOSE To develop a nursing outcome label for the concept of hyperactivity. METHODS Using concept analysis of an exhaustive review of the nursing and related literatures — including psychology, pediatrics, and general medicine—the NOC Psychological/Cognitive Focus Group constructed a conceptual definition for Hyperactivity Level and delineated the indicators. The group identified pertinent data from the literature and clustered the data into the predetermined categories of conceptual definition and indicators. FINDINGS Results included a conceptual definition for Hyperactivity Level label: the severity of patterns of inattention or impulsivity in children, and a list of 23 indicators that reflect all dimensions of the outcome Hyperactivity Level. ▪ Inattention ▪ Lack of active listening ▪ Difficulty organizing tasks ▪ Inability to stay “on task” ▪ Lack of follow-through or completion of activities ▪ Difficulty with tasks that require sustained mental effort ▪ Careless mistakes ▪ Frequently loses things, excessive distractibility, excessive forgetfulness ▪ Impulsivity, excessive fidgeting, inability to remain seated ▪ Excessive running and/or climbing ▪ Excessive motor behavior ▪ Difficulty playing quietly ▪ Excessive talking ▪ Blurts out answers before the question is completed ▪ Difficulty awaiting turn ▪ Excessive interrupting of others; intrusive, abrasive, loud, interpersonal interactions ▪ Inappropriate aggressive behavior ▪ Difficulty in keeping hands to self CONCLUSIONS While most people do not outgrow ADHD, people can learn to control hyperactivity urges and live satisfying lives. Using combinations of medication, new behavior skills, and emotional support, people with ADHD can develop ways to control their attention and minimize their disruptive behaviors. With the skills of the nurse as well as support from parents, teachers, and other healthcare providers, children with ADHD are better prepared to manage their hyperactivity and channel it into more socially acceptable behaviors. By using selected nursing outcomes and interventions, the child can improve his self-esteem through the development of self-control.",

      "title": "Social skills training",
      "abstract": "Overview The principles of coaching and reinforcement will be discussed along with case examples of the application of reinforcement, coaching skills and graded exposure for social skills and assertiveness deficits. Clinical examples demonstrating the distinction and overlap between social anxiety disorder and poor social skills will be described. Anger and poor impulse control will be examined, as will comorbidity and overlap with other treatments. A lack of social skills may be present from childhood or only become apparent later in life. Social skills deficit may arise in response to a mental health problem such as schizophrenia or may lead to psychiatric problems in their own right. Indeed, many people may have poor social skills, which interferes with their ability to sustain relationships, succeed in the workplace and live fulfilling lives. Failure in these domains can result in psychological distress and mental health problems. Situations and conditions that can result in impaired social skills include: • lack of general social skills • social anxiety disorder (social phobia) • social skills not developed (e.g. owing to being brought up in a different culture and lack of understanding of the social norms in the new culture) • secondary to a developmental disorder (e.g. Asperger syndrome or autism spectrum disorder) • secondary to severe, enduring mental illness and subsequent withdrawal and negative symptoms (e.g. secondary to schizophrenia) • lack of assertiveness • this can lead to a build up of resentment and eventually may result in psychiatric difficulties such as depression • lack of impulse control • can be comorbid with other psychiatric disorders (e.g. alcohol or drug misuse, personality disorder) • can be a standalone condition and part of a generally impulsive personality. Michel Hersen was one of the most powerful figures in the development of social skills and assertiveness training in the 1970s and 1980s. Although much of this work is now forgotten, many of the skills developed from this time are used in a variety of clinical and non-clinical settings (Miller, 2012; Thase, 2012). Social skills training techniques are part of packages used to treat patients with psychotic illnesses and depression (Bellack, 2004). They are also now widely used in the fields of autism and Asperger syndrome (Patrick, 2008; Weiss et al , 2013; Chang et al , 2014).",

      "title": "Apego e impulsividad. Su relación con el desempeño académico",
      "abstract": "A high level of impulsiveness may severely affect academic performance, interpersonal relationships or simply daily tasks. Adequate regulation of impulsiveness is closely related to the style of attachment. People with a secure attachment are able to self-regulate more appropriately their feelings. Impulsive people’s performance may be impaired by information gathering and organization problems, by difficulties in recovering information already stored, by inadequate regulation of attention, focus and concentration to solve tasks or taking exams. Therefore, impulsive people may face some difficulties when studying like: storing information in a superficial way, switching from one subject to another before being able to delve and consolidate the subject, and having problems to find the most relevant aspects of a piece of information when summarizing due to the feeling of urgency to finish a task quickly that the person may experience, thus affecting the selection of adequate strategies to evaluate new information or to analyze new problems to solve them. Sometimes, performance is not directly affected but, impulsive behaviour reduces learning capacity.This project was completed with the participation of 229 students from 1° and 2° year of the careers of Psychology and Educational Psychology of USAL. The operational processes of two instruments were analyzed. The Experiences in close relationships-Revised-ECR-R (Fraley,Waller &Brennan, 200) was applied in order to recognize the styles of attachment and, the State Impulsivity Scale- EIE (Irribaren M, Jimenez, Garcia, Garcia Rubio, 2011) was applied to study the state impulsivity. High levels of each factor were found in 15% of the students in the Reward factor. In the Automatism factor, there was a high level of 15.2% and, in the Attentional factor, 20% of the students have a high level. This last figure is considered to be a remarkable percentage, if it is taken into account the fact that a class is made up of 40 students. It is possible to find 8 students with high levels of impulsiveness facing difficulties in regulating attention, focus and concentration. Although no significant correlations evidencing the direct impact over the obtained amounts were found, there may be a cumulative personal discomfort growing which may produce a feeling of inefficiency when studying or incorporating new information during classes. Although this report shows that performance is not directly affected, we believe that tendency to impulsiveness reduces the capacity for enjoying while learning. Although it is an intentional sample, we consider that the data provided in this report allows a better understanding of the problem. Furthermore, we consider that this data should be taken into account when organizing workshops about learning strategies to regulate and focus attention.",

      "abstract": "I. Problems The learned helplessness phenomenon is claimed by Seligman to produce deficits in motivation, cognition, and affect which results m various performance deficits m subjects exposed to situations designed to produce learned helplessness Three components of the orignial theory may be described as follows: (1) Motivational-the incentive to initiate voluntary responses in a traumatic situation wanes as the expectation that responding will produced when relief is diminished : (2) Cognitive a disturbance in the form of proactive interference occurs in which the subject is unable to perceive that the parameters of the learning environment have shifted from those of uncontrollability to controllability(e.g, from a noncontingent to a contingent setting) : and (3) Emotional-a heightened state of fear or emotionality occurs which dissipates with control, or wanes into apathy / depression if the subject is repeatedly exposed to uncontrollable events (Maier, Seligman & Solomon, 1969: Seligman, Maier & Solomon, 1971) Learned helplessnes is related to the literature of achievement motivational attribution theory most directly, in that the phenomenon has been studied m achievement-oriented, academic settings with tasks that are achievement based For example, Diener and Dweck(1978) studied children`s performance and cognitions while worked on tasks they previously had failed. They found that, in addition to using relatively less effective problem-solving strategies, helpless children focused their attention more on their concerns about their performance and less on problem-solving strategies that did mastery children A sutdy by Miller(l986) suggested that children who believe that effort will not produce positive result actually reduce their effort, in part, to avoided providing unambiguous evidence that they lack ability(i e., Failure despite high effort). Diener and Dweck`s(1978) research also suggested that helpless children are preoccupied with performance and that then concerns about their ability to solve tasks interfere with their ability to use effective strategies to solve problems or master material The purpose of this study was to investigate learned helplessness on the academic achievement of high school students II. Methods To research this study, 864 high school student(M = 399, F = 465) were sampled from the City of Seoul in Korea, using Shin`s Learned Helplessness Scale(l990) The data were analyzed by some appropriate statistical analysis method(i e, pearson`s y, cronbach α, Duncan t-test, Turkey`s studentized Range Test by employing the SAS package III Results The main results and findings of this study can be summarized as follows 1) There was a negative correlation between the LH scale and Achievement Score of high school students(n = 864, y = -26, P < 001) 2) According to LH groups and achievement score, there were a significant difference high LH group and middle LH group, high LH group and law LH group (Duncan t-test, p< 05) 3) This LH scale showed a significant difference between liberal schools and vocational schools(F = 6 11, P < 001) 4) It was found out that the LH scale showed a significant difference male students and female students(F = 4 90, P < 01) 5) It is possible to explain the academic achievements with LH scale(ETA Square = 5 63)",

      "title": "Controlling the Wandering Mind",
      "abstract": "Abstract Older adults typically report less mind wandering compared to young adults, both in responses to thought probes that interrupt laboratory tasks and in experience sampling studies during everyday activities. Possible explanations for older adults’ reduced mind wandering include factors related to affect as well as task interest and engagement. Older adults also show differences in the content of off-task thoughts. Whereas younger people typically report thoughts about internal sensations (often hunger or fatigue) or daydreams, older people report evaluative thoughts about their task performance. Older adults’ greater tendency to monitor their task performance suggests that they are more motivated or concerned about performing well. Regular spontaneous performance monitoring may improve metacognitive accuracy; age-related increases in evaluative thoughts may contribute to findings that older adults’ monitoring abilities are largely spared with aging. Older adults’ tendency to reflect on their task performance may improve their strategic approach to cognitive tasks.",

This can happen when they are both involved in some project (such as an institutionally‐managed game, a physical journey, an educational activity and so on). The support worker might use their deontic authority (to propose, decide or announce future actions) to do things that advance the over‐arching project, in spite of proposals for what are cast as diversions from the person with impairments. They might also use their epistemic authority (their greater knowledge or cognitive capacity) to trump their clients’ choices and preferences in subordinate projects. Not orienting to suggested courses of actions is generally interactionally dispreferred and troublesome, but, although the providers do sometimes orient to their actions as balking their clients’ wishes, they usually do not, and encounter little resistance. We discuss how people with disabilities may resist or palliate such loss of control, and the dilemmas that support staff face in carrying out their duties.",

      "abstract": "1. Students must understand content to facilitate transference across contexts. 2. The teacher must recognize that more than one skill is required to solve most problems. In processing even simple mathematical problems, a minimum of 3 skills is required – the relevant data must be ‘recorded’ (either in memory or on paper), a rule must be retrieved or constructed, and the rule must be applied to the data. (We will refer to this as the 3-skill-rule.) 3. In general, the more information and/or skills that are required to solve a problem, the more likely that capacity will be exhausted and performance will deteriorate. 4. New skills place unusual demands on capacity, therefore the teacher should minimize other demands on capacity until that skill is mastered (recall the 3-skill rule). 5. Capacity varies across individuals and groups of individuals (for example, with respect to age and with respect to levels of anxiety). 6. Skills are used in a fixed order in attempting to solve a problem. Capacity is more likely to be exhausted with skills implemented later in the sequence. Thus, skills may appear to be error prone in some sequences but effective in others where the same skill was used earlier in the sequence. This makes it important to teach new skills using minimal data sets (recall the 3-skill-rule). 7. Skill enhancement reduces the load on capacity. This can be achieved by practicing the skill, using more efficient skills, and using shortcuts.” (Mantyka and Ricketts, 2010, pp. 1-2) The combination of these factors leads us to present new content to learners in the following order:",

Whenever we are not able to rely on overlearned routines, we must concentrate on and continuously monitor our actions. This is not restricted to practical actions but holds equally well for every kind of social interaction and every kind of intellectual activity. In this sense, attentional functions can be considered as fundamental processes. When we are inattentive, 'unconcentrated', a number of things that go on around us escape our notice. We get distracted and digress, we do not remember details afterwards. Practical actions get difficult, and we make mistakes.

      "abstract": "CHAPTER II of this issue of the REVIEW gives the characteristics of children as one of the main influences on the curriculum. The present chapter develops further one area of children's characteristics and draws from them some implications for school programs. It emphasizes the intellectual activities of preschool and school children, not as isolated behavior but as functioning intelligence and a part of total behavior in different situations involving thinking. Research studies on children's thinking as such are relatively meager. Mental tests are concerned with products rather than the process. Most psychological studies of perception, concept formation, and creative thinking have used college students or adults as subjects. There are at least three reasons for this neglect of direct study of children's thinking: (a) The term thinking as frequently used is an omnibus term. We say a child may be thinking as he cries for his cereal, urges his peers to build with blocks, or writes a paragraph for a school report. Because the term is diffuse, it has been difficult to study in an organized way. (b) Thinking, like other psychological processes, can be studied only indirectly by observing behavior, recording language, or keeping laboratory records (33). A child's language and thinking are closely related but not identical (36). All we can know about thinking must be a product of inductive inference. (c) No well-rounded theory of children's thinking has been presented as a guide to experimental work. The many accounts of thinking in books on logic, including Dewey's famous statement (19), are idealized pictures rather than factual accounts of what happens in children's everyday thinking. The logician states errors in thinking, for example, but gives us no data on their frequency. Recent psychological accounts of thinking, such as those of Humphrey (36), Johnson (39, 40), Leeper (45), Symonds (63), and Vinacke (71), give small place to genetic aspects of thinking.",

      "abstract": "Attention refers to the way in which a person allocates his or her mental processing capacity to the task or tasks at hand. The capacity to do mental processing is not unlimited, so effective allocation of attention is pivotal to successful learning and performance. This is especially true in the sports domain, where poor performance is often attributed to errors of attention. A missed free throw in basketball can be caused by distractions from crowd noise; a defensive player in football can be deceived by an opponent to attend to the wrong cues; or the concentration of a tennis player can waver on an easy smash. These are common occurrences in sport that illustrate the connection between control of attention and successful performance. For different types of sports, and tasks within sports, optimal performance depends on the athlete's ability to either focus attention (so as to apply the maximum mental processing resources to a single element of a task) or divide attention (so as to distribute processing resources concurrently between two or more tasks or elements of a task).",

This requires coordination with teachers, administrators, school nursing/medical providers, parents, and often classmates. The steps include mental rest, light cognitive activity (e.g., reading familiar material), moderate cognitive activity (e.g., new material in the student’s strongest subject), back to school with accommodations and extra rest, back to school without accommodations, catch up on missed work, then resume extracurricular activities. For complex concussions, reduce barriers to optimal cognitive performance, such as sleep disorders, headache, depression, and anxiety. There is no point in trying to return to school when any of these are substantially impairing. Reduced cognitive activity is associated with faster resolution of concussion-related symptoms, but complete cognitive rest is not necessary. Patients do not have to be completely symptom-free to return to school and to light exercise. Consider using a quantitative measure such as the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF).",

These response patterns typically fall under three different but interrelated components: cognitive responses (e.g., “People will laugh at me if I raise my hand”), physiological responses (e.g., increased heart rate or sweating), and behavioral responses (e.g., avoidance of social situations). An important challenge for researchers lies in distinguishing aspects of transitory fears, worries, and anxieties that differ for females and males from fears, worries, and anxieties that persist and impair functioning over different developmental periods.",

      "title": "Dependence Of Motivating Motives On The Quality And Standard Of Life",
      "abstract": "Both household and work activities of a person or group of people have certain goals and objectives. To achieve the desired result, it is necessary to clearly understand the own goals. If you want to partially or completely delegate tasks to another person, it is important to convey to him - what you need to get at the end. In addition, the person should understand what is expected of him and why he does it, and what will be the benefit. It is determined by the fact that resources are always limited, and the priority will belong to those tasks that meet the own interests. All this leads to the fact that a person must be motivated by something to realize certain actions (in particular labor activities). Motivation should be understood as the incentive for activities aimed at achieving certain goals (own or organizational). Motivation factors (motives) are determined by needs. Needs reflect the physiological or psychological lack of something, they are dynamic. In addition to needs, the reasons for certain actions are views, beliefs, culture, values. All these reasons are also mobile and can change throughout the life. Motives can be influenced by the stimulation. Stimulation and motivation are not identical concepts. Stimulation is understood as an external impulse that leads to the performance of certain actions. Stimulation will be effective if it leads to motivation. The aim of the study is to identify specific motivation features, analyze the relationship between motives and standards of life.",

      "abstract": "The term “EI (emotional intelligence)” was first used in 1990 by Salovey and Mayer. EI involves: (1) the ability to perceive accurately, appraise and express emotion; (2) the ability to access and/or generate feelings when they facilitate thought; (3) the ability to understand emotion and emotional knowledge; and (4) the ability to regulate emotions to promote emotional and intellectual growth. Adequate interpersonal skills are an important component of EI. Social skills include: interpersonal behaviors needed to make and keep friends, such as joining in and giving compliments; peer-related social skills valued by classmates, such as sharing and working cooperatively; teacher-pleasing social skills related to academic success, such as listening and following directions; self-related behaviors, such as following through and dealing with stress; communication skills, such as attending to the speaker; and assertiveness skills. IE may be as important as or even more important than cognitive intelligence. Many learners, particularly those at risk of school failure, do not possess the social-emotional skills needed to be emotionally intelligent. Social-emotional learning enables learners to effectively understand process, manage and express the social and emotional aspects of their lives.",

It is argued that neither the question about the effectiveness of different learning methods nor that about the type of learner activities should be central issues.

For example, self-regulation is the modulation of behavior through a variety of cognitive processes representing self-observation (e.g., self-monitoring), judgment processes (e.g., comparing against standards), and self-reaction (e.g., rewards and punishment). These processes can be impaired by physiological stress, fatigue, or distracting thought/feelings. Furthermore, setting high goals, goal-striving, and goal abandonment are likely to influence, and be influenced by, stress. Other theories like the job characteristics model and self-determination theory provide implication for how to change the environment to support motivation and decrease stress (e.g., fulfill the needs of autonomy, belonging, and competence). Finally, action-state orientation can describe when people flexibly disengage from irrelevant concerns (preoccupation), effectively initiate required actions (hesitation), and stay focused until tasks are completed (volatility).",

      "abstract": "therapy structure l attentional focus l feedback l task order Abstract ! Introduction: In order to be able to (again) per- form activities of daily living, patients often have to learn or relearn certain motor skills. The ques- tion arises, how these learning processes can be optimized, making therapy more effective and ef- ficient and successful in the long term. Method: Research on motor learning investi- gates learning processes in healthy persons as well as in persons with impairments, such as stroke patients or those with Parkinson's disease. Experiments compared the learning effects of different kinds of instructions, feedback, and task orders, self-controlled practice, as well as practice with a partner. Results: The immediate effects of various prac- tice conditions on learning do not necessarily cor- respond to their long-term effects on learning. Practice conditions (e.g. a random practice order, reduced feedback frequency, or delayed feedback) tend to degrade performance during practice but ultimately enhance learning. Random practice, re- duced or delayed feedback, instructions inducing an external focus of attention, self-controlled practice, and practicing with a partner have been shown to be beneficial for learning. Conclusion: Research findings related to motor learning have important implications for the de- sign of physical therapy practice. Taking into ac- count these findings has the potential to enhance the effectiveness of treatment. Future studies are needed to examine the generalizability of those results to different patient populations.",

      "title": "Clarification of Ambiguous Problems: Effects on Problem Solving Ability and Attitude Towards Mathematics",
      "abstract": "Problem solving is now being encouraged to be used as the main activity in all mathematics classes. Students should be encouraged and exposed to work on problems that may take hours, days, and even weeks to solve to develop effective problem-solving ability (Mikusa, 1998). However, it has been observed that students lack the necessary skills to engage in real-life problem solving outside the school setting. This is because students are only trained to work on routine problems that have well-defined goals where all the needed information are given to be able to solve the problem. That is why it is vital to explore other types of problems that can be given as class activities to develop effective problem-solving skills and positive attitude towards mathematics. The Merriam-Webster online dictionary defines “ambiguous” as “doubtful or uncertain especially from obscurity or indistinctness”, “inexplicable”, and “capable of being understood in two or more possible senses or ways.” There are times that problems encountered are fragmented, contradictory, or elicit multiple meanings, which cannot be easily structured and understood. How a person reacts or deals with ambiguous situation or stimulus shows the degree of tolerance or intolerance he or she has. It can also have a profound impact on his/her educational experiences (Owen and Sweeney, 2002). Recognizing the potential positive effects of developing ambiguity tolerance to problem solving, this research utilized activities involving lateral thinking problems, riddles, and analysis of impossible figures, which encouraged students to think outside the box. As stated by Baroody (1995), solving a problem often depends on looking at the problem in a new way. In this study, it is hypothesized that ambiguous problems will help improve the problem solving ability and attitude of students towards mathematics. Furthermore, given an ambiguous problem, students will be able to practice analysis of conditions in a problem and clarify rules and goals to come up with an array of sensible answers. Problem clarification can be one of the important skills that a student needs to develop in order to become a proficient problem solver. This hypothesized importance of problem clarification agrees with the observation of Roberts (1995) that the crucial part in problem solving is how to get started with a solution.",

Given these properties of thought flow, spontaneous thoughts are highly adaptive as (1) reminders of the individual’s larger agenda of goals while occupied with pursuing any one of them, (2) promotion of planning for future goal pursuits, (3) deeper understanding of past goal-related experiences, and (4) development of creative solutions to problems in goal pursuit. The same mechanisms may occasion repetitive but unproductive thoughts about the pursuit, the consequences of the failure, or the self, and strong negative emotions steering the train of thought may lead to narrowing of its focus, thus producing rumination.",

      "title": "Designing Collaborative Learning into the Curriculum",
      "abstract": "The most common misconception held by students about collaboration is that it is “getting along” with others or essentially people skills. This focus on “getting along” as opposed to learning or exploring new ideas, leads to certain types of classroom interaction styles and behaviors that work against true collaborative learning. Our research shows that the most important of these interaction and behavioral outcomes in space science classrooms are: 1) Failure to use conflict and disagreement to enhance understanding. Discussion that enhances learning requires the expression of multiple perspectives and trust in fellow class members. This is conflict in the more robust sense of the word. 2) Tendency to focus on task only. There is a constant tension in any collaboration between task-orientation and relational-orientation (personal exchanges that build trust and confidence – knowledge of students as individuals rather than anonymity). Good collaborative learning requires a balance of both orientations. 3) Premature appeals to authority. When students focus on getting along rather than on the expression of multiple view points, they consistently avoid conflict by appealing, at the first sign of disagreement, to an outside authority (e.g., a TA) to mediate their discussion by providing them with the “right” answer. Another barrier to collaborative learning is students’ belief that the ability to collaborate is innate, but can be enhanced through experience. Although students can recite the politically correct stance on collaboration (it is necessary, it works well, and I’m good at collaborating), we found that this deeply-held misconception about collaboration is actually very widespread among students. This leads to other behaviors that interfere in collaborative learning: 1) Not hearing instructions about collaboration. Since they believe that you cannot learn to collaborate, they typically ignore any instruction given on how to function effectively in a group. 2) Failure to take responsibility for group outcomes. Armed with the belief that collaboration cannot be taught, students fail to assume any responsibility for the way their group functions as well as the quality of the learning that takes place. Collaboration is also stymied by the student belief that science requires no discussion. This is a direct result of the fact that they have been socialized to believe that science is either right or wrong. When seen this way, it reduces learning in the subject to memorization only. This view also reinforces a desire to avoid making public mistakes. Students also tend to resist the strategies that are typically used to involve them in class and in group discussions and collaboration. When teachers pose questions as a means of developing discussion, students feel",

      "title": "Self-Efficacy and Emotional Competence of Learning Disability Students:A Correlational Analysis",
      "abstract": "Unlike other disabilities, such as paralysis or blindness, a learning disability is a hidden handicapped and it is a neurological disorder that affects the brain's ability to receive, process, store and respond to information. The term learning disability is used to describe the seeming unexplained difficulty a person of at least average intelligence has in acquiring basic academic skills. These skills are essential for success at school and work and for coping with life in general. An important part of the definition of Learning Disability is its exclusions: learning disabilities cannot be attributed primarily to mental retardation, emotional disturbance, cultural difference, or disadvantage. Thus, the concept of Learning Disability focuses on the notion of a discrepancy between a child's academic achievement and his orher apparent capacity to learn. Learning Dis abilities affects individuals differently at various stages of life-early childhood, the elementary schools years, adolescence, and adulthood. In some cases other problems coexist with the learning disabilities. Emotional competence as an efficiency to deal effectively with several dissociable but related processes is a blending of competencies (Coleman 1970). A learned capability' based on emotional intelligence that results in outstanding performance at work. Our emotional intelligence determines our potential for learning the practical skills based on the five elements: self-awareness, motivation, self-regulation, empathy, and adeptness in relationships. Our emotional competence shows how much of that potential we have translated into on-the-job capabilities. (Denial Goleman, 1998). Emotional competence can be defined as the demonstration or practical application of the learned abilities and knowledge-building attitudes related to the cognitive, affective, conative and social aspects of emotional intelligence in active interaction with one's environment. Emotional competence can be a resource through which organisational relationships are created, interpreted and altered but self-efficacy refers to an individual's belief in his or her capacity to execute behaviours necessary to produce specific performance attainments (Bandura, 1977,1986,1997). Self-efficacy reflects confidence in the ability to exert control over one's own motivation, behavior, and social environment. Self-efficacy is the extent or strength of one's belief in one's own ability to complete tasks and reach goals. Self-efficacy affects every area of human endeavor. By determining the beliefs a person holds regarding his or her power to affect situations, it strongly influences both the power a person actually has to face challenges competently andthe choices a person is most likely to make.Jadhav (2010) investigated a study on a study of emotional maturity' and emotional competence of college going students of Belgaum district and reported that there is a significant difference between male and female students, second year students and government and private college students in emotional competence. It was found that there is no difference between 20-21 and 22-23 year students in both variables, male and female and first and second year students in emotional maturity and arts and science students in both emotional maturity andemotional competence, rural and urban students in emotional competence.Pintrich and Groot (1990) observed in one study on Motivational and self-regulated learning components of classroom academic performance and results revealed that, depending on the outcome measure, self-regulation, self-efficacy, and test anxiety emerged as the best predictors of performance. Intrinsic value did not have a direct influence on performance but was strongly related to self-regulation and cognitive strategy use, regardless of prior achievement level. Levine (1999) reported that children who cannot overcome learning difficulties are more likely to under-perform in school and become problem students. …",

      "title": "Learned Helplessness and the Elementary Student: Implications for Counselors.",
      "abstract": "Learned helplessness is a phenomenon that occurs when people are repeatedly exposed to situations over which they do not have control. When adults believe that it is impossible to influence outcomes, many will stop trying. Likewise, many instances exist in which children are unable to control events in their environment. Because this feeling of lack of control may be exaggerated by physical, mental, or emotional reasons, adults and children often fail to recognize opportunities for control when they arise. Whether the lack of control is real or imagined, the results are equally devastating. Once children develop learned helplessness behaviors, they are reluctant to attempt the initial task in which failure was experienced and tend to avoid related activities. In addition to avoidance of activities, other behaviors displayed are listlessness, passivity, depression, lack of motivation, and negative beliefs about oneself and abilities. Another characteristic of children who develop learned helplessness is a difficulty in seeing relationships between responses and outcomes. As a result, many children do not recognize the successes that they have achieved, whereas, on the other hand, they take personal responsibility for all perceived failures. In short, if children start to believe that experienced failures are indicative of their future performance, they will develop learned helplessness and stop attempting to influence outcomes. In this article we explore the topic of learned helplessness in children as well as counselor strategies for helping",

Classes of situations in which executive functions are required include novel tasks and situations that require concentration, planning, problem solving, coordination, change, conscious choices among alternatives, or overriding a strong internal or external pull. Component cognitive abilities that constitute what collectively is known as executive function include the following: inhibition, that is, the ability to ignore distraction and stay focused, and to resist making one response and instead make another; working memory, that is, the ability to hold information in mind and manipulate it; cognitive flexibility, that is, the ability to switch perspectives flexibly, focus of attention, or response mappings. These abilities are crucial to all forms of cognitive performance. The ability to inhibit attention to distractors makes possible selective and sustained attention.",

      "title": "How not to write a client report: discussing common errors a trainee makes",
      "abstract": "The previous chapters described the requirements for presenting case studies and process reports. Numerous examples of actual work were included to give the reader a clearer idea of the level and breadth required of this work in postgraduate academic settings. Once having grasped what is required of you in a case study or process report, there may still be some uncertainty about how best to describe your clinical experience. Indeed, many students perform well in the counselling context with clients and are able to give a balanced account of their clinical practice in supervision sessions, but are let down by the poor quality of their written work. Most often this is due to one or more of the following faults: Failure to fully justify one's actions or interpretation of psychological process. Making claims that are not borne out in the transcript or case study. 'Forcing' one theoretical model on to case material that is quite clearly presented from another theoretical perspective. Making extravagant (and usually unbalanced) claims that do not accurately reflect the complexity of the situation. Resorting to generalisations and gross assertions in order to simplify process and, presumably, impress the reader. Using technical terms (including diagnostic categories) inappropriately, or resorting to psychobabble. Being overly descriptive of psychological process without adequate critical reflection on what is happening in the session. Having no clear rationale or objective for the session, and consequently providing no focus for the person assessing the work. Poor grammar, typographic errors and untidy presentation of written material or inaudible audio tapes for process reports. The remainder of this chapter illustrates, through excerpts from case studies and process reports, some of these and other errors. The excerpts are accompanied by tutor's comments in order to improve your understanding of what tutors are looking for in coursework. In our experience, we have found that it is unusual to come across a student who produces outstanding case studies and process report at the start of their training. Because most tutors have the ability to identify key problems and deficiencies quickly in coursework pertaining to clinical material, you stand a good chance of significantly improving the quality of your work, and enhancing your assessment grade if you learn to remedy these before submitting work for assessment. Much like learning any new and unfamiliar task, it takes practice and a willingness to respond positively to the feedback given by tutors.",

      "title": "Educating Professionals about Executive Functioning: Developing Strategies to Enhance Executive Functioning in our Communities",
      "abstract": "Executive Functioning (EF) refers to mental processes and skills required to organize the brain to act on information to reach a goal. Stated in another way, EF can be viewed as the managing system of the brain that coordinates all the activities our brainpower must accomplish. EF allows us to retain and work with a lot of information in our mind. It also helps us to filter distractions and switch from one topic or project to another. Specific skills of EF include: working memory, initiating and planning tasks and regulating behavior (impulse control, emotional control). Weak EF can occur in children with developmental disabilities (DD) and those without DD. EF dysfunction is viewed on a spectrum. Some children may have mild deficits; others may have more severe issues. Children may also have weakness in some skills and be proficient in others. EF dysfunction is not a diagnosis. It will, however, increase the difficulties of managing day-to-day activities and educational success for children/adolescents with this disorder. There is a dearth of literature on the incidence and prevalence of EF dysfunction. Even without specific statistics, special education and mental health experts are beginning to recognize the negative effect that weak EF has on a person’s academic and social abilities. Communities must become educated with issues associated with weak EF, in order to advocate for students’ needs. Learning strategies to improve students’ EF will enable children/adolescents/ students to reach their full potential as adults. This article will provide educational information and practical approaches for educators and healthcare professionals to assist families in managing EF in their children. Many of the strategies can be used in the schools and in the home to augment EF support. Adults needing EF enhancement may also find these same methods helpful.",

      "title": "Analyzing Common Problems in Chinese-English Consecutive Interpreting and Countermeasures",
      "abstract": "Consecutive interpretation is one of the most important and commonest interpretation areas. Interpreters are often required to have excellent language skills, memory, and the ability to convey the exact meaning of the speaker. However, most interpreters, especially inexperienced ones, inevitably make mistakes in consecutive interpretation which will make communication lack efficiency and professionalism. This article reviews some common problems, their causes and coping strategies in the consecutive interpretation: 1) Listening and analysis problems. Its causes include lack of language skills and poor timing in note-taking. Strategies for dealing with this problem include allocating energy and content prediction; 2) Difficulty decoding notes. It can be caused by the formatting of notes and abbreviations. Strategies such as improving overall comprehension and refining the note-taking system can help; 3) Information loss or redundancy. Its causes include short-term memory problems, cultural differences and so on. Strategies for dealing with this problem include doing English to Chinese conversions and so on; 4) Mishandling of logic. It is caused by note-taking and listening errors and over-stimulation. Strategies like analysing the logic of the source text can help. By analysing these problems, interpreters can identify their specific problems and consciously reduce the number of mistakes. Improving the interpreting skills based on strategies can help them convey the speaker's meaning more accurately when doing consecutive interpretations.",

Your self-talk may be inhibiting or limiting your effectiveness, satisfaction, and professional success. Self-talk is our internal dialogue, much of which occurs below the level of awareness, making it all the more insidious. The human mind seems to focus on the negative, and we tend to berate ourselves in ways we would never tolerate from a boss, spouse, or anyone else. Negative thoughts affect our feelings, and negative feelings affect our thoughts in a vicious cycle that influences our behavior and performance. Negative thoughts are not uncommon, and most people will recognize some of the following: “It’s going to be another one of those days.” “I just know it won’t work.” “I already know I won’t like it.” “I’ve never been any good at that.” “I just can’t seem to get the work done.” “Nothing seems to go right for me.” “I always freeze in front of a group.” “If only I were smarter.” “If only I had more time.”",

      "title": "A Seven Step Problem-Solving Method for School Psychologists.",
      "abstract": "School psychologists must become better acquainted with basic principles of applying and communicating psychological interventions if they are to be accepted in the school setting. Psychological interventions are often ignored or improperly applied by school staff and parents, who perceive them as difficult, of little value, or inappropriate for a particular school setting. Thus it becomes the burden of the psychologist to communicate complex ideas and expected outcomes. School psychologists need to understand how change occurs in complex settings, how to find professional literature that deals with change, and how to incorporate these ideas and techniques into the actual practice of psychology in the school. Delivery of psychological services in schools is suggested as a series of steps: (1) define and clarify the problem; (2) analyze the forces impinging on the problem; (3) discuss alternative strategies; (4) evaluate and choose among alternative strategies; (5) specify consultee and consultant responsibilities; (6) implement the chosen strategy; and (7) evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. Actual problem solving rarely follows discrete steps, and communication (genuineness, listening and encouraging consultee verbalizations, empathy, paraphrasing, continuation, etc.) is essential. Lewin's Field Theory is used as a framework for conceptualizing change in schools, and its tenets are applied to the steps in delivering psychological services. Contains 29 references.

      "abstract": "Attention deficits may persist through childhood and into adolescence or they first may become manifest in adolescence. Their manifestations are often more subtle but Severe enough to exact a significant toll on academic performance. Associated learning disabilities, behavioral problems, and affective dysfunction, especially low self-esteem, are frequent concomitants or complications. On the other hand, some traits (such as creativity) of attention deficits may serve as redemptive features. Evaluation necessitates a systematic gathering, synthesis, and interpretation of a vast amount of information as well as direct testing and observation. Compensatory strengths and other positive attributes should be elicited and mobilized. Management should be individually tailored to the adolescent9s specific needs and resources and implemented in a stepwise fashion. Intervention is usually multimodal, because attention deficits invariably affect several areas of function: academic, behavioral, social, and emotional. Management might include educational interventions, counseling, cognitive behavior therapy, behavior modification, and pharmacotherapy. Management should always include demystification, construction of a functional profile, specific advice-giving, encouragement, advocacy, and long-term follow-up, roles for which the pediatrician is especially qualified. With increased awareness of the plight of adolescents with attention deficits, the pediatrician, working closely with other professionals, has an extraordinary opportunity to minimize the accusations, suffering, and maladaptive, self-destructive behaviors that have been so much a part of the adolescent9s condition in the past. As we become more sensitive to the effects of endogenous dysfunction during adolescence, it will become increasingly possible to redeem the struggling young people in their own eyes and in the eyes of important adults in their lives. Optimal evaluation and treatment is likely to be taxing, time-consuming, and expensive for all involved. However, the price of neglect, false attributions, and failure will be far higher.",

The objectives for participants in such experiences include increasing (1) understanding of principles and theories as applied to concrete situations, including transfer to outside situations, (2) skills in certain interpersonal and decision making methods, (3) skills in observing and diagnosing behavioral phenomena, and (4) awareness of their own values, assumptions, and interpersonal strengths and weaknesses. Although opportunities exist for accomplishing all of the above objectives, participating in an experiential exercise does not guarantee that any learning at all will occur. Participants often become so involved, or have such a good time, that they fail to observe the lessons that could have been leaned. A similar outcome can occur when objectives and guides to leaning are unclear, or insufficient time is allowed for processing what happened during the exercise. The major opportunity for learning occurs through careful reflection and processing of the experiences as related to specific concepts and situations. In other words, all four phases of the leaning loop must be completed, i.e., the (1) experiences must he followed by a debriefing where participants (2) reflect and analyze what they did and felt, with respect to (3) existing concepts and new generalizations, so that they can (4) develop hypotheses to be tested in future experiences. Some ideas on how the facilitator can enhance this learning loop via the debriefing, are presented below.",

      "abstract": "In today’s organizations, where people must manage multiple projects at the same time, having uninterrupted time to focus on one’s work has become a rare luxury. Instead, employees must frequently interrupt their work flow to attend a meeting, answer a colleague or client’s request, or make some progress on another project that needs attention. While existing research has shown an increased interest in studying interruptions, it only provides a partial understanding of their performance implications. Current studies have focused on how interruptions affect the work activities that get interrupted. By contrast, performance effects on the interrupting tasks have not been considered. Yet, it is unclear whether people are able to cognitively disengage from on-going work once it is interrupted to fully focus and perform well on an interrupting task. This paper addresses this gap. As revealed by a series of five experiments, the attention devoted to an interrupting task and the performance on that task depend on the conditions under which people expect to later resume the work that got interrupted and that they had to temporarily put aside. More specifically, people who anticipate resuming interrupted work under high as opposed to low time pressure find it more difficult to cognitively disengage from that work and turn their attention to the interrupting task, such that their performance on the interrupting task suffers. This paper explores the mechanisms explaining these effects as well as how to alleviate them.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. The article carries out a theoretical and methodological analysis of the phenomenon of procrastination. In psychology, procrastination is understood as a constant postponement and non-fulfillment of planned tasks. It is different from a simple correction of plans or laziness. A person is well aware that non-fulfillment of certain cases can have negative consequences (non-fulfillment at all, late execution, excessive extra effort for deadlines, condemnation of relatives, lack of sleep), however. Again and again a person postpones it. That is why procrastination is often accompanied by various negative emotional states: guilt, anxiety, discomfort, a sense of inability to control the situation. Procrastination is usually manifested in activities, the result of which is very important for the individual. Students have all kinds of procrastination, but academic procrastination is the most common. Most often studentsʼs procrastination occurs in situations that involve intellectual stress, require self-organization and activity planning, with deferred remuneration, not sufficiently motivated. The classic of academic procrastination is to prepare for the exam on the last day, to write a term paper the day before the defense, or even to write it at night. Chronic procrastination is characteristic of students who have chosen the wrong specialty and the wrong educational institution, so they study without interest and try to complete educational tasks on the last day. In addition, such students show an inability to organize their activities, forgetfulness, general behavioral rigidity. There are the factors that cause procrastination in the studentʼs environment. They are psychological, socio-psychological, pedagogical and psychophysiological factors. An empirical study has shown that procrastination is common to all students, but manifests in varies degrees. There are some causes of procrastination that the students indicated. They are inability to plan, lack of time, lack of motivation, fatigue, health, too many tasks, uninteresting tasks, lack of willpower, the presence of other important tasks. It should be said that both groups with a low level of procrastination and with a high level of procrastination there are students who have a positive attitude to procrastination. They see the benefit of procrastination, explaining that they have time to have a rest, time to find more effective way to achieve a desired result, thus considering procrastination a natural state of reduced activity. In the group of students with a low level of procrastination the success rate is higher than in the groups of students with medium and high levels of procrastination. In the group of students with a low level of procrastination there is a high overall ability to self-regulate. High self-regulation of laziness is a characteristic of students with low levels of procrastination.",

Problem solving materials must be implemented to allow the student to explore facts as she / he works through specific pre-stored problems. A command vocabulary is provided for this purpose, and the command set enables the student to set the problem chunk to be attempted (complete question, stages or smaller steps) and to ask, successively if he wishes, WHY DO a stage / step ( i.e. if that goal is achieved how does it help in moving towards a solution ?) WHY CHOOSE that goal ( i.e. what problem features lead to that goal rather than do others) .HOW DO stage / step ( a general hint on method ), and WHY THAT method would be followed . A HELP command provides advice, through heuristic, when the student can not proceed (A TELL response is available as a last resort), WHE WRONG enables student to gain further feedback. Other commands are available to provide summaries and reminders of previous and present work, and to manage the presentation of information. The system keeps full records of responses and these are to be analyzed, This method of triggering ideas towards developing and acquisitions skills in the solution of problems seems to be effective and needs to be developed through further works",

      "abstract": "Research provides some observations about learning from events that appear to be rare or quite unusual. All learning has uncertain consequences, but learning from rare events is especially problematic. Learners see many idiosyncrasies and exogenous interference, tendencies that suppress learning on an organizational scale. Rare events also rouse uncertainty and bring on reactions to uncertainty such as wishful thinking, reliance on prior beliefs, biased probabilities, a search for more data, cautious action, and playing to audiences. The most important contingencies affecting these reactions are the content and strength of prior beliefs: people are unlikely to learn if they think they have nothing to learn. Although learning from rare events is statistically unusual, and effective learning from rare events is rare, both individuals and organizations can benefit significantly from active efforts to learn from rare events.",

      "title": "Attention Deficits in Adolescence: Description, Evaluation, and Management",
      "abstract": "Attention deficits may persist through childhood and into adolescence or they first may become manifest in adolescence. Their manifestations are often more subtle but Severe enough to exact a significant toll on academic performance. Associated learning disabilities, behavioral problems, and affective dysfunction, especially low self-esteem, are frequent concomitants or complications. On the other hand, some traits (such as creativity) of attention deficits may serve as redemptive features. Evaluation necessitates a systematic gathering, synthesis, and interpretation of a vast amount of information as well as direct testing and observation. Compensatory strengths and other positive attributes should be elicited and mobilized. Management should be individually tailored to the adolescent's specific needs and resources and implemented in a stepwise fashion. Intervention is usually multimodal, because attention deficits invariably affect several areas of function: academic, behavioral, social, and emotional. Management might include educational interventions, counseling, cognitive behavior therapy, behavior modification, and pharmacotherapy. Management should always include demystification, construction of a functional profile, specific advice-giving, encouragement, advocacy, and long-term follow-up, roles for which the pediatrician is especially qualified. With increased awareness of the plight of adolescents with attention deficits, the pediatrician, working closely with other professionals, has an extraordinary opportunity to minimize the accusations, suffering, and maladaptive, self-destructive behaviors that have been so much a part of the adolescent's condition in the past. As we become more sensitive to the effects of endogenous dysfunction during adolescence, it will become increasingly possible to redeem the struggling young people in their own eyes and in the eyes of important adults in their lives. Optimal evaluation and treatment is likely to be taxing, time-consuming, and expensive for all involved. However, the price of neglect, false attributions, and failure will be far higher.",

      "title": "Prospective memory : from intention to action",
      "abstract": "The goal of this thesis is to provide insight into the psychological processes that subserve remembering and acting on behavioural intentions. People have many plans but often do not carry out these intended activities: they change their minds, or they are physically unable to carry out the planned activity, but often they simply forget. Behavioural intentions may be forgotten due to distractions: we may intend to prepare dinner in a few minutes time but when the doorbell suddenly rings and a neighbour starts discussing the latest gossip, we may forget all about dinner. Alternatively, we may forget an intended activity because we have not specified well enough how, where and when the activity will take place. Planning is an important step between the formation of an intention and acting on it. An intention to buy fuses is more likely to result in action if the intention is accompanied by a specific plan to do it next Thursday when we go shopping. In addition, some intended activities are carried out frequently, perhaps on a habitual basis. For example we may add sugar every time we pour ourselves a cup of coffee. The general observation is that habitual intended activities are almost never forgotten.",

Personality is comprised of the individual's usual modes of behavior, including how he/she perceives and approaches life experiences, reacts to stress, relates to others, and thinks about him or herself in relation to the world. When family members experience personality alterations simply as intensifications of prior personality traits in the patient or as changes for the better. Diseases that affect the frontal lobes will have a pronounced impact on behavior in the arenas of motivation, attention, reactivity to environmental stimuli, appetitive interests, affect, social appropriateness. Apathetic individuals demonstrate a remarkable lack of initiative; they have restricted interests, diminished verbal output, and psychomotor retardation.

      "abstract": "The aim of the research: To describe the intellectual humility of a teacher as strength in the processes of forming and developing knowledge. Intellectual virtues presuppose the objective of deep, factual perception with a possibility to make mistakes. A lot of pedagogues lack the activities important for virtues without dependence on mood or similar supporting means (the total level of virtue). A teacher who distinguishes with intellectual humility, who belongs to the virtues of the first range (the initiation of learning process and its guiding towards the right direction) and has connection with other intellectual virtues, aims for coordinated learning relationship where the sense of equality is present, as well as broaden perspective, distinguishes with flexibility while re-considering convictions, fear which is felt by an intellectually humble person when he/she misses information or something is not understood. An intellectually humble teacher, developing his/her knowledge, distinguishes with the constant pursuit for development, ability to self-evaluate strengths and weaknesses, seeing relationship with others as perspective for development The definition of intellectual humility is usually related with the recognition that your convictions and opinions can be wrong. This virtue is concerned with the strengths of a teacher. Being an intellectually humble person opens possibilities to the independence of a learner while forming or developing knowledge and understanding. In this process the potential of colleagues is recognized, strong and weak points are firmly pointed out, intellectual arrogance is avoided. This presupposes more possibilities for the change of learning both to a learner and the one dependant on him/her.",

      "abstract": "People’s activities vary dynamically from moment to moment, and analysis of level of skill complexity in successive activities provides a tool to portray and analyze variation as skills are learned. Systematic examination of these variations is crucial for illuminating the dynamic nature of learning and development – the ways that people construct activities under the influence of multiple factors interacting in complex ways, in context, over time. A study of adults learning to use a computer program illustrates three important patterns in the dynamic variation of adult cognitive microdevelopment: (1) each person’s performance levels vary within a range between upper and lower attractors during dynamic construction of a skill. (2) Performance moves through different pathways from a novice pattern to a transitional pattern characterized by scalloping (repeated building up and collapse of complex performance) to an expert pattern. Social scaffolding plays an important role in moving a learner toward the upper attractor. (3) Each person functions at diverse levels depending on demands of the task, domain, background, scaffolding, and capacity and thus shows asynchrony in level, not simple consistency. Tasks and situations attract specific skill levels that are often below people’s highest capacities. Copyright © 2002 S. Karger AG, Basel People’s activities vary widely in content and complexity, not only across longterm developmental epochs but also from moment to moment.

      "abstract": "A great deal has been written about the nature of borderline personality. We maintain that borderline psychopathology emanates from particular disturbances in mental representations—impairment in the ability to maintain and use benign and integrated internal images of self and others—and that these troubled ways of thinking drive the troubled interpersonal relations, affective instability, and impulsivity associated with borderline. Aspects of borderline self-other representational disturbances are present across a wide theoretical spectrum, and a number of research methodologies already exist to assess the phenomena. We conclude that borderline attributes exist on continua, and summarize important features as: (1) unstable mental images of self and others, often marked by self-loathing and attributions of malevolence to others; (2) interactions with others organized around a fundamental need for care that is felt to be necessary for basic functioning; (3) fear of others based on expectations of being mistreated and disappointed and/or terror of having one's identity subsumed by another person; (4) difficulty considering multiple and/or conflicting perspectives, with a tendency toward concrete, all-or-none, or black-and-white, thinking and distortion of reality; and (5) sadomasochistic interpersonal interactions in which a person alternatively inflicts suffering on others and suffers at the hands of others.",

      "abstract": "Self-regulated learning is the process by which effective learning happens: an iterative cycle of judging what has been learnt, followed by making decisions on what to invest effort in to learn further.When this process works well, learners can accurately assess their progress towards a desired outcome (e.g.mastering a skill, or passing a course), and make decisions about how to invest their limited time and resources to maximise learning.However, not all learners have the skills which underpin self-regulated learning, as learners may have poor judgement about how their learning is progressing.For example, they may believe that they understand the content and are progressing well, but they instead have a shallow understanding and are not meeting their learning goals.Learners' decision-making capabilities also vary in effectiveness.Some learners in tertiary education settings, for example, invest time in learning activities that develop procedural learning, or passive activities such as re-reading information or re-watching videos.These activities give the learner a sense of familiarity with the content without developing the conceptual learning required to master the topic and pass an exam.Furthermore, judgement and decision-making are connected: learners who choose ineffective (e.g., passive) learning strategies gain less information about their learning than those who invest time in more effective activities.Here, we use a mathematical model, consisting of coupled ordinary differential equations, to explore interactions between the processes which underpin self-regulated learning.Our results provide evidence for two distinct self-reinforcing learning regimes: an unproductive regime in which poor judgement and poor decision-making undermine learning (and ultimately wellbeing), and a productive learning regime characterised by good judgement and decision-making.We predict that students with good judgement and poor decision-making (or vice versa) exist in unstable intermediate states.We also model interventions that can shift students from unproductive to productive regimes and discuss their implications for designing effective education.",

      "abstract": "We study a model of task completion with the opportunity to learn about own self-control problems over time. While the agent is initially uncertain about her future self-control, in each period she can choose to learn about it by paying a non-negative learning cost and spending one period. If the agent has time-consistent preferences, she always chooses to learn whenever the learning is beneficial. If the agent has time-inconsistent preferences, however, she may procrastinate such a learning opportunity. Further, if her time preferences exhibit inter-temporal conflicts between future selves (e.g., hyperbolic discounting), the procrastination of learning can occur even when the learning cost is zero. Such procrastination also leads to non-completion of the task. Our results help explain why people pursue implausible dreams and never start any task instead of taking better alternatives. When the agent has multiple initially uncertain attributes (e.g., own future self-control and own ability for the task), the agent's endogenous learning decisions may be misdirected – she chooses to learn what she should not learn from her initial perspective, and she chooses not to learn what she should.",

In addition, at very high levels, some aspects of positive leadership, such as assertiveness, can be harmful. Like high quality leadership, destructive leadership exerts its negative effects by initially changing the way in which followers think about themselves, their jobs and their relationship with their leaders. In turn, negative organizational (e.g., employee theft, absenteeism, turnover, performance) and health consequences for employees (e.g., physical and psychological illness, alcohol consumption) can result. Recent research has also highlighted a trickle-down or “kick the dog” phenomenon, whereby supervisors who are mistreated (whether by their supervisors or during their own childrearing) might subsequently mistreat their own employees or family members",

Smooth Pursuits -the ability to stabilize gaze and follow a moving object with the eyes accurately.2. Saccades -the ability to move eyes accurately from one target to another.Saccades are necessary for tracking skills while reading or copying information.In order to process visual information properly, the eyes must move smoothly and quickly from one object to another.3. Convergence/Divergence -the ability of the eyes to move inward/outward in order to focus on an object and keep it single as it moves near/far.In oculomotor dysfunctions, a person may have difficulty reading.He may lose place while reading or repeat sentences.He may also have difficulty with balance, depth perception, sports, or hand eye coordination.Children suffering from autism spectrum disorder haveproblems with eye contact and also have eye movement disorders.Currently validated procedures to measure oculomotor abilities require verbalization, cognition and comprehension on the part of the subject.This is done in the form of reading out the numerals/alphabets subjectively and or/ follow instructions of the examiner.This becomes difficult for subjects who are unable to communicate and comprehend.An objective, non-verbal software was designed to objectively evaluate the ocular movements.Methods: Commercial Tobii eye tracker was used with a software (developed to objectively measure ocular movements).This was validated against NSUCO, which is a validated procedure.NSUCO, however requires understanding and comprehension.

      "title": "How to Manage a Difficult Conversation",
      "abstract": "Even as the boss, some conversations are just plain hard. Women can find it especially difficult to advocate for themselves or to bring up sensitive issues, whether it's with an employee, supervisor, peer or family member. At the Women's Leadership Institute on Amelia Island FL in December, Melanie Hawks of the University of Utah outlined how to get past the fear and make difficult conversations work for you. Putting off a loaded discussion on a touchy issue is perfectly normal. Avoidance doesn't mean you're a wimp, just cautious. Common reasons are: You don't need to have a conversation about everything that bugs you. Sometimes the risks are too great or the potential rewards too small. Don't bother if there's a better way to handle the problem (restructure the group?), you just need to vent (that's what friends are for) or you're hoping to change the other person (you can't). Don't bother if it's mostly about you, a behavior that pushes your buttons but does no larger harm. But some issues influence your ability to do your job or the team's capacity to pursue its mission. They have too much impact to let them slide. If you see a difficult conversation coming up, you have a choice. You can lie awake obsessing about it, or you can use your daytime hours to plan and rehearse. Being intentional carries more hope of positive results and a good night's sleep. Difficult conversations share four traits. The topic is hard to talk about, perceptions differ, the stakes are high and emotions run strong. It's hard to talk about. When an issue pushes our boundaries, we try to back away. “Lean into your discomfort,” Hawks said. Examine your feelings and motives. What makes the topic uncomfortable? If you're asking for a raise, are you uneasy talking about money or is it about inequity, or maybe a fear of being told you're not worthy? You don't want to jump in the middle of your discomfort, just identify it and lean in. Is there a little piece of the larger issue that you're comfortable with, a bit that you could bring up safely? Script the conversation and rehearse it with a friend. She rehearsed with someone from HR, and got feedback. Perceptions differ. Everyone has a story. In our effort to understand, we may make up a narrative for the other person that doesn't reflect her real story. The more you can understand and acknowledge the other person's story, the greater your hope of reaching a resolution. Accept that there will be some difference in your perspectives. “The goal is not to change the other person but to change behavior,” Hawks said. Separate facts from beliefs. You may never agree on the latter, but it's hard to argue with facts such as published salary data. Stakes are high. Hard as it is to bring up a difficult issue, it's even harder to do it so that everyone feels safe. Strive to preserve self-esteem for all. That means no guilt trips, no victim story and no victory dance when it's over. To avoid guilt and being victimized, think through what result you really want out of the conversation for yourself, for the other person and for the relationship. If your only purpose is to blow off steam, get a dog or a cat. Once you're clear on what you hope to achieve, you're in a position to look for mutual goals. Emotions run strong. Before the conversation begins, you need to master yourself. Wait until the heat of the moment has passed; speaking in anger will only raise the other person's defenses. Vent somewhere else, practice your script and cool off enough to listen as well as speak. Use care in selecting the time and place to talk. Be prepared for pushback and expect the unexpected. You can't change the another's emotions; you can manage only your own. Several good models have emerged for conducting conversations that matter. There are several sound reasons to choose one and apply it consistently. For you as an individual, a model provides a template so you don't have to keep reinventing the wheel. You can put your energy into substance instead of fretting over format. The models give you tools for planning, scripting and follow-up. If you're in a supervisory position or can influence decisions for your unit, see if there's budget to bring in a trainer as staff development. Orienting the whole group with one model will reduce ambiguity and increase consistency in expectations and documentation. Even if group training isn't practical, your consistency in approaching tough issues will be good for morale. In choosing a model, consider how it fits with the organizational culture and budget (formal training can be pricy). What level of structure and formality best suits your group? How well can it adapt to your situation? “I usually cobble several models together,” she acknowledged. She described three solid approaches: These models for crucial, fierce and difficult conversations have four features in common: 1. Describe the problem. The conversation begins with identifying the behavior and its results. Work this out in advance so the conversation does not become personal. Hawks suggested drawing up a sheet with Behavior on one side and Impact on the other. Note that there is no column for traits. Pushy and disrespectful does not belong here; better to write, Interrupts and rolls his eyes when I speak. “We need to break down their behavior into distinct parts. When we put labels on things, we end up disputing the labels,” she said. Keep the focus on the behavior and not the personality. You may find that making the chart is all you need to do. If you cannot identify an impact beyond reminds me of my bossy brother, you may not need a conversation after all. Making the chart allows you to see what changes of behavior you could request. It gives you the tool to say how such a change would make things better. When the conversation begins, describe the behavior and its impact without using labels. Avoid ranting and raving, when your voice gets higher, faster and louder. Calmly say, Your work that was due yesterday has not been completed, and that is keeping other people from meeting their timetables to bring the product out on schedule, notYou dropped the ball. 2. Explain what you want. Talk about what you would like to see in the future, preferably in the form of a positive action. When I am speaking, could you please wait for me to finish before you comment? If you disagree, could you please keep your face neutral and express your view in words after I am finished? Stay away from the past, which makes people feel chided. Keeping a positive focus on the future, you may be able to agree on a course of action that everyone can live with. 3. Listen actively. “You come in all scripted and organized and you run through your script, but there is another person who is feeling nervous and defensive,” Hawks said. “If you just want to have a one-way dump, then realize you're not having a conversation.” Active listening includes accepting the possibility that your viewpoint will be changed by what you hear. Perhaps the problem has a different solution from the one you brought to the table. Perhaps feeling heard will make the other person more willing to change. Perhaps by hearing each other you will arrive at mutual goals and a shared plan to achieve them. 4. Clarify the next steps. When is the conversation over? Before you're finished, make sure you both share the same understanding of what will happen next. Follow up may include putting it in writing. This could be in the form of a thank-you note for the meeting, summarizing the results. Don't copy the letter, memo or email to everyone unless there's a compelling reason to do so. Do keep a copy and place one in your personnel file if appropriate. Supervisors walk a fine line between giving orders and offering sympathetic support. Directive styles include deciding, assigning, monitoring and use of authority. Supportive styles include guiding, teaching, coaching, mentoring and empowering. When women are being directive they're viewed as bitchy, and when they're being supportive they're viewed as weak. Difficult conversations don't require you to choose. It's a false choice; you can be directive without being a jerk and supportive without being a wimp. Here's how: Clarify roles and limits. If you're the boss, own your authority without apology. Being a boss is different from being bossy. Define who is responsible for what. Lay out the limits—the musts or must-nots—and point out areas where the other person has the autonomy to make her own choices. Help, don't enable. State the goal or end product clearly; often the boss defines the goal and individual employees can decide how to achieve it. Provide the guidance and resources they need while leaving the responsibility where it belongs. Share data and reasoning. Jerks say it's my way or the highway. To give directions without being a jerk, explain your reasoning and the objective data that supports it. Why do you want this done in this particular way? As you listen to the other person, allow for the possibility that new data may change your point of view. Show warmth and empathy. Smile, listen and show you care. Use humor when you can. Show that you understand the other person's viewpoint, whether or not you agree with it. Pair empathy with detachment; don't let yourself get pulled into someone else's personal problems. Don't feel guilty about doing your job. Be patient. Take the time to answer questions. Allow people to learn by trial and error. If possible, be willing to flex your timetable a little to help the employee succeed. Promote learning. Emphasize what's going right. Don't punish mistakes or jump in too soon to prevent them. Let your staff learn from their errors and set their own corrective course. Rather than intervening the moment things start to go wrong, set your back-up plan: how far will you let it go and when will you intervene? Difficult conversations focus on how to make things go right. Preserving safety and self-esteem, they work toward possibilities that will meet everyone's needs and help everyone to grow.

Hard working and ambitious, perfectionists are usually successful at any tasks they undertake. Their self-imposed high standards, self-discipline, and control usually ensure a high level of productivity and achievement. These personality features may lessen the likelihood of being exposed to and being overwhelmed by unexpected stressors. However, extreme manifestations of perfectionistic traits can result in indecisiveness or in behaviour patterns that are too rigid or controlling. For example, perfectionism may be displayed as a tendency to prevaricate on making the ‘right’ decision in a way that overshadows the more immediate demands of making a decision.",

      "title": "A test battery for attentional performance",
      "abstract": "All of the actions we carry out that are not based on overlearned routines must be controlled by functions that can be summarized under the concept of 'attention'. Every moment that we experience consciously is determined by the information that the attentional system has filtered and conveyed. As discussed earlier (see Chapter 2), there is no conceivable cognitive or nonautomatic practical action that is not under the control of the attentional system. When we explore our environment, even if only to take a closer look, when we move through space in order to reach a goal or to avoid an obstacle, when we make a coordinated movement or adjust the accuracy of a manipulation, when we follow a conversation or contemplate what we want to say, when we plan a sequence in a series of actions or look for the solution to a problem, the efficiency of our behaviour is determined by the capacity of the attentional system. As said before, attention functions can be considered fundamental processes. When we are inattentive, 'unconcentrated', a number of things that go on around us escape our notice. We get distracted and digress, we do not remember details afterwards. Practical actions get difficult, and we make mistakes. Thus, impairments in attentional functions have farreaching consequences for an individual's participation in almost every area of life: everyday activities, education, work, traffic, and nearly every other conceivable activity (see Chapter 2).",

These criteria contrast play with exploration (focused investigation as a child gets more familiar with a new toy or environment, that may then lead into play), work (which has a definite goal), and games (more organized activities in which there is some goal, typically winning the game).

All learning has uncertain consequences, but learning from rare events is especially problematic. Learners see many idiosyncrasies and exogenous interference, tendencies that suppress learning on an organizational scale. Rare events also rouse uncertainty and bring on reactions to uncertainty such as wishful thinking, reliance on prior beliefs, biased probabilities, a search for more data, cautious action, and playing to audiences. The most important contingencies affecting these reactions are the content and strength of prior beliefs: people are unlikely to learn if they think they have nothing to learn.

Executive functions help us to achieve goals in our daily lives, whether planning a vacation, controlling anger or multi-tasking. They develop dramatically during infancy and childhood, and predict later success in school, health and income. They are also trainable under certain conditions. At the same time, executive functions are highly heritable, meaning that genetic differences between individuals contribute to differences between individuals in executive functions. Moreover, these differences are stable across development: Low executive functioning in childhood predicts low executive functioning decades later. Impairments in executive functions are observed in children from backgrounds of low socioeconomic status and in a variety of clinical disorders, including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, autism and depression.",

      "title": "Taming the Writing Demons: Overcoming Writing Apprehension",
      "abstract": "Many individuals, especially those who lack writing experience, may face anxiety when confronted by a writing task. Writers may experience a variety of thoughts when beginning to write such as: “What should I write about?” or “How do I start this paper?” However, some writers move beyond these basic questions and begin to doubt their writing. They may have thoughts such as, “I am having a writer's block, just like I've had when writing in the past.” “What if my paper is not right and the reviewers dislike my work?” “I am just not a good writer,” or “I don't feel good about my writing because I don't have anything important to say.” This internal battle or writing struggle may go on for days or weeks before a breakthrough in writing occurs or the writer simply gives up. Writing apprehension is an overwhelming sense of anxiety associated with a feeling of dread when facing a writing activity. The feeling of writing apprehension may develop for numerous reasons including evaluation fear, lack of experience and confidence, or poor writing outcomes in the past (Vanhille, Gregory, & Corser, 8). Other causes of writing apprehension may stem from a disinterest in writing or having one's work available for public review (Autman & Kelly, 1). Common factors in all these descriptions include the avoidance of writing. Writing apprehension may be linked to Albert Bandura's theory on self-efficacy. Bandura theorized that individuals assess and judge their own capabilities to accomplish a task (Bandura, 2; 3). When applied to writing, those who believe they possess the abilities to write well will write effectively, and those who believe they lack the abilities to write well will struggle. Bandura also later theorized that an individual's self-efficacy comes from four major areas: mastery experiences, where an individual experiences success; vicarious experiences, where a person witnesses someone else's success; verbal persuasion, where an individual is confident in one's own capabilities; and physiological and affective states, where an individual's mindset and outlook focus on confidence (Bandura, 4; Vanhille et al., 8). In linking Bandura's theory to writing apprehension, writers with a low self-efficacy would question their ability to write, would lack experience, lack mentors in writing, and view writing as a stressor, ultimately generating obstacles in writing success. The ability to effectively express ideas clearly and appropriately is a critical communication skill needed by all nurses. Nursing students, nurse educators, staff nurses, and nurse administrators must write at some point in their careers. Therefore, raising awareness about writing apprehension and offering strategies to overcome this writing problem can be an effective way to advance nursing. Various strategies can be used to help writers overcome their apprehension. The following strategies can serve as a guide for writers and those working with writers helping them to overcome writing apprehension. Begin by reflecting upon previous and current writing experiences. Consider what went wrong in past writing activities. Can you identify a specific problem or issue? By identifying what went wrong in past submissions, you may be able to avoid those same mistakes again thereby making changes in your writing and increasing your success and confidence. Another strategy involves the development of a writing log. This log can be used to record common problems or errors you make. For example, if you struggle with the appropriate use of words such as “which/that,” then write down the problem and include the rule for use in the future. This log will provide you with a guide for your next writing experience. You might also consider journaling about the feelings you have about writing. Journaling thoughts and feelings may also help separate the actual task of writing from the feelings towards writing. A journal may provide insight into those negative feelings and emotions that emerge when writing. As suggested above, Bandura's theories indicate that emotions and mindset can positively or negatively affect writing. By identifying negative thoughts or feelings about writing from the start, you can begin work to transform those thoughts into a more positive approach towards writing. Reframe that negative self-talk from “I am a poor writer” into positive affirmations such as “I can do this.” Rather than thinking or saying, “I can't write well,” shift the thinking to statements such as, “I am learning to write better.” Self-affirmation and a positive mood can assist in creative development. Studies have shown that people expressing positive self-affirmation are more inclined to generate creative ideas rather than avoid them (de Buisonjé, Ritter, de Bruin, ter Horst, & Meeldijk, 5). Envision the final product and your writing success. If writers envision themselves as writers and see their final product, then their visions may likely become a reality. Realize that not everyone will love your writing and so you may need to remove your ego from writing. Remember that harsh or negative reviews are not a reflection of who you are as a person. Do not take these bad reviews personally and don't let them damage your confidence. Use the feedback provided by others to improve your work. If you do receive an unflattering review of your writing, keep in mind that at times even famous writers have struggled with writing and have probably received negative evaluations of their writing. For example, twelve publishers rejected J.K. Rowling's famous Harry Potter series before it finally was accepted and published (Randee, 6). Other strategies for overcoming writing apprehension involve completing prewriting activities to develop ideas. Brainstorming, free writing, concept mapping, or outlining your work can assist you to produce ideas and facilitate your writing. See Mapping Your Way to Successful Writing in Nurse Author & Editor (http://naepub.com/collaboration/2018-28-4-3/) for additional suggestions. Prewriting activities will decrease writing apprehension by creating a more structured plan to guide the writer in developing an assignment or manuscript. Lastly, dismiss myths about writing. One writing myth involves a person's natural affinity or skill with writing. Writing is not innate; it does not come naturally for some people. It is hard work, but like most skills can be developed. To become an expert writer, practice is required. All writers must spend time drafting and editing before final products are polished quality products. Some writing apprehension develops because of past negative experiences with writing activities. There are approaches that faculty and editors can use to decrease this writing apprehension. In academia, strategies such as writing across the curriculum or writing in the discipline, have been used to try to help students develop their writing through structured approaches. Integrated writing practices throughout education may be helpful. Others may approach writing challenges with educational interventions like peer reviews or the use of writing centers and editors. Faculty and editors assist writers by providing writing support and offer information about writing resources and centers that are available. Encourage students and other writers to acquire help for basic writing difficulties. If they struggle with writing basics, provide resources to assist them in overcoming these concerns. For example, books such as The Elements of Style by Strunk and White (7) could assist students with the basic writing structure and mechanics of writing that they may be lacking. Websites such as Grammar Girl's Quick and Dirty Tips (https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/grammar-girl) can provide useful writing resources. Another important consideration is to build writing confidence. When reviewing writing, do not direct all energy on errors and focus solely on mistakes. Make sure to identify some writing strengths and provide positive feedback which will strengthen writing confidence. If writers only see negative feedback, they will begin to dislike writing, lack confidence in writing, and ultimately continue to have writing apprehension. Educators can also offer a variety of writing practice or opportunities for students to develop their writing skills. Ungraded writing exercises with feedback could help identify problems early on and allow students to revise their work. Ultimately this could save faculty time on grading and writing apprehension may decrease for students. Ungraded assignments would allow for a more relaxed environment in which to make mistakes, provide feedback that would not negatively impact grades, and enhance writing abilities so students perform better on the final submission of their work, which in turn boosts their writing confidence. Another key aspect needed to decrease writing apprehension is to read other's writing. Reading early drafts of work by others can provide insight and reinforce the fact that everything starts as a draft. By reading others work, students will be able to assess their progress, and this may help propel them to ensure their writing skills are at the expected level. Through peer review, students may be able to gather new writing ideas and will be able to identify good writing habits. Conversely, students may also be able to identify poor writing habits, which will enable them to identify areas to avoid. Another approach for faculty to use is to be clear about writing expectations. Evaluating writing involves some subjectivity, so try to remove this by providing clear directions and guidelines. Students often fear that they will not perform at the expected level of individual instructors. Providing specific rubrics and instructions will help students know what is expected and may assist in decreasing fear and promote successful writing. Editors can also help by making sure author guidelines are clear. Lastly, discuss writing apprehension and raise awareness of the problem. Talk about it. Mentoring emerging authors also helps guide them through the writing process. As they begin to experience writing success they will gain more confidence and their writing apprehension will decrease. Many novice writers feel writing apprehension, which is fear and anxiety related to writing. Ultimately this creates barriers to producing quality writing. Faculty and editors can play an integral role in decreasing writing apprehension and help writers develop the mindset that will promote success. By adopting the suggested strategies to overcome writing apprehension, writers may start to become more confident in their writing abilities and overcome the anxiety and fear associated with writing.

      "title": "Reading Comprehension and Reading Disability",
      "abstract": "Virtually all reading researchers and theorists, regardless \nof their views of reading development, regard comprehension as the gold standard in de ning prima facie reading \ndif culties. Thus, even if a good comprehender exhibited \nsome de cits in particular skill areas (e.g., phonics or \nmonitoring), we would say that those variations from the \nideal were differences that did not make a difference, or \nperhaps disabilities that did not make a difference. Conversely, if a student was skilled at decoding, oral language \nvocabulary, and monitoring but could not understand the \nmost basic material, we would conclude that he or she \nhad a reading dif culty and, depending on our view of the \nneurology of reading, perhaps even a disability. Less than \nideal comprehension, then, is the key criterion in de ning \ndisability. When it comes to addressing poor comprehension performance, the key question is what is the basis of \nthe performance de cit? What is it about a student’s intellectual makeup, skill repertoire, knowledge, experience, \ndispositions, or instructional history that might account for \nthe prima facie failing in comprehension? Other questions \nreadily follow: (a) Is the nature of disability the same for \nall poor comprehenders or are there different patterns of \ndisability with different etiologies for different classes of \nstudents? (b) Can more than one pattern of sub-skill performance lead to the same comprehension achievement? \n(c) How are comprehension dif culties best ameliorated \nfor students with reading disabilities?",

      "abstract": "Why are some nudges ineffective, or at least less effective than choice architects hope and expect? Focusing primarily on default rules, this essay emphasizes two reasons. The first involves strong antecedent preferences on the part of choosers. The second involves successful “counternudges,” which persuade people to choose in a way that confounds the efforts of choice architects. Nudges might also be ineffective, and less effective than expected, for five other reasons. (1) Some nudges produce confusion on the part of the target audience. (2) Some nudges have only short-term effects. (3) Some nudges produce “reactance” (though this appears to be rare) (4) Some nudges are based on an inaccurate (though initially plausible) understanding on the part of choice architects of what kinds of choice architecture will move people in particular contexts. (5) Some nudges produce compensating behavior, resulting in no net effect. When a nudge turns out to be insufficiently effective, choice architects have three potential responses: (1) Do nothing; (2) nudge better (or different); and (3) fortify the effects of the nudge, perhaps through counter-counternudges, perhaps through incentives, mandates, or bans.",

The combination of Action Science (Argyris) and Action Learning (Revans) provides a powerful methodology to surmount these two obstacles. The processes involved are: critical reflection, re‐framing, and unlearning/relearning. These processes are practised in heterogeneous small groups which meet over several months to resolve real organisational problems.",

      "title": "So difficult to smile: Why unhappy people avoid enjoyable activities.",
      "abstract": "Engaging in an enjoyable activity is often effective in reducing or eliminating a negative mood. However, imagining this activity before deciding whether to perform it can decrease unhappy people's willingness to engage in it. The facial expression that accompanies a negative mood (and the muscles activated by the expression) can conflict with the expression that is elicited by imagining the performance of an enjoyable activity, evoking subjective feelings of difficulty of imagining it. Unhappy people misattribute these feelings of difficulty to the enjoyable activity itself, decreasing their desire to engage in the activity. The effects of metacognitive difficulty are eliminated when (a) unhappy people attribute difficulty to something other than the enjoyable activity and (b) focus their attention on the outcome of the activity rather than the process of engaging in it. Moreover, when an irrelevant factor activates smile-related features while performing the activity, the experience of difficulty is attenuated and its effect on aversion to the activity is not apparent. In contrast, unhappy people also find it easy to imagine an unenjoyable activity and consequently evaluate it more favorably after imagining it. Seven studies demonstrated the role of these metacognitive experiences and their implications for research on affect regulation. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).",

Human nature tends to make action difficult - or make it more likely to be delayed or be done half-heartedly (with subsequent negative impact on results). There are so many unpleasant issues to be faced, such as firing people or dealing with poor or unacceptable behaviour and performance; tackling sensitive issues such as bullying and discrimination; awkward or embarrassing situations like aspects of networking or prospecting. Too often, managers and others find themselves in the 'discomfort zone' with no chance of avoiding involvement and every wish to steer clear of the unpleasantness. This book faces these difficulties head-on and offers a wealth of excellent advice about reducing the discomfort, taking the right action and increasing the result. The key is to recognise the problem of inaction or avoidance, and to put yourself in the discomfort zone on a regular basis.",

Child Health; Child Rearing; Child Welfare; Coping; Elementary Secondary Education; Health Promotion; *Mental Health; Parents as Teachers; Parent School Relationship; *Personal Narratives; *Quality of Life; Self Efficacy; *Self Management; Teacher Welfare; *Well Being This speech focuses on the ways in which many individuals try to teach others about emotional health and well-being without having accomplished the same for themselv'es. The speaker posits that some are better talkers than doers because to really find a sense of health and stability, one must forget about oneself; one must become absent of self rather than focused on self. Further, a sense of well-being and fulfillment will never be found with the intellect by dwelling-on what this personal sense of self thinks it wants, needs, or deserves. There are eight characteristics or attitudes of an emotionally healthy adult: sees what needs to be done and does it; (2) lives life in silent integrity; (3) serves others; (4) is creative and a good problem solver; (5) accepts changes and disruptions; (6) is not influenced by peer pressure; (7) is kind, gracious, courteous, giving and compassionate; and (8) has a sense of humor. Teaching young children and working with their parents is the perfect employment for anyone seeking emotional health because many daily demands are made to forget oneself, so ideas, certainty, and goodness can flow. These demands are what force the practice of this absence of self so fulfillment can follow. Educator attitudes towards the parents of the children they teach create the environment in which parents can learn about children, parenting, and emotional health. The speaker exemplifies this philosophy through discussions of parenting and child behavior.

Les enfants font souvent face a des situations qui les amenent a selectionner une option parmi plusieurs options qui se font concurrence (par ex., terminer ses devoirs avant de jouer ou manger une collation maintenant au lieu de consommer des aliments plus sains lors du repas servi plus tard). Lorsqu’ils prennent de telles decisions, les enfants doivent examiner les options conflictuelles disponibles a la lumiere des attentes et des regles specifiques qu’ils doivent respecter et ils doivent reguler leur impulsion de choisir la gratification immediate au profit d’une option moins immediate et moins automatique. Ce type de controle comportemental et cognitif est lie au concept de fonctions executives. Les fonctions executives referent a des processus de controle cognitif multidimensionnels qui resultent d’un effort volontaire important.

      "title": "ADDRESSING the CONNECTION between CAREER and MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS: The Utilization of Career Assessments",
      "abstract": "Initial Phase of AssessmentDuring the initial meeting with a client, career practitioners inquire about her or his presenting issues through the use of informal (e.g., interview) and formal (e.g., screening questionnaires) assessments. While tending to verbal and nonverbal behaviors, it is important that career practitioners recognize common signs and/or symptoms of mental health concerns displayed by their clients. For example, a client with clinical depression may seem quiet (not shy); express a lack of interest and/or pleasure in engaging in life roles and activities; and share negative views about self, others, and the outside world (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013). Take into consideration the following scenario:James seeks career services to assist him with finding new employment. He recently lost his long time employment and experienced a divorce. During the initial meeting, a career practitioner noticed that James seemed tired, was less verbal, avoided eye contact, and appeared withdrawn at times. When asked about his recent loss of employment, James first became teary and subsequently had an emotional outburst. James mentioned, am completely worthless and nobody wants me to work for them. I don't even know what I want to do anymore. I have no interest in anything. I am such a loser!In this case, it is clear that James is unable to fully engage in the process of seeking new employment at this time (or, in other life roles and activities) without acknowledging his feelings of worthless and hopelessness-two hallmark symptoms of depression (APA, 2013). In light of this need, it is incumbent upon the career practitioner to explore with James the ways in which his feelings relate to his career (and personal) development.In addition to considering mental health concerns when conceptualizing ways to work with clients, it is important for career practitioners to determine the degree to which formal assessments utilized during this phase are well-suited with the client's presenting situation. Although there is no established study examining the relationship between undifferentiated or flat profiles and depression, Campbell and Hansen (1981) suggested that individuals with undifferentiated profiles might experience confusion, hopelessness, apathy, and desperation-symptoms of clinical depression (APA, 2013). According to his theory of vocational choice, Holland (1997) suggested that practitioners use the assessment interpretation process to clarify one's interest when individuals present with lack of differentiation in their interest. For example, James appears to present with a lack of career interest. Although exploring his interest could be helpful, it is important for practitioners to note that he seems to fit the criteria for clinical depression. Therefore, administering the Strong Interest Inventory may not be helpful as his results may indicate a flat profile- that is, the majority of his answers are scored in an indifferent domain- which may lead to an inaccurate reflection on his interest. Implications of the assessment results can be detrimental to a client's career development and trajectory as well as mental state.The aforementioned information suggests that general knowledge of mental health (e.g., signs, symptoms, progression) can be useful for career practitioners. Some mental health conditions are more recognizable than others (e.g., clinical disorders vs. personality disorders). In some cases when there is uncertainty about the client's clinical presentation, career practitioners may consider consulting mental health professionals who could provide additional information to assist them. Addressing clients' mental health and career development needs through interdisciplinary teamwork promotes the holistic approach that is strongly encouraged in the career development literature (Lenz et al., 2010).Relatedly, if the client displays signs or symptoms of mental health concerns, it is important for career practitioners to understand the impacts of one's mental health concerns to one's career development. …",

Las creencias sobre si mismo, sobre sus resultados y realizaciones, influyen notablemente en los sentimientos del que aprende, en las metas, en la perseverancia y en definitiva, en los resultados escolares. Las reacciones emotivas que resultan de enfrentarse a una tarea determinada significan un porcentaje motivacional bastante considerable ante proximas situaciones parecidas. Estas emociones pueden explicarse por una serie de principios, expuestos desde la teoria de la atribucion de Weiner (1974, 1979, 1980, 1985, 1986)",

      "abstract": "The theoretical base for curricular goals and pedagogical techniques in general education focuses on thinking and problem-solving skills, apart from content, that should be promoted in the classroom. However, there are a variety of cognition models used in discussions of teaching students to think. Those most represented are 1) approaches that involve global constructs of thinking (e.g., \"analysis\") in a progression (e.g., from \"knowledge\" to \"synthesis\"); 2) approaches that address strategies for learning or problem solving; 3) approaches that employ a psychological or epistemological model of human development; and 4) approaches that address thinking skills that are regarded as generic, functional in all higher-order thinking. The boundaries are fluid, none is complete, and each raises questions. Summed up, the models carry common principles—students may function adequately without higher order thinking and grades generally should not be equated with quality of thinking. Also, active and social learning are preferred.",

      "title": "La memoire prospective : oublis et processus de recuperation : une etude du role des contraintes cognitives associees a la tache aupres d'adultes jeunes et ages",
      "abstract": "La memoire prospective est la memoire des actions futures (e. G. , se souvenir de prendre un medicament). Une des caracteristiques des taches de memoire prospective est qu'elles sont integrees dans d'autres taches. En effet, le plus souvent, il faut se souvenir de faire quelque chose au moment opportun alors que l'on est occupe par une autre tache. La principale hypothese de ce travail est que la quantite de ressources cognitives necessaires a la realisation de cette tache (la tache contextuelle dans laquelle s'insere la tache de memoire prospective) a une influence sur le souvenir prospectif. En d'autres termes, plus une personne est absorbee par la tache contextuelle plus celle-ci est susceptible d'oublier d'accomplir l'action prealablement planifiee. Dans la premiere partie de ce travail, l'effet de la difficulte de la tache contextuelle (aupres de sujets jeunes uniquement) est examine dans deux experiences. Les resultats montrent que l'augmentation de la demande attentionnelle ou de la charge en memoire de travail, lors de la realisation de la tache contextuelle, provoque une baisse significative des performances de memoire prospective. Dans la deuxieme partie, les effets de l'age sur les performances de memoire prospective sont examines a travers deux autres experiences comparant des groupes de sujets jeunes et ages. Globalement, les sujets ages s'averent aussi performants que les sujets jeunes. Cependant, dans certaines conditions ou la tache de memoire prospective est plus complexe, les performances satisfaisantes des sujets ages sont obtenues au detriment des performances a la tache contextuelle. Ces resultats sont discutes a la lumiere de certains modeles recents visant a expliquer le fonctionnement de la memoire prospective.",

      "abstract": "Imagining the situation: twenty office-workers stay the whole day together but they cannot gossip at work. They work a day, a week, a month, and suddenly, their productivity and work spirit lowers, they begin to fall ill and refuse to work. The reason is obvious—they miss gossiping. People like to discuss other people's lives; moreover, they cannot live without it. Moreover, if a person reveals his or her thoughts and ideas about something personal, he/she feels better, and it stimulates such a person to work better. On the contrary, when people keep too many secrets in memory and do not share them with anyone, they can fall into depression. It is doubtful whether any business owner wants to have depressive workers. In order to analyze the problem, one should consider that gossiping is a necessary type of communication at work, can benefit the working place in many effective ways, form the good atmosphere at work. Encouraging of positive gossiping can also bring efficient results into the working process.",

      "abstract": "A ansiedade matematica (AM) e definida como um tipo de fobia especifica que gera sentimentos de medo, tensao e preocupacao em situacoes onde e exigido um raciocinio numerico ou resolucao de problemas. Um fator de risco consistente para a AM e o baixo desempenho em tarefas aritmeticas. O baixo desempenho pode gerar auto avaliacoes negativas do individuo e, consequentemente reduzir sua autoeficacia. Portanto, as tarefas de matematica seriam associadas ao sentimento de fracasso e isso geraria ansiedade em relacao a disciplina. Assim, como a ansiedade matematica, os mecanismos metacognitivos como a autoeficacia e a autorregulacao tambem sao cruciais para o processo de aprendizagem. Habilidades metacognitivas pobres estao correlacionadas a piores desempenhos academicos. Outro ponto relevante em relacao a ansiedade matematica e seu impacto nas tarefas de memoria de trabalho. Diversos estudos demonstram como individuos com alta ansiedade matematica apresentam piores resultados em tarefas que exigem memoria de trabalho. Deste modo, o presente estudo foi realizado para testar a eficacia de uma intervencao em grupo para reducao da ansiedade matematica e desenvolvimento de estrategias metacognitivas. Tambem foi testada a hipotese de que ha uma melhora no desempenho em tarefas de memoria de trabalho. A amostra contou com 19 adolescentes, entre 12 e 17 anos, com altos niveis de ansiedade matematica. A intervencao foi baseada em tecnicas cognitivo-comportamentais. Os resultados indicam que a amostra foi formada por dois grupos de perfis distintos e, que por isso, a intervencao mostrou resultados na reducao da ansiedade somente para um dos grupos. Porem, nenhum dos grupos apresentou melhora na memoria de trabalho. Em seguida, foi realizado um estudo de caso de um dos participantes da intervencao. Uma adolescente de 16 anos, com inteligencia superior a media e deficits na memoria de trabalho e funcoes executivas. Habilidades como linguagem, habilidades visoespaciais e habilidades numericas basicas preservadas, mas com uma dificuldade persistente na aprendizagem da matematica. Foi investigada a hipotese de que poderia haver algum fator mediador (ansiedade matematica) entre o deficit geral (funcoes executivas) e a aprendizagem da matematica. Apos a intervencao, verificou-se uma melhora estatisticamente significativa na reducao dos niveis de ansiedade e aumento da autoeficacia e da autorregulacao. Contudo, nao foram observadas melhoras na memoria de trabalho.",

The topics for the programme are based on assumptions that children who have low self-esteem may have the following problems: Difficulty discovering their positive attributes Difficulty accepting their limitations Unrealistic expectations of self Maladaptive behaviours that have been developed to hide unattractive parts of self Difficulty deciding on values, beliefs and attitudes Difficulty with creativity Behaviours that are frightened, anxious and ambivalent Difficulty making and reaching goals Difficulty in accepting differences within themselves Irrational beliefs An inability to make use of cognitive or other healing strategies to help them feel better Feelings of disempowerment, helplessness and victimisation Feelings of incompetence Poor social skills (see Chapter 9) Akin et al. (1990) consider that self-esteem is the emotional result of an ever-changing collection of accurate and/or inaccurate assessments one continually makes of oneself. These assessments are based on the way one views oneself (self-image) and thinks about oneself (self-concept) relative to numerous personal characteristics such as physical appearance, personality traits, status in various groups and the like. It is therefore advisable for any self-esteem programme for children to include elements which address both self-image and self-concept.",

      "title": "Factors and experiences of stress among primary school teachers",
      "abstract": "Stress is our life's companion and can have stimulating effects but more often than not causes anguish and emotional exertion in professional life. Employees working in helping professions, among which are teachers, experience special kinds of distress. Teachers are generally known to be enthusiastic and energetic at the beginning of their teaching careers, but can lose pedagogical eros during the years of service. Primary education teachers have to deal with burdening class situations, home work, student assessment, paperwork, need to deal with the demands of their superiors and have to work with the parents of their pupils. All of the previously mentioned factors cause stress, which is often not recognized as hazardous by teachers until they reach the point of burnout.\r\nStress is a response (reaction) of organism to certain factors we call stressors. Stress is mostly referred to as something negative, although it is in fact a necessary and vital life factor, as it encourages an individual to be effective in one’s life. The negative stress or distress occurs when an individual is put up against tasks one feels one cannot cope with. Signs of stress can occur on physical, behavioural or emotional level. The consequences of ineffective dealing with stress are not only important on a level of an individual, but also on a level of organization the individual is a part of, as well as on a level of broader society. It is for this fact that stress makes for such an important research topic.\r\nThe main purpose of the research was to establish the degree of stress experienced by teachers of primary education and to find out which stressors are the commonest, strongest, and most important in teachers. The goal was also to establish the connection between the previously mentioned evaluations of stress and some aspects of teachers' lives (age, length of service, gender, organizational form of school in which a teacher is employed, satisfaction in romantic relationships, class in which a teacher works, the number of children in family and their age, perception of co-workers' and management’s support, the frequency of sport and other recreational activities). In this part, descriptive and quantitative research methods have been used.\r\nThe findings show that teachers generally experience moderate stress. The strongest stressor turned out to be the parent-teacher relationship and the behaviour of parents, while both the commonest and most important stressor proved to be the workload, that is to say, a lot of admin work. Teachers experience stress more at the end of the school year. Stress is strongly experienced by women, the oldest age group and the group of teachers with the longest service.\r\nIn general, teachers who work at subsidiary schools and those in a romantic relationship, specially in an unhappy one, experience greater stress. Greater stress is also experienced by teachers who either teach a combination of three grades or the sixth grade, by those who have four or more children and those who have preschool children. The support of the superiors and co-workers is in a moderate positive correlation with the evaluation of stress. Frequent use of activities that teachers find relaxing helps reduce their stress. Teachers know there are many ways they can prevent stress themselves but also know they can get even more help within the school system, management, co-workers, parents, teachers...\r\nThe data obtained through the questionnaires given to the primary education teachers shows the presence of stress and shows the field of teachers' work where stress is strongly expressed. The data can be the basis for further research for the benefit of teachers' well-being and consequently greater pedagogical efficiency.",

      "title": "TRAINING IN CRITICAL SITUATIONS - SURVEY OF EXISTING TRAINING PROGRAMS, PROBLEMS RELATED TO SUCH TRAINING",
      "abstract": "Initially the concept of critical or emergency situation and related definition problems are discussed. An information processing model serves as a background for the analysis. The various stages of the process are described and, with reference to these, existing training programs are reviewed. The effectiveness of relevant training programs is discussed and the general conclusion is drawn that very little has been done in the way of studying the effectiveness. The problems connected with the training are summarized under the following headings: (1) learning-extinction-generalization; since the training by necessity is of very short duration and limited to very specific situations, rapid extinction and low general application to other emergency situations might be unavoidable consequences, (2) interference; new responses are to replace possibly firmly established ones acquired during several years of driving. This might lead to conflict between the two sets of responses in a sudden emergency. Interference might also occur with normal driving behaviour, (3) negative changes in risk acceptance; the driver might overestimate his own skill after training, (4) driver characteristics; special problems can be foreseen with elderly drivers and with drivers that are already very experienced. The discussion is concluded by an outline of a five-step research program dealing with the above-mentioned problems. /TRRL/",

      "title": "Bungled Actions in Socio-Psychoanalysis: Longitudinal and Transversal Study",
      "abstract": "This study draws on the author’s recollection of socio-psychoanalytic interventions which he had planned to take part in or which he has actually carried out over the last twenty years or so, and identifies two types of causes: first, those on the basis of which the intervention did not take place (intervention not permitted) and, secondly, those that contributed to its interruption (intervention interrupted). While accepting that psycho-sociological interventions may not get off the ground or may not be pursued, we put forward a certain number of explanatory hypotheses for this phenomenon. Here are some of them. For example, our contention is that the perfect, successful, finished intervention does not exist; that a successful (or easy) intervention is not always the one that is the most productive from the standpoint of psycho-sociological knowledge (conversely, a difficult or unsuccessful intervention is often instructive); that hiccups and unforeseen circumstances partake of its definition; that contexts have an effect on the intervention in a way that is often decisive, and that they are likely to modify its course; and, finally, that what is important is not so much what we are capable of dissimulating in our practices as what we hide without realizing it. So, while we know, for instance, that an intervention which the intervening party is not in favor of has little chance of succeeding or of being pursued, who will take the trouble to say so or even to admit it to him or herself? This text aims to contribute, for a change, to defending an incomplete conception of intervention that accords a bit more value to what there is of loss in it.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Emergent‐based practices of leadership development (such as intentional emergence (IE), case‐in‐point, or group relations) rely a great deal on stopping the action in order to publicly notice group behaviors and patterns and connect what is happening authentically to conscious actions and ideas (such as course content, readings, theories, etc.). However, when a facilitator or participant practices stopping the action and calling out these behaviors, there is a danger that they will go beyond productive tension into a level that causes casualties. This article explores the foundational need for compassion and purpose when using the common tools of heat and noticing in intentionally emergent spaces.",

      "title": "Good sport",
      "abstract": "Sport: an athletic activity requiring skill or physical prowess and often of a competitive nature.1 Metaphor: a figure of speech in which a word or phrase is used to refer to something it does not literally denote in order to suggest a resemblance.1 As I take in the summer spectacle of an Ashes cricket mauling for England, I am reminded of the capacity of sport to provide verbal expressions that encapsulate many of the experiences of our patients and their families. In my own clinical field of developmental and behavioural paediatrics, opportunities abound for the use of such figurative links to explain diagnostic and management concepts. For example, behaviours that fall within the normal range for age are ‘par for the course’. Planned ignoring of low level misdemeanours (‘letting some things go through to the “keeper”’) while focusing on the positives (‘you really have kicked some goals today’) is the order of the day in behaviour management. The use of time out (‘a few minutes in the sin bin’) can be considered for higher priority behaviours. When aiming to improve a child's emotional regulation skills, it may sometimes seem like a series of ‘false starts’, but it takes time to ‘get into the swing’. Parents should be supported and encouraged to ensure they do not ‘throw in the towel’ prematurely. It is well to remember this undertaking is ‘a marathon, not a sprint’. ‘Going in to bat’ for our patient describes an act of advocacy. In doing so, it is best to be ‘on the front foot’. For example, the provision of appropriate classroom accommodations for those with specific learning disorders is to ‘level the playing field’. Families appreciate having ‘someone in their corner’ as their child strives to ‘raise the bar’. At times, one can feel ‘snookered’ when unforeseen obstacles arise. Perhaps our initial diagnostic impressions were unfounded (‘off base’). Eligibility criteria may have changed (‘moving the goalposts’). A re-evaluation of the situation should prompt a review of management priorities (‘for a kick off, let's try… .’). Some may feel that such metaphors are trite, hackneyed or likely to alienate members of our target audience. I beg to differ. Used judiciously, sporting metaphors help me explain the unfamiliar and make the abstract tangible, particularly for families for whom sport is a second language. I believe the range of expressions now at my clinical disposal justifies the countless hours of diligent couch-based research involved in their acquisition! So step up to the plate folks. In the words of Roy Slaven and HG Nelson;2 ‘too much sport is barely enough'!",

      "abstract": "If we consider objectively the question of whether in practice meditation should be the proximate or remote preparation for prayer, what are we to say? In deciding, two factors should be taken into consideration: (i) In practice when following formal meditation it is difficult, frequently impossible, to decide such questions as: When should I begin to make acts and for how long? Am I using my imagination enough or too freely? Am I thinking too much or too little? When I cannot think at all what shall I do? This last question is the nodal point of the whole problem. Most of us find it possible to pray when it is quite impossible to think. At morning prayer simple ideas in the form of acts can be elicited by the will, whereas constructive thinking often cannot. We have control of the one, too little control of the other. For this reason formal meditation imposes such a strain on average Catholics (and not least on over-worked religious sisters) that they give it up in despair, either because they cannot think or else because they want to pray; often it is both.",

      "title": "Sleep Deprivation and Error Negativity: A Review and Reappraisal",
      "abstract": "Performance monitoring is an aspect of cognitive control that is crucial to optimal task performance. Error monitoring is a major domain of performance monitoring. In everyday life, people commit action slips that indicate losses of intentional control. Reason (1979) argues that \"central to the notion of error is the failure of 'planned actions' to achieve a desired outcome\" (p. 69). The key factor mediating action slips is the lack of close monitoring of ongoing activity by attentional control, even in a well-learned and familiar situation. In addition, these lapses also occur when exercising any well-learned behavior in daily life, particularly in states of reduced arousal and attention, such as during periods of extended wakefulness or sleep deprivation.

      "title": "Tort liability for sexual harassment",
      "abstract": "Sexual harassment conducts such as patting, pinching, constant brushing or touching an inappropriate area of another person's body, making sexually related comments, jokes and graphic drawing, degrading comments on one’s appearance, displaying sexually suggestive pictures, amongst others, are examples where the honour and dignity of an employee is violated. Such conducts if goes unchecked, would create ‘intimidating, hostile and offensive work environment which can adversely affect the industrial relations climate in the organisation’. In most cases, the victims get annoyed, angry and even embarrassed by the unwanted sexual attention, as it belittles their persons. The aggrieved worker may experience emotional trauma, anxiety, nervousness, depression and feeling of low self-esteem. Further, it may also affect the employee's morale and job performance such as difficulty in concentrating on their job. An employer may avoid liability if they exercised reasonable care to prevent or correct promptly any harassing behaviour. If a co-worker is involved, the employer is generally liable if it knew or should have known of the misconduct, unless it can show that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action. Further, a failure to respond to bona fide complaints of sexual harassment would constitute a breach of the implied trust and confidence term. In the aforesaid breach, the aggrieved employee may walk out of her job and claim constructive dismissal. This paper would explore the possible cause of action in tort against the assailant for general and specific damages for the alleged assault and battery arising from the unwelcomed incidents of sexual harassment.",

      "title": "Bullying in Sport and Performance Psychology",
      "abstract": "Bullying is a growing problem in sport and performance settings. Bullying falls under the umbrella of “athlete maltreatment,” which includes any form of harm and all relationships where harm could occur in sport and performance. Specifically, bullying is defined as repeated hostile and deliberate behavior from one person (the perpetrator) to another (the target) with the intent to harm or threaten harm to the target; it is marked by an imbalance of power. Often, after extreme bullying, the target feels terrorized. Athlete maltreatment in sport and performance has been categorized into one of two forms: relational maltreatment and nonrelational maltreatment. Bullying is a relational problem. In particular, sport and performance bullying can occur from coach to player, parent to player, or player to player, and often takes the form of (1) making unreasonable performance demands of the target, (2) repeated threats to restrict or remove the target’s privileges or opportunities, (3) screaming or yelling directed at the target that is unwarranted, (4) repeated and continual criticism of the target’s abilities, (5) discounting or denying the target’s accomplishments, (6) blaming the target for his or her mistakes, (7) threats of and/or actual physical violence toward the target, and (8) social media or e-mail messages with threats or insults toward the target. Sport and performance organizations should develop and implement antibullying policies. Six potential steps toward policy development and implementation include: (1) defining bullying behaviors, (2) referring to existing “best-practice” bullying policies, (3) specifically outlining the reporting of bullying incidents, (4) outlining clearly investigation and disciplinary actions to be taken, (5) outlining specific assistance for bullying targets, and (6) including prevention and training procedures. In the meantime, coaches as well as parents and players can recognize that they are role models for everyone with whom they come into contact in sport and performance settings. Coaches, parents, and players can also accept responsibility for creating a respectful and safe sport and performance environment, have a pre-season meeting to discuss antibullying policy, foster open and honest communication, accept critical feedback, not engage or allow bullying behavior themselves, create acceptable boundaries between themselves and others, and teach players to trust their instincts when things do not feel right. More advanced bullying prevention and training procedures can then take place.",

      "abstract": "The influence of emergency situations on the psychological state of the victims is shown. Their frequency, typical for the modern world, carries threats to life and personal dangers. The negative thing is that emergency situations occur suddenly and at night, are accompanied by disruption of communications, and in cases of natural disasters, a sharp deterioration in weather conditions occurs. It has been proven that 12-15% of persons in emergency situations retain self-control, the ability to rationally assess the situation, to act clearly and decisively even in the most difficult conditions. The basis for this is the level of psychological protection that is formed in everyday activities. The reaction (passive, active) of people to emergencies is revealed. In some, the sense of danger turns into feelings of doom and inevitability, they become completely helpless, confused, incapable of purposeful actions (for example, to protect). Others – under the influence of a threatening situation, they feel the rise of spiritual and physical strength, they can begin to act more persistently and tirelessly. In some people, the instinct of self-preservation causes a desire to escape, to avoid threatening circumstances, in others it mobilizes and tunes in to active actions. Speaking about assessing the negative impact of certain adverse factors that arise during emergencies, one should distinguish between normal and pathological reactions of people. In the first case, the psychological clarity of the reaction becomes important, its occurrence, as a result of an emergency, and mainly a short duration. The working capacity of a person is preserved (albeit reduced), there is contact with people around him, and a critical assessment of his actions remains. Six stages of behavior of people caught in an emergency situation are identified, the behavior of each stage is characterized. Under the influence of stress factors, there is a risk of pathological changes in the structure of the personality, which are the basis for the development of personal disharmony. To reveal individual and collective methods of protecting people in emergency situations (a person's desire to go beyond the influence of harmful factors (to avoid danger, to protect himself, etc.). Panic was revealed as the most dangerous and negative factor caused by real or perceived danger, which may involve one or more people.",

      "abstract": "The sharp contrast between counselor preparation and professional practice is one of the most perplexing problems in the counseling profession. Most counselor preparation programs attempt to help prospective counselors acquire the skills, the attitude, and the commitment necessary to be helping persons. Too often, however, when the counselor takes a job in a school, he is unable to establish and maintain his helping position. Further, his effectiveness as a helping person may in fact diminish with time on the job. Some possible reasons for this condition include: (a) lack of a systematic approach, (b) regression to attitudes and concerns held prior to entering the profession, (c) conflict between needs of students and institutional demands, and (d) the tendency to set unattainable goals. These conditions contain several implications for the profession and suggest a reexamination of traditional emphases in counselor preparation.",

For example, most appetitive drives (e.g., hunger, sleep) are cyclic, and people act to address them at certain times of the day in certain circumstances. Many other goals, such as getting to work or achieving physical fitness, also involve periodic activities that occur in specific, recurring times and places. This regularity in motivated behavior organizes everyday experience into repeated patterns of goal-directed activities in particular circumstances. With repetition of behavior in stable contexts, actions become automatic in the sense that deliberation about behavior becomes unnecessary. These well-practiced behaviors represent habits, and in this chapter we consider the role of habitual behavior in motivational processes.",

      "abstract": "A 4-decade long research program that had started out focusing on creative genius unexpectedly produced a general response typology potentially applicable to the average person on the street. In particular, attempts to define both creativity and noncreativity resulted in an eightfold typology of everyday human thought and behavior. Given any situation that may evoke a response, the alternative outcomes can be distinguished according to their initial probability, actual utility, and the person's prior knowledge of that utility. These 3 parameters then yield 8 major types of outcomes: (a) routine, reproductive, or habitual responses (based on acquired life and work expertise); (b) fortuitous responses (such as uninformed response biases); (c) irrational perseveration (or failing to learn from past mistakes); (d) problem finding (such as violations of expert expectations); (e) irrational suppression (refusing to do what's good for you); (f) creative or productive thoughts and behaviors (original, useful, and surprising responses); (g) rational suppression (such as those due to previous response extinction); and (h) mind wandering and behavioral exploration (such as fantasy, tinkering, and play). These distinct responses exhibit important interrelationships. For example, although habitual responses are antithetical to creative thought and behavior, creativity is fostered by problem finding, rational suppression, and mind wandering or behavioral exploration. Moreover, because the 3 parameters can assume continuous values between 0 and 1 inclusively, the typology allows for more finely differentiated thoughts and behaviors, including “satisficing” decisions that fall short of utility optimization as well as tentative hunches residing between absolute ignorance and certain knowledge.",

      "abstract": "The Decimus Lunius Luvenalis’ “Mens sana in corpore sano” is finding a second wind with the growing interest in physica activity (PA) effects on health and cognition. PA is known as health factor. Children are recommended to practice at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous PA a day to benefit from PA for health. However, in in Europe, children don’t reach the recommendations. Also, we have to underline that PA and sedentary behaviors are not diametrically opposed: a single person can be physically active and being sedentary (e.g., staying sitting at the desk for more than one hour) and so, being at risk. Fostering PA and struggling sedentary behaviors is a public health priority. More and more papers are interested in the PA- cognition link. PA can foster executive functioning (high level cognitive processes that permit to adapt ourselves to environment constraints) after a single bout of exercise and can foster their development through a regular practice. A little is known about which PA dimensions are to take into account or what is the minimal dose that foster executive functions. However, aerobic exercise and cognitively engaging PA appear to foster PA. As children present less effective executive functioning than children from passed generations and as these functions are linked to success in life, health and future well-being, it is crucial to foster their development in our children. The aim of our study is to design, carry out and conduct a process analysis of an in class PA program that would be able to counteract in class sedentary behavior habits and foster children executive functioning. In order to achieve this aim, we developed and set up a 12 weeks school based program of in class active breaks. 3 classes of French CE2 participate to the study. In this presentation, we will table how we built our program from scientific framework and how we adapted it pedagogically. Then, the process analysis will permit to discuss the program in term of feasibility and interest. As the study is still in process, we are not able to give you results in this abstract.",

      "title": "Career Indecision in Adolescents",
      "abstract": "evolution of fundamental concepts of occupational indecision–or career indecision–is initially summarized: dichotomous, developmental, cognitive, and multifactor concepts. Then, some typical evaluation tools that have enabled more fundamental research work on identity, intercultural differences, and the effects of guidance-related practices are presented. Finally, the evolution of fundamental concepts is mentioned through its possible avatar– uncertainty. Indecision, i.e., the inability of a person to make a choice when encouraged to do so, is an irritating state for the researcher who wishes to explain it, as it is for the expert who wishes to reduce it. Career indecision relates to the incapacity to make decisions about a major or a vocation. Career choices are worked out in two large frames of reference: family and school, the effects of which are pointed out. Various designs have been built, all of which cannot be set out: especially, strictly clinical approaches or those related to career decisions of adults engaged in the professional Indecision is often approached in a dichotomic–almost administrative–way, by the opposition of decided/undecided people. Studies on the frequency of indecision (lack of choice) and contrasts between decided/undecided adolescents turned out to be rather disappointing. Indeed, during adolescence, indecision often doesn't mean lack of career choice, but indicates a period of development of this choice. In the developmental approaches of decisions, some adolescents make choices rather quickly (and, therefore, are said to be decided) and others more slowly (and are said to be undecided). However, either quickly or slowly, some adolescents manage not to decide. Two forms have been distinguished: a developmental, normal indecision, and another form, more problematic and marked by a strong anxiety, chronic indecision. Undecided adolescents are thus not a homogeneous group: some are undecided and others indecisive and they undergo different processes. These processes have been studied within the framework of Cognitive Information Processing, where decision is considered as an application of several mechanisms, the dysfunction of the one being sufficient to create an undecided state. The location of these mechanisms is supposed to allow a reduction of indecision–which is not always true. Factors of indecision are indeed numerous and have been described in multifactorial approaches. A differential diagnosis of indecision is necessary for understanding the state of a person; this diagnosis makes it possible to assess the role of different factors (as lack of information or lack of decision method). These last approaches require precise data and adapted tools have been elaborated; some– among the most typical–are presented. With these tools, more fundamental problems have been examined as the question of identity, intercultural differences, and assessment of guidance practices. The assessment of these practices may be located among a body of research in France, from which one relates to college students: it is for an average indecision at the beginning of college (university) that the later examination grades are highest. The idea of optimum indecision is then taken up in a more general way: depending on situations, an amount of indecision is adaptive and the current evolution of the professional world seems to indicate that indecision–which becomes a perceived uncertainty– could increasingly become more efficient because it leaves the person free to adapt to the modifications of the world.",

Date/delay effect에 따르면, 기간을 시간범위로 표현하는 것(e.g., 6개월)과 달력날짜로 표현하는 것(e.g., 11월 1일) 사이에 시간할인이 다르게 나타나며(LeBoeuf, 2006; Read et. al., 2005), 이는 기간 표현방식에 따라 주관적 시간이 다르게 지각되기 때문이다(Zauberman et. al., 2009). 이를 목표의 기한에 적용하여, 시간범위 표현방식인 ‘5일 안에 수행’ 또는 달력날짜표현방식인 ‘8월 5일까지 수행’으로 설정할 수 있다. 그러나 짧은 기한이 항상 효과적인 것은 아니며, 자기효능감 수준에 따라 다른 기한 설정 방식이 효과적일 수 있다. 자기효능감이 높은 사람은 필요한 시간보다 충분한 시간이 주어졌다고 생각하여 미루기 때문에, 남은 기한이 주관적으로 짧게 지각되는 기한 방식이 미루기를 감소시킨다(가설 1-1). 그러나 자기효능감이 낮은 사람은 기한이 짧게 생각되면 어려움이 크게 지각되어 손실회피가 발생할 수 있다. 따라서 남은 기한이 주관적으로 길게 지각되는 기한 방식이 미루기를 감소시킨다(가설 1-2). 연구방법 피험자 103명을 대상으로, 2(기한설정: Delay vs. Date) x 2(효능감: 고 vs. 저) 집단간 요인설계로 제시된 과제의 시작을 미룰 의도를 측정했다. 연구결과 시간범위로 설정한 기한이 달력날짜로 설정한 기한보다 남은 기간이 주관적으로 짧게 지각되었다. 시간범위로 기한을 설정할 때, 자기효능감이 낮은 사람보다 높은 사람의 미루기 의도가 감소했다. 반면 달력날짜로 기한을 설정할 때, 자기효능감이 높은 사람보다 낮은 사람의 미루기 의도가 감소했다(F=6.37, p<.05).",

      "title": "How to Make a Good First Impression When Socially Anxious",
      "abstract": "Making a good first impression is integral to forming and maintaining relationships, which affect nearly every aspect of one's life. Whether interviewing for a job or meeting a partner's friends and family, making positive first impressions can significantly improve one's quality of life. Research shows that social anxiety impedes a person's ability to make a good first impression. Wherein appearing anxious (i.e., tense, fidgeting, unstable vocal pitch) can cause a person to come across as less desirable, more submissive, detached, and less expressive. Social anxiety also contributes to one's negative interpretation of their impressions on others, further perpetuating this fear. However, there are specific strategies that can help people conquer social anxiety and make better first impressions. By creating self-distance (e.g., non-first-person self-talk, reflecting as if watching a stranger), focusing on others (e.g., learning about others, performing acts of kindness), and increasing self-expression, one can decrease social anxiety and make better first impressions.",

      "title": "The Differential Effect of Gender on the Way Conflict between Work and Family Roles Affects Managers' Reliance on Information Sources in Dealing with Significant Workplace Events",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Many managers strive to simultaneously perform two demanding roles. One role frequently involves a sole or shared responsibility for managing a family. The other role involves successfully performing managerial tasks on the job. Both roles usually require substantial time and the use of the manager's physical and mental resources. These roles can frequently result in conflicting demands for these limited personal resources. When these resources available for one role are limited by an increase in the use of these resources to perform the other role, the performance of the role not receiving adequate resources may be impaired. For example, dealing with health or behavioral issues within the family could require extra time and attention of a manager that would not be available to deal with workplace issues. If this impairment extends to decision-making processes, important decisions such as those related to important workplace events may be made quickly and intuitively rather than made after seeking an appropriate amount of input from other information sources and properly analyzing that input. As a result, decisions that are made more intuitively may have a negative impact on organizational performance compared with decisions that are the result of a more thorough and more logic-based decision process. A manager typically makes numerous workplace decisions dealing with events in his or her area of responsibility. These can include dealing with personnel issues, resources issues and procedural issues. For example, a manager may encounter subordinate performance that either fails to meet expectations or far exceeds them, experience a lack of support from other areas of the organization, or face implementation issues when the organization changes established operational procedures. In dealing with many of these events, it would be appropriate for a manager to consult many sources of guidance within the organization for assistance in interpreting them and evaluating alternative approaches in responding to them. A manager simultaneously dealing with significant issues related to the family would likely experience difficulty in taking the time necessary to properly consult alternative sources of information and consider alternatives approaches in dealing with these workplace events. As a result, such an individual might adopt a decision-making process based on the amount of time and effort available rather than amount that the decision requires. This study investigates how a manager's gender affects the way that conflict between work and family roles impacts the way managers utilize informational sources in obtaining guidance in interpreting and acting upon these commonly encountered workplace events. This study supplements recent exploratory research that assessed the effect of these conflicts on information seeking behavior, but did not specifically explore gender differences in that behavior. Achieving a better understanding of these gender-based differences potentially provides a basis for assessing employer personnel policies that seek to minimize any potential adverse effects that occasional high levels of family-related demands on a manager's time and attention may have on the organization. The criterion variable in this study was the extent managers found information sources useful in resolving a wide range of common workplace events. This variable should serve as a suitable proxy for assessing how managers use information sources in performing other important work-related managerial tasks. LITERATURE REVIEW AND HYPOTHESES Many recent descriptive decision-making models are based on two distinct systems of reasoning (Sloman, 1996). Although the terminology used to describe these two systems varies, the characteristics of the two systems are described in a similar manner. Epstein (1994) described the two systems as experiential and rational. Sloman (2002) characterized them as associative and rule-based. …",

      "title": "Por que a procrastinação é tão comum em adultos com TDAH e como manejar",
      "abstract": "Embora a procrastinação não seja um sintoma oficial do TDAH, ela aparece com frequência entre adultos diagnosticados, devido a dificuldades comuns como desorganização, impulsividade, má gestão do tempo e planejamento ineficaz. Pessoas com TDAH tendem a buscar recompensas imediatas e têm mais dificuldade em perceber o tempo de forma precisa, o que favorece o adiamento de tarefas. Aspectos emocionais, como ansiedade, perfeccionismo e pensamentos que levam à evitação, também contribuem para esse padrão de comportamento. A procrastinação pode afetar negativamente várias áreas da vida, como os estudos, o trabalho e os relacionamentos, além de aumentar o risco de outras condições, como ansiedade e depressão. Quando se trata de tratamento, a terapia cognitivo-comportamental (TCC) é apontada como a abordagem mais eficaz, por ajudar o indivíduo a mudar padrões de pensamento e desenvolver estratégias práticas para lidar com a procrastinação. A modalidade online da TCC também aparece como uma alternativa útil, especialmente por facilitar o acesso ao cuidado. Em resumo, a procrastinação em adultos com TDAH é um desafio multifacetado que exige intervenções específicas para promover bem-estar e qualidade de vida.",

In order to address consultee resistance, it is recommended that consultants complete functional assessments to determine the underlying reasons for the resistance so that the results can be linked to strategic or intensive consultative intervention(s). Seven \"high hit\" reasons to explain consultee resistance are discussed: (a) a lack of knowledge or skills, (b) the need for consultative modifications, (c) difficulties with the transfer of training, (d) difficulties with the transfer due to \"conditions of emotionality,\" (e) the lack of consultee motivation or consultant accountability, (f) inconsistency, and (g) the presence of \"special situations.\" These are linked with possible consultative interventions that are focused on eliminating a consultee's resistance, resulting in the implementation of an effective intervention and, ultimately, in student success.",

      "abstract": "Pembimbing : (1) Dra. Siti Suminarti, M.Si.\r\n\r\n(2) M. Salis Yuniardi, S. Psi. M.Psi.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnak-anak adalah masa-masa bermain, proses mereka belajar tentang sesuatu yang baru melalui sebuah permainan. Dalam permainan, seorang anak akan dapat berpikir mengenai apa yang harus dilakukan dalam menyelesaikan suatu konflik. Akan tetapi yang menjadi masalah adalah ketika anak memiliki kepribadian yang berbeda dari anak-anak pada umumnya, anak tersebut dapat dikatakan telah memiliki gangguan jika telah memenuhi kriteria dari gangguan itu sendiri. Misalnya gangguan pemusatan perhatian atau ADHD, dan gangguan tingkah laku.\r\n\r\nAnak ADHD tersebut memerlukan pendidikan dengan guru yang dapat memikul tanggung jawab yang sangat besar, ia dituntut untuk mampu mampu memilih, menentukan, dan mengembangkan model dan bentuk-bentuk evaluasi kemajuan belajar yang cocok atau sesuai bagi siswa ADHD. Ketika guru SLB tidak memiliki kesabaran dan ketelatenan dalam melakukan pengajaran, guru tersebut akan rentan mengalami stres karena kegiatan tersebut berhubungan dengan gangguan kognitif, fungsional dan perilaku yang dialami oleh penderita. Menurut Lazarus dkk (1994) coping atau cara mengurangi stres mempunyai dua macam fungsi yaitu emotion focused coping dan problem focused coping. Metode dan strategi coping juga harus sesuai dengan stres yang dialami agar coping tersebut menjadi efektif. Jika coping yang dilakukan berhasil maka keadaan stres dan stressor dapat ditekan.\r\n\r\nPenelitian ini menggunakan metode penelitian kualitatif berjenis deskriptif dengan subyek berjumlah 4 orang dengan klasifikasi tertentu yaitu guru SLB yang mengalami stres berdasarkan gejala-gejala yang diramalkan ketika mengajar anak ADHD dan memiliki coping yang ditunjukkan melalui cheklist. Selanjutnya pengambilan data yaitu dengan metode wawancara tidak terstruktur dengan menggunakan pedoman umum wawancara.\r\n\r\nDidalam penelitian ini dapat disimpulkan bahwa penyebab stres terdapat dua faktor yaitu faktor internal dan faktor eksternal. Faktor internal ditunjukkan adanya perasaan jenuh, marah dan jengkel pada anak ADHD. Hal tersebut muncul karena subyek merasa tidak mampu untuk menanganinya dan merasa kurang memiliki strategi lain untuk mengajar anak ADHD. Faktor eksternal yang menyebabkan munculnya stres adalah ketatnya aturan yang ada disekolah dan ketua yayasan yang terlalu menuntut agar pekerjaan guru tersebut dapat memenuhi target. Hal tersebut membuat subyek merasa sangat tertekan dan bingung harus bersikap seperti apa. Selain itu masalah-masalah yang ada dalam rumah subyek kadang-kadang juga membuat subyek merasa terbebani.\r\n\r\nOleh karena itu ketika menangani stresnya guru SLB yang mengajar anak ADHD tersebut lebih dominan menggunakan strategi emotion focused coping yang mengacu pada approach strategies yaitu dengan cara berintrospeksi diri dan belajar dari kesalahan yang sudah terjadi. Adapun problem focused coping juga digunakan oleh subyek yaitu dengan cara mencari cara lain untuk menangani anak ADHD dan secara langsung mendekati anak ADHD dengan cara yang pelan. Akan tetapi strategi ini jarang digunakan oleh subyek penelitian.",

      "title": "Influence Of Self-efficacy On The Enjoyment And Fulfillment Of The Recommendations Of The Acsm",
      "abstract": "Within the transtheoretical model, behavior modification involves the progression of individuals through five stages (SC): pre-contemplation (PC = inactive without any intention to change), contemplation (C = inactive with intention to change), preparation (P = active but not fulfilling the recommendations of the American College of Sports Medicine [ACSM]), action (A = has complied with the recommendations of the ACSM but for less than six months) and maintenance (M = has complied with the recommendations ACSM for more than six months). Two critical aspects for progression through the stages are enjoyment (E) and self-efficacy (SE), the former being maybe the most important positive correlate for adherence and maintenance of a structured exercise program; whereas the latter refers to the confidence one has on his/her ability to perform a specific behavior in a specific situation. For instance, some people may have high level of self-efficacy towards 30 minutes vigorous walking during the day but low perception about maintaining such behavior at least five times a week for a long time. PURPOUSE: To examine the influence of perception of self-efficacy on the stages of change (EC) and healthy physical activity enjoyment. METHOD: A total of 533 subjects (48% female and 51.8% male; 33.22 ±15.27; range = 11-76). Self-efficacy, enjoyment scales, and the stages of change for physical activity questionnaire were used. RESULTS: The internal consistency of the subscales of SE (alpha = .81) and E (alpha = .94) were satisfactory. The results of one-way ANOVA revealed significant differences in the SE (F(4,524) = 23.775, p< .001) and E (F(4,523) = 20,842, p< .001) in different EC. The Tukey’s test indicated that people in M and A perceived more SE than those in P, C and PC; people in A and P perceived higher SE than those in C and PC; and people in P and C showed high levels of SE than those in the PC. Meanwhile, people in M had higher E than those in P, A, C and PC; and people in P, A, and C showed higher levels of E than those in PC. The relation of E vs SE was significant (F(1,528) =109.403, p< .001). CONCLUSION: Perceived self-efficacy is a factor that positively affects enjoyment in physical activity. This will be beneficial to continuing and extending the healthy practice recommendations issued by the ACSM. Supported by PAICYT, 2015 (UANL).",

      "title": "Ways Managers Interpret and Act on Common Workplace Events: Implications for the Entrepreneurial Executive",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Performing the role of manager involves indentifying issues that require the attention of the manager, seeking guidance when necessary on how best to resolve the issues, making a decision as to what alternative course of action to take and implementing that decision. Some situations that are interpreted by a manager as routine, or of minor consequence, are resolved by decisions that are made quickly and often intuitively with little information search or analytic activity. Other situations are interpreted as more complex, novel or important and, therefore, require significant information search and analysis before action can be taken by the manager (Smith, Peterson, & Schwartz, 2002). An individual's need for closure (Webster & Kruglanski, 1994) may influence the interpretive and decision-making process by affecting the amount and type of guidance that is sought. A manager that has a higher need to reach a state of cognitive closure would be less likely to tolerate a longer period of ambiguity in resolving situations. As a result, the expectation would be an individual that has a high need for cognitive closure would be significantly less likely to seek guidance from a number of sources in analyzing situations than an individual with a lower need for closure. Individuals that utilize fewer sources of guidance are more likely to be intuitive decision-makers and, as a result, be more likely to make an incorrect decision than an individual who has followed a logic-based process involving appropriate information search and analysis. Achieving a greater understanding of how individual differences affect decision-making processes potentially helps improve those processes. This study investigates how a manager's need for closure affects the manner in which the manager seeks guidance from his or her peers and relies on personal when dealing with work-related situations that are both commonly encountered and relatively important. Because this study is a field study of actual managers performing common managerial activities, it has the potential of providing valuable insights into managerial decision-making behavior. This understanding is important in a wide range of decision-making situations, including those in an entrepreneurial context. Individuals that are more collaborative in the workplace and less likely to make quick, intuitive decisions potentially represent a much more valuable resource to the entrepreneurial executive seeking to identify and exploit market opportunities than individuals that are less collaborative or that tend to reach cognitive closure more readily. Similarly, possessing an understanding of the entrepreneurial benefits of collaborative behavior and the threats to entrepreneurial activity posed by an individual's tendencies to seek premature closure should provide motivation for the entrepreneurial executive to engage in sufficient information seeking and analytic behavior prior to making important decisions related to opportunity exploitation. Event Management The criterion variable in this study is the extent various information sources are utilized to interpret and sometimes act upon complex events commonly encountered by managers in the workplace (Peterson & Smith, 2000). Prior research (Smith, Peterson & Schwartz, 2002) has identified the individual, organizational and cultural sources of guidance commonly accessed in dealing with these situations. At the individual level, expertise is developed through and training. At the organizational level, persons providing guidance include superiors, subordinates specialists and coworkers. Impersonal sources at the organizational include formal rules or informal organizational norms. In addition, beliefs that are grounded in aspects of culture such as ideology or religion provide additional interpretive guidance. The extent the sources including own experience and other people at my level are assessed in the present study. …",

Studies 1-4 showed that self-presentation under challenging conditions or according to counter-normative patterns (presenting oneself modestly to strangers, boastfully to friends, contrary to gender norms, to a skeptical audience, or while being a racial token) led to impaired self-regulation later, suggesting that those self-presentations depleted self-regulatory resources. When self-presentation conformed to familiar, normative, or dispositional patterns, self-regulation was less implicated. Studies 5-8 showed that when resources for self-regulation had been depleted by prior acts of self-control, self-presentation drifted toward less-effective patterns (talking too much, overly or insufficiently intimate disclosures, or egotistical arrogance).

      "title": "The Differential Effect of Gender on the Way Conflict Between Work and Family Roles Affects Managers’ Reliance on Information Sources in Dealing With Significant Workplace Events",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Many managers strive to simultaneously perform two demanding roles. One role frequently involves a sole or shared responsibility for managing a family. The other role involves successfully performing managerial tasks on the job. Both roles usually require substantial time and the use of the manager's physical and mental resources. These roles can frequently result in conflicting demands for these limited personal resources. When these resources available for one role are limited by an increase in the use of these resources to perform the other role, the performance of the role not receiving adequate resources may be impaired. For example, dealing with health or behavioral issues within the family could require extra time and attention of a manager that would not be available to deal with workplace issues. If this impairment extends to decision-making processes, important decisions such as those related to important workplace events may be made quickly and intuitively rather than made after seeking an appropriate amount of input from other information sources and properly analyzing that input. As a result, decisions that are made more intuitively may have a negative impact on organizational performance compared with decisions that are the result of a more thorough and more logic-based decision process. A manager typically makes numerous workplace decisions dealing with events in his or her area of responsibility. These can include dealing with personnel issues, resources issues and procedural issues. For example, a manager may encounter subordinate performance that either fails to meet expectations or far exceeds them, experience a lack of support from other areas of the organization, or face implementation issues when the organization changes established operational procedures. In dealing with many of these events, it would be appropriate for a manager to consult many sources of guidance within the organization for assistance in interpreting them and evaluating alternative approaches in responding to them. A manager simultaneously dealing with significant issues related to the family would likely experience difficulty in taking the time necessary to properly consult alternative sources of information and consider alternatives approaches in dealing with these workplace events. As a result, such an individual might adopt a decision-making process based on the amount of time and effort available rather than amount that the decision requires. This study investigates how a manager's gender affects the way that conflict between work and family roles impacts the way managers utilize informational sources in obtaining guidance in interpreting and acting upon these commonly encountered workplace events. This study supplements recent exploratory research that assessed the effect of these conflicts on information seeking behavior, but did not specifically explore gender differences in that behavior. Achieving a better understanding of these gender-based differences potentially provides a basis for assessing employer personnel policies that seek to minimize any potential adverse effects that occasional high levels of family-related demands on a manager's time and attention may have on the organization. The criterion variable in this study was the extent managers found information sources useful in resolving a wide range of common workplace events. This variable should serve as a suitable proxy for assessing how managers use information sources in performing other important work-related managerial tasks. LITERATURE REVIEW AND HYPOTHESES Many recent descriptive decision-making models are based on two distinct systems of reasoning (Sloman, 1996). Although the terminology used to describe these two systems varies, the characteristics of the two systems are described in a similar manner. Epstein (1994) described the two systems as experiential and rational. Sloman (2002) characterized them as associative and rule-based. …",

Dalam skala yang lebih luas, AP bisa berdampak keputus-asaan, stress dan paranoid terhadap tanggung jawabnya sendiri. Hal itu bisa terjadi karena beberapa faktor. Beberapa penelitian mengenai faktor penyebab AP pada mahasiswa sangat bervariasi. Hal itu disebabkan berbedanya situasi yang melatarbelakangi keadaan pikologis dan sosial mahasiswa. Artinya, faktor penyebab AP pada satu instansi pendidikan tinggi akan berbeda dengan instansi pendidikan tinggi lainnya. Berdasarkan hasil penelitian diketahui bahwa indeks kelulusan mahasiswa yang lulus tepat waktu dibawah 50%. Pada faktor primer, AP bisa terjadi karena anxiety , time disorganization , poor task approach , stress and fatigue . Selain itu, faktor sekunder yang juga menjadi penyebab AP seperti low discomfort tolerance and pleasure seeking , self - depreciation , environmental disorganization dan lack of assertion .",

Nous developpons dans une periode relativement courte un toute etonnable nombre d’habilites motrices, de locomotion jusqu'a manipulation qui requierent une motricite globale ou fine. Le developpement moteur emerge de l’interaction avec l’environnement qui exerce des contraintes mais offre egalement des modeles pour l’apprentissage par imitation. Notre capacite a appliquer les principes de coordination a de nouvelles habiletes motrices nous ouvre un vaste champ de possibilites. A noter que certaines habiletes motrices, telles que l’ecriture, necessitent, elles, un apprentissage et un entrainement specifiques. Chez certains enfants, les habiletes motrices ne se developpent pas de facon appropriee. Ces enfants eprouvent des difficultes dans l’apprentissage des habiletes motrices et sont maladroits dans leur mise en œuvre. Il en resulte un retard du developpement moteur. Pour nombre de ces enfants, aucune etiologie d’ordre medical ou neurologique ne peut etre trouvee. Ils sont diagnostiques comme atteints d’un Trouble d’Acquisition des Coordinations (TAC) et sont l’objet de ce livre. Ce trouble est designe sous diverses appellations telles que la maladresse, la dyspraxie ou difficultes d’integration sensori-motrice. Cet ouvrage a pour objectif d’informer le lecteur – qu’il soit professionnel, chercheur, enseignant ou parent - des derniers acquis de la recherche portant sur le TAC. Il passe en revue les difficultes rencontres par l’enfant souffrant d’un TAC (Geuze), les principaux tests disponibles dans le domaine des fonctions perceptivo-motrices (Albaret & Castelnau), les differents sous-types et la comorbidite (Visser), les deficits sous-jacents au TAC (Wilson & Butson), les principales approches therapeutiques et leur efficacite (Polatajko & Cantin), et enfin, la prise en charge du TAC (Sugden). Cet ouvrage souhaite favoriser la diffusion des connaissances scientifiques actuelles ainsi que l’utilisation des outils appropries pour le diagnostic, l’evaluation et le traitement du TAC. L’objectif ultime est le developpement optimal – non limite au seul developpement moteur – de l’enfant atteint d’un TAC, ce qui constitue une gageure pour les parents, les enseignants et les professionnels concernes.

A follower would like his action to be close to some ideal (but unknown) target; to reflect his own idiosyncratic preferences; and to be close to the actions of others. He learns about his world by listening to leaders. Followers fail to internalize the full benefits of coordination and so place insufficient emphasis on the focal views of relatively clear leaders. A leader sometimes stands back, by restricting what she says, and so creates space for others to be heard; in particular, a benevolent leader with outstanding judgement gives way to a clearer communicator in an attempt to encourage unity amongst her followers. Sometimes a leader receives no attention from followers, and sometimes she steps down (says nothing); hence a leadership elite emerges from the endogenous choices of leaders and followers.",

This feeling is frequently enhanced by the attitudes of their classmates, their par ents, and even the teacher, if she fails to understand the true situation. Read ing becomes disliked and they seek op portunities to avoid it. Sometimes fail ure leads children to become timid and withdrawn. Excessive daydreaming is indulged in. In other cases, insecurity is manifested by nervous habits such as nail-biting, or the appearance of hysterically motivated illnesses such as headaches. Still others may com pensate for their feelings of inferiority by developing various forms of antiso cial behavior.",

      "abstract": "That’s not really surprising when you stop to think about it. Traditional practices (with respect to teaching students but also to raising children and managing employees) often consist of what might be called a “doing to” — as opposed to a “working with” — approach, the point being to act on people to achieve a specific goal. These strategies sometimes succeed in producing an effect in the short term. Research — which itself is often limited in duration or design — may certify the effort as successful. But when you watch what happens later on, or you look more carefully at the impact of these interventions, the initial findings have a way of going up in smoke.",

This can sometimes cause problems, especially when the tasks are very difficult, or when they are not well-practiced. Researchers are interested in how people perform tasks at the same time, and also in age differences: Do children and older adults encounter more problems in such situations than young adults? Findings indicate that children and older adults tend to pay more attention to the motor task when there is a risk of getting hurt, which is a smart strategy because it keeps them safe.",

      "abstract": "Secondary (or ``auxiliary,'' or ``subsidiary'') tasks have often been used to load or to stress an operator while he performs a primary manual control task. As discussed in Poulton, <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">[1]</sup> the secondary task should measurably stress the operator's parameter being tested, without rendering the primary task behavior meaningless. This problem has given rise to several types of secondary tasks, which fall into two categories. In the first category are secondary tasks that do not involve the same form of manual control activity as the primary task, such as: mental arithmetic, verbal report of warning light detection, verbal repetition of heard number sequences, etc. <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">[2]-[4]</sup> In the second category are secondary tasks involving similar psychomotor activity as the primary task, such as: tracking in a second degree-of-freedom, two-handed tracking, monitoring, and extinguishing warning lights, etc. <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">[5]</sup> In the latter case, the distinctions between a secondary task and a multiloop control situation are not sharp and depend primarily on the relative emphasis placed on secondary task performance, specified by the procedures or practiced by the operator.",

      "abstract": "In open-ended and changing environments, agents face a wide range of potential tasks that may or may not come with associated reward functions. Such autonomous learning agents must be able to generate their own tasks through a process of intrinsically motivated exploration, some of which might prove easy, others impossible. For this reason, they should be able to actively select which task to practice at any given moment, to maximize their overall mastery on the set of learnable tasks. This paper proposes CURIOUS, an extension of Universal Value Function Approximators that enables intrinsically motivated agents to learn to achieve both multiple tasks and multiple goals within a unique policy, leverag-ing hindsight learning. Agents focus on achievable tasks first, using an automated curriculum learning mechanism that biases their attention towards tasks maximizing the absolute learning progress. This mechanism provides robustness to catastrophic forgetting (by refocusing on tasks where performance decreases) and distracting tasks (by avoiding tasks with no absolute learning progress). Furthermore , we show that having two levels of parameterization (tasks and goals within tasks) enables more efficient learning of skills in an environment with a modular physical structure (e.g. multiple objects) as compared to flat, goal-parameterized RL with hindsight experience replay.",

      "abstract": "The shortcuts in thinking that humans use to solve problems (‘heuristics’, covered in an earlier review) are not always perfect, and in medicine this can lead to errors in diagnosis. So, how to recognize what is happening and try to combat it? In this review (part 2 of 2) the authors from the USA suggest ways of getting doctors ‘to think about the way they think’ (an approach known as metacognition) during the process of diagnosis. A number of strategies are considered: for instance, learning to pay more attention to – and acting more readily on – gut feelings of uncertainty, and being more aware of when to take time out to look at possibly uncertain diagnoses from different angles (‘What else could it be?’ ‘Why does this not fit?’ ‘Let's discuss it with a colleague.’). Even being more consciously aware of when the work environment is too demanding or distracting (the phone never stops ringing, emails are constantly coming in, fatigue is kicking in, etc.) is an important skill. Reflecting on personal errors in diagnosis is another simple, practical example, as is asking for feedback from patients about what worked and what didn't. High risk professions have used checklists for a long time: does medicine need to catch up? Finally, the authors comment that experience can be a two‐edged sword: although experienced doctors generally use heuristics more effectively in diagnosis than inexperienced ones (see part 1), this can be undermined if they also ‘become less likely to seek outside opinions or use reference materials’.",

      "title": "The Psychology of Procrastination: How We Create Categories of the Future",
      "abstract": "Paying bills, filling out forms, completing class assignments, or submitting grant proposals – we all have the tendency to procrastinate. We may engage in trivial activities such as watching TV shows, playing video games, or chatting for an hour and risk missing important deadlines by putting off tasks that are essential for our financial and professional security. Not all humans are equally prone to procrastination, and a recent study suggests that this may in part be due to the fact that the tendency to procrastinate has a genetic underpinning. (2) Yet even an individual with a given genetic makeup can exhibit a significant variability in the extent of procrastination. A person may sometimes delay initiating and completing tasks, whereas at other times that same person will immediately tackle the same type of tasks even under the same constraints of time and resources. \n\nA fully rational approach to task completion would involve creating a priority list of tasks based on a composite score of task importance and the remaining time until the deadline. The most important task with the most proximate deadline would have to be tackled first, and the lowest priority task with the furthest deadline last. This sounds great in theory, but it is quite difficult to implement. A substantial amount of research has been conducted (3) to understand how our moods, distractability, and impulsivity can undermine the best-laid plans for timely task initiation and completion. The recent research article The Categorization of Time and Its Impact on Task Initiation (4) by the researchers Yanping Tu (University of Chicago) and Dilip Soman (University of Toronto) investigates a rather different and novel angle in the psychology of procrastination: our perception of the future.",

The levels of self-regulation relating to any professional activity, and corresponding to these levels self-regulatory capacities are distinguished: 1) psychophysiological - the ability for self-regulation of emotional and psycho- physiological states; 2) socio-psychological - the ability for self-regulation in the process of social interaction; 3) psychological (the ability to regulate activities; the capacity for personal self-control);spiritual - the highest capacity for self-regulation due to the higher values and meanings of existence. Self-regulation at the highest spiritual level is considered in this research in connection with the actualization of higher self-regulatory capacities, leading to self-realization of the person including professional activity. Processes, levels, components of self-regulation, associated with different conditions of professional activities (for example, in extreme situations), as well as with different types of professions (teachers, sales managers, etc.) are described. A particular attention is given to self- regulation in the teaching activities: levels, techniques of teachers’ self-regulatory skills are presented; the importance of teachers’ personal self-regulation is emphasized, because it determines self-development, self-improvement and self-fulfillment in their chosen profession, and is associated with the manifestation of higher self-regulatory capacities. It is noted that in the process of professional activities different levels and types of self-regulation are demanded. The self-regulation in professional activities is carried out due to various self-regulatory capabilities - from simple to complex, including the highest.",

Suicide attempt is trying to take one’s own life with a nonfatal outcome and which may or may not result in injuries.

Suicide ideation ranges from passive thoughts (e.g., “I wish I wasn’t around”) to clear, active thoughts of suicide (e.g., “I will jump in front of a car tomorrow on the freeway”). Suicidal behavior is suicide, suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, and planning/preparation done with the intent of attempting or dying by suicide (SPRC, 2018). Suicide risk/lethality is defined on multiple levels, depending on the severity or level of risk to which a person experiences suicidal ideation or behavior (e.g., no risk, low risk, moderate risk, high risk; Paladino &amp; Barrio Minton, 2008).",

      "title": "Spontaneous Thought and Goal Pursuit: From Functions such as Planning to Dysfunctions such as Rumination",
      "abstract": "Spontaneous thoughts occur by default in the interstices between directed, generally task-oriented thoughts or moments of perceptual scrutiny. Their contents are overwhelmingly related to thinkers’ current goals, either directly or indirectly via associative networks, including to past and tentative future goals. They are triggered by ambient goal-related stimuli or segments of own thought. Most spontaneous thought segments are very brief, a matter of seconds, but may be much longer. Their typical brevity generally permits wide variation in content, reflecting the individual’s current agenda of goals. Their evocation is accompanied by emotional responses that vary widely in type, valence, and intensity. These properties of the emotional accompaniments probably determine which content area receives priority for thought. Given these properties of thought flow, spontaneous thoughts are highly adaptive as (1) reminders of the individual’s larger agenda of goals while occupied with pursuing any one of them, (2) promotion of planning for future goal pursuits, (3) review and deeper understanding of past goal-related experiences, and (4) development of creative solutions to problems in goal pursuit. In the face of threats to successful pursuit of important goals or the prospect of failure, the same mechanisms may occasion repetitive but unproductive thoughts about the pursuit, the consequences of the failure, or the self, and strong negative emotions steering the train of thought may lead to narrowing of its focus, thus producing rumination. The disposition to ruminate is in part a function of states of negative affect and individual differences such as strength of focus on particular thought themes, momentum of particular emotional states, and neuroticism. Rumination is a common occurrence during low mood or outright depression that accompanies the process of disengaging from goal pursuits that have become unrealistic or overly expensive. The typically reduced interest in alternative goals during this phase further limits the range of thought content and the individual’s resources for re-engagement with gratifying goal pursuits. For assessment and clinical purposes, spontaneous thought content can potentially provide information not captured by other procedures. When an individual’s spontaneous thoughts are themselves problematic, empirically validated methods for improving the individual’s motivational structure provide a likely best treatment strategy.",

The current paper seeks to provide a theoretical and clinical understanding of procrastination by reviewing prior research. Based on previous studies, here, the present review interprets effects of personality traits (like conscientiousness and neuroticism), aversiveness of tasks and negative emotions on procrastination. Furthermore, we suggest that making proper plan and emotion regulation strategies could attenuate procrastination. For investigating psychological mechanism of procrastination further, specific experiment design and neuroimaging techniques, such as fMRI and fNIRs, should be engaged in future research.",

Performance correlated strongly with liking for mathematics and self-rating of mathematical performance, and liking and self-rating also correlated with one another. Mathematics anxiety seems often to involve concerns about not only accuracy but also speed and a feeling that one is in a sort of race. The people with high mathematics anxiety were less precise in their number comparisons than those with lower mathematics anxiety. Mathematics anxiety correlated strongly with unhappiness at poor performance, but neither measure correlated with actual performance.

      "abstract": "Artikkelissa tarkastellaan myönteisen arvioinnin keinoja, toteutumismuotoja ja vastaanottoa tehtävänohjaustilanteissa, joihin osallistuu kehitysvammainen työntekijä ja ei-kehitysvammainen työnohjaaja. Näissä kielellisesti ja institutionaalisesti epäsymmetrisissä ohjaustilanteissa ohjaajat muotoilevat arviointinsa usein kehuvuoroiksi, joilla he suuntaavat työntekijän huomiota ohjauksen kannalta olennaisiin saavutuksiin. Kehuvuorot muotoillaan useimmiten kielellisesti yksinkertaisesti. Niissä käytetään puhekielessä yleisiä sanoja ja kielen rakenteita, selkeää intonaatiota sekä ydinasian painotusta. Myönteisiä arvioita esitetään tehtävän edistymisestä ja onnistumisesta sekä työntekijän osaamisesta ja oppimisesta. Lyhyillä, kehuvilla minimikuittauksilla annetaan myös palautetta tehtävän yhden vaiheen suorittamisesta ja suuntaudutaan vuorovaikutuksessa eteenpäin. Kehitysvammaiset työntekijät vastaanottavat myönteisiä arvioita pääosin joko ohittamalla kehun tai hyväksymällä sen lyhyellä myöntöpartikkelilla. Ohjaustilanteissa nämä arvioinnin vastaanottotavat vaikuttavat odotuksenmukaisilta. Tarkasteltujen esimerkkien valossa voikin sanoa, että sekä kehitysvammaiset työntekijät että työnohjaajat kykenivät yleensä mukauttamaan toimintaansa sensitiivisesti tilanteen vaatimusten mukaan. Artikkelissa myönteistä arviointia pohditaan myös työnohjaajien ammatillisen vuorovaikutuksen kehittämisen näkökulmasta. Havaintoja tarkastellaan suhteessa selkokielisen puheen suosituksiin, joiden tavoitteena on tarjota tukea kielellisesti epäsymmetristen keskustelujen erityishaasteisiin. Positive evaluation: job coaches’ compliment turns in the task guidance of workers with intellectual disabilities This article explores the means, forms of implementation, and reception of positive feedback in task-guidance situations involving workers with intellectual disabilities and their job coaches. In these linguistically and institutionally asymmetrical situations, job coaches often formulate their feedback as compliments, which direct the participants attention to their achievements that are relevant in terms of the guidance. Linguistically, such compliment turns are formulated very simply, using frequent everyday vocabulary, common linguistic structures, clear intonation and emphasising the core contents of the turn. Positive evaluation concentrates on the progress and success of the task as well as the worker’s skills and learning. Short, minimal, complimentary feedback is provided to the worker to express that one phase in the task is now complete and to indicate a shift forward in the interaction. Workers with intellectual disabilities usually accept positive feedback on their performance either by ignoring such compliments altogether or by responding with a short particle to indicate acknowledgement. In task guidance situations, these ways of reception are to be expected. In light of the examples in this study, both workers and coaches are usually capable of sensitively adapting their actions to the situation. The article also considers positive evaluation from the perspective of improving job coaches’ professional interaction. The findings are examined in relation to Finnish Easy Language recommendations, which aim to provide support for the challenges specific to linguistically asymmetrical conversations.",

      "abstract": "Distraction is the key reasons for inefficiency in any activity or task. The choice is after realis-ing the effects people evolve or retain. Evolve lead to betterment where as retaining the same leads to waste of time and efforts resulting in poor focus of activity. What happens when a person is distracted ? Actually the person mind shifts the activity on process to activity that tempts or alarms. This become a habit on practise loosing concentration on what to be done. Activity of a human can be in two parts 1. Productive and 2. Non Productive. Productive activity is one with time framed tasks and which result in revenue generation or for a useful cause. Where as non productive activity is for entertainment or fun or like or addiction which will not or will have low impact on an individual knowledge or revenue generation process. The conclusion is that apart from the respondents who are from the age group between 47-55 the respondents from other age group felt anxious and lost due to use of digital gadgets and also female respondents believe that use of digital gadgets may lead to mood improvement. This factors has to be eradicated as this cause harm and may addict them towards continuous usage of digital gadgets in future period of time.",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "abstract": "As reported by Lavakumar et al. [1], when clinicians from seven different academic centers across the United States were asked to rate what factors were most important to them when requesting a psychiatric consultation, two of the three most important parameters identified were \"understanding the core questions being asked\" and \"practical and helpful management suggestions for medical staff\". Understanding the consult question and providing actionable recommendations are not as straightforward tasks as they may first seem. The consult question may be incomplete, misleading, or not easily discernible. It may be prompted by a number of different needs or tensions, some of them practical (e.g., \"the patient is not taking his medications\"), or interpersonal (e.g., dynamic processes between the patient and the team, between the patient's illness and the team, or among team members). The ask, or help, that the consultee is requesting may indeed be \"practical\" (e.g., \"what medication will help manage this behavior?\") or more intangible (e.g., a wish for the patient to be cured of an untreatable illness, or a desire that the patient not be the team's \"problem\" any longer). Sometimes the physician requesting the consult cannot quite articulate what the exact issue is, or what kind of help they are requesting—only that there is something impeding the course of treatment and that assistance is needed to bring the situation back into usual order. While it can be relatively straightforward—although never simple—to learn the basics of how to manage common clinical problems and patient presentations seen on the Consultation-Liaison (C-L) Psychiatry service, it is substantially more challenging to gain proficiency in handling the many layers that lie beneath the surface of the typical consult, from psychodynamic complexity to the external influences of the medical system. This book aims to fill that gap and provide insight into the parts of the consultation process that require the consultation-liaison psychiatrist to think beyond the facts of the consult.",

      "title": "Measures of Personal Success and Failure: A Self-Assessment, Applying the Sociological Imagination",
      "abstract": "I sometimes look back and ask myself a series of questions: am I doing? Am I having a successful life so far or have I had more failure than success? How do I measure my personal success and failure? Was my success or failure based upon my own standards or other people's determinations? How do I decide my standards? Are they influenced by other people's What is considered to be a success and what is considered to be a failure? Was my success really successful or were they considered successful only according to other people's considerations? Did I really fail in my failure or was I just locking myself behind another set of bars created by other people? Am I the only one who has been living in such a life pursuing this kind of success and avoiding that kind of failure or am I just one of many whose eyes are blindfolded by the society's perception? As I am trying to search for the answers, I find one question leading into another one. The deeper I get into these questions, the more I find that some common senses aren't so common anymore, because I cannot tell whether my common senses represent the principles of how things are and why things are; maybe my common senses are just Islands of Meaning (Zerubavel 18-23) in Eviatar Zerubavel's words, I have sorted my personal experiences into distinct categories (Zerubavel 18-23). Or maybe I was into a world already interpreted and organized by others (Zerubavel 18-23). Perhaps I should use the Sociological imagination (Mills 1) described by C. Wright Mills, to do a self-research by linking my personal experiences with society and history. I was born in a small town in China, grew up in an ordinary family, somehow managed to cross the ocean and come to the United States. Thirty one years old today, I have a respectable job with decent salary; thirty one years old, I have just had my American Dream come true, owning my first house. To a lot of people, they think I am having quite a successful life so far; but then I look even closely at myself: thirty one years old, I am still working on my first undergraduate degree; thirty one years old, I haven't done anything that is really meaningful other than just working and working to make money; thirty one years old, I still don't have a clear picture of what I will be in the next thirty years. To some people, to me at least, it is a failure. Ever since China opened itself up to the world, although the thousand years long of traditions still root in most Chinese, western cultures have always been the exceptional ones in the perspectives of many Chinese. As China is blooming in economic and many other areas, western cultures have become even more dominant, American culture is the most prevailing one among them. Walking down the streets in China today, you find you are surrounded by American cultural symbols--Nike, Adidas, one store after another; McDonald, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut, from corner to corner. You can see people are lining up in every one of them. They all believe what they get are much better products, because they all believe USA is better than China when it comes to anything other than the national pride. I was, or maybe I am still, one of them. I came to the United States because I believed I would make a better living. Stories heard from parents or seen from TV about people who migrated to America are always wonderful; those people always come back with money and prestige and they all seem very successful. People envy them. I envied them. That was the reason I did not hesitate to make the decision to come here when I got the opportunity to participate in a student exchange program between US and China. My parents were very supportive too even though the application fee and other expenses were quite costly. My parents didn't have enough money to support me but they managed to borrow money from friends and family knowing that they would have to work twice harder and I would have to work just as hard as they did in the next few years; however we all believed it would be worth it at the end. …",

Aunque muestran una marcada tendencia a “sonar” con ejercer otros oficios ademas de la psicologia, dentro del ejercicio, la Psicologia Clinica fue el objetivo laboral mas ambicionado a largo plazo, mientras que otras areas como la Psicologia Escolar u Organizacional eran vistas como “objetivos temporales” por considerar mas factible su ingreso al campo laboral a traves de ellas, por otro lado la Psicologia Comunitaria o Social era concebida como una “accion humanitaria” a desarrollar en paralelo a las otras actividades profesionales. Se evidenciaron coincidencias significativas sobre planes de emigrar y deseos de reencuentro con familiares y amigos, explicadas por el momento vital e historico-cultural que comparten los estudiantes por la situacion pais.

      "abstract": "ABSTRAK Kurniawan, Bagus Hadi. 2017. Perilaku Memalak Siswa SMA dan Manajemen Layanan Khusus Penanggulangannya Studi Kasus di SMA Pratama Ken Arok. Skripsi. Jurusan Administrasi Pendidikan, Fakultas Ilmu Pendidikan, Universitas Negeri Malang. Pembimbing 1) Prof. Dr. Hj. Nurul Ulfatin, M.Pd, dan Pembimbing 2) Ahmad Nurabadi, S.Pd, M.Pd. Kata kunci: perilaku, memalak, dan manajemen layanan khusus  Perilaku adalah tindakan atau aktivitas dari manusia itu sendiri yang mempunyai bentangan yang sangat luas antara lain : berjalan, berbicara, menangis, tertawa, bekerja, kuliah, menulis, membaca, dan sebagainya. Dari uraian ini dapat disimpulkan bahwa yang dimaksud perilaku manusia adalah semua kegiatan atau aktivitas manusia, baik yang diamati langsung, maupun yang tidak dapat diamati oleh pihak luar. Perilaku kenakalan remaja ada banyak jenisnya salah satunya adalah memalak. Memalak merupakan tindakan menyakitkan dengan disengaja yang ditujukan pada orang atau orang-orang lain, yang dilakukan oleh satu atau lebih orang dan juga melibatkan saling pengaruh-mempengaruhi yang kompleks antara status sosial dan dominasi. Kenakalan remaja utamanya memalak atau pemalakan masih cukup sering terjadi di SMA Pratama Ken Arok. Untuk mengurangi dan memberantas permasalahan ini, sekolah menggunakan program manajemen layanan khusus. Layanan khusus atau pelayanan bantuan diselenggarakan di sekolah dengan maksud untuk memperlancar pelaksanaan pengajaran dalam rangka pencapaian tujuan pendidikan di sekolah. Di samping itu, sekolah juga perlu memberikan pelayanan keamanan kepada peserta didik dan para pegawai yang ada di sekolah agar mereka dapat belajar dan melaksanakan tugas dengan tenang dan nyaman. Fokus penelitian tentang: 1) jenis-jenis perilaku memalak oleh siswa di SMA Pratama Ken Arok; 2) dorongan dan penyebab siswa SMA melakukan tindak pemalakan di SMA Pratama Ken Arok; 3) terbentuknya kelompok atau jaringan dari siswa SMA melakukan tindak pemalakan di SMA Pratama Ken Arok; 4) layanan khusus sekolah untuk mengatasi masalah memalak oleh siswa di SMA Pratama Ken Arok. Penelitian tentang perilaku memalak siswa SMA dan manajemen layanan khusus penanggulangannya studi kasus di SMA Pratama Ken Arok ini menggunakan pendekatan kualitatif. Lokasi penelitian ini dilakukan di SMA Pratama Ken Arok Jalan Pahlawan Pendidikan Nomor 1 berada di sebuah kecamatan di Kabupaten Malang yang berbatasan dengan Kabupaten Pasuruan Jawa Timur. Teknik yang digunakan dalam pengumpulan data penelitian kualitatif adalah wawancara, observasi, dan dokumentasi. Data yang diperoleh dari ketiga teknik tersebut diorganisasikan, direduksi apabila tidak relevan dengan fokus penelitian, dianalisis guna menyusun dan mengabstaksikan, serta menyimpulkan temuan lapangan. Keabsahan data diuji dengan: 1) trianggulasi; 2) pengecekan anggota; dan 3) perpanjangan ketekunan. Kesimpulan penelitian ini meliputi: 1) jenis-jenis perilaku memalak oleh siswa di sma pratama ken arok: a) pemalakan secara fisik; b) pemalakan secara verbal; c) pemalakan secara isyarat; d) pemalakan secara materi; 2) dorongan dan penyebab siswa sma melakukan tindak pemalakan; 3) terbentuknya kelompok atau jaringan dari siswa sma melakukan tindak pemalakan; 4) tindakan sekolah untuk mengatasi pemalakan: a) pemaksimalan layanan khusus berupa ekstra kurikuler di sekolah; b) penyuluhan rutin oleh guru bimbingan dan konseling; c) layanan homevisit; d) pembentukan layanan polisi siswa; e) beribadah dan ngaji wajib sebelum kbm di sekolah. Berdasarkan kesimpulan penelitian dapat disarankan bagi: 1) Kepala Dinas Pendidikan Kabupaten Malang diharapkan lebih menunjang dalam pembinaan layanan khusu yang ada di sekolah utamanya kegiatan yang bersifat untuk mengurangi kenakalan remaja yang sering dilakukan oleh siswa; 2) Kepala Sekolah diharapakan agar meningkatkan pengawasan dan aturan yang berlaku disekolah agar mampu meminimalisir terjadinya tindakan kenakalan pemalakan seperti ini, kepala sekolah juga diharapkan ikut berperan aktif dalam mengawasi jalannya semua kegiatan yang ada disekolah salah satunya program layanan khusus; 3) Waka Kesiswaan diharapkan semakin memperbanyak program layanan khusus yang bersifat mengembangkan potensi dari setiap siswa, agar waktu mereka bisa dipergunakan secara positif.  Program layanan khusus yang ada sekarang sudah cukup baik dan mampu menunjang untuk meningkatkan potensi siswa dan moralitasnya; 4) Orang Tua Siswa diharapakan tetap mengawasi dan memberi perhatian kepada anak baik perkembangan akademik maupun non-akademik, dikarenakan pada usia seperti remaja masih labil dalam peniruan atau imitasi; 5) Peneliti Lain yang akan meneliti tentang penelitian sejenis, maka disarankan untuk menghasilkan penemuan yang lebih baik dengan menggunakan pendekatan yang berbeda dan juga variable yang berbeda agar dapat memperoleh hasil penelitian yang sempurna Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE /* Style Definitions */\r\n table.MsoNormalTable\r\n\t{mso-style-name:Table Normal;\r\n\tmso-tstyle-rowband-size:0;\r\n\tmso-tstyle-colband-size:0;\r\n\tmso-style-noshow:yes;\r\n\tmso-style-priority:99;\r\n\tmso-style-parent:;\r\n\tmso-padding-alt:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt;\r\n\tmso-para-margin-top:0cm;\r\n\tmso-para-margin-right:0cm;\r\n\tmso-para-margin-bottom:8.0pt;\r\n\tmso-para-margin-left:0cm;\r\n\tline-height:107%;\r\n\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan;\r\n\tfont-size:11.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:Calibri,sans-serif;\r\n\tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;\r\n\tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;\r\n\tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;\r\n\tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;\r\n\tmso-bidi-font-family:Times New Roman;\r\n\tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}",

      "abstract": "Personality refers to the characteristics of the person that account for consistent patterns of feelings, thinking, and behaving, that distinguishes one person from another and persist over time. Personality has conspicuous impact on creative intelligence (CiQ) and individuals' success (or failure) in developing new ideas and translating those novel, original ideas into appropriate, valuable actions or artefacts. There is an extensive body of knowledge on the impact of personality traits on creative intentions (motivations), inventions (enacting or executing ideas) and how these traits interact with the creative teams and processes that occurs at work. It is important to note right at the outset that creative personalities vary greatly between domains and disciplines. A further key concept readers will quickly arrive at, is that there not one single identifying personality trait for creative genii. Also, no personality traits should be regarded as predictive of performance (either at work or at play), without considering the wider context or the specific situation (i.e., the other Ps in six Ps of creative intelligence).",

New Year's resolutions, promises, and assurances are often quickly forgotten before they have a chance to influence behavior. Intentions are particularly ineffective when forgetting, procrastination, or distraction from other goals or activities increase the difficulty of self-regulation. One way to overcome these obstacles is to form implementation intentions, or intentions that are supplemented with detailed plans and contextual cues that serve as reminders to perform intention-relevant activities (Gollwitzer, 1999). In addition to specifying a desired end state, implementation intentions link goals to situations by taking the form, I intend to do y whenever situation z is If sufficiently strong action-situation associations are formed in memory, the action is performed automatically whenever the relevant situation is encountered. When this occurs, behavioral control shifts from the individual to the situation.",

Research across multiple domains of psychology shows that our “free” choices, preferences, motives, and social behavior are all shaped by these unconscious operations. They arise from various sources, including (1) evolved primary motives for survival and safety, (2) early childhood experiences for which there is later no explicit memory; (3) carryover (priming) effects of experiences from one situation into the next; and (4) the transformational impact of our active goals on attention, preferences, and behavior. These effects have now been demonstrated in many real-life settings, including eating and health behavior, consumer purchasing, and teamwork and individual performance in the workplace, with unconscious effects in the field significantly stronger than those in the lab.",

      "abstract": "The article provides an overview of modern works devoted to the study of cognitive predictors of academic success. The general patterns of forecasting are revealed: the most powerful and universal predictor of academic success at different stages of school education is psychometric intelligence; creativity is less significant and rather unstable. It is argued that these patterns are poorly traced at the level of preschool education. Particular cognitive functions are significant for predicting the future educational achievements of preschoolers: information processing speed, visual perception (in combination with motor functions), short-term memory, and attention. Spatial abilities have a certain prognostic potential, though reasoning in preschoolers is not a strong predictor of academic success; executive functions have the greatest predictive power. It is noted that the general patterns in predicting the academic success of students can be traced in elementary school: the predictive potentials of psychometric intelligence are revealed, the power of individual cognitive abilities (in particular, spatial abilities) increases, the contribution of executive functions to the prediction decreases. The general tendency for non-cognitive factors (educational motivation, some personality traits) to increase with age also begins to appear in elementary school.",

Les stratégies en prévention et en promotion de la santé mentale mises de l’avant dans les établissements d’enseignement postsecondaire offrent les plus belles possibilités de rejoindre un grand nombre de jeunes adultes. Cependant, malgré l’intérêt grandissant pour de telles initiatives en milieu scolaire, les méta-analyses et les revues des écrits scientifiques recensés mettent en lumière les difficultés reliées à l’évaluation des stratégies utilisées et aux possibilités de répliquer les interventions, particulièrement en ce qui a trait à la promotion. Les stratégies les plus efficaces sur le plan de l’amélioration de la santé mentale semblent être associées à la supervision d’exercices en lien avec l’intervention telles que les exercices de pleine conscience ( mindfulness ), les techniques cognitives-comportementales, la relaxation et le développement d’habiletés sociales.

      "abstract": "The aim of our research is to show psychological peculiarities of procrastination as the important problem in Modern Psychology, to describe the results of our research of the level of procrastination of teenagers. Methods of the research. The following theoretical methods of the research were used to solve the tasks formulated in the article: a categorical method, structural and functional methods, the methods of the analysis, systematization, modeling, and generalization. The experimental method was the method of organizing empirical research. The results of the research. Respondents with a low level of procrastination are highly organized and efficient in completing tasks. They are usually able to plan their activities with precision and adhere to the planned schedule, which allow them to avoid procrastination and postponing tasks for later. This ability to complete tasks in time is the result of well-developed time management skills, organization, and self-discipline. Pupils with a low level of procrastination are able to tune into completing tasks, even if they require significant effort or difficulties arise. They can also work effectively under stress, when they are affected by several tasks at once. Conclusions. Procrastination, as a multifactorial psychological phenomenon, has come a long way from a simple understanding as laziness to the modern interpretation as a complex psychological process. Its emergence and development are associated with the evolution of views on human behavior, motivation and internal conflicts. From ancient times to the present day, procrastination has been changed in its understanding, and today it is considered not only as a personal flaw, but as a problem that requires special attention and intervention.",

      "title": "Some Conditions for Effective Work with Groups",
      "abstract": "The principal point being made in this article is that a group leader or therapist, by his own decisions and actions, can substantially influence (though not absolutely control) the likelihood of the group's success and effectiveness. Some facilitating decisions can be made and some activities undertaken before a group begins. These include deciding whether or not to conduct a group in a particular setting; exploring the attitudes of one's colleagues; conducting preparatory discussions with potential group members; deciding how many staff will be present; deciding at what intervals to introduce new members; etc. Other decisions cannot be made, or actions taken, until after the group is under way; or they must be undertaken after the group has started because they were overlooked beforehand. These include helping a group to establish a consensus by encouraging the expression of expectations, reservations, and underlying concerns; reassessing a group which seems to have gone stale; initiating discussions with colleagues when covert resistances on their part become apparent. The four issues discussed here set the stage and constitute the context for the group's work. Appropriate attention to them, and management of them, will facilitate but not guarantee the group's success. Many further situations arise in the course of the group's life which may alter its character and course. Nevertheless, many groups which provide a disappointing experience for both group members and leaders could be retrieved if these issues were kept in mind. To summarize: A group is more likely to be successful if it is conducted in an organizational or institutional context in which other personnel, not directly involved with the group, nevertheless accept and support its aims and general procedures, and value its potential contribution to the shared goals of the organization or institution. A group is more likely to be effective if a consensus—which may be implicit—can be established within the group about its aims and procedures. Lack of clarity, persistent splits within the group, or identification of the leader as adversary, all work against the best interests of the group. Structural factors such as size, duration, composition, constancy of membership, and ratio of staff to members, influence the character and effectiveness of the group. A group which has lost its usefulness can and should be terminated or reconstituted with a different mandate",

      "abstract": "This chapter discusses the neuropsychology of problem solving. Problem solving encompasses a vast range of normal cognitive activity. At its most basic, the ability to problem solving requires the modulation and control of more fundamental or routine cognitive skills. The right skill has to be harnessed at the right time and changing between skills has to be flexible. Psychologists distinguish between two main ways in which the organization of cognitive skills is controlled: (1) habitual routines and (2) novel reorganization. Habitual well-established routines, such as the series of acts required to get from home to work in the morning, are thought to be established in memory. Like a computer program, the various component skills can be called up as and when the time is appropriate. This type of skill organization is not strictly problem solving. Problem solving comes into play when nonhabitual or novel patterns of behavior are initiated that require the reorganization of sets of established cognitive skills. The chapter discusses the following different aspects of problem solving: (1) focused attention, (2) higher-order inferences, (3) formulation of strategies, (4) flexibility, and (5) evaluation of the outcome.",

      "title": "Do versus Don’t: The Impact of Framing on Goal-Level Setting",
      "abstract": "Abstract The consumer behavior literature extensively studied the impact of goal setting on behavior and performance. However, much less is known about the antecedents of goal-level setting—consumers’ decision of whether to work out twice or three times per week. Consumers can decide how many goal-consistent activities to undertake (“goal-consistent decision frame”; such as exercising two days per week) or to forego (“goal-inconsistent decision frame”; such as not exercising five days per week). While objectively the same decision, we argue that these different frames impact consumers’ ambition. Making a decision to forego goal-consistent activities triggers negative, self-evaluative emotions and to compensate for these unfavorable self-evaluations, consumers set more ambitious goal levels. Across a variety of contexts, consumers are more ambitious when their focal decision is inconsistent with goal achievement. For instance, they decide to work out more often when they decide how many work-out sessions they would skip (vs. attend). The impact of goal-inconsistent decision framing is mitigated when the activity is less instrumental toward goal achievement, and when negative self-evaluative emotions are alleviated through self-affirmation.",

La especializacion precoz es un aspecto negativo presente hoy en dia en la iniciacion deportiva. Hace referencia a la practica deportiva concreta demasiado temprana. Lo que se debe buscar en la iniciacion es conservar y mejorar la salud del nino a traves de la actividad fisica, utilizando sus aptitudes, para lograr una mayor interaccion entre el cuerpo y el entorno. Esta, segun Gonzalez (1996) no es recomendable ya que puede producir algunos exitos deportivos precoces pero se acompana de una corta carrera deportiva, a veces con secuelas patologicas y alteraciones del desarrollo armonico por una actividad fisica que supera unos determinados limites de esfuerzo. Su utilizacion tiene diversos efectos negativos en el nino. Puede sentirse decepcionado y abandonar el deporte e, incluso, llegar a una frustracion cuando se da cuenta de que no va a ser posible llegar a la cima. Es importante, por lo tanto, una formacion deportiva completa del nino, para despues del periodo iniciativo pasar a una especializacion.",

Anxiety, fear, conflict, emotional tension, and mental problems will occur if people are not able to adapt to changing times and the demands of a new society. Individual mental problems are often caused by a failure to provide adequate coping mechanisms for long-term stress. One of them is difficulty thinking or experiencing illusions. Delusions can cause problems with verbal communication, such as unrealistic ideas, running out of ideas, loss of association, repetition of words, and poor eye contact.

      "title": "Managerial Supervision",
      "abstract": "Supervision is an important life skill with many applications, all of which involve the provision of helpful guidance to others. Guidance may come in the form of encouraging self-realization or the explanation of specific procedures. Generally, supervisory encounters involve one or two issues or their combination: counseling problems and coaching problems, broadly conceived. Counseling problems involve issues of attitude, more or less. Coaching problems involve issues of information. A supervisory framework includes the identification of stairs of supervisee competence: novice, beginner, competent, proficient, expert, master, and maestro (a master who can motivate others and blend the individual skills into a larger collective product) (Dreyfus &amp; Dreyfus, 1986). Each stair, or stage, has its own \"flow chart,\" where the complexity of tasks is matched by the level of competence. When the supervisee gets to 8/9 or 9/9, it is time to move to the next level. Supervisors need to know the six supervisory competencies: professional supervision (clinical/educational), managerial, supportive, career development, reflective supervision, and coaching. Being well supervised helps the supervisee be a better supervisor. There are several guidelines to follow to be a good supervisor: Consider what makes a supervisor “great” or a supervisor “awful” and apply what is learned to one’s supervisory practice. Organize each upcoming supervisory meeting and plan an agenda for it. It is helpful to be aware of “wicked problems” (which are multisided and complex, and often without simple resolution). Know the difference between professional work and emotion work, and between formal and informal managerial supervision. Finally, consider 19 common supervisory questions and suggestions.",

Reflective features, which provide opportunities to rehearse content, were relatively rare. Character action was typically nonsalient. The DVDs used speech only 24% of the time and failed to selectively use speakers, such as choosing a child over an adult for dialogue and narration, which garners slightly older children's visual attention. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Producers who claim that their programs are educational should pay more attention to how they transmit content. Most programs directed at infants and toddlers rely on perceptually salient features like rapid pacing and camera cuts, which may elicit attention and interest but are most likely very difficult for a young audience to understand.",

      "abstract": "When we measure social competence, the scores indicate that a person can become better and better just as in other school subjects such as history or geography. In general, these scores also give an actual picture of the sta tus and/or progress of the person’s social competence. However, it might be preferable to portray many of the dimensions of social competence as a continuum where the optimal level could be in the middle rather than at one of the ends. That is to say, soc ial initiatives could take place too often or too seldom, or a person could take others’ needs into consideration too little, but also too much, to the detriment of his or her own needs. This implies that the overall purpose in a training social and emotional learning program might at the same time involve training some participants to do less of something and others to do more. The present article reflects on different continua involved in social competence training and suggests that the facilitator needs to analyse the needs of each of the participants in a group and adapt the training program accordingly. The implica tions for conducting a program, composition of programs and for the training of fa cilitators are also discussed.",

El problema consiste en la baja eficiencia de los periodos de práctica y su impacto en el desarrollo de la técnica de ejecución. El objetivo de este trabajo fue explorar formas de hacer más eficientes los periodos de práctica del violín para mejorar la ejecución. Se realizó un ejercicio autorregulatorio durante las clases para recoger datos acerca de la habilidad de los estudiantes para identificar y resolver sus problemas y se complementó con un cuestionario para obtener datos acerca de la percepción de su propia habilidad atencional durante sus periodos de práctica individual. Los resultados mostraron que un porcentaje mayor de los participantes no eran conscientes de los procesos autorregulatorios. La concentración y el sostenimiento de la atención eran escasamente considerados por la mayoría y en muchos casos desconocían los factores que favorecen u obstaculizan la habilidad atencional. El análisis de resultados mostró que es necesario guiar la autorregulación, así como la atención de aquellos estudiantes que ignoraban dichos conceptos. La autorregulación como estrategia atencional para el aprendizaje, junto con metodologías pedagógicas activas, apoyadas con el uso de tecnologías, pueden elevar los niveles de atención de los estudiantes durante la práctica, reducir el tiempo que tardan en aprender las obras y contribuir al fortalecimiento de las habilidades técnicas de ejecución. La autorregulación influye en la habilidad atencional de los estudiantes de violín de nivel superior y tiene alcances en el aprendizaje.",

Play appears to have important implications for all areas of a child's psychological life, and it is a mistake to see it even in older children as a trivial, time-wasting activity. On the other hand, it is a mistake to lose sight of the fact that the purpose of play from the child's point of view is simple enjoyment. He does not consciously engage in play in order to find out how things work, or to try out adult roles, or to stimulate his imagination, or to do any of the other things that commentators over the years have claimed to identify in various aspect of this play. He plays because it is fun, and the learning that arises out of play is to him quite incidental. Even when he engages in so-called structured play (that is, play organized by the adult with the express intention of providing desirable learning experiences) it still appears to him as an essentially non-serious activity offered for his diversion.",

One expression of this is to treat travel as derived demand, i.e., participation in activities such as work, shop, and leisure motivate travel but travel could also be an activity as well (e.g., taking a drive). Time allocation is viewed as management of episodes (events defined by their starting time, duration, and ending time) and they are arranged in a sequence forming a pattern of behavior that can be distinguished from other patterns (a sequence of activities arranged in a chain/tour of episodes). These episodes and their chains are not independent and their interdependency is accounted for in the theoretical framework(s). For example, one can identify episodes that belong to a “project” such as prepare an evening meal for friends. This project includes a trip to a wholesale store and stay at the store, a trip to a gourmet grocery store and stay at the store, a variety of meal preparation tasks at home, arrival of the friends at home and so forth. More complex projects may focus on children education, career advancement, caring for older parents, and so forth.",

      "abstract": "Assessing the consequences of actions and events often requires comparing a mental stimulation of the world in which the action is present to one in which the action is absent. We propose that people perceive more impact when asked to assess whether an action would increase the likelihood or degree of a potential outcome (mental addition) than when asked whether it would reduce the probability or extent of a potential consequence (mental subtraction). This judgmental asymmetry occurs because people (a) give more weight to features of the particular mental stimulation (the action or its absence) serving as the subject of comparison and (b) give more weight to factors that produce as opposed to inhibit the relevant outcome. In 4 studies, Ss assessed the impact of personal actions (e.g., studying for an exam). Ss perceived more impact when the assessment was placed in an additive frame (e.g., \"how many more questions will you get right if you study?\") as opposed to a subtractive one (e.g., \"how many fewer will you get right if you do not study?\"). This effect was not influenced by the hedonic value of the event or by whether the S had actually experienced it. Discussion centers on the relevance of these results for the undoing of scenarios and causal attribution.",

      "abstract": "Context Talk refers to any conversation or dialogue that involves a dimension of diversity. Whether in the classroom, consulting room, or in supervision, the task of effectively and seamlessly integrating Context Talk into the process is often a challenging endeavor even for the most experienced Supervisor and/or Trainer. Most attempts to talk openly and candidly about virtually any dimension of diversity are frequently greeted with extreme caution and trepidation, unabashed avoidance, or conflict escalation. In any case, the results are usually the same: an absence of meaningful engagement involving Context Talk. The more Context Talk is avoided, the more difficult it is to develop the experience, comfort, and skill to have meaningful conversations. One of the principal reasons underlying the hesitancy or unwillingness to fully engage in Context Talk is the lack of \"know how\" or skill to do so. Like any other challenging topic, Context Talk requires possession of a well-honed skill set to ensure its relative success. Full and effective engagement in Context Talk requires participants to have some degree of mastery of both basic communication skills as well as a keen understanding of advanced Context Talk-related skills. Both are briefly highlighted below.",

      "title": "Inhibition and prefrontal lobe functioning in preterm and full-term infants",
      "abstract": "IntroductionInhibition involving inhibiting prepotent responses and resisting distraction or disruption by competing events, and flexibility of thinking reflects cognitive perspective (1,2). Barkley (2) conceptualised as three interrelated abilities:· The ability to inhibit a prepotent response from occurring. A prepotent response is a response which is established through reinforcement and is resistant to the changing circumstance. For example, in the situation where a choice must be made between two locations where a reward may be hidden, the prepotent response is established through reinforcement of one location (e.g., location A). When the reward is moved to a different location the subject is likely reaching back to the previously successful location. This is called an inability to inhibit a prepotent response. Prepotent responses may be elicited not only by external stimuli, but also by conditioned stimuli from the internal environment (i.e., thoughts, and emotions). Without the capacity to inhibit prepotent responses, new goals cannot be achieved and new learning will not take place.· The capacity to interrupt an ongoing sequence of behaviour. If the feedback from a series of responses indicates the ongoing behaviours are erroneous or ineffective, then this sequence of behaviour must be interrupted. Thus the individual must exhibit flexibility that allows ongoing behaviour to be altered quickly in response to the changing situation. This requires a degree of self-monitoring and an awareness of immediate past responses and their outcomes.· Interference control, the ability to inhibit responding to irrelevant interference or distraction while engaging in a task. Failure to do this leads to neglect of the relevant stimuli and increased attention to extraneous background stimuli. Thus distractibility, which is often a characteristic of children with attention deficit disorders, may be caused by inefficient response (2). The cognitive is different from social in studies of shy and socially inhibited children, in which the term inhibition refers to clinging, quiet, timid, shy and withdrawn behaviour (3-5).Difficulty with of a prepotent response: Patients with frontal lobe damage also frequently fail to inhibit or suppress inappropriate or untimely actions which interfere with goal-directed behaviour, because their attention is vulnerable to interference from both external stimuli and internal representations or prepotent responses. As Fuster (6) expressed it, interference can come from sensory stimuli that appear in the context of the behavioural structure and that, if not suppressed, can lead the behaviour away from its goal. The interference can also be seen in the form of internal tendencies, whether inborn or the product of learning. For example, it may be interference from instinctual impulses that, under certain conditions, prevail over current behaviour and disrupt it. Or, alternatively, the interference may come from well-established memories or patterns of behaviour that are appropriate in other circumstances but are an impediment to current behaviour and the achievement of the goal (6). Failure to inhibit a prepotent response is responsible for poor performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), in which the subject must keep in mind the criteria for sorting a set of visual figures and be prepared to shift criteria when the sorting criteria change (7,8).Difficulty in inhibiting distraction: Patients who have frontal lobe damage may be abnormally attracted by irrelevant stimuli, and be unable to resist the interference from stimuli that would normally be suppressed or ignored by adults who do not have frontal lobe damage (9,10). Thus, relevant stimuli appear to be neglected while attention to background or irrelevant stimuli is increased. This failure to suppress extraneous information is reminiscent of the disorder of interference control that animals which have orbital prefrontal lesions exhibit in structured tasks (11- 13). …",

Sometimes you just have to have a difficult conversation. These tips can make it a bit easier. Be prepared. Decide what information you will share and what information you want to keep private. Do you want to indicate that you have a “family issue” or “medical condition” and keep the details private, or do you want to share more specific information?

For manager the accentuation is an alar ming phenomenon, because not every accented person can be nominated for a leadin g position. In particular, it is difficult to imagine the head of police department as an excessively optimistic, frivolous person who feels no boundaries of permissible, heav ily tolerates criticism, rapidly experiences failure (hyperthymic type of accentuati on); as a persistent, self-confident, suspicious, person, who is not able to switch from one problem to another (sticking type of accentuation); a person, which is too good, soft -hearted, socially dependent, deeply experiencing the slightest trouble and does not seek to occupy a leading position (emotional type of accentuation); dogmatic, boring, meticulous, scrupulous with exaggerated accuracy, irritable person, prone to dou bt and excessively frequent inspection and impractical of the process of manage ment solutions performance (pedantic type of accentuation); modest person with i nternal strain and constant expectation of trouble, unable to defend his/her in terests, fearful, insecure in himself and his own abilities, thoughts, decisions (anxious-fea rful type of accentuation); a person with frequent mood changes and swings (cyclothymic type of accentuation); a person, which strives for recognition, adventure, attractin g attention, capable of deliberately fantasize, lie and manipulate (demonstrative type of accentuation); aggressive, rough, impulsive, stubborn, intolerant, conflict and unres trained person (excitable type of accentuation); prone to capture about a minor issue and despair as a result of frustration, feelings of polarity, distraction, pan ic, excessive talkativeness (affective- exalted type of accentuation); overly serious, depr essed, closed, frustrated person with the low self-esteem (dysthymic type of accentuation ). However, it is advisable to pay attention to the st rengths of the leaders with different accentuation that will certainly have a p ositive impact on their direct management professional activity, in particular: ac tivity, endurance, ability to build trust, communication, creative approach to the extr eme situations, willingness to take responsibility (hyperthymic type of accentuation); persistence in achieving goals, punctuality and commitment, attention to details, c ommitment to excellence (sticking type of accentuation); capacity for empathy and support, gratitude and humane expression of feelings (emotional type of accentuation); caring, responsibility, ability to check all details (pedantic type of accentuation); the abilit y to calculate their own strength and power of subordinates (anxious-fearful type accentu ation); activity, creativity and commitment to innovation (cyclothymic type of accen tuation); developed intuition, desire for non-standard solutions, capability to infect ot hers with ideas and views (demonstrative type of accentuation); to trust and b e committed to the people (excitable type of accentuation); morality, ability to see the real truth (affective-exalted type of accentuation); to have a cold mind, be resistant to the emotional impact, the ability to work a long time (dysthymic type of accentuation).",

      "title": "Factors of stress in oral translation",
      "abstract": "The article is dedicated to the analysis of stress factors that interpreters face in oral translation. Practical research and the results of the analysis of theoretical literature have shown that there are a number of factors in oral translation that affect the emotional-psychological state of the interpreter and the quality of the interpretation. The stress factors in oral translation are divided into psychophysiological, cognitive, emotional, organizational, and situational. Cognitive factors include the lack of clarity in the speech of the presenter/speaker; the complexity of the topic; the use of a large amount of phraseological units, slang, culture-marked units and realities, quotes, and proper names; accents and dialects; and inadequate preparation for the interpretation. A critical role is played by a high speaking pace, which does not allow the time for the information processing and affects the quality of the interpretation, as well as the “interpreter unfriendly” behavior of the speaker, who presents their speech quickly, without logical pauses, uses humor, sarcasm, pun, etc. Psychological and emotional factors include the fear of making mistakes, not knowing something, or being misunderstood; a sense of high responsibility and inflated expectations of oneself; the presence of a large audience and/or important individuals. Physiological and technical factors include the translator’s inadequate physical condition, problems with technical equipment (microphones, booths), poor sound quality, interference in the headphones, background noise, lack of breaks, emotional-physiological incompatibility with the colleague in the booth, and the overall microclimate in the audience. Organizational factors include insufficient interaction with colleagues, public criticism or corrections from them, poor organization of the event, changes in the translation format (from consecutive to simultaneous or vice versa), lastminute adjustments and changes, and uncertainty of the agenda. A special place among the already known stress factors is occupied by moral and ethical deviations, which cause ethical stress. It arises as a result of critical discrepancies between one person’s ethical values and the expected behavior patterns of another, which can lead to serious consequences or even professional burnout. A survey conducted among beginner interpreters showed that the main stress factors are lack of time for reflection, fear of making mistakes, high responsibility for the outcome, unfamiliar vocabulary, high expectations from the client/audience, technical difficulties, and poor physical health.",

      "abstract": "One important finding that the book, How People Learn, highlights is that all learning involves transfer from prior knowledge and previous experiences which can facilitate or impede learning. Learning can be facilitated by activating prior knowledge from an earlier class and/or context can be created for new material from previous experiences. Conversely, learning can be impeded by misconceptions that originate from personal experience, prior knowledge from previous classes, or inappropriate application of prior knowledge. Misconceptions from prior knowledge and previous experience can be classified according to their origin as a type of ¿impediment¿ to learning for which there are two general types, each with subtypes. Null impediment refers to missing information (necessary for learning new material) due to students: (1) not having prior knowledge (deficiency) or; (2) not recognizing links between new material and their prior existing knowledge (transfer). Substantive impediment refers to faulty concept models students hold from: (1) personal experience or observations (experiential); (2) prior courses and teaching (pedagogic) and; (3) bending or misinterpreting of new concepts to fit prior knowledge (misinterpretive). In this paper on research-to-practice we address the question of what learning strategies are most effective in repairing misconceptions or ¿impediments¿ of different origin.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of Individual and Group Life Skills Training on Shyness among Adolescents",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONShyness is a common but little-understood emotion. Shyness is not a mental disorder. Common sense indicates that Shyness is a behaviour pattern characterized by inhibition in some situations. Shyness may be defined experientially as discomfort and/or inhibition in interpersonal situations that interferes with pursuing one's interpersonal or professional goals. It is a form of excessive self-focus, a preoccupation with one's thoughts, feelings and physical reactions. Situational shyness involves experiencing the symptoms of shyness in specific social performance situations but not incorporating it into one's self-concept. Shyness reactions can occur at any or all of the following levels: cognitive, affective, physiological and behavioral, and may be triggered by a wide variety of arousal cues.According to various statistics, around 40 to 50 percent of the people (and sometimes more) are involved in shyness. Shyness leads to lowered self-esteem and decreased self concept (D'Souza, 2005), increased fear reactions among adolescents and college students (D'Souza et al., 2006; D'Souza, 2007), decreased levels of happiness (Sreeshakumar et al., 2007), increased maladjustment among college students (D'Souza, Ramaswamy, Rangaiah, 2008). It was also observed that shy adolescents require specific guidance in educational and social areas (D'Souza, Urs, and Jayaraju, 2008). Shyness is not just one or two symptoms but an all-encompassing collection of characteristic that manifests itself in the mind, body and behavior of shy people (D'Souza, 2005).Regarding large number of the shy students and relationship of shyness with other various problems like anxiety and depression and its negative influence, applying effective methods to reduce shyness seemed to be necessary. The lack of such method will increase the negative effects on shy students especially on their personality and social communication. The key to converting shyness into something positive is to develop life skills that will diminish the effect or impact of such a feeling or condition in our life. The present study adopted Individual and Group Life Skills training to reduce the shyness among adolescents.METHODParticipantsParticipants were selected through screening of more than 500 adolescents for shyness. Only those adolescents who had high levels of shyness were considered for the present study. The researcher selected 96 shy adolescent students and divided them into 3 groups (32 each), LSTI and LSTG and control group and in each group there were equal number of male and female adolescents were randomly distributed.MEASURESShyness Assessment Test (D'Souza, 2006).The shyness assessment test for adolscents was developed by D'Souza (2006) of University of Mysore. It consists of 54 items and requires the subject to indicate his/her response by marking Yes, or No. or can't say. The items in the test pertain to three domains of shyness- Cognitive/Affective, Physiological and Action oriented. The reliability index ascertained by split half (odd-even) method and Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the scale as a whole were found to be 0.735 and 0.812 respectively.PROCEDUREThe entire procedure consisted of 3 phases: Screening/Pre test, LST Intervention and Post test.Phase IScreening/pre test: In the first phase, the researcher administered the shyness assessment test to a large sample (more than 500). Only those participants who had high degree of shyness and had shown willingness to the investigation were selected for the study. The main author selected 96 adolescents having high degree of shyness (81 and above), 48 boys and 48 girls. Further, those 96 students were randomly divided LSTI and LSTG and control group.Phase IILST Intervention: After the selection, treatment was given to subjects (individually and group) for 8 session for 60 days. After the introduction, the researcher explained about the LST programme. …",

      "abstract": "Individuals do not all come to tasks, activities, or assignments with the same readiness to engage. Differences in the ability to focus, comprehend, or problem-solve can lead to inequalities of outcome and make learners less likely to realize their potential. Given that interest development supports persistence, conscientiousness, and the ability to work with negative feedback, educators and policymakers could help to increase educational opportunity for all by promoting the development of interest. Interest is a cognitive and motivational variable that describes (a) engagement, or participation, with some content (such as physics, writing, or baseball) and also (b) the motivation to continue to seek opportunities to engage with that content: seeking information, posing questions, and tackling challenge. Interest works because the information search it creates is rewarding. The development of interest heightens understanding and sustains engaged work. It also positively influences outcomes such as performance and continued enrollment. Even the development of a little interest can make a difference. Educators and policymakers can enhance educational opportunities by promoting interest development. Methods are described.",

      "title": "Prevention and Treatment of Suicidal Behaviour",
      "abstract": "Making any choice creates in us a sense of being vulnerable. With each decision, we lose all the other choices that we did not make. What about the decision to die? Regardless of the cause of suicidal gestures or attempts, the individuals involved usually feel an intense sense of anxiety. One of the reasons is that deciding to die involves no further choices after that. It cannot be undone and people that have reached operational stages of thinking know that. In children, however, suicidality is more dangerous, as they have no or a limited sense of the irreversibility of dying.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the successful acts of suicide are carefully planned in advance. It has been described as a process in which the persons develop suicidal thoughts without a plan but rather a passive desire to “not wake up.” Most often, this ideation disappears for a time or leads to one or several plans regarding the means to be used. This stage can lead to acquiring the means to accomplish this task. It can last for months (e.g., storing months’ worth of prescribed medication). In the time leading up to the act, many individuals go through a testing phase, mainly designed to decrease their anxiety (playing with the gun initially, cocking the gun without ammunition, buying the bullets, and loading the weapon, etc.). This interval often provides a prolonged window of time during which the individual can be identified as at risk by friends or physicians. This progression also might lead to reduction in anxiety about the final act. For example, some Golden Gate Bridge survivors did not report any anxiety symptoms as they fell, but others “changed their mind” about the act of dying.1\r\n\r\nIn light of the above conceptualization, we can hypothesize that the anxiety of “final choice” occasionally helps overturn the desire to die in some patients, at least for the time necessary to seek help. During this time, those caring for an individual at risk need to assure that the person is observed carefully to promote safety, assess protective and contributory factors, and develop a plan to anticipate and manage future attempts.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, even with our best efforts, the rate of completed suicide is high in those who have had a previous attempt. Those in whom thoughts of suicide recur are not “exploring new ground” anymore. They have been there before. We have limited information since patients are often secretive about these thoughts and hide them even from close family and friends. The risk of suicide is highest after hospital discharge in psychiatric patients, particularly if there is a change in provider at the time of discharge. Proposed explanations include that patients return to the same environment that caused their suicidal symptoms, perceive loss of the supports available during hospitalization, perceive a sense of shame about being hospitalized, and perceive “inadequacy.” Therefore, immediate follow-up and close coordination between psychiatric and primary care services are necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the book, Prevention and Treatment of Suicidal Behaviour: From Science to Practice, the editor has assembled a series of thought-provoking chapters exploring these phenomena and describes the related research data. He integrates new hypotheses and outlines future directions for research in a well-rounded structure. The authors discuss the devastating and long-lasting effects of suicidal acts not only as a burden to society but also on relatives, friends, and workmates. The book overall provides a balanced perspective on suicidal behavior without being too general or too specific, and without being too lengthy or too limited for use by a busy clinician.\r\n\r\nThe first 6 chapters introduce the epidemiologic evidence from several large studies, carefully considering the time trends and the geographic differences in completed suicide. This gives the authors the opportunity to introduce several hypotheses and prevention measures (e.g., national policies controlling access to the most common lethal means of suicide resulting directly in decreased suicide rates).\r\n\r\nIs suicide a phenomenon in its own right or is it a secondary product of another illness? In the following chapters, the authors look at suicide from a different perspective. To deconstruct this phenomenon, the authors take a step back in Chapter 7, looking at the predictive value of the interplay of genes and environment. In Chapter 8, the emphasis is on traumatic stress and suicidal behavior, and in Chapter 9, the authors introduce a broad view of prevention.\r\n\r\nWith this overview, the remaining chapters present data regarding other risk factors for suicidal behavior and paired suggestions for treatment and prevention. Many factors are important when discussing this phenomenon (e.g., access to means, influence of the media, and lasting effects on survivors). The approach to these concepts makes the book easy to read and understand, giving this book a particular elegance.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the editor has assembled a cohesive text, easy to follow and well documented, which could be a valuable resource for practitioners and researchers working with suicidal patients.\r\n\r\nHistorically, the fascination of death has been around for centuries. Freud's perspective is that the death drive is an urge of living things to restore the earlier state of things.2 How much more do we now understand about suicide compared with 100 years ago? As long as there still are patients completing suicide, certainly not enough.\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert G. Bota, M.D.\r\n\r\nUniversity of Missouri, Kansas City, Missouri",

      "abstract": "Empirical studies in visualisation often compare visual representations to identify the most effective visualisation for a particular visual judgement or decision making task. However, the effectiveness of a visualisation may be intrinsically related to, and difficult to distinguish from, individual-level factors such as visualisation literacy. Complicating matters further, visualisation literacy itself is not a singular intrinsic quality, but can be a result of several distinct challenges that a viewer encounters when performing a task with a visualisation. In this paper, we describe how such challenges apply to experiments that we use to evaluate visualisations, and discuss a set of considerations for designing studies in the future. Finally, we argue that aspects of the study design that are often neglected or overlooked (such as the onboarding of participants, tutorials, training, etc.) can have a big role in the results of a study and can potentially impact the conclusions that the researchers can draw from the study.",

Most questions arise because a student's stage of development does not yet allow him or her to answer those questions: For instance, “How do I know when I have a category?” and later, “a core category?” Other questions arise because students are plagued by lingering doubts about the validity or efficacy of grounded theory (and qualitative analysis generally), having been schooled or partly sold on quantitative methods. Hence, questions are raised about sampling, reliability, and so on. Associated questions pertain to how to convince others who are committed to quantitative methods about the validity or reliability of the qualitative methodology that the students are learning. Other questions stem from puzzlement about some procedures, like converting questions of psychological motivation into sociological questions and analysis. And understandably, there are still other sets of queries about how to write up the results of analysis for publication or speech making.",

      "abstract": "Numerous studies indicate that communAtion apprehension can and does have considerable negative consequences for college students so affected. There are strategies that can be undertaken in the classroom that may help alleviate communication apprehension for some students. Classroom instructors must first recognize how students are processinc: their own communication apprehension. Basically, students will either be apprehensive or not, and will possess adequate performance abilities or not. The first general strategy is visualization which combines systematic desensitization and positive thinking. The second strategy is skills training. In-class activities designed to address students' skills deficiencies should be selected based on relevancy of those skills to the immediate task. Commonly used approaches based in oral communication skills training which address communication apprehension include social/conversational skills training, assertiveness training, rhetoritherapy, and oral interpretation/aesthetic performance skills training. Four criteria for appropriate classroom activities for remediation of communication apprehension are: (1) relevancy; (2) appropriate comfort level; (3) whole class involvement; and (4) some non-graded activities. If these intervention strategies are undertaken with enthusiasm and caution, some measure of successful reduction of students' communication apprehension likely will be realized.

      "abstract": "This article presents a framework, based on directed forgetting and social judgment research, for understanding compliance with overt instructions to disregard particular information. The success of intentional forgetting depends on how one originally encoded the to-be-forgotten information, the scope of the forget instruction, and the type of retrieval task done later. Memory-based processes of segregation and retrieval inhibition can lead to successful forgetting when subjects may forget all of the prior information. However, they are insufficient when subjects must forget only part of it. In this case, one «forgets» (i.e., limits expression of forget-cued information) by altering one's decision processes later. Successful intentional forgetting occurs only when one intentionally retrieves information from a particular learning episode, not when the task does not expressly require this (e.g. implicit memory tasks)",

Four experiments support this karmic-investment hypothesis. When people want an outcome over which they have little control, their donations of time and money increase (experiments 1 and 2), but their participation in other rewarding activities does not (experiment 1b). In addition, at a job fair, job seekers who feel the process is outside (vs. within) their control make more generous pledges to charities (experiment 3). Finally, karmic investments increase optimism about a desired outcome (experiment 4). We conclude by discussing the role of personal control and magical beliefs in this phenomenon.",

Once these unethical administrators succeed in framing a faculty victim as a target (often through innuendo, factual distortions, or outright lies), the victim's colleagues—many of whom have known and benefited from the victim for years—either fail to support the victim (a problem known as passive evil) or begin actively participating in the persecution themselves (often in pursuit of personal gain). The purpose of this chapter is to focus on the first instance (i.e., passive evil), and to discuss how passive evildoers' failure to stand up for victims of downward academic mobbing effectively encourages future acts of persecution—including against the passive evildoers themselves.",

Such thinking achieves its goals due to the fact that, along with the properties and nature of the object, as well as the peculiarities of the action situation, its conditions, as well as the means of implementation available in this case, are taken as the conditions of the task. The following psychological features are characteristic of practical thinking: observation, the ability to quickly move from thinking to action and back, the ability to see a problem, since the very formulation of a problem is an act of thinking that often requires a lot of hard work. Practical thinking is determined by such psychodynamic determinants as motivation - a set of psychological processes that direct human behavior (at high levels of development, future law enforcement officers are motivated to succeed); an attitude is an individual's tendency to a certain form of response, with the help of which this or that need can be satisfied; representative systems (auditory, visual, kinesthetic), the auditory sensory modality prevails in the subjects, which is expressed in the perception of information by ear and better memorization. All these psychodynamic determinants affect the development of practical thinking of future law enforcement officers.

      "title": "Prospects for the professional and personal development of the penal system leaders reserve of the Russian Federation as a factor in the prevention of malfeasance",
      "abstract": "The effectiveness of penitentiary activities, assuming the authoritarianism of the management system, is largely determined by the individual and personal characteristics of unit heads of the penal system, who need to show their managerial abilities as fully as possible, but not every leader has a sufficient amount of such abilities. If he/she does, he/she cannot always demonstrate them to the fullest extent. In this case, there can be serious miscalculations, leading to certain socio-psychological and criminological consequences. Among them, the instability of the socio-psychological climate in a team, provoking a high employee turnover, which does not allow forming the key personnel of a unit, as well as a high risk that subordinate employees, projecting the style, manner of communication and affects of the management, begin to show socially disapproving and even self-destructive forms of behavior, such as various forms of aggression towards oneself and others, neglect of safety requirements at work and in everyday life, unlawful actions against convicts, etc. One of the most important factors in the prevention of these phenomena is the system of work with a personnel reserve for managerial positions. The arsenal of diagnostic tools for the study of 65 employees working in the penal system, who are middle managers in the personnel reserve, included a set of methods: a) analysis of documents; b) expert assessment of the employee’s personality; c) psychological testing, which allows obtaining a generalized psychological profile of a personality according to the estimates of five “traits of an adequate personality”, motivators of socio-psychological activity, the style of behavior self-regulation, levels of legal consciousness and faith in people, as well as self-assessment of professional development opportunities and career prospects. The generalized characteristics of the respondents show that 88% of them meet the requirements for penitentiary activities. The respondents have an average level of emotional intelligence development with a tendency to lower; their style of behavior self-regulation is accentuated due to their relatively poorly developed independence; 95% of respondents have a high and medium level of legal consciousness development; 70% of them are distinguished by their distrust of people; the leading motivator of their socio-psychological activity is success achievement. All surveyed employees see opportunities for their professional development, although about 30% of them have concerns about promotion opportunities in this system. Based on the results obtained, the resources of success and the four most important areas of work with the personnel reserve were identified.",

In Chapter 3 we examined how teachers can observe their own classrooms. In this chapter the focus is on observing another teacher's classroom and what two teachers can gain through observing each other's teaching. In our experience, many teachers have a negative reaction to the idea of someone observing their classes. For many, “observation” calls to mind a coordinator or visitor coming to a classroom to carry out a supervisory or evaluative observation as part of the process of performance appraisal. Observation tends to be identified with evaluation, and consequently it is often regarded as a threatening or negative experience.Williams (1989, p. 86) has summed up some of the problems of traditional classroom observations:",

      "abstract": "It is important to ask to what degree does a given undergraduate curriculum either reinforce impeding myths and misconceptions about computing or work to dismantle them. Particular focus should be placed on motivating examples and programming projects throughout the curriculum, with special focus on the introductory courses. Students' perceptions about computing, if they have a realistic opinion regarding computing at all, is strongly correlated with the programming projects they or their peers have worked on. Is computing seen as boring (duck counting), not serious (games), or maybe solely focused on business/commerce?",

      "abstract": "La plupart des formations mettent l'accent sur l'ecoute des patients et de leurs proches et l'analyse de leurs besoins. Or l'epuisement des soignants et son corollaire l'absenteisme ou les departs prematures a la retraite deviennent un probleme majeur. Un autre symptome est l'agressivite, temoin de nombreux manques chez les soignants : manque d'attention, de reconnaissance. Les batteries sont a plat, et nul ne peut donner au long cours sans recevoir. Prendre en compte les besoins des soignants est donc tout aussi important que de prendre soin de ceux des patients. C'est la premiere chose dont la Communication NonViolente, ou Communication Empathique m'a fait prendre conscience. Developpee par Marshall Rosenberg (1), il s'agit d'une demarche fondee sur la prise de conscience de ce qui facilite ou entrave la communication. Elle met l'accent sur l'ecoute de ce qui se passe en soi instant par instant avant de s'exprimer ou d'aller vers l'autre. Le deuxieme apport de la CNV est de desamorcer l'agressivite, de decoder ce que l'autre veut vraiment dire derriere des propos ou attitudes percues de prime abord comme agressives ou deplaisantes. Developper une attitude empathique permet d'economiser beaucoup d'energie et de rendre les relations plus nourrissantes. Le troisieme benefice de la pratique CNV est de renforcer la cohesion et la solidarite au sein des equipes, afin que celles ci deviennent un lieu de ressourcement et non d'usure. La demarche de la CNV sera presentee de maniere interactive a partir de cas concrets.",

Une analyse des interactions montre comment les interventions du maître tendent, en forçant des interprétations, à la réduction du nouveau ou du différent, au même, au déjà collationné. Une seconde analyse, pédagogico-didactique, révèle que le maître privilégie les résultats concrets obtenus par l’application d’une règle au détriment de la formulation même de la règle. Or il arrive qu’une stratégie «heureuse » amène des résultats douteux, comme il arrive qu’une mauvaise en amène de bons. C’est le cas dans la séquence considérée. En délaissant les formulations d’un groupe, le maître, pressé par le temps et le but, exhausse pour la classe entière les résultats d’un autre reposant pourtant sur une pratique morphologique douteuse.

      "abstract": "The prognostic assessment of a patient aims to pre­dict the future, using the range of evidence available. This evidence relates to: … ● the individual patient (e.g. their own history of illness, and their compliance with medication); ● groups of patients like the individual patient, that is, diagnostic and subdiagnostic groups (e.g. in depressive disorder, the risk of recurrence; and in anorexia nervosa, the risk of suicide or of death by starvation); ● psychiatric patients in general (e.g. the importance of good relationships with healthcare professionals, supportive family and friends, and insight into illness). … Prognostic assessment results in an understanding of the following: … ● What outcomes are likely to happen? Relevant outcomes can be related to the illness (relapse and recurrence, for example— see ‘Terminology’ for definitions), to treatments (such as side effects or complications), to risks (to self, to others— see Chapter 7), or to important social outcomes (such as return to work, marital break- up, or permission to drive a car, bus, or lorry). ● How likely are they to happen, and when/ over what time period? An estimate of both likelihood and timeline is helpful. So, for example, in a patient with recurrent depressive episodes, who is now well, we may view that their lifetime risk of suicide is significantly higher than the population risk, that they are not currently at increased risk, and that suicide attempts are likely to occur in the context of depressive recurrence. ● What can change the nature or likelihood of the outcomes? For example, in the case just mentioned, we may view that the lifetime risk of recurrence can be reduced by training the patient and family to spot the early warning signs of illness, by reducing daily consumption of alcohol, and by finding regular, stable employment. In addition, we can reduce suicidal risk by ensuring that the patient is prescribed medicines that are relatively safe in overdose (e.g. SSRI antidepressants rather than tricyclics), and by making family members aware of the risk of their own medication being used in an overdose.",

      "abstract": "Jealousy is a common phenomenon and accompanies man in each period of his life. The adult man, despite his well-developed consciousness and ability to de-centrate, i.e. perceiving various events and situations from different points of view, other people included, is incapable of eliminating jealousy from the repertoire of his emotions. Jealousy affects the quality of man's skill to regulate his relations with the surrounding world and is a cause of a great number of complicated behaviors. If it occurs with low intensity, it can become a constructive force of activity; however, when it grows beyond certain limits, it disrupts the course of interpersonal relations. It has been assumed that jealousy is a feeling of uneasiness, often in the form of sadness, anger, aggression, which is induced by a fear of losing something or someone (feelings, faithfulness, love, trust, partner), as well as perception of success that is achieved by others in various interpersonal relations, and which results from different factors. It can also stem from noticing differences in the state of possessing (things, features of character), irrespective of whether it is an effect of real evaluation of events or comes in consequence of imagined, or even falsified, representations. This, in turn, gives rise to the appearance of desired, as well as destructive behaviors. Jealousy becomes exposed the strongest in relationships between partners, mainly in marriage. Its intensity and the manner of functioning of jealous people are conditioned by many factors (among others, awareness, culture of the environment, psychic disorders), yet - to a considerable extent - they depend on the individual's personality.",

It is a specific case of self-efficacy, i.e., “beliefs in one’s capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to produce given attainments” (Bandura, 1997, p. 2), directed toward the teacher as an agent of student achievement. Teacher efficacy influences behavior through cognitive processes (especially goal setting), motivational processes (especially attributions for success and failure), affective processes (especially control of negative feelings), and selection processes (Bandura, 1993; 1997). Teachers who believe they will be successful set higher goals for themselves and their students, try harder to achieve those goals, and persist through obstacles. Individuals who believe they will fail avoid expending effort because failure after trying hard threatens self-esteem. Self-efficacy is situational; it is not a generalized expectancy.

      "abstract": "The infant's participation in sequences of joint activity that require visual attention, or what is often called joint attention (e.g., gaze following, social referencing, pointing), is usually argued to be an outcome of and evidence for the existence of particular psychological competencies on the part of the infant. This convergence in opinion occurs, I contend, because social developmental theory is predicated in large part on a causal-psychological-representational picture of meaning and mind. In a review of the relevant literature I suggest that what is presupposed or at least underappreciated in most theories of joint attention is the role of social practice in the understanding of other minds. Rather than assuming that these joint activities requiring attention reveal psychological competencies, I argue that: (a) it is with recourse to such practices that researchers theorize about the infant's understanding of mind in the first instance, (b) the mind is not some entity that is separable from human activity, (c) knowledge of such practices is what the developing agent requires to come to an understanding of other minds, and (d) because non-language using agents do not understand mental states, young babies, a fortiori, do not understand their own attention or that of others. I then focus on a single infant activity typically thought to reveal a leg hold on other minds (i.e., pointing) and I report two empirical studies of its development. In the first I evaluate theories of the emergence of pointing by investigating the ways in which infants first get into shared activities involving pointing. In the second I investigate the development of pointing within mother-infant interaction. In neither study do I find support for the position that pointing gestures emerge as a result of some conceptual revolution on the part of the infant.",

It involves a prolonged exposure to workplace stressors that often drain an employee's vitality and enthusiasm, and lead to less engagement and productivity. Burnout increases turnover rates and absenteeism; causes decreased performance, workplace accidents and poor customer service; and sometimes leads to litigation. It also threatens the integrity and professionalism of an individual. Emotional labor—sometimes referred to as \"emotion work\" or \"emotion management\"—contributes heavily to the burnout factor by forcing an employee to control his or her feelings in order to fulfill the goals or expectations of an organization.

An essential characteristic of delaying is the acknowledgement of the individual that this delay has some negative aspects. As a result, this delay can be seen as an irrational behavior- the delay of certain intentional actions, realizing that this is in his/her disadvantage. This delay in behavior is observed in at least two ways. Primarily, during the implementation of the action, the person can deviate to an alternative action and even more tempting, delaying intentionally in an indirect way the initial plan. Secondly, from a long-term perspective, the negative consequences of such a deviation become visible, for example, when people postpone the visit to the doctor until the treatment is no longer an option or postpone the initiation of personal plans. In a longitudinal study, it was proven that the students that delay at beginning of the semester have created a stress free, pleasant situation, experiment that these gains are just for short term and have big costs in long term at the end of the semester.",

      "title": "Why Leadership Falters in Critical Moments: Emotions and the Impact on Cognitive Abilities",
      "abstract": "This study looks at the impact of emotions on the cognitive ability of the leader to manage himself/herself under stress. The findings show that emotions have a notable impact on the cognitive performance of an individual. Further findings reveal that physical senses; what you see, hear, feel, taste and smell; are strong triggers in activating emotions. When emotions are triggered, cognitive ability is disabled and an automatic knee-jerk reaction occurs from the individual’s subconscious programming; based on the individual’s perception and belief system that surrounds the incident or event. The study also indicates subconscious programming; i.e. beliefs and perceptions come from repeated past experiences, types of movies watched, songs listened to or books read. This research will shed light on why leaders can’t practice the learnings from leadership and management courses, especially under stress. The ability to manage emotions determines whether the manager goes into an automatic reaction, where cognitive abilities are shut down and the manager acts out from his/her subconscious programming or the cognitive ability kicks in, and the manager can access and apply the newly learned information, eventually creating new habit patterns, resulting in the application of the knowledge learned. Further, this paper presents a methodical approach to managing emotions called SIEP; abbreviated for Spirit, Intellect, Emotions and Physical Senses; the conceptual model and its effectiveness in managing emotions, amongst entrepreneurs in a social business incubator, called ET Ideas in Malaysia.",

Students, who find 5-6 hrs. study a really tedious task, can study for 10-12 hrs. at a stretch with better concentration during exam days. But the prolonged stress is likely to reduce the efficiency of a person. Adolescence is the age of stress and storm. Rapid body changes and heightened emotionality characterize this stage of human development. And when the adolescents face additional stress in their family, school and social environment, what is the combined effect of all this psychological distress? Does it influence their working ability? The Critical Success Factors that affect the Budding Managers are stressors encountered handling and managing the various stressors in optimal manner. It evokes many hazards generated due to academic stress on psychological level, physical level and social level. The unmanaged stress can lead to fatigue, sleep disorders, eating disorders and other unhealthy symptoms. The present study was carried out to know if any relationship exists between mental stress and academic performance of Budding Managers. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY WERE: 1) To review some of the common stressors responsible for academic stress 2) To examine the relationship between mental stress and academic performance on Management Students. Against this backdrop this study reveals the development of various coping strategies for managing academic stress like keeping track of how to use the time effectively, elimination of the ways of wasting time and non critical events, the focus on importance of forward planning , the focus on importance on self organization, communication of problems with trusted people , frustration release through intense activities , prioritizing the important activities and regular exercise , meditation , relaxation by support groups.

      "title": "Social preferences and emotions as regulators of behavior in processes⋆",
      "abstract": "Abstract Behavior is driven not only by individual “(economically) rational” deliberation, but also by shortcuts (decision biases) and by social preferences (the achievement of status, reciprocal relationships, and group identity). An important aspect of these behavioral drivers is that they may operate (at least in part) through emotions. Emotions influence behavior in ways that are relevant to performance in processes; for example, anger prompts employees to refuse cooperation, fear inhibits workers’ willingness to take initiatives (for example, in continuous improvement), and shame motivates them to change behavior. This study provides experimental evidence that the social preferences systematically trigger emotions. This happens not “linearly” (more achievement of a social preference might be expected to cause more positive emotions), but rather in more complex patterns that regulate social relationships. Arbitrary (but earned) status signals trigger pride, while status achievement from being lucky does not. An externally (not by an own fault) caused status loss triggers anger and disgust. Not receiving cooperation by another person triggers anger, but more so if the cooperation failure violates a reciprocity expectation; the happiness form receiving cooperation by another person is attenuated by guilt and sadness is the subject itself has previously refused cooperation to the other person. Events happening to salient in‐group members trigger emotions as if they happened to subjects directly, including if the in‐group member behaves in an embarrassing way. These results are relevant for front‐line managers because they help predicting and interpreting emotional reactions of employees: awarding or withholding status, offering or demanding reciprocity, and the creation of in‐groups have emotional effects that depend on the context in predictable ways. Our results also contribute to theory by connecting literatures on emotions, decision making, and behavioral operations.",

      "abstract": "The work environment can be considered one of the main determining factors that can influence the mental health of workers, especially as regards the structural and organisational conditions to which the worker is subjected. This work environment has positive effects when work provides satisfaction and contributes to personal self-fulfilment, or negative effects provoked by situations of stress, inadequate working patterns and schedules, possible situations of abuse and/or harassment, etc., which may contribute to the appearance of alterations in the mental health of the worker. Therefore, it is crucial that organisations use strategies for mental health promotion and disease prevention in the workplace, as mental health problems arising from work represent a major burden of disease for society and the economy of a country. Stress can be considered one of the main factors capable of disrupting a person's mental health and determining the development of a mental disorder, but other individual, socio-cultural, organisational, biological, and environmental factors also play a role to a greater or lesser extent. A negative work situation can trigger the development of serious mental disorders such as psychotic, neurotic, or cognitive disorders, as well as those derived from work-related stress and psychoactive substance abuse, and self-injurious behaviours. For early detection, treatment, reintegration, and/or rehabilitation, coordination between the public health system and occupational health or occupational risk prevention services is necessary.El entorno laboral puede ser considerado uno de los principales factores determinantes que puede influir en la salud mental de las personas trabajadoras, especialmente relacionados con las condiciones estructurales y organizativas a las que está sometida la persona trabajadora. Este entorno laboral proporciona efectos positivos cuando el trabajo aporta satisfacción y contribuye a la autorrealización personal, o negativos, por situaciones de estrés, por ritmos y horarios de trabajo inadecuados, por posibles situaciones de abuso y/o acoso, etc., pudiendo contribuir en la aparición de alteraciones en la salud mental de la persona trabajadora. A este respecto, es de vital importancia que las organizaciones recurran a estrategias de promoción de la salud mental y prevención de la enfermedad en los lugares de trabajo, de hecho, los problemas de salud mental derivados del trabajo representan una importante carga de enfermedad para la sociedad y la economía de un país. El estrés puede ser considerado uno de los factores capitales capaces de perturbar la salud mental de una persona, y determinar el desarrollo de un trastorno mental pero, existen otros factores individuales, factores socioculturales y organizativos, biológicos y ambientales que también influyen en mayor o en menor medida. Una situación laboral negativa puede desencadenar el desarrollo de trastornos mentales graves como pueden ser trastornos psicóticos, trastornos neuróticos, trastornos cognitivos, trastornos derivados del estrés laboral, trastornos por abuso de sustancias psicoactivas y trastornos autolíticos. Para su detección precoz, tratamiento, reinserción y/o rehabilitación se hace necesaria la coordinación entre el sistema de salud público y los servicios de salud laboral o de prevención de riesgos laborales.",

Nonverbal communication is a type of communication that is frequently used in a professional sport team: technical sessions, trainings or official matches. The role of nonverbal communication is to help the understanding of verbalized notions expressed with the help of verbal communication and sometimes, to replace totally verbal communication. Can be noted in the advantages chapter the following ideas: short time of communication, the possibility of providing a greater amount of information’s in a shorter time and a much better understanding of the message from the receiver in the case of existence of disturbing factors (the music from the stadium or the crowd). According to prof. Cristian Radu, we can receive messages through nonverbal communication by studying elements such as: paraverbal communication (the timbre and intensity of a coach/player’s voice or the pauses or speech defects of an athlete), clothes (can underline aspects like the importance of the event or it can show us how much a coach/player cares about his image, mimicry and facial expressions can show us the intensity of the moment (technical instructions of coaches during the match).",

A successfully organized listening class which normally involves a wide range of pre-listening, while-listening and post-listening activities results in successful speaking and writing. However, listening activities require not only concentration, vocabulary and background knowledge, but some mental processes such as short-term and long-term memories. Two different kinds of processes are also involved in understanding spoken discourse – bottom-up and top-down processing. When designing tasks we should not demand that our students remember more details than a native speaker would in a real life situation.",

      "title": "Learning Principles and Behavioural Modifications",
      "abstract": "Problem behaviour often relates to clusters or degrees of behaviours, emotional states and cognitions, which the owner finds problematic (see Chapter 7). Training and behaviour therapy involve using controlled interactions and structuring of the environment to bring about change in either the motivational (specific goal) or emotional (appraisal and subsequent strategic focus) basis to the problem behaviour. Depending on the nature of the problem, it may be more efficient to focus on either the motivational or emotional element. For example, if a dog presents with food guarding and it can be established that the behaviour is limited to this particular context, then it might be hypothesized that the dog is specifically motivated to protect food for some reason (there are both potential diseases and learned reasons why this might be the case). However, if it is established that the dog is more generally protective of resources, and possibly also has broader issues associated with intrusion into its personal space (including territory), it might be indicative of a more general problem with frustration. In the former case, managing the specific factors leading\r\nto a motivation to protect food may be more efficient; however, in the latter case, rather than seeking to address each context as a separate problem, focusing on treatment to reduce the tendency for frustration might be more efficient. This chapter considers how managing contingencies within the social and physical environment can be used to bring about predictable changes in behaviour to support the management of a range of problems. Rather than approach this issue from a‘theory first, application second’ perspective, which is commonly used in many other texts (e.g. Horwitz and Mills, 2009; McGreevy and Boakes, 2007; Ramirez, 1999), the chapter is structured along the lines of considering first those practices and practical outcomes that alter the specific motivation for a behaviour (which underpins traditional training practice), and then considering how more general changes in behaviour can be brought about through\r\nthe control of emotional arousal and executive function (see Section 7.4 – Executive control of behaviour and emotion). We introduce technical terminology and theoretical concepts on an as-needed basis to make the chapter more accessible to those without a learning theory background. For those seeking more information on theory, we suggest the texts cited above.",

The instrument consists of two steps, whereby the first step can be used on its own. Step one: Detection of visibility of path dependencies/influences in the material analyzed in general. The guiding question is whether the material in question (teaching material, curriculum, educational policy document, transcript of an interview with the teacher, recording of a lesson, etc.) can be considered to be (influenced) or produced by a postsocialist/post-authoritarian path dependency. Step two: In part, the instrument allows for detection of the modality of path-influences and answers the question of whether the path dependency detected should understood as continuity, as a break or as a specific post-space within which continuities or discontinuities are not yet defined.

Problems associated with this position include poorly defined objectives and role; lack of training for the job; a marginal position at the interface of groups that at times are in conflict, leading to situations of divided loyalties and unrealistic performance expectations. Qualities seen as desirable in a chief resident have been discussed. In addition to the usual personal qualities which command respect these include organizing ability, leadership potential, mediation skills, the capacity for self direction and humour. Factors which make the position attractive and factors relevant to appropriate evaluation are considered. To improve the performance and job satisfaction of chief residents, the following points are suggested: • The expectations related to the position should be clarified in terms of specific objectives when the candidate is selected or elected. • Whom he reports to and whom he works for should be clear. • Before, or soon after, assuming office the chief resident should have exposure to teaching or supervision in group dynamics, consultation skills and mental health administration.",

The tool contains three elements of execution in one place: the priorities one needs to focus on, the progress and outcome measures associated with these priorities, and accountability for accomplishing the work. Crazy-busy types of activities can dilute one's focus and distract him from his execution targets. In essence, these activities (planning, doing admin work, scheduling, and so on) help to manage the job and are significantly different than interacting with others to get things done. As a leader, one must demonstrate accountability himself and expect it of his team members and others in the organization. This takes consistency and focus. In particular, one must be transparent in setting and tracking measures, and vocal about accomplishing priorities.",

      "abstract": "The minimum effort coordination game uncovers the prevalence of a major economic problem, coordination failure. Involved in a game of imperfect information that displays a number of Pareto ranked equilibria, players (in laboratory experiments) do not choose the efficient, but the inefficient but safe equilibrium. From various experimental papers, it is known that this problem disappears if the groups playing the game are very small or if the game is played by several groups that compete against each other for a bonus. Yet, up to now, there is no attempt to explain these findings in the framework of a theoretical, behavioral model. There are several experimental findings that make it hard to set up a deductive analytical model of individual behavior in this game: - Heterogeneity: In experiments, several different behavioral 'types' of participants can be observed, e.g. players always choosing the efficient strategy, players always playing myopic best responses, players who are easily frustrated and consequently start playing the safe (instead of the efficient) strategy after some rounds of the game, etc. - Dynamics: Players tend to change their behavior (and sometimes even their 'type') over time. - Noise: Even if well instructed, players make 'mistakes' while playing the game. In this paper, an agent based model of individual play of the minimum effort coordination game is introduced, which accounts for all three critical facts, behavioral heterogeneity, changing individual behavior over time, and the presence of individual mistakes. The model builds heavily on data and observations from an extensive series of laboratory experiments undertaken during the years 2003 to 2004 in the experimental laboratory of the University of Magdeburg (MaxLab). The artificial agents populating the model are set up to closely resemble individual behavior observed in these experiments. The model is then used to find out more about the reasons why aggregate behavior in the game changes with the decrease of group size and with the introduction of inter-group competition and, moreover, what can be done to drive aggregate behavior closer towards the efficient outcome.",

Les troubles cognitifs et les symptômes cliniques en sont la cause principale. Cependant, la nature de leurs relations avec l’insertion professionnelle reste mal connue. Cet article présente les résultats d’une étude examinant l’influence des fonctions mnésiques et des symptômes négatifs sur 5 composantes du comportement au travail chez 39 personnes schizophrènes en réinsertion professionnelle. Un deuxième volet de l’étude présente une approche de remédiation cognitive « sur mesure » qui cible des objectifs en lien direct avec les difficultés professionnelles et/ou quotidiennes de la personne. Les programmes ont concerné les fonctions mnésiques et le contrôle attentionnel. Les analyses indiquent que la mémoire à long terme verbale exerce une influence sur les capacités de coopération, la qualité du travail et la présentation personnelle. La capacité d’apprentissage d’informations verbales joue un rôle dans les habitudes de travail. La mémoire de travail qui permet le traitement et le maintien de l’information à court terme ne semble pas exercer une influence sur le comportement au travail. Enfin, les symptômes négatifs déterminent en partie les habiletés sociales et la présentation personnelle. Les résultats des interventions cognitives montrent leur efficacité pour compenser les déficits cognitifs dans l’insertion professionnelle et sociale.",

      "abstract": "Enduring cognitive or physical performance over extended periods of time is an important ability in daily life, prototypically required in many athletic, educational, and vocational contexts. A critical requirement for maintaining performance at a high level is that individuals continuously self-regulate various affective experiences (e.g., pain or boredom), thoughts (e.g., related to distractions or quitting), and behaviors (e.g., responding to feedback or increasing effort). The ubiquitous importance of self-regulation for performance has been recognized across psychological disciplines. In this special issue, we draw upon diverse insights from these disciplines to better understand the self-regulation of human performance.",

      "abstract": "During our entire life span we spend time in the activity of learning (anything from basic survival skills to highly intellectual processes), but this activity occupies most of the time during the first years of our lives. The classroom becomes then the \"official\" learning space that is designed to be conducive to this activity. The learning process, regardless of the task difficulty, is not a mechanical one. It requires a mental process, concentration, attention in various degrees. Distractions can be detrimental to the learning. Most of the learning activities that occur at school settings require some kind of oral communication (teacher-student or student-student), and these activities call for appropriate room acoustics. In the presence of high levels of background noise, human beings have other resources to better understand the signal of interest. Those can be visual cues, previous knowledge of the topic, or mental ability to \"fill in the blanks\" in the received speech. The last two, are abilities that come with age and experience.",

      "abstract": "We introduced a model of activity-based active learning class which has been practiced for a few years in [4]. While it may seem an easy task, designing an effective activity-based active learning can be quite challenging. Active learning adds new benefits to teaching including increased student involvement, social interaction, and hands-on learning, etc. [1]. However, in some situations, it may not provide an efficient learning environment. For example, we may assume that it is effective for educators to provide students with an environment where they can perform peer instruction and social learning. It could be further assumed that students will naturally find their way around the activities by following the instructions or peer instruction [2]. Such issues depend on the way activities are designed and executed. In this work, we discuss how the scaffolding of activities can help students stay engaged with the course without feeling lost or disconnected. Scaffolding refers to methods used to help students progress towards stronger understandings and eventually more independence in the learning process [3]. Our scaffolding methods smoothly transition students from lower to higher levels of challenge through an appropriate breakdown of course contents into activities of various types, proper sequencing of concepts and formative assessment questions. We believe that such proper breakdown is essential to keeping students engaged. We don't want students to feel bored (when challenge level is too low) or overwhelmed (when the challenge level is too high). Our findings indicate statistically significant differences in participation and engagement when using scaffolded activities in our introductory programming course (CS1).",

      "title": "What Can I Do When My Manager Says I Cannot Give Spiritual Care? Part 1",
      "abstract": "Figure“What do I do when my manager says I cannot give spiritual care—especially if a patient asks for it?” A two-part series will address this question. Here, we will assume the manager is uninformed; in the next issue, we will assume the nurse is unaware. To respond effectively to a supervisor admonishing you not to provide spiritual care, consider the following: 1) Have a listening conversation. When a manager makes such a request, you presumably do not know the reasoning. Does the manager believe spiritual care inevitably involves proselytizing religion? Does the manager think spiritual care, even ethical spiritual care, is outside the purview of nursing? Did the manager previously have a bad experience with a nurse providing spiritual care? Understanding the manager's perspective is pivotal to knowing how to respond. Have a conversation where your goal is to listen deeply. This can help you understand the manager. Make queries and observations as appropriate. For example, “Can you tell me more about what prompted you to ask me to not give spiritual care?” or “I'm sensing you're feeling there is something unprofessional about spiritual care or the way I am doing it.” It may also be beneficial to clarify how the manager defines spirituality and religiosity. Then listen. Avoid defensiveness and argument. Just listen. 2) Share information. If you have learned from listening that your manager has a knowledge deficit, ask if you can do some homework and share it later. Your homework will be to locate a few documents that substantiate the support of providing spiritual care. Empirical evidence abounds substantiating how spiritual well-being is positively associated with physical and mental well-being (Koenig, 2015). The logic, of course, is that supporting spiritual well-being may contribute to overall well-being. Extensive evidence also documents that spiritual and religious beliefs and practices are used to cope with health challenges. Patients who want spiritual care and receive it have better healthcare outcomes such as higher patient satisfaction (Hodge et al., 2016). A review article, especially if it caters to the patient population for whom you care, may be the most helpful. Your professional nursing organization may have a position paper that implies or advocates a need for nurses to address the spiritual dimension. If not, nursing organizations' (American Nurses Association and International Council of Nurses) ethics codes typically recognize a nursing role in respecting and supporting patient spiritual well-being. National organizations committed to quality healthcare identify spirituality as a human dimension worthy of assessment and care (i.e. The Joint Commission [TJC], National Quality Forum). If you learned that the manager equates spiritual care with promoting religion, providing professional literature that discusses the difference between these concepts may be useful. Most managers would want to promote a sense of purpose, hope, and gratitude. 3) Consider extending the council to include others. If the manager is receptive, ask if the topic can be discussed more widely. Discussing the evidence and mandates in a larger council can raise awareness and refine practice. Shared governance councils or nurse practice committees provide a forum where spiritual care practices and policies could be honed. If you work at a TJC-accredited organization and feel unsafe discussing spiritual care, contact TJC to confidentially report your concern without fear of retaliation. TJC, which has a standard requiring spiritual assessment, can be contacted via their hotline (800-994-6610), or by completing a reporting form (https://www.jointcommission.org/about/jointcommissionfaqs.aspx?faq#2183). And of course, pray that God will grant you insight into resolving this dilemma.",

Because of that learning becomes something very important for one's life. In conducting learning activities, of course, requires a force called motivation. This paper tries to look further at how motivation influences one's learning activities. Literature approach is employed in this study to describe everything obtained to increase understanding related to motivation to learn. In general, motivation is divided into two, namely intrinsic and extrinsic. Problems that always cause difficulties for students to learn are internal factors that include cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains, while external factors cover all situations and environmental conditions that do not support student learning activities. In addition, other factors that are more specifically causing difficulties for students in learning are dyslexia (inability to learn to read); dysgraphia (inability to learn or to write) and dyscalculia (inability to learn mathematics).",

A su vez, se mencionan sus características principales en la etapa preescolar. Se ha realizado una revisión exhaustiva y minuciosa sobre el tema en las principales fuentes de información y se ha llegado a la conclusión de que son constructos diferentes pero a su vez interdependientes. Mantienen una relación estrecha y recíproca compartiendo importantes puntos de desarrollo en común. El control inhibitorio es una de las principales funciones ejecutivas, junto con la memoria de trabajo y la flexibilidad cognitiva, y todas ellas se encuentran en la base de cualquier conducta organizada. Por otro lado, permiten el desarrollo de otras funciones más complejas como pueden ser el razonamiento, la planificación o la capacidad para resolver problemas. Estas habilidades de alto nivel cognitivo se desarrollan y evolucionan a lo largo de la vida manifestando un importante desarrollo en la etapa preescolar. Resultan imprescindibles para lograr una adaptación exitosa al ambiente, mantener una salud integral y están directamente vinculadas a la adquisición y desarrollo de las habilidades socioemocionales. En la infancia, tanto el control inhibitorio como la regulación emocional resultan fundamentales para obtener éxito académico y responder adecuadamente a las exigencias del entorno. El primero permite regular la atención, la cognición y el comportamiento mientras que la regulación emocional posibilita que las personas aprendan a regular la intensidad y la expresión de sus emociones. Ambos constructos están fuertemente vinculados con el desarrollo de competencias socioemocionales que promoverán interacciones sociales positivas y significativas. El control inhibitorio se encuentra en la base del proceso regulatorio de emociones y ambas habilidades tienen un importante desarrollo durante la etapa preescolar. Se pueden entrenar y, por lo tanto, se deben contemplar en las propuestas educativas.",

      "title": "Publishing addiction: a behavioural disorder with specific characteristics",
      "abstract": "By reading an academic journal, you are already at high risk of publishing addiction (PA). So, read on and see if you have it. PA is proposed as a previously unreported behavioural addiction. Gambling, excessive smartphone use and unrestrained shopping are other behavioural 'addictions'.1, 2 Although widespread, PA is masked by its normalization within academia, as alcoholism may be accepted in a brewery. PA can greatly impact the lives of those in its grip. The distinguishing features of PA include an urgent desire to keep publishing, getting emotional kicks from various publishing stages, including seeing your name in print, devoting excessive time to the habit, imagining that your articles are important, deluding yourself that your articles are actually read, blaming others when your articles get rejected and creating behaviours and strategies to support the habit. PA has several characteristics in common with other behavioural addictions. These include a lack of insight or denial, an inability to stop the behaviour, and delayed gratification. There may be damage to oneself and family and giving up of some social activities. Repeated rituals may develop, such as frequently checking citations and H-index on Google Scholar. The classic drug addict strategy of keeping a steady supply of the drug is echoed by constantly having several articles at various stages of publication. Some publishing addicts even start their own journal.3 Minor features of PA include constantly being on the outlook to publish even very minor issues (such as 'Antecubital fossae petechiae in Scottish country dancers')4 and performing publishing tricks, such as breaking the record for the shortest publication (two words).5 Time wasted on these multiple small pursuits could be better spent on grant applications and research leading to fewer, more important publications. Other PA features include developing coping strategies: using an exhaustive 'response to referee' method that leaves an editor with little room to reject, and viewing rejection as evidence of the article being 'an idea before its time' and one step closer to eventual acceptance. Warning signs of PA might include publishing more than 10 articles per year or having more than 100 publications. PA has similarities with alcohol addiction. Most drinkers occasionally have an enjoyable drink, but a few develop alcoholism. But while alcoholism is almost universally negative, PA often also brings positive benefits. It turbocharges spreading your ideas, and may lead to peer recognition, promotion, invitations to lecture or advise, and to stimulating academic encounters. Your career may flourish and go from success to success. But PA can lead to ruin, through salami publications, duplicate publications, plagiarism and fabricated results. In the academic publishing business model, the author does all the work, gifts it to the publisher, and then has to pay to make it widely available. Potato growers wouldn't put up with such an absurd offer from a supermarket. But academic authors accept this outrageous situation allegedly because they want to disseminate their research, to enhance their CVs, and because employers require them to publish. For many, however, the real underlying reason is to feed their PA. My interactions with the BJD, coupled with my PA, have included being the British Association of Dermatologists' Treasurer (BJD income being critically important), being President and trying to restructure editorial arrangements, being on the Editorial Board and refereeing, but my main involvement has been as author. As addicts trying to manipulate the supplier, our team members have tried to 'use' the BJD to help develop our quality-of-life measures, partially successfully. And, on leaving my office window open, even the Cardiff birds with PA chose my BJDs to nest on (Figure 1). How might PA insights help the editors of a major journal, such as the BJD? Top-ranking authors are likely to have PA. The BJD wants to attract top-ranking authors. If you understand what gives these authors their big kicks, you can develop and enhance these, creating journal ecstasy. Then you've got them! Journals already flaunt their glitzy impact factors on their websites to suck in authors, much as casinos attract gamblers with their gaudy surroundings. But they could do better. The highs of PA include receiving an acceptance email (parallels here with gambling addiction, hitting the jackpot), seeing the proofs, noticing your article on PubMed, and, the ultimate kick, finally seeing it published. Editors could try to enhance these highs. Make the submission response more personal. Individualize rejection letters and be encouraging. Make the acceptance letter more celebratory. Enhance the proofs experience. Make it simple to access the pdf of the final publication. Arrange a tracking system to inform the author of current status and likely dates. Essentially, reduce the technical, enhance the emotional and massage the trigger points. After lecturing on PA, several dermatologists contacted me to admit their addiction, and an anonymous reviewer of this manuscript also self-diagnosed PA. This disorder may be prevalent in the academic community across all disciplines, especially among the most 'successful' academics. These academics may also be in the grip of the closely related 'research addiction' for which the ultimate high is the Eureka moment of scientific discovery. PA probably occurs among other authors such as novelists and journalists, whose career choice may spring from their PA. Understanding PA may allow authors to have more insight into their behaviour and enable editors to strengthen their journals.

      "abstract": "Abstract: Saturation of learning can strike students if they have lost motivation and lose consolidation of one particular skill level before the student reaches the next skill level. In addition, saturation can also occur because the learning process of students has reached the limits of physical abilities, because of boredom (boring) and fatigue (fatigue). Students' fatigue can be categorized into three types, namely: 1) student's sensory fatigue; 2) students' physical fatigue; 3) students' mental fatigue. Among the three types of fatigue, mental fatigue was seen as the main factor causing the emergence of learning saturation.\r\nMotivation as anfactor inner functions to cause, underlie, direct the act of learning. Motivation is one of the spiritual factors of students who are generally seen as more essential which can affect the quantity and quality of student learning. This means that motivation can determine the good or not in achieving the goal so that the strong weakness of one's learning motivation also influences its success. A person who learns with strong motivation, will carry out all his learning activities seriously, full of passion or enthusiasm, actively trying to read books to improve his performance to solve his problem, seeming persistent not to give up. Conversely, learning with weak motivation, attention is not focused on the lesson, does not want to do tasks related to the lesson, indifferent, easily discouraged, lazy, like to disturb the class.",

There’s a sense that boredom sometimes causes bad things to happen (e.g., substance use, self-harm), and sometimes good things (e.g., daydreaming, creativity), but it’s hard to understand what boredom does, without first understanding what it is. According to the Meaning and Attentional Components (MAC) model of boredom and cognitive engagement, the emotion of boredom signals deficits in attention and meaning. Much like pain, it may not be pleasant, but boredom critically alerts us that we’re unable or unwilling to successfully engage attention in meaningful activities. Whether that’s good or bad rests ultimately on how we respond.",

There are multiple potential reasons for resistance and lack of implementation fidelity in general, but three pertain specifically to the use of rewards and praise as commonly prescribed by behavioral consultants: (a) conflicts with teacher's philosophy, training, and educational aims; (b) the teacher's recognition that change is not needed; and (c) the teacher's recognition of the limitations of frequent and systematic use of rewards and praise. As discussed in this article, those reasons often are valid but also can be addressed by consultants and researchers in ways that are likely to reduce resistance and increase fidelity of implementation.",

The adult participants gave clear evidence of possessing these intuitions, both in their responses and in their justifications of their responses. Many of the child participants, especially the older ones, also responded as if they had at least some grasp of them. These intuitions appear to form part of a family of fundamental intuitions concerning the what and when of thinking that are in the process of acquisition during the late preschool and middle-childhood years.",

Cognitive regulation can occur before individuals engage in tasks, while they are working on them, and during pauses or when tasks are completed where individuals reflect on their performances. Researchers have addressed which cognitive regulation processes are used during various phases of task engagement, how these processes differ among individuals due to ability and achievement levels and due to development, how cognitive regulation processes operate during task engagement, and which interventions can effectively help persons become better cognitive regulators. The implications of the research findings are that teachers and others can help learners improve their cognitive regulation skills. Some important processes are goal setting, strategy use and adaptation, monitoring of cognition and performance, motivation (e.g., self-efficacy), and self-evaluation. Effective interventions expose students to models displaying these skills and provide for practice with feedback. There are six limitations of the present research that should be addressed. This can be accomplished by conducting more intervention studies, examining fine-grained changes in cognitive regulation, conducting research in non-traditional contexts, integrating the educational and developmental literatures, exploring cognitive regulation across cultures, and investigating cognitive regulation during learning with technology.",

      "abstract": "Past and future events can affect present-time decision making in important ways. More so when these events have self and social esteem implications. For example, individuals might find that unflattering past events can resurface in present-time and harm their current esteem. Or, they might realize that present-time unflattering events might be revealed later in time and damage their future esteem. Depending on how formative individuals view past events to be for the construction of their current self, they might become less or more willing to engage in concealing lying (i.e., lying aiming to cover up a past action). Similarly, contingent on how individuals project their future self to be affected by current events, they might become less or more willing to engage in anticipatory lying (i.e., lying aiming to prevent a present action from being revealed in the future). In an incentivized experiment, participants exhibit the tendency to engage in concealing but not anticipatory lying, implying some naivety in anticipating future concerns. In a related experimental variation, subjects do not make more unflattering (but profitable) decisions when, beforehand, they know they can use lying to cover up afterwards or, when they do, they do not lie about it, i.e., they do not significantly engage in premeditated lying.",

      "abstract": "Cognition refers to processes involved in knowing, understanding, learning, perceiving, remembering, judging and thinking. These can be contrasted with physical, behavioural or emotional processes although it is not always easy to separate them, particularly when they may in some circumstances interact with each other. Judging whether a person is exercising a cognitive or some other process, simply by observing behaviour, is not at all easy. For example, memory-impaired people who keep repeating the same question may be doing so because of anxiety (an emotional problem), or because they have forgotten they have already asked the question (a cognitive problem), or because they see that it is annoying for those around them and find this rewarding (a behavioural problem).",

      "title": "The relationship between teachers’ experience of work pressure and their performing of professional learning activities : an explanation through basic need frustration and controlled motivation",
      "abstract": "Because of ongoing educational changes in many countries, teachers are required to continuously learn and develop. To do so, they need to perform professional learning activities (e.g., read literature and participate in courses). At the same time, teachers experience work pressure from their primary tasks (e.g., preparing and teaching lessons and grading students’ work). The relationship between work pressure and teachers’ performing of professional learning activities is not clear from current research. Some studies find positive effects, while others report zero or negative relationships. An explanation for these mixed findings could be that only moderate work pressure creates a concern for professional learning, because learning can help to alleviate the negative consequences of work pressure. This implies a curvilinear relationship between experienced work pressure and teachers’ performing of professional learning activities. It is hypothesized that this relationship can be explained through basic need frustration and controlled motivations. That is, work pressure can cause teachers to experience controlled motivations (i.e., feel pressured) to improve their circumstances through learning. This relationship could, in turn, be explained through basic need frustration. However, when work pressure becomes too high, basic need frustration could become too high and teachers become concerned with their wellbeing instead of learning (Jansen in de Wal, van den Beemt, Martens, & den Brok, 2018). In this study, these expectations are evaluated employing data collected at three occasions among 2359 (t1), 678 (t2), and 536 (t3) secondary school teachers from the Netherlands. Analyses of a complete measurement model show factorial validity and longitudinal metric measurement invariance of our measures of work pressure, basic need frustration, controlled motivations and learning frequency, χ2(8106) = 13546.49, p < .001; CFI = .91; TLI = .90; RMSEA = .02; SRMR = .05. The latent zero-order correlations between all constructs derived from this model are in line with our hypotheses. At the time of the conference, longitudinal panel models will have been evaluated that further test whether basic need frustration and controlled motivations mediate the (quadratic) relationship between work pressure and teachers’ performing of professional learning activities over time.",

Emotional and/or behavioural difficulties can impact a young person's cognitive abilities, for instance, making it harder to concentrate or to process what is being said. Conversely, weak cognitive abilities in the form of a learning disability or some more specific form of developmental delay can be the primary issue that underpins emotional and behavioural difficulties, e.g. anxiety, low mood, poor concentration, oppositional behaviour, frustration and anger outbursts. Understanding such difficulties and knowing whether they underlie or exacerbate the young person's emotional and/or behavioural problems can be difficult but useful when it comes to providing support for them.",

We identify the following attention disorders: (1) learning myopia - neglecting long-term goals, global interests, failing outcomes or emerging trends; (2) learning hyperopia - neglecting short-term goals, local interests, successful outcomes or current trends; (3) learning astigmatism – neglecting both short-term goals and long-term goals, local interests and global interests, winning outcomes and failing outcomes and/or current trends and emerging trends; and (4) learning presbyopia – paying attention ineptly to short-term goals and long-term goals, local interests and global interests, winning outcomes and failing outcomes, current trends and emerging trends. We argue that these attention disorders lead to specific incompetence traps. We apply this typology to reveal the cognitive roots of business failure.",

      "title": "Development of educators’ soft skills: tolerance to uncertainty and thinking in conditions of instability",
      "abstract": "Based on the analysis of scientific, pedagogical and regulatory sources, it is summarised that the concept of uncertainty is considered in different contexts and meanings. Tolerance for uncertainty and thinking in conditions of instability as part of the “soft skills” of educators, which, along with other skills, underlies their professional effectiveness, adaptation to life situations, remains relevant for researchers. Properties that are important for pedagogical activity are highlighted, which indicate tolerance to uncertainty: the ability to control oneself and not fall into a prolonged state of stress, psychophysical stability, anti-fragility; the ability to master emotions, to control or regulate one’s emotional states; cognitive attitudes that approve, positively colour what is incomprehensible, multitasking, non-linear or multiple; a positive attitude towards situations in which one needs to act, take responsibility, and find solutions. It also deals with intolerance to uncertainty – various negative feelings – discomfort, threat, insecurity, mistrust of oneself and others; giving preference to cognitive strategies in order to simplify situations – stereotyping, polarisation, rushing decisions, finding ways to delegate responsibility, the need for categorisation, dichotomy of thinking, which prompts to automatically give priority to one's own, familiar and usual. Factors that are the conditions and characteristics of instability in professional pedagogical activity have been identified and analysed: poly-subjectivity of educational processes; verticality of the structure of pedagogical interaction; the dynamics of educational changes and educational processes, which is particularly typical of the modern global educational space; external determinism of education by market and social factors. Based on the results of the empirical research (diagnosis of intolerance by Badner), it was found out that: 1. A significant advantage of the average level of intolerance/tolerance of the respondents was found in relation to the subscales: “novelty of the problem” – 73.91 %; “complexity of the problem” – 91.30; “insolvability of the problem” – 84.05; 2. Tolerance, that is, the low level of intolerance of the interviewees is insignificant: “insolvability of the problem” – 7.24 %; “complexity of the problem” – 1.44; “novelty of the problem” – 2.8; 3. As for the high level of intolerance, it was found that it is characteristic of a significant part of future teachers only according to the subscale “novelty of the problem” – 34.78 % – in the respondents of the Preschool Education specialty, and 17.39 % – of the Primary Education specialty. According to the “complexity of the problem” subscale, these indicators are much lower: 8.69 % and 6.52 %, respectively, and according to the “insolvability of the problem” subscale, they are 13.4 % and 6.52 %. Thus, the novelty of the problem is the main source of intolerance to uncertainty and thinking of students in conditions of stability. Keywords: soft skills; pedagogical activity; professional activity in conditions of instability; thinking in conditions of instability; tolerance to uncertainty.",

      "title": "Integrating emotion in interaction in the case of aquired brain injury",
      "abstract": "‘Aphasia’ is characterized by challenges in the production of speech. A variety of applied pragmatic approaches to aphasia exist. Many other units than linguistic units are central to meaning-making with persons with acquired brain injury, ABI (Goodwin 2003a): Embodied talk, multimodal units such as gesturing, pointing, gazing and bodily posture, the handling of objects etc. Data excerpts from a collaborative study will be discussed in order to demonstrate the pros and cons of a new cross-interdisciplinary approach between ‘augmented’ CA and an applied integrational linguistics perspective. I draw on a study, which investigates routines and emotion displays mainly in a care home setting, where some of the participants have severe acquired brain injury. Critical situations where emotion is relevant, e.g. cases of compliance and non-compliance to having memorized something “wrong” or ”correctly”, are investigated. Critical emotional displays seem to depend on circumstantial factors; which situation, persons, purpose or the challenge there is at stake (to win the argument versus being polite etc.) rather than retrievable interactional/organizational patterns (Harris 1998: 25; Goodwin 2003a; Klemmensen, forthcoming). The organization of talk after trauma is often characterized as ‘atypical’ in their organizational patterns (Perkins 2003). The notion ‘atypical communication’ represents the current data-driven analytical discourse in rehabilitation studies and health communication (Goodwin 2003a, 2003b; Wilkinson 2011). It may be applied for ethical purposes in the tradition after Goodwin’s augmented version of Conversation analysis (CA), which aims to retrieve what is perceivable for the other participants in interactions (Goodwin 2003a). Still, it contributes to a segregationist stance in an integrational perspective (Harris 1998, 2012: 44). May ’sense-making’ be approached integrationally as ‘persons’ experienced understandings’ (Harris, 1998, 2012: 43; Conrad, 2011; Nielsen, 2015)? May micro-social factors, macro-social factors and the history of a person’s interactional behaviour be used to investigate communicative habits, as they are displayed under various circumstances (Sarangi 2007)? Finally, may a new approach help distinguish the experienced communication as practiced by the participants from the analyst’s interpretations (Fleming 1995; Harris 1998, 2009, 2012; Nielsen 2015; Sarangi 2007)?",

      "abstract": "There are several strategies to attain greater satisfaction from one's work. While radical steps such as exiting the workplace and moving to another environment or starting one's own business are sometimes useful solutions, the majority of workforce members cannot move as swiftly in and out of jobs as they might wish. This chapter suggests a strategy to build meaning and engagement by turning inward and engaging in a six-step process of insight-focused contemplations, which could enhance the quality of life at work for the practitioner as well as his or her colleagues. The six mindsets entail, (1) general awareness: the impermanence of everything; (2) specific awareness: the fickleness of positions; (3) holistic view: the ability to focus on the whole, and see past small irritations while recognizing the blessing of being where one is; (4) learning stance: the skill to understand that every seemingly negative occurrence serves a useful future purpose; (5) interconnectedness: the connection with others, even if they refuse to see it; (6) void: the awareness of one's non-self.",

      "title": "ON THE ACCURACY OF INSPECTORS",
      "abstract": "Reasons for inspector inaccuracy have been examined in three main groups: reasons of basic individual abilities; of formal organization (training, instructions, physical conditions, the lay-out of the job); and of interpersonal relations and social relations. Without denying the importance of the basic individual abilities of inspectors, which must set the ultimate limits of accuracy, it seems that the actual limits in a working situation are set by the other two groups of reasons. These practical limits may be well inside the limits set by basic psychological and physiological functions. For example, given an inspector who is well equipped with the basic abilities and aptitudes for the actual inspection task itself, he cannot operate more accurately than his instructions, for instance, allow him to. Moreover, even if well selected, well trained and well briefed, he still can be no more accurate than the pressures of interpersonal and other social relations permit. These interpersonal relations do not necessarily make him pass work that should be failed; they may also make him fail work that should be passed. Conversely, the production man will be more eager to ' get products past ', to trick the inspector, when he does not' sanction ' the inspector. This may in turn make the inspector reject more of the work of the man who tries to trick him than is actually bad. These interpersonal and social relations become all the more important when the inspection task is the more ' socio-technical '—involving direct interaction with production. It seems that when relations between production and inspection are poor. when production feel they can not sanction the inspectors and/or their standards, and when inspection chooses to play its role in a dominant, authoritative, and essentially invidious way. rather than as finding neutral facts, then not only will inspector accuracy be adversely affected, but there will also be strong pressures against inspection supervisors testing their inspector's accuracy. Although the obvious man to check inspector accuracy is the inspector's own supervisor, there are powerful pressures against his doing this,Not only are there practical difficulties, but also there is the fact that inspection supervisors, and others, tend to become ' product-bound ', even to the neglect of their true supervisory duties. Moreover, the pressures of interdepartmental relations encourage inspection supervisors to see themselves first as inspectors, and only secondarily as supervisors. The general conclusion is that inspector accuracy, in a working situation, is determined by a wide range of factors. Problems of inaccuracy must then be studied in a wider context than is given by any single approach.",

      "title": "A Culture of Teaching and Learning Excellence Starts with an Examination of Assumptions: Influences of General Semantics on Faculty Development",
      "abstract": "does it mean to teach? When I ask this question, I usually receive a myriad of answers, some insightful, some not as insightful, and some, well, you get the point. Answers vary, reflecting a central theme with teaching and learning as I see it, especially in higher education: instructional practices reflect the beliefs, attitudes, and assumptions of faculty. If these are examined and clarified, then they become a vital part of the faculties' efficacy and ability to engage in teaching and learning excellence. However, problems in teaching and learning excellence usually arise when instructional actions, opinions, and attitude are based on unconscious or unrealized assumptions by the person making the claim about teaching and learning matters. It is the central point of this essay that assumptions lead to action even in the area of faculty development as related to the practice of teaching and learning. Thus, if a spirited culture of teaching and learning is to exist, one based on ( 1 ) respect for teaching and learning as a separate discipline of study, (2) a celebration of evidence-based practices rather than opinion, (3) mutual respect for various perspective and thoughts, and (4) self-reflection and discovery, then this movement must start within a different paradigm-a paradigm that supports a move toward excellence as defined above. In order for this new framework to exist, current assumptions must be clarified because assumptions correlate to actions based on those sets of assumptions. Furthermore, attitudes, emotions, and language, supported by assumptions and beliefs, create the foundation of the discourse framework for conversations and verbal interactions, yet remain unknown to the person holding a set of assumptions. It is then the purpose of this essay to make the readers aware that they too operate on a certain set of assumptions and to provide a method for assumption clarification as this is a necessary process to help move toward a new paradigm of teaching and learning excellence.As a faculty educator, I usually ask to see the evidence to back these beliefs that allow certain faculty to act in specific ways. We, as faculty, would be less likely to tolerate many opinions held by our students who claim all types of things during class discussion or in essays, without evidence or justification beyond mere opinion, so then why would it be ok for some faculty to behave in the same manner, as their questionable students, when it comes to discussing, thinking, and engaging in teaching and learning excellence? Any battles over opinion regarding teaching and learning could be classified as meaningless because the words used in the opinion tend to be ambiguous and are typically under or overly defined. In addition, the consequence of the unconscious assumption is opinion and action, which may not surface toward consciousness, unless someone questions the validity of the opinion held by the arguing faculty member. Therefore, holding opinions based on unchecked assumptions may lead to ineffective habits in mind and in practice, yet these habits remain normal to an unsuspecting person.AssumptionsI ask, What assumption is your opinion about teaching and learning based upon? In other words, opinions are outward verbalizations of certain beliefs, which a person holds and those are based on certain assumptions about the world. In further words, faculty, because they are human, operate on a set of assumptions they have about their role as an educator or as a person in academia.For example, are your actions based on the assumption that you teach a discipline, such as biology, philosophy, and education, or do you assume that you teach students who are human and adults, and if they are adult humans, they most likely are a person, and if they are a person, they have the potential and capacity to learn?I ask you to reflect on this topic. Have you thought about these ideas before? If not, then now is the time because believe it or not, your answers to these assumptions determine your framework for HOW you will teach, thereby reflecting your attitudes toward the educational process itself. …",

      "title": "Helping niches may trigger the development of task specialization and division of labour",
      "abstract": "Multimember societies often exhibit Division of labour (DoL), where different individuals perform distinct tasks such as brood care, food acquisition and defence. While demand for tasks exists at the group level, assigning them to specific members poses an organizational challenge. I propose the ‘Helping Niche Specialization hypothesis’ (HeNS hypothesis), which suggests that cues indicating societal demand for tasks along with the current distribution of help, influence individual biases towards specific task preferences. This process may begin during early ontogeny, even before helping behaviours are actively performed. I first introduce the concept of the ‘helping niche’, a special form of the social niche. Next, I outline procedures central to the HeNS hypothesis, which represent a stepwise process: (i) societal and environmental cues bias individuals towards task preferences, which may arise already during early life, (ii) experience with preferred tasks reinforces these biases, (iii) learning-by-doing enhances task performance, and/or (iv) reduced response thresholds make task execution more likely, leading to (v) differentiation and specialization. Furthermore, I discuss the costs and benefits of specialization, how helping niches may emerge during development, the environmental conditions that favour them, and alternative pathways to DoL. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Division of labour as key driver of social evolution’.",

      "title": "Shadaavashyak: A Technique for Self Management (Based on Jain Scriptures)",
      "abstract": "Introduction:Most of the people today are mentally disturbed as they found themselves incapable of handling the situation. The reason is lack of correct understanding of people around, thing, incident and circumstances. To address such issues Shad Aavashyak (six essentials/Pratikraman) can be adopted for Self-management for a balanced, happy, contented life. Objectives: The research aims to suggest a self management tool to manage oneself by oneself by applying six essential techniques in day to day activities. It enables one developing a positive attitude and balanced personality capable to handle all situation with equanimity. Further, as in the process the body(different mudras/postures), mind (purification of thought process) and speech(devotional hymns with correct pronunciation) are involved, these have a direct effect on mental, spiritual and physical health and fitness. Methods: There are six techniques which one can use in two sittings in a day while sittinng 48 minuts in one go. (1) Samaiyak (withdraw oneself from worldy affairs and remain equanimous) (2) Chaturvinshatistava, (devotional hymn so that qualities of God can be emulated in oneself) (3) Vandan,(to show gratefulness towards mentor/Guru) (4) Pratikraman (introspection of wrong dees/sinful activities during the day/night) (5) Kayotsarg,(withdrawl from bodily affairs and meditate) (6) Pratyakhyaan (Repentence of wrong deeds with commitment of non-repeating in future). Results:It is helpful in time management and emotion management as by freeing oneself from unnecessary tasks, both energy and time are saved. This is the best way to remove mental stress and every work can be done with vigour and freshness. The recitation of the mantras by raising the left knee and Namaskar Mudra help in dissolving the ego and develops positive thinking along with increasing appreciation of qualities. The body becomes balanced and the nervous system becomes healthy. Mental and physical stress ease out. The person become calm and happy. Conclusions:The shadaavashyak is an act of of self-introspection and self-purification with a larger objective of salvation for spiritual seekers as it enables one to detach oneself for a certain length of time from all external activity and dwell within one’s self. With a practice one can experience the inner self. Furter, for worldy people also it gives a different and real perspective to understand the things with calmness. Maintain equanimity in all situations. Develop a personality of appreaciating good things in others and condemning bad deeds by one with promise of non-reapeating. It helps in developing a balanced, happy personality.",

      "title": "Suspending and reinstating collaborative activities",
      "abstract": "There is an interest in how people coordinate multiple activities with multiple partners, and in particular, how people deal with interruptions. Interruptions happen unexpectedly. They can cause errors and loss of productivity. Effects of interruptions have been studied in individual tasks, but not in collaborative tasks. When pairs deal with an interruption, they have to jointly suspend their activity, address the matter, and later jointly reinstate their activity. The main goal of the dissertation was to define a model of suspensions and to measure constrains on the suspension and the reinstatement steps. Pairs suspend momentarily without taking leave of each other. This requires the coordination of two important processes: Politeness and common ground. First, politeness is often involved in suspensions, because asking one's partner to wait while one does something else is facethreatening. Two factors affect politeness: The degree of personal responsibility of participants proposing suspensions and durations of suspensions. Second, continuing tasks requires reconstructing joint representations of the tasks (common ground). Several factors affect the reconstruction of common ground: The persons interrupted the timing of suspension and the availability of cues about the state of the task. Five studies were conducted. Study 1 used naturally-occurring suspensions in telephone conversations from a corpus data. Study 2 & 3 used suspensions triggered with a cover story in laboratory. Study 2 & 3 manipulated participants’ roles in conversations and durations of interruptions. Results revealed that participants were more polite when suspension lasted longer, and it took more collaborative effort to reinstate conversations. Also, initiators of suspensions were more polite when they were listening than speaking. Study 4 & 5 manipulated the duration and the timing of interruptions during a goal-oriented task. Additionally, Study 4 manipulated the participants’ role during interruptions, and Study 5 manipulated the visibility of workspace between participants. Results showed that participants took more time to reinstate tasks when interruptions lasted longer and when it happened in the middle of sub-tasks, compared to when interruptions were brief and happened between sub-tasks. Also, they took more time to reinstate when both participants were distracted during interruptions, rather than when just one was distracted, and when participants did not share their workspace, rather than when they did share a workspace.",

      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event Making disciplinary perspectives explicit and other best practices for interdisciplinary work in educational neuroscience Priya Kalra1* and Jamie K. O'Keefe1 1 Harvard Graduate School of Education, ISB, United States Education is a field rather than a discipline [2], and therefore lacks a single cohesive set of the defining elements of a discipline as identified by Repko [1], including assumptions, theories, methods, phenomena of interest, and epistemological perspectives. Instead, each of the disciplines that approaches problems in education (such as psychology, sociology or economics) brings its own latent set of disciplinary characteristics to the study of education. As a result, confusion and miscommunication between researchers of different disciplinary backgrounds often arises. This problem is heightened in the area of Educational Neuroscience and may be a serious hindrance to progress in the field. In previous work, we have attempted to make explicit the defining elements of disciplines contributing to educational neuroscience (such as developmental psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and educational psychology inter alia) and demonstrate how they may conflict or cause confusion when not acknowledged, using the example of each discipline’s contributions to the study of reading disorders. Here, we build on that understanding by comparing the still-emerging interdisciplinary field of Educational Neuroscience to more established interdisciplinary fields; we will use this comparison to infer best practices for interdisciplinary work in Educational Neuroscience as well as to examine pitfalls we can avoid as the field goes forward. We believe that a wider understanding of the importance of making disciplinary perspectives explicit will lead to greater productivity in the field of Educational Neuroscience in the future.

Without connecting potential solutions to the case analysis, emerging and new professionals may miss opportunities to design and implement resolutions that address the full range of issues and concerns embedded in a given situation. Students and new professionals generally find it helpful to organize their responses by thinking of them as either short-term or long-term approaches. Long-term approaches tend to be proactive responses to address broader issues to ensure this type of problem either does not occur again, or if it does, the effects are limited. Students and new professionals often struggle in devising responses to problems presented in a case study that are not appropriate or realistic given the facts of the case.

Sometimes limited anxiety and tension are essential for optimal performance. The average person has capacity to live through stressful situations-even crisis-and adjust to a normal state when upsetting situation passes. Conversely there are negative results of stress. High level of uncontrolled intense stress may reduce physical resistance, lower productivity; disrupt routines, cause behavior problems, result in physical or mental illness or numerous other anti social conditions.Academic stress is product of a combination of academic related demands that exceed adaptive resources available to an individual. If a student is unable to cope effectively with academic stress, then serious psycho-social-emotional health consequences may result (Arthur, 1998; MacGeorge, Samter, & Gillikan, 2005; Tennant, 2002).Self-efficacySelf-efficacy as defined by Bandura (1997) is the belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute courses of action required to produce given attainments (p. 3). These beliefs affect human functioning in four areas: cognitions, motivation, mood/affect, and depressive states (Bandura, 1997). Cognitive implications suggest that individuals with high self-efficacy are more likely to set goals for themselves in hopes of attaining lofty aspirations. They tend to visualize their success, think soundly, and commit themselves to challenges at hand. Conversely, those with low self-efficacy are more likely to focus on how things might go array or dwell on their perceived personal deficiencies. In essence these individuals tend to focus on problems of circumstance rather than possibilities of success.Peer pressureThe formation of specific friendships begins to be observed during period from 18 to 36 months (Schneider, 2000). These friendships are indexed by mutual interaction preference, shared affect, scripted regularities in play, and differentially sophisticated play between peers (see Howes, 1996). Indeed, percentage of children at these ages without friends is very small, at least among children in child care settings (Howes, 1983, 1988). Because toddlers' concepts of a friend and friendship are limited (Selman, 1980), it is sometimes assumed that these early friendships are of marginal importance to children of this age. However, children with friends acquire social skills as a result of their participation in these relationships, especially if these relationships are maintained over time (Howes, 1996).Objective of study* To study relation in academic stress and self-efficacy among students.* To study relation in academic stress and peer relations among students.MethodParticipantsThe sample was compared of400 students (200 boys and 200 girls) studying at senior secondary school level. The data was collected from govt and private school of district Hisar, Haryana.InstrumentsStudent Academic Stress Scale (SASS) (A. O. Busari): The SASS was used within current study for an exploratory factor analysis. It is a measure of stress response developed specifically for quantifying stress in university students in stress response domains: Physiological, Behavioural, Cognitive, and Affective. Respondents rate how much of time they experience symptoms on a 5-point Likert scale with anchors None of Time ( 1), A Little of Time (2), Some of Time (3), Most of Time (4), and All of Time (5). Items are summed for subscale scores and subscales are summed for a total SASS stress response score. Higher scores indicate a greater stress response. Items for SASS were generated from a review of general stress and academic stress literature. …",

      "abstract": "Maths anxiety is an acquired fear of mathematical situations or subjects which stops the brain being able to process maths effectively or even at all. This situation-specific anxiety occurs as a result of one or many negative experiences with maths and is thought to affect a large proportion of people. Statistics anxiety, which is related to maths anxiety, has been shown to be a strong predictor of poor performance in research methods courses and can affect a student's ability to use statistical software and understand research articles.\r\n\r\nNegative experiences condition the brain to view maths as a threat so students with maths anxiety will generally opt out of maths or statistics. Where this is not possible, avoiding studying until the last minute is a common occurrence, leading to poor performance, which reinforces belief that the student cannot do maths. For some, previous experiences are such that even the word ‘maths’ triggers fear which results in self-safeguarding by avoiding even maths support centres or maths anxiety seminars. \r\nThis paper discusses initial approaches which can be implemented within an individual support setting to start the process of overcoming affective barriers to mathematical learning. The process of addressing maths anxiety includes: increasing awareness of maths anxiety; developing approaches which enable learners to overcome triggers and setbacks (mathematical resilience); providing non-threatening, inclusive, positive teaching experiences with maths and statistics and, perhaps most importantly, developing agency within each learner that enables them to suitably self-safeguard.",

      "title": "Academic Orientation Supported by Hybrid Intelligent Decision Support System",
      "abstract": "IntroductionIt is common that in all academic systems the students must make decisions about the future by choosing among different alternatives that include professional profiles or modalities, elective subjects or optional, etc.These decisions can have a very important influence in the academic journey of the students because sometimes a wrong decision can lead to academic failure or its correction implies a time cost for the students.It is remarkable that in many academic systems these important decisions have to be made in early stages in which the students do not have enough maturity or knowledge to be conscious about the consequences in their future if a wrong decision is made.Ideally these multiple choices, offered to the students, want to facilitate the acquirement of some professional and valuable competences to obtain a job.Taking into account that the suitability of people in jobs or studies is not only restricted to their taste or preferences, but also other factors involved in the process of acquiring maturity as an adult who develops any function.These factors such as capacities, skills, attitudes concerning the task, social attitudes, taste, preferences, etc. (Briñol 2007, Robertson 1993, Salgado 1996, Shevin 2004), must be taken into account in such processes.Initially these decision making processes were made by the students themselves or with their parents support according to different criteria such as, preferences, future job market, even randomly, etc.Therefore, in order to improve this situation different countries introduced one figure, so-called advisor, whose role is to guide the students in their decision making situations regarding their academic future.The academic orientation process carried out by these advisors imply the review of different information regarding the students in order to report which academic alternatives suits better their skills, competences and needs.In most of academic institutions the advisor deals yearly with several hundreds of students with different skills, personalities, etc.To make an idea, in Spain, and depending on the high school, advisors can manage from 200 to 800 students.This number of students implies a big search space to find the relevant information that can facilitate the orientation for each one in a right way, making very hard to perform successfully the academic orientation process.Hence it seems suitable the development of automated tools that support the accomplishment of the different processes of academic orientation to improve the success of advisors' tasks.An overview of different problems in the real world that deal with search spaces drove us to pay attention to the situation raised some years ago with the advent of Internet and the www.intechopen.comEfficient Decision Support Systems -Practice and Challenges From Current to Future 242 increase of requirements in many areas.One of the most demanded solutions is based on the necessity of finding out suitable items over huge and/or complex search spaces in e-shops.The users need help to explore and filter all the possibilities about the items offered in order to improve the quality of their choices, minimize the time consumed and the wrong decisions.Different tools have been developed to accomplish the previous goals, being remarkable the use of Recommender Systems (Adomavicius 2005, Resnick 1997, Rodríguez 2010).These systems offer recommendations to users according to their preference profiles, guiding them through search spaces in order to find out the most suitable items for their needs in many real-life situations.The growth of this area is basically due to the vast amount of available information in Internet and the facilities provided by the Web to create users' communities in order to share experiences, tastes, interests, etc.In this sense, Recommender Systems (RS) provide users customized advices and information about products or services of interest in order to support their decision-making processes.Usually a RS estimates the degree of like or dislike either how suitable is an item for a user.To do so, a user profile is generated from his/her preferences which are built by gathering explicit data, implicit data or both (Adomavicius 2005, Pazzani 1999) (see Figure 1).

Three forces in particular make the transition to retirement difficult: (1) organizations and work careers have, however inadvertently, filled a wide variety of very basic human needs, so the retiree is often unprepared to know how to replace these needs in other ways; (2) social norms and subtle pressures enhance feelings of being \"finished\"; and (3) marital difficulties result from a new twenty four-hour-a-day relationship, from unresolved conflicts, patterns of interaction, poor communication, and inadequate sharing.

      "title": "Measurement in Health Psychology Research and Practice",
      "abstract": "Health psychology is the investigation of psychological and behavioral processes in health, illness, and health care. It investigates the behavior of people who are healthy or ill as well as practitioners and policymakers delivering or making decisions that influence health care. Measures may be used in studies aiming to elucidate and understand processes to advance theory and evidence, or to gain greater understanding or even intervening to improve health and health-care outcomes. A wide range of research designs are used including observational, intensive longitudinal (or ecological momentary assessment [EMA]), experimental laboratory, pre-post event or intervention, and randomized controlled trials. Frequently investigations measure a target behavior or psychological state and examine (a) whether it can be predicted or influenced by antecedents (events, environments, cognitions, interventions) and (b) whether it predicts or influences consequences, especially health/illness outcomes. Health psychology shares measurement issues that are challenging for psychology in general, including establishing reliability and validity, scaling mental processes, and reactivity of measures. Additionally, self-report measures are frequently used to assess symptoms such as pain or reports of health behaviors such as smoking, and these assessments may be used to assess a clinical condition and to guide clinical decisions. They may be validated against an objective measure, but the objective measure may fail to represent the full range, context, or occurrence of the target construct and can therefore only give an indication rather than a solid assessment of validity of the self-report. Measures are often used to measure change over time, especially change associated with an intervention or a changing clinical state, and therefore need to be repeatable while retaining meaning; sensitivity to change may be more important than test-retest reliability. Longitudinal measurement has been aided by the use of digital mobile technologies, including wearables and automatic measurement of physiological processes. Additionally, physiological functioning, especially autonomic, immune, and cardiac, are commonly measured. Data collected routinely by health-care organizations such as attendance at appointments or health outcomes may be useful, but these data may be incomplete or only give indirect evidence of the target behaviors or outcomes. Finally, the context of measurement may determine what is possible: ill patients could be burdened by a long questionnaire; health-care professionals may have limited time and opportunity to respond to assessments and measures may need to be adapted for a clinical environment. The following sections address measures of key psychological constructs, health-related behaviors, and responses to health, illness, and health care.",

      "abstract": "The ‘Executive Functions’ (EFs) of inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility enable us to think before we act, resist temptations or impulsive reactions, stay focused, reason, problem-solve, flexibly adjust to changed demands or priorities, and see things from new and different perspectives. These skills are critical for success in all life's aspects and are sometimes more predictive than even IQ or socioeconomic status. Understandably, there is great interest in improving EFs. It's now clear they can be improved at any age through training and practice, much as physical exercise hones physical fitness. However, despite claims to the contrary, wide transfer does not seem to occur and ‘mindless’ aerobic exercise does little to improve EFs. Important questions remain: How much can EFs be improved (are benefits only superficial) and how long can benefits be sustained? What are the best methods for improving EFs? What about an approach accounts for its success? Do the answers to these differ by individual characteristics such as age or gender? Since stress, sadness, loneliness, or poor health impair EFs, and the reverse enhances EFs, we predict that besides directly train EFs, the most successful approaches for improving EFs will also address emotional, social, and physical needs.",

This evaluation has to be oriented, not only to the scores obtained, but how cognitive processes are deteriorated. In this sense, it is very important to pay attention to the strategies used by the subject to carry out each one of the tasks that we present to him, and the emotional factors that can influence in the success of the rehabilitation program like, for example, awareness of the deficits or familiar and social pressures.The neuropsychological rehabilitation program must take care of several fundamental issues: 1. The treatment of the altered cognitive functions (cognitive rehabilitation): the use of different principles like the restoration, the compensation or the substitution will be determined. 2. The modification of the dysadaptative behaviors (irritability, aggressiveness, etc.) by means of different operating techniques. 3. The professional readaptation or reintegration: one of the final objectives of the rehabilitation is the reintegration of the brain injured person in the work or studies that did before or in those for which is enabled. 4. The psychosocial support: it is impo0rtant to work with the relatives and the social surroundings, specially the paper of the associations and the support groups. The design of the rehabilitation program must be focused to the specific necessities of each individual patient. It is also advisable to combine the individual and group treatment sessions.",

The deficit may also affect AH's ability to acquire knowledge in circumstances where processing of visual location and/or orientation information is implicated in the learning process (e.g., learning to spell).",

Some focus primarily on the development of student and neophyte psychologists into competent practitioners (e.g., Bernard & \nGoodyear, 1998). For example, Bernard and Goodyear defi ned supervision as:An intervention provided by a senior member of a profession to a junior member, or \nmembers of that same profession. This relationship is evaluative, extends over time, and \nhas the simultaneous purpose of enhancing the professional functioning of the junior \nmember(s), monitoring the quality of professional services offered to those clients she, \nhe, or they see(s) and acting as the gatekeeper for those who are to enter that particular \nprofession. (p. 6)This defi nition seems quite client evacuated. Others see supervision as important for practitioner development but consider the primary role as ensuring the safety, welfare, and health \nof clients in practitioners’ care (see Van Raalte & Andersen, 2000). For this chapter, we will \ndefi ne supervision quite broadly as what happens when two people sit down and discuss \n(or peripatetically converse about) the professional activities, experiences, or cases of one \nof the dyad. Meta-supervision would be similar with two people discussing the supervision \npractices and experiences of one of the pair. These professional encounters can have inherent power differentials (e.g., graduate student-supervisor; beginning supervisor-senior metasupervisor) or these can be collegial (e.g., peer meta-supervision). The focus can be primarily psychologist/supervisor development, or the emphasis could be client/supervisee health and \nwelfare, or both.",

Following this, the risk factors identified for pregnancy-related anxiety (i.e., characteristics or traits associated with an increased risk of pregnancy-related anxiety) are described. Our review of the literature showed that there are three antecedents necessary for the occurrence of the pregnancy-related anxiety: (1) a real or anticipated threat to pregnancy or its outcomes; (2) self-doubt about one's ability to control or cope with the situation, also called a low perceived control; and (3) excessive thinking and cognitive activity about potential adverse consequences. As described in this chapter, multiple risk factors contribute to anxiety during pregnancy. Some of these factors are common contributors for general anxiety and pregnancy-related anxiety; however, there are some factors that are only associated with pregnancy-related anxiety but not general anxiety or have stronger associations with pregnancy-related anxiety. Finally, this chapter includes a brief discussion of the implications of knowledge of the risk factors and antecedents in the practice for screening and management of pregnancy-related anxiety.",

      "abstract": "Anyone who has ever worked in a formal organization has likely experienced some form of workplace dysfunction at one time or another, and at times to a startling degree. Not only do workplace dysfunctions frustrate and demoralize people on the “receiving end” ‐ often those in subordinate positions ‐ they undermine an organization’ s morale, productivity, and future development. In extreme cases, they may jeopardize the survival of an organization, or one of its major units. This workshop will describe and demonstrate a teaching activity that: (1) identifies and highlights several common workplace dysfunctions, and (2) coaches students in developing strategies for dealing or coping with various dysfunctions. The purpose of the workshop is to familiarize instructors of business courses with a framework for describing workplace dysfunctions, and to provide them with tools to implement a student activity on workplace dysfunctions, in a business course.",

      "abstract": "Adults bring attitudes with them into the learning situation that markedly affect their ability to learn or their motivation. Recent research indicates that those adults with strong feelings of power lessness will fail to learn control-relevant information. Adults will be more motivated to listen to and to read content which may increase their competence in a current situation. If a strong need conflicts with information given, the information will not be learned. If sufficient rationalizations have been built to defend certain behavior, educational programs to change the behavior will be ineffective. As an adult assumes a new role, he goes through stages of vacillation between the old role and the new, overlearn ing behavior appropriate to the new role and integration of the new role into other roles. The adult's attitude toward role-relevant learning will depend upon his current stage of role mastery.",

      "abstract": "The article deals with the usage of the paradox in the family consulting by social worker. Social worker receives invitation to work with more than one person at the same time very often, and very often the object of such multi-personal help is a small and specific group - a family. On the one hand, there would be no time for social worker to know the family better and/or to make the personal close relationship with family members, on the other hand, the family would have no motivation to solve its problems independently or to change something in the family. Under such circumstances the usage of proper method in family consulting becomes the matter of great importance for social worker. The method of paradox would be recommended. The paradoxical communication with problem family can help to soothe the family members, to discuss and express the symptom, and to stimulate new actions. The paradox could be used by such means: neutral answer to emotional statement, permission to act symptomatically, stimulation of delay of decision making, permission to stay in crisis, prohibition to do what no one wants to do, prediction of symptom’s recurrence, overestimation of symptom’s meaning, positive estimation of symptom, stimulation of symptom behavior, request to teach symptom behavior, connect symptom behavior and positive behavior. Methods of simulation of symptom, prescribed inactivity, reframing, metaphor, responsibility for symptom, and supporting of role are discussed in the article. The application of methods in practice is also presented.",

Perhaps you often worry about whether your memory will cope, realizing as you do that you have not only the music and the words to remember but the blocking as well, if your performance is staged. The human mind remembers almost everything that happens to it, but sometimes the information cannot be recalled. When you say, “I can’t remember,” you actually mean that your memory is (temporarily) blocked. You will be pleased to know that it is rare for human beings to forget information altogether and even more pleased to be told that, like any other mental skill, memory can be enhanced in two ways: By linking it to the learning methods that suit you best (you do have your own personal way of learning-visually, kinesthetically, verbally, or any combination of these).",

As a content-analytic approach, this procedure assesses the attitudes of the speaker and the degree of like or dislike the speaker associates with another. Assessments of verbal immediacy typically include students' perceptions of their teacher's verbal behaviors or teachers' self-reports of their own behaviors. The 17-item measure of verbal immediacy has demonstrated consistently high reliability. Verbal immediacy behaviors have been found to correlate positively and significantly with affective learning (and behavioral commitment) and cognitive learning but negatively with learning loss. Research on immediacy in the classroom should rely on assessments of both verbal and nonverbal immediacy.",

      "title": "Processes of Self‐Management Using Evaluation Based On Distance from Average Solution (EDAS)",
      "abstract": "People with good self-management skills can effectively regulate and control their feelings, thoughts, and actions in a range of situations. Strong self-management skills allow employees to set goals on their own while making every effort to achieve them. Such employees understand how important it is to control their emotions and behavior at work. Employers like people with high self-management skills since it can be challenging for someone to control their emotions and thoughts. As a result, they might end up shouting at a client and saying harsh things to their coworkers. Self-management skills enable people to exercise more self-control, which leads to wiser professional judgements. Important jobs and activities, as well as fulfilling research goals, call for little diversion and a good capacity for concentration (4). The most crucial tasks are identified, prioritized, and concentrated on by researchers, who also try to avoid distractions. In order to efficiently handle their time, simplify daily tasks, and keep crucial information and things close at hand, researchers create organizational systems. Finally, they get ready to start the job at hand. They arrive early for classes, meetings, and presentations. After leaving for the day, they make plans for the next day. A novel and effective MCDM is designed based on the separation to the mean solution evaluations (EDAS). In this manner, alternatives are chosen depending on how much they deviate analysis, the EDAS approach (Avg evaluation adjusted for distance from solution) is the best choice. The solution with the greatest separation from the ideal is short range and negative, although the comparison between these distances is insignificant. Alternative: Overall sample n 605, 6th graders in 309, 8th graders in 296. Self-management strategies, perceived barriers, Perceived barriers, Outcome expectancy. Results: From the result it is seen that Outcome expectancy is got the first rank where as is the perceived barriers is having the lowest rank.",

Det ar lattare att peka mot ”de andra”, de som inte hor hemma pa arbetsplatsen an att komma tillratta med arbetsplatsens interna problem.

Manga arbetsplatser kannetecknas av oenighet, motsattningar och konflikter, dar bade forovaren och den utsatta personen ar anstallda. Forovarens intention kan vara att skada och uppna makt, men det kan ocksa saknas intention och i dessa fall ar forovaren omedveten om det egna beteendets effekter for andra (Arbetsmiljoverket, 2011).

Det finns saledes ett behov av att utveckla arbetssatt som okar medvetenheten. Exempel pa forekommande beteende ar, orattfardigt ledarskap, bristande respekt, ohovlighet, forolampande beteende (vilka kan benamnas sa som ”mentalt vald”) eller marginaliserande, minimerande, etc. (”tyst vald”). Orsaker till psykosociala arbetsmiljoproblem kan vara brister i ledning, otydliga organisationsformer och laga grader av fortroende och tillit som ger upphov till vantrivsel och mindre del effektivt arbete. For att na god produktivitet med hog grad av effektiv arbetstidmaste resurser laggas pa trivselstarkande aktiviteter och starka organisationskulturen.

      "abstract": "Although it is quite easy to conceive of a number of conventionalised impoliteness formulae that, depending on context, do not lead to the hearer’s evaluations of impoliteness, there are many situations when the speaker aims to be genuinely impolite and does not try to mitigate his/her verbal behaviour. This paper reports the findings of an analysis of twenty-nine genuinely impolite verbal behaviours that occurred in the Big Brother UK 2012 house. The main objective of this study is to examine the triggers for genuine impoliteness and determine which aspects of the hearer’s face and rights s/he claims for him/herself are targeted in such interactions. The results reveal that impoliteness among the housemates is triggered by previous impolite (non-)verbal behaviour, implied negativity or personal dislike of the target. The speaker, in his/her turn, tends to associate the target with a negative aspect or behaviour, question his/her mental, emotional state or knowledge, deny the freedom of expression or participation and, finally, warn or threaten the target.",

      "title": "ACUTE AND CHRONIC EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL: SOME INSIGHTS FROM COGNITIVE SCIENCES",
      "abstract": "Alcohol consumption may alter the behaviour of a drinker through several different mechanisms that lead to transient changes in the cognitive functioning of the drinker. In some cases, alcohol users and abusers begin to suffer from a disorder characterised by a certain “myopia” for future consequences, where the negative consequences associated with drinking (e.g., relationships, medical problems, etc.) do not lead to drinking moderation or cessation. Interestingly, this abnormal cognitive functioning is often seen in these individuals even when they are sober.This paper reviews evidence in support of the notion that the acute effects of alcohol disrupt primarily at least three key cognitive processes that are critical for flexible interaction with a changing environment: (1) the response to alcohol cues, which acquire new properties of quickly grasping attention and generating strong motivation to have a drink; (2) the individual’s ability to exert control over this tendency to seek reward, and to volitionally inhibit or suppress a prepotent responding to alcohol cues; and (3) the individual’s ability to detect an error when an incorrect response is initiated, or to detect action slips, so that for instance when driving a car is intended, the stopping of alcohol consumption becomes difficult. Finally, cognitive and brain electrophysiological aspects of binge drinking are discussed. In order to improve prevention, the identification of susceptibility factors to these alcohol effects should be challenged in further investigations.",

      "abstract": "It is common nowadays to hear people speak of Management by Objectives. But it is not so common to hear the relevant but often ignored question, ‘By whose objectives?’ If the question were asked someone designing an effective ‘management’ learning programme, the answer should be loud and clear as ‘by the learner's objectives.’ This is so because the objectives of the learner are in full control of what is learned, how fast it is learned, how well it is learned, and for how long it stays learned. That is, the learner makes the choice of what is learned and/or unlearned, he learns what impresses him most (whether he is expected to learn such things or not) and leaves out the experiences that do not impress him at all (whether they are ‘important’ or not). This assertion of conscious will on the behaviour of the adult human being makes it imperative that for any learning programme to be effective, the learning material to be presented to the adult, must be made to be as near as possible to what he would have freely chosen (to satisfy his learning needs — why want to learn) in terms of content (what to learn with), methodology(ies) (how to learn), time (when to learn), duration (for how long to learn formally, location (where to learn), and facilitators (people to help him learn). Hence the need for a designer to put all these items together optimally for effective learning.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACTPerson with disability (PWD) can be defined as an individual who cannot perform/ having problems with handling daily activities in a normal way (either in total or in part), due to the lack and/or defects in their physical being or mental health. Mental disabilities, such as autism and dyslexia, are commonly caused by disturbances of neural circuit and the structure of the neuronal cell, itself. Past studies on the reading capability of the mentally challenged individuals have been done, but none involving the reading of al-Quran. Currently, the reading of al-Quran capability by this group is limited, as there is no specific technique of  teaching and learning for them. Al-Quran is considered as an antidote and a blessing for Muslims, in fact the recitation of Surah al-Fatihah (first surah) is obligatory in a prayer/ solat. Therefore, various methods have been put forward to facilitate Muslims to learn to read al-Quran such as al-Baghdadi and Iqra’ techniques. However, none or very few of these techniques are being applied to the mentally challenged group. Hence, this article focused on the autistic group and aimed to reveal methods of teaching of al-Quran sourced from the Islamic tradition (the Quran, hadith and writings of Islamic scholars). Employing documentation method and analysis of Islamic tradition sources, this preliminary study was conducted prior to an advance study focusing on the efficiency of techniques used in teaching al-Quran reading to autistic children. Although the methods needed to teach al-Quran to people with disabilities are not specifically mentioned in the sources from Islamic tradition, however, there is information from which guidelines applicable in the teaching of al-Quran for them can be formed.",

      "title": "Short-Term and Time-Limited Work",
      "abstract": "One of the differences usually identified between counselling and psychotherapy relates to the issue of length of treatment. In general, psychotherapy is more likely to be long-term and/or open-ended. Counselling is often short-term and/or time-limited. It is useful to be clear that there are two different elements at play here, the actual length of time and the question as to whether there is a set time frame before the work starts. Open-ended work can be short-term, and long-term work can be time-limited, as in a contract for 2 years of psychotherapy. There can of course also be short-term time-limited work, for example if what is offered is 6 sessions of counselling. Different problems and opportunities arise with each kind. There are differences in the approach to issues of time between the trainings for psychotherapy and counselling. This has an effect on the mind-set of psychotherapists and counsellors, particularly at the start of their careers. In psychoanalytic psychotherapy trainings there is a requirement to see a certain number of patients for a certain time. Trainees typically have to see patients regularly for the 18 months or 2 years before being eligible for qualification. Even a small shortfall can mean that that work may not count towards the clinical requirement and keeping the therapy going can feel like an end in itself.",

Les analyses indiquent que la memoire a long terme verbale exerce une influence sur les capacites de cooperation, la qualite du travail et la presentation personnelle. La capacite d’apprentissage d’informations verbales joue un role dans les habitudes de travail. La memoire de travail qui permet le traitement et le maintien de l’information a court terme ne semble pas exercer une influence sur le comportement au travail. Enfin, les symptomes negatifs determinent en partie les habiletes sociales et la presentation personnelle. Les resultats des interventions cognitives montrent leur efficacite pour compenser les deficits cognitifs dans l’insertion professionnelle et sociale.",

      "title": "Performance-Based Assessment",
      "abstract": "Teaching and assessment go hand in hand. In the classroom, teaching cannot be truly effective if it is not linked to some form of authentic assessment. Likewise, assessment is useless if it is not based on what has been, or is to be, taught. Although this may sound obvious, teachers sometimes forget the close relationship between the two. Performance-based assessment requires students to demonstrate their learning and understanding by performing an act or a series of acts. This type of assessment is appropriate to use in a project-based, problem-based, or inquiry-based science classroom because it is consistent with the way students learn--by investigating a question or problem using tools and materials (i.e., performing an act). Since students in a project-based classroom learn by producing a product or performing an act, it is only fitting for them to be assessed using methods similar to those used to teach them--thus, aligning assessment with instruction. This article provides two common examples of performance-based assessments that science teachers can use in (or adapt for) their classrooms and a discussion of their strengths and limitations. FIGURE 1 Structured-performance task. Materials: You have a piece of potato, a bottle of water, three glasses (cups), sodium chloride (NaCl), a set of measuring spoons, a knife, and a watch. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Instruction: Design and perform an experiment to investigate what happens when a potato is placed in salt water and answer the following questions. Assessment task/questions: 1. What happens to the potato when the NaCl concentration is at zero? 2. What happens to the potato when the NaCl concentration is very low? 3. What happens to the potato when the NaCl concentration is very high? 4. Write your results on the worksheet provided, including an explanation of your observations. Assessment examples Figure 1 represents a structured-performance task. In a structured-performance task, the student is provided with all necessary materials, a set of instructions, and assessment questions. Inquiry can be included in structured-performance tasks by asking students to design some of the experimental procedures themselves. The student is evaluated based on whether he or she * follows directions correctly and uses suitable procedures, u arrives at the appropriate answers, and * understands and is able to explain the answers. In Figure 2, a typical open-ended performance task is presented. In an open-ended task, a case or problem description is followed by a broad and open-ended task or question. Student responses vary because there is no single approach to solving the problem. The teacher should look for critical thinking, evidence-based reasoning, and problem-solving skills: * Does the student have a clear procedure for addressing the problem? * Can the student explain the procedure? * Does the student provide evidence to support the proposed solution? Scoring Performance tasks can be scored to assess students' science-process skills as well as their understanding of science content. Scoring procedures vary depending on the focus and intended outcomes of the performance task. For instance, the California Golden State Examination for laboratory-performance tasks focuses on mastery of scientific methods, problem solving, and understanding of scientific concepts (CDE 1993). The Connecticut Academic Performance Test focuses on science-process skills, such as the ability to define a problem, design an experiment, reason logically, make inferences and conclusions that are consistent with observations, perform with minimum errors or misconceptions, and communicate clearly (Greig, Wise, and Lomask 1994). Strengths Performance-based assessment allows the student to construct his or her own answers as opposed to simply choosing from a list. …",

      "abstract": "Wellness is often intimidating. Pursuing it requires significant commitment and carries emotional risk/vulnerability [1]. While fear can be a strong motivator, it can also be the reason one may not try or follow-through with a plan. In most cases, fear prevents us from being able to accomplish what we wish to. In the case of wellness, we found that due to the commitment many were challenged by the fear of not being able to achieve the results and goals they had set for themselves. For example, if one was never taught, or had modeled, how to live a life full of joy, love, and wellness, they will fear a life different than what they were taught, whether by observation or directly. Occasionally it can be more difficult and painful to break a pattern than to live in it [2]. The path to wellness will likely be unique for each and every one of us.",

      "abstract": "This chapter presents several guidelines for fatigue reduction. These guidelines may be divided into two categories—(1) fatigue prevention and (2) fatigue reduction. Fatigue and the work/rest situation are recognized as a problem. Fatigue is related to long daily work hours, especially if there is a lack of sleep. Occasionally, fatigue is due to long weekly work hours, perhaps combined with shiftwork. From a fatigue viewpoint, a rest is a rest. In addition to the coffee break, there are three types of at-work breaks—(1) microbreaks (short breaks of a minute or less), (2) informal breaks (work interruptions, training), and (3) working rest (a different task using a different part of the body, such as answering the phone vs. keying data). Fatigue can affect different parts of the body such ascardio-vascular system, skeletal-muscular system, and the brain. The cardio-vascular system is primarily affected by heavy work such as manual material handling. The skeletal-muscular system is primarily affected by postural static work (e.g. standing) and manipulative work. The brain is affected by information overload (concentration and attention) jobs. However, a serious problem is information underload (boredom). Another serious problem for the brain is lack of sleep.",

      "abstract": "At least half of all employees have quit a job at some point because of their supervisor. People complain of bosses who bully them, micromanage, steal credit, hoard information, and otherwise make them unhappy—which threatens their productivity and the organization’s success. But don’t despair if you don’t get along with your boss. This article lays out steps you can take to improve the situation: Practice empathy. Behavioral research and neuroscience suggest that being mindful of the pressures on your boss and responding empathetically can trigger reciprocal support. Examine your role. Consider how you might be contributing to a negative dynamic, and seek training or advice to help you change your behavior. Talk to your boss. Start by asking how you can improve your performance and the relationship. If that isn’t fruitful, launch a frank conversation about the dysfunction in your interactions. Go to HR. As a last resort—and only if you have evidence to show that your boss is unfit—file a formal complaint. Leave. If you see no potential for change, it’s probably time to start job hunting.

      "abstract": "Everyone is stressed to some extent. The way you respond to stress, on the other hand, has a significant impact on your overall well-being. Stress is defined as any type of change that causes physical, emotional, or psychological strain. Stress is your body's reaction to anything that requires your attention or action. Students are exposed to a wide range of potentially stressful situations in their daily academic lives, which can have a negative impact on both their academic achievement and their health. Among the factors that may be weakened by academic stress are self-efficacy expectations, which are regarded as one of the most important determinants of student engagement, persistence, and academic success. Sometimes the best way to deal with stress is to change your situation. Other times, changing your response to a situation is the best strategy. Short-term and long-term stress are both possible. Both can cause a variety of symptoms, but chronic stress can take a serious toll on the body and have long-term health consequences. As a result, they must be educated on healthy coping strategies. Counselling sessions and other student support systems must be better organized to address issues such as career guidance, healthy coping behaviors, time management, and improving self-esteem among those affected. It is also important to pay attention to making the study environment in the classroom less stressful and free of excessive academic load (Joseph, 2021). This would accomplish the aim of reducing academic stress, improving academic performance, and minimizing anxiety. This review article aims to discuss the causes and coping strategies for adolescents dealing with academic stress.",

      "abstract": "All aspects of human life rely on the most important cognitive ability that man has been endowed with, namely, memory. Some cognitive tasks such as consecutive interpreting put high demands on this powerful ability to the effect that it needs special training to cope with those demands. The interpreter is required to perform a number of complex cognitive activities in order to transpose the original message from one socio-cultural environment into another. Unless his memory is able to perform well, his task will be adversely affected. In this paper, an attempt is made to suggest a number of steps that provide special training to novice interpreters with the aim of improving the performance of their memory. This is done in a preparatory training course that does not involve consecutive interpreting but working from and into the same language. If the instructor manages to help the trainee overcome memory problems in advance, he can smoothly introduce him to the process and strategies of consecutive interpretation proper. The steps suggested proceed over three phases: (1) attentive listening, meaningful analysis and visualizing, (2) anticipation and note-taking, and (3) rephrasing.",

      "title": "The Evaluation of the Major Characteristics and Aspects of the Procrastination in the Framework of Psychological Counseling and Guidance.",
      "abstract": "Abstract It is important to understand causes and consequences of procrastination that is appeared common among general and academic population. Procrastination affects people in various domains of life such as academic, professional, social relationships, and finance management. A person with high procrastination may lose his/her work, drop out from school, or may endanger his/her marital life. Similarly, High procrastinators might increasingly experience psychological distress related to lack of sense of personal control, self-worth and lack of sense of self-perceived personal ability as deadlines approach. The purpose of this study presents theoretical and conceptual frames of procrastination that is an important variable of individual difference and common in general and academic population. Key Words Procrastination, Conceptual Framework, Psychological Counseling. Procrastination is a phenomenon in which a person neglects to attend to a necessary responsibility, such as a task or decision, in a timely fashion, often despite their good intentions or inevitable negative and unpleasant consequences. It is not unusual for people to procrastinate occasionally, but for some, procrastination is a chronic problem that causes considerable psychological discomfort and distress. Procrastination is especially common in the general and academic populations. Ellis and Knaus (1977) point out that 95% of American college students procrastinate. In Solomon and Rothblum's (1984) survey, 46% of students reported that they procrastinate on academic tasks at least half of the time. Harriott and Ferrari (1996) refer to procrastination as one of the least understood minor human miseries, affecting 15-25% of the population during their lifetime. Procrastination is pervasive, affecting many facets of life. Milgram, Batori, and Mowrer (1993) identify five categories of procrastination; (i) life routine procrastination, (ii) decisional procrastination, (iii) neurotic procrastination, (iv) compulsive procrastination, and (v) academic procrastination. Each theory related procrastination tends to address one side of procrastination problem and not the others. For example, behavioral perspective used to in the reinforcement theory has been the prevailing explanation of procrastination under the behavioral paradigm. According to the tenets of behaviorism, procrastination can be explained in terms of incentives students have for off work and the absence of incentives for effort that contributes to goal attainment (Briody, 1980). Within the psychology literature, earliest theories of procrastination came from the psychodynamic tradition, a school of psychology that emphasizes childhood experiences as an influential factor in adult personality, unconscious mental process as influences on everyday behavior, and internal conflict as an underlying root of most behavior (Matlin, 1995). As such, psychodynamic literature primarily characterizes procrastination as a problematic behavioral manifestation of underlying internal psychic drama, often involving feelings about and towards one's family. Based on their extensive clinical experience working with procrastinators, Ellis and Knaus (1977) emphasized that the irrational nature of procrastination and the ability of the procrastinators to actively identify, dispute and restructure their irrational beliefs, self defeating cognitions to bring about desired behavioral and emotional chances. Although they have defined procrastination in technical sense as putting off something until a future time-postponing or deferring action on something you have decided to do( p.7). Ellis and Knaus (1977) characterized procrastination as resulting from three basic and, often overlapping causes: self- downing (negative and disparaging self talk), low frustration tolerance, and hostility. These three causes are viewed as manifestations of a cognitive style that involves unrealistic views about the self, others and the world. …",

The extreme form of an unsupportive relationship within a job setting is that of workplace bullying that comprises prolonged harassment or violence emanating from an individual or from a group, the latter being referred to as mobbing. Social support is fundamental to diminish stress in workplace settings.

      "abstract": "Consider the following pattern of events in special education teaching. You have identified a four-step procedure that is important for the current topic you are working on with your students. The topic might be in a curriculum area like mathematics or in a behavioural area such as social skills. You devise and carry out a series of lessons on this topic and, after a suitable period of practice, you are pleased to observe that the steps in the procedure are used successfully by most of the group. The procedure is also used on the day following the original teaching, when you reinstate the training situation and conditions: Many of the students produce the procedure without prompting! The next day you test to see whether the students will use the procedure in a situation which involves a modification to the conditions you used in the original training. You might change the format of the mathematics problem or the social situation. For many of the students it seems as though your teaching in the use of the procedure never occurred. They act as though the procedure no longer exists. They do remember it when you remind them of the original training situation, but they don’t do that unless you provide the reminder. They have learned the procedure but they can’t transfer that learning.",

The author individually distinguishes the features contributing to cyberbullying, in particular, the distance (there is no direct contact with the victim); anonymity (ability of the bully (aggressor) to protect himself from identification); prevalence (the ability to reach a large audience in the hiring process); support (the ability to involve an unlimited range of bullies in the hatching process); persistence (cyberbullying does not depend on the time and location of the bully (the aggressor) and his victim, no need for eye-to-eye contact); equality (absence of a bully (aggressor) need to take precedence in strength, social status, financial status, etc.).&#x0D; Features of cyberbullying include changes in behavioral and emotional state during or after use of mobile phone or other Internet-access devices; hiding certain facts of one’s online communication; avoiding school or friendly meetings; occurrence of unmotivated anger at home, destructive relationships with parents or teachers; change in mood, behavior, sleep or appetite; desire to stop using one’s PC or mobile phone; avoid talking about one’s PC or mobile phone activity; impaired learning; suicide attempts. The article deals with the classification of types of cyberbullying, where the following are separately distinguished: trolling, happy-sloping, flamingos, attacks, slander, defamation, impersonalization, fraud, alienation, cyber-harassment, sexual assault.&#x0D; The author identifies the reasons that contribute to the spread of this negative phenomenon. In addition, special attention is paid to the prevention of cyberbullying, where among the main are the education of cyber literacy, direct communication and interest in the life of the child, spending more time with the child, demonstrating the benefits of real communication over virtual.",

      "abstract": "ne important class of actions concerns tasks. Questions may be raised about whether we have succeeded or failed to do what we were trying to do. Not all the things we call actions are open to considerations of such success or failure. And questions of succeeding or failing are not raised solely about what we may have been trying to do. The paper attempts to classify various ways in which one may fail in an action; the array that results is explored in terms of evaluations rendered, responsibility, character, deliberate decision, and the like. The analysis of failing in what one has tried to do is made central. To be said to be trying to do something, one must have done the requisite things that constitute trying to do something and not to have succeeded yet in doing what one may have tried to do. “Trying to succeed”; in doing something is a redundant expression except for special cases; and though one may decide to try to do something, one cannot decide to succeed in this. One may actually succeed in doing what one has tried to do but one cannot deliberately succeed. Further distinctions are made between trying to do something and wishing to do something and believing that one is trying to do something; also, between failing in what one has tried to do, failing to try, failing to do something without failing in what one has tried to do, and failing to do something in respects in which one could never be said to have tried to do it.",

Nustatyta, kad viena dažniausių problemų yra mokymosi sunkumai, sąlygoti išorinių veiksnių, pvz., neracionalių mokymosi krūvių, mokymosi priemonių stokos ir pan. Nemažiau svarbūs yra ir vidiniai veiksniai, pvz., nepakankamai išlavėję studento valingas dėmesys, suvokimas, kalba ir t.t., bei asmenybės ypatumai, charakterio bruožai.

      "abstract": "Thinking includes cognitive processes implicit or explicit, or an internal mental perception of events or things, or a mental means by which a person deals with facts, things and events through the cognitive processes that are represented in the use of symbols, concepts and words. Thinking and style are its types, it is the outcome of interaction between several changes, such as an individual’s past, past experiences, ability to teach, level of education, level of education and social upbringing, cultural and civilizational factors and the influence of the surrounding environment. Work is one of the important factors that affect the life of a pensioner. Without it, the individual suffers from many social and psychological diseases, such as isolation, depression, anxiety, stress and fear. Work is the basis of respect for the individual and the respect of people for him, and the individual achieves many gratifications through his work, and when he loses it, he is exposed to many frustrated situations related to his inaction. Compulsory retirement is the second of the growth crises experienced by the individual after the crisis of adolescence. Compulsory retirement from work has become one of the most important problems facing them. Here, there are many studies that dealt with adaptation to retirement, which emphasized the importance of preparing for the post-retirement phase so that the individual avoids potential psychological disorders and to achieve a sound psychological and social harmony and a smooth transition to the retirement stage. Irrational thoughts come as a result of false cognitive precipitations in forced retirees, resulting in many socio-psychological problems, such as the problem of family relationships and a tendency to depression. Accordingly, the problem of the study was determined in a question: What is the effectiveness of a professional intervention program within the framework of strategies and methods of rational emotional-emotional-behavioral therapy in modifying the irrational thoughts related to the pressures of life for forced retirees?",

      "title": "Twenty questions about student errors",
      "abstract": "Abstract Errors in science learning (errors in expression of organized, purposeful thought within the domain of science) provide a window through which glimpses of mental functioning can be obtained. Errors are valuable and normal occurrences in the process of learning science. A student can use his/her errors to develop a deeper understanding of a concept as long as the error can be recognized and appropriate, informative feedback can be obtained. A safe, non‐threatening, and nonpunitive environment which encourages dialogue helps students to express their conceptions and to risk making errors. Pedagogical methods that systematically address common student errors produce significant gains in student learning. Just as the nature‐nurture interaction is integral to the development of living things, so the individual‐environment interaction is basic to thought processes. At a minimum, four systems interact: (1) the individual problem solver (who has a worldview, relatively stable cognitive characteristics, relatively malleable mental states and conditions, and aims or intentions), (2) task to be performed (including relative importance and nature of the task), (3) knowledge domain in which task is contained, and (4) the environment (including orienting conditions and the social and physical context). Several basic assumptions underlie research on errors and alternative conceptions. Among these are: Knowledge and thought involve active, constructive processes; there are many ways to acquire, organize, store, retrieve, and think about a given concept or event; and understanding is achieved by successive approximations. Application of these ideas will require a fundamental change in how science is taught.",

      "abstract": "Gedragsproblemen komen veel voor bij kinderen en volwassenen met ernstige verstandelijke en meervoudige beperkingen (EVMB), blijkt uit het promotieonderzoek van Petra Poppes. Het gaat dan om verschillende uitingsvormen: zelfverwondend gedrag, stereotype gedrag, teruggetrokken gedrag en agressief/destructief gedrag. Veel van deze typen gedragingen komen dagelijks of zelfs elk uur voor maar opvallend is dat begeleiders ervan uit gaan dat deze gedragingen geen grote gevolgen hebben voor kinderen en volwassenen met EVMB. Een mogelijke verklaring hiervoor is dat het gedrag gezien wordt als deel van de persoon, het gedrag is bij iemand gaan ‘horen’ of is in gedachten deel geworden van de beperking. Uit het onderzoek blijkt verder dat gedragsproblemen die wel gesignaleerd worden in de dagelijkse praktijk in meer dan de helft van de gevallen niet worden beschreven in het persoonlijk plan. Dat betekent ook dat er geen duidelijke afspraken zijn omtrent het voorkomen of verminderen van dergelijk gedrag. Een interventie gericht op kennisoverdracht over de mogelijke verklaringen voor- en gevolgen van gedragsproblemen is vervolgens ontwikkeld en in de praktijk geimplementeerd. De resultaten hiervan laten zien dat zorgprofessionals na het volgen van de interventie gedrag als ernstiger beoordelen, maar dit effect is beperkt. Verder onderzoek naar de wijze waarop het bewustzijn van zorgprofessionals ten aanzien van gedragsproblemen vergroot kan worden is belangrijk want het is geen optie eventuele gedragsproblemen niet op te merken en/of niet te behandelen. Dit leidt namelijk tot een situatie waarin we mensen met EVMB niet kunnen ondersteunen bij het behalen van hun levensdoelen en doelen die van belang zijn voor hun familie.",

Because, private life, which includes family, love or health problems, has an affect on business efficiency. Time management is based on determining what is important to us and making way to put that in the schedule of activities that we need to do for achieving our goals.\r\n To start to manage our time, we should make analysis of our habits and ways how we spend our time. There are various methods that can help with time management, some of them are Pareto principle, ABC rule, Parkinson’s law and Eisenhower delegation matrix. Time thieves are all activities that continuously and systematically waste our time and do not lead us to our goals. Some of most common time thieves are ineffective meetings, insufficient delegation of tasks, ineptitude in rejection, phone calls, social networks, paperwork, poor work habits, perfectionism, failure in setting priorities, and lack of defined goals. Lack of Time management can lead to several consequences for a person's health (mental and physical), especially after a long-term of stressing and overworking at work. Creating a life balance is a method of maintaining balance between work and private needs. It is important to understand that our jobs do not always present and describe us as persons we really are or what we want to be.

This situation is anxiety-producing for the teachers, as well as for the administrators. The Dictionary of Education defines attitude as “the predisposition or tendency to react specifically towards an object, situation, or value; usually accompanied by feelings and emotions” (Good, p. 49). Attitudes vary among students and cause children to respond to a situation either favorably or unfavorably. Thus children’s attitudes serve as guides to behavior and profoundly affect the progress made toward educational goals and the level and degree of children’s participation in educational activities. A positive attitude produces a motivational stimulus that promotes and sustains learning. On the other hand, a negative attitude results in a lack of persistent effort, a lack of motivation, an abundance of avoidance maneuvers, and various misbehavior problems.

We argue that these feelings of being moved are not limited to situations that are appraised as pro-social but elicited when someone surpasses an internal standard. In line with these predictions, people were moved by relationships and success (Study 1), by reunion, separation, success and failure (Study 2) and by social, environmental and sports achievements (Study 3). In all three studies, the elicitation of these feelings was partially mediated by appraisals of surpassing social or achievement standards. In line with this, ratings of meaningfulness were closely associated with feelings of being moved and moving stimuli elicited behavioural intentions such as spending time with family and friends, helping others and/or achieving something in life. Thus, moving situations may remind us about what we perceive as meaningful and thereby help us to act accordingly.",

      "title": "Being moved by meaningfulness: appraisals of surpassing internal standards elicit being moved by relationships and achievements",
      "abstract": "People can be moved and overwhelmed, a phenomenon typically accompanied by goose-bumps and tears. We argue that these feelings of being moved are not limited to situations that are appraised as pro-social but elicited when someone surpasses an internal standard. In line with these predictions, people were moved by relationships and success (Study 1), by reunion, separation, success and failure (Study 2) and by social, environmental and sports achievements (Study 3). In all three studies, the elicitation of these feelings was partially mediated by appraisals of surpassing social or achievement standards. In line with this, ratings of meaningfulness were closely associated with feelings of being moved and moving stimuli elicited behavioural intentions such as spending time with family and friends, helping others and/or achieving something in life. Thus, moving situations may remind us about what we perceive as meaningful and thereby help us to act accordingly.",

This tier involves a collaborative process that provides additional resources, training, and/or support to the teacher to help meet the distinct academic and/or behavioral needs of the student. Tier 2, in part, constitutes what has been referred to as the pre-referral process. Due to the nature of Tier 2, it tends to be more collaborative than Tier 1 and typically requires a team approach. Depending on the nature of the class and the classroom environment, it may be difficult for teachers to provide the specific information and details necessary to determine the appropriate interventions. In those cases, further assessment, analysis, and decision-making must occur before the proper course of action is determined. How Tier 2 is specifically implemented may differ from school to school, but there are two common approaches used in this decision-making process, standard protocol and problem-solving.",

      "abstract": "We present here a framework for a systematic study of attitudes expressed by speech. Although the term “attitude” is commonly used to refer to phenomena at several different levels, we shall assign separate terms to each of these levels for the sake of clarity. The term “ attitude” can refer both to a person and an object (either concrete or abstract), here we shall be concerned only with personal relationships. Stances: Those (attitudes) related to official relationships, often influenced by social factors together with long-term personal factors (such as commanding, subordinate, etc.) Attitudes (in the narrow sense): Those referring to private but mid- to long-term relationships, often involving the whole personality (such as kind, friendly, remote, etc.) Manners: Those (attitudes) referring to short-term but somewhat consistent individual behaviors/acts (such as polite, rude, abrupt, etc.) For example, when a teacher tries to call the attention of a young child to an imminent danger, his/her utterance will have commanding stance, kind attitude, and abrupt manner simultaneously. Although in real life these distinctions are not always clear-cut, our data collection is based on this principle. The result of a preliminary analysis supports the validity of our approach.

In addition, active listening consists of verbal strategies (e.g., asking clarifying questions), whereas passive listening is nonverbal in nature (e.g., providing backchanneling cues). The purpose of this article is to show that supportive listening is a central dyadic mechanism of providing, perceiving, and receiving beneficial emotional support. Supportive listening differs from other types of listening (e.g., listening during chit-chat or a conflict, informational listening) because it requires that the support listener demonstrate emotional involvement and attunement while attending to, interpreting, and responding to the emotions of the support seeker—a complex and challenging task.",

      "title": "Building Emotional Resilience at the Workplace",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONStress happens, and it happens to everyone. If workers do not have emotional resilience skills and habits to help support them during these times, their productivity declines. Work-related requirements such as precision and accuracy, problem solving, interpersonal communications, as well as speed and quality of work output will suffer. This general state may be considered part of presenteeism, which is typical when workers are demoralized, distracted, overwhelmed, or otherwise not coping well with stress. It is important to note that the stressors may be from work-related or personal issues, but frequently, stress in one sphere is accompanied by stress in the other. The good thing is that skills to maintain emotional resilience are effective across all settings, and these habits get stronger with use. EMOTIONAL RESILIENCE DEFINED Emotional resilience is the capacity to adjust to change, disruption, or difficulty while maintaining good functional capacities. Employees who have high emotional resilience are those who, when presented with stress (either work related or personal) can bounce back, bend without breaking, and cope without giving in, giving up, or breaking down. Emotional resilience is a skill that can be taught and learned, but to be effective, these skills need to be practiced and incorporated into a healthy lifestyle and a healthy work style.SOME STATISTICS ON EMOTIONAL RESILIENCE Clearly, we like to save our paid time off for fun, but when we are highly stressed, we dependably go to work and probably experience the employee perspective on presenteeism. To illustrate this point, consider these statistics: Gallup’s (1) global surveys on self-reported stress categorize results into three levels or zones of functioning, thriving, struggling, and suffering. In a report of these trends of workplace-specific data by nation, the United States was characterized as 56% thriving, 41% struggling, and 3% suffering. The reality of what life throws at us is captured by a poll that finds in the past year that 49% of all American adult respondents had at least one major stressor. The most prevalent was a major illness or injury, followed by death of a loved one, and the third most prevalent was problems at work (3). It is easy to imagine a “thriving” employee suddenly falling into the “struggling” category through a serious illness or injury or through the death of a loved one. None of us is immune to the reality of our lives. Lost productivity because of sick days varies among workers based on their stress zone. An average sick day in the United States is worth about $200 per day to employers. People who fall into the “suffering” category on an annual per-person basis cost $28,000 because of lost productivity and work days (i.e., the equivalent of 140 lost days). For those in the “struggling” zone, the cost is $6,168 (i.e., the equivalent of 61.8 lost days); and for those high in the “thriving” category, the lost productivity caused by sick days is only $840 (i.e., the equivalent of 4.2 lost days) (4). When polled, one of the least likely things that Americans who have been under “a great deal of stress in the past month” actually do is take time off from work. When under a great deal of stress, the three least likely actions are (3): ○ To take time off from work. ○ Engage paid service for household help. ○ Follow a formal self-help program. MANAGING ILLNESS OR ACHIEVING BEST SELF? From an employer’s perspective, what approach should be considered when making decisions on how best to apply resources to address worker stress and emotional resilience? Should an employer wait for negative consequences to occur and manage them at that time or proactively strive to prevent such negative outcomes, thus optimizing worker health, well-being, and achievement of their best selves? At HealthPartners, a not-for-profit, member-governed, integrated health system headquartered in Minnesota that serves more than 1.4 million health insurance members and more than 1.2 million patients, a proactive and intentional strategy has been deployed to address emotional resilience for its 22,500 employees. The strategy is applied to employees and to plan members because all employees live, work, and play in the same communities as the overall membership. Figure 1 illustrates the emotional resilience components of well-being, with resources and tools for those who are thriving, struggling, or suffering, which are available to HealthPartners members and employees. A description of the resources provided follows.Figure 1: Helping employees achieve their best self through emotional resilience.DESCRIPTION OF RESOURCES ACROSS THE STRESS ZONES Thriving and Struggling Zones As depicted in Figure 1, for those in the “thriving” zone and those just into the “struggling” zone, there are individual phone coaching and group coaching options from either health promotion professionals or behavioral health professionals depending on the topic. Similar to health promotion professionals who coach on topics of physical activity, healthy eating, sleep, and milder levels of stress reduction, behavioral health professionals take the lead when the topics are high levels of stress or the application of cognitive behavioral therapy. After completing an annual health assessment, the behavioral health professionals reach out to employees with the highest levels of stress, emotional health concerns, or chemical health issues to conduct at least three individual telephone consultations. The goal of these consultations is to identify those who may benefit from self-help resources and those who need professional face-to-face consultation with a mental health or chemical health professional. Self-help resources and guided learning resources available for employees include three-session group coaching programs called Healthy Thinking©, Healthy Communication©, and Social Connectedness©, as well as similarly structured group coaching sessions on physical activity and healthy eating. Online virtual coaching makes access to resources that address topics such as positive thinking, stress management, and healthy sleep available to a workforce that staffs six hospitals, several urgent care centers, and other 24/7 operations such as information technology help desks. These options also allow those who prefer online learning to access content in their preferred modality. One online option is an evidence-based program developed in England and used in the National Health Service during the past 14 years called Beating the Blues™. The program consists of eight 30-minute sessions that teach cognitive behavioral skills and supplies structured practice between sessions. It features video clips of five characters who describe and focus on how to deal with their life stressors. Beating the Blues™ teaches that what we think has a major impact on how we feel emotionally. Thinking things that are literally true helps mood regulation and better individual functioning and resilience. Challenging our assumptions and addressing negative self-talk is a major part of this program. After each session, participants have the option to hear how any of the characters did in their own practice. Because these video clips are only “earned” through session completion, this type of reward offers a kind of social connectedness that helps participants feel more supported. Mental health and chemical health conditions undermine emotional resilience through mood dysregulation. Some employees or their immediate family members need more support and guidance if they have a condition that undermines emotional resilience. HealthPartners provides an array of mental health and chemical health resources to those who may be in the “struggling” zone. On Your Way©, Moving Forward©, and Step by Step© are condition self-management programs designed to educate, encourage, and provide prompts and reminders related to treatment options for those with any of three sets of conditions (depression, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, and chemical dependency). Typically, about 12% of employees will have at least one of these conditions in any given year. Suffering Zone In 2003, HealthPartners created predictive analytics to identify those who without intervention are at high risk for future psychiatric crises and hospitalization because of complex mental or chemical health conditions or coexisting behavioral health conditions. Behavioral health professionals reach out and engage such persons and help educate them about their conditions, coordinate care, and create crisis plans through provider networks and community crisis options planning, intervention, and support. With participant permission, behavioral health professionals engage with the participant in three-way phone calls with supportive family or friends to answer questions and encourage healthy engagement. ADDRESSING MENTAL HEALTH STIGMA Mental health stigma remains pervasive in the general population. Stigma reduces the chances that all receive the treatments they need. HealthPartners teamed up with the Minnesota chapter of National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) and Twin Cities Public Television to create the award-winning Make It OK© campaign to address mental health stigma for employees, members, and community at-large. This campaign is supported by a Web site, www.MakeItOK.org, four half-hour programs created by Twin Cities Public TV, a speaker’s bureau, and engaging online interactive content that allows viewers to get to know real Minnesotans who have learned to live well with mental illnesses. Online organizational readiness toolkits that support employers, faith and civic communities, as well as health care providers and public health services are available to support implementation of the Make It OK© resources. SUPPORT FOR MANAGERS AND LEADERS In addition to a wide variety of content to support employee emotional resilience, HealthPartners provides training and tools for managers, directors, and executives on resilience. In 2014, the company included instruction and experience training on emotional resilience for approximately 5,000 leaders. An introduction to emotional resilience resources is included in new employee and new leader orientation that range from simple prompts and reminders (e.g., see Figure 2) to the ongoing available supports described above.Figure 2: Prompting for emotional resilience.CASE STUDY: WHAT CAN AN EMPLOYER DO TO BUILD EMOTIONAL RESILIENCE? Program Description As part of a comprehensive worksite well-being program, HealthPartners offers Emotional Resilience group coaching to employees. In 2013, and again in 2014, two related group coaching series were offered: Healthy Thinking© and Healthy Communication©. Both programs are designed to build skills intended to reduce stress and improve how individuals think and feel. Healthy Thinking© teaches participants to recognize negative self-talk and replace it with thoughts that are literally true. Healthy Communication© teaches participants to recognize their poor communication skills and replace them with good communication skills. These programs may be considered a “stress inoculation,” strategy, or a means of helping employees develop the skills to cope with stress effectively and prevent the impacts of unmanaged stress, such as irritability and listlessness. Program Participants This project was designed to measure 1-year outcomes resulting from participation in either emotional resilience coaching option offered at HealthPartners. As part of HealthPartners BeWell employee health and well-being program, the two coaching programs were available to all employees at HealthPartners corporate offices in the fall of 2013. Each series consisted of three 1-hour sessions. The programs were promoted with building-wide emails and flyers. A total of 83 employees participated in the emotional resilience offerings in 2013. Participants were predominantly female (85%), with an average age of 48 years. Outcomes associated with emotional resilience were measured using the Health Assessment (HA) available to employees. The HA is an online self-reported questionnaire that assesses a comprehensive set of self-reported health factors, provides personalized feedback, and connects participants to well-being program options. Collected before the start of the emotional resilience programs and again after 1 year, the HA results of program participants were evaluated relative to a comparison group of employees who did not participate in a well-being program in 2013 (N = 308). Outcome Measures The HA assesses a variety of health factors and is summarized by an overall 1,000-point score called the Total Health Potential Score (THPS). The THPS has a maximum of 1,000 points consisting of three subscores: the Modifiable Health Potential Score (MHPS), the Quality of Life Score (QOLS), and the Non-Modifiable Health Potential Score. All health potential scores are designed so that achievement of a higher score reflects better health (2). In this study, we tested the impact of resiliency coaching on THPS, MHPS, and QOLS. Also tested was the program’s impact on the Health Risk 10 Score (RISK10). The RISK10 consists of 10 risk factors known to influence the health of individuals. Because this measure is designed to reflect risk, the achievement of a lower score reflects better health (i.e., less risk). Emotional health concerns were measured using the question: “During the past 4 weeks, to what extent have you accomplished less than you would like in your work or other daily activities as a result of emotional problems, such as feeling depressed or anxious?” Questions related to life and job satisfaction also were considered: “In general, how satisfied are you with your life?” and “How satisfied are you with your current job?” Analysis For continuous outcomes, paired t tests were used to analyze change scores between baseline and follow-up for both resiliency coaching participants and the comparison group, respectively. For categorical outcomes, McNemar tests were used to analyze changes in the response distributions between baseline and follow-up. Values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results Participants in resiliency coaching experienced positive outcomes as measured by several summary scores. These included notable improvements in THPS (+4.5) and MHPS (+10.1) and reductions in RISK10 (-0.2), although only the MHPS showed statistical significance (Figure 3). In addition, both life satisfaction (+0.09) and job satisfaction (+0.2) improved among participants in resiliency coaching. No statistically significant differences were observed among the comparison group from baseline to follow-up. See Table for a complete listing of results.Figure 3: Modifiable health factors.TABLE 1: Preprogram to Postprogram Change for the Healthy Thinking and Healthy Communication CoursesKEY TAKE-AWAYS Among employees, Gallup poll indicators note that, at any given time, 56% are thriving, 41% are struggling, and 3% are suffering. However, at any given time, anyone — even those who are thriving — may experience a major stressor that puts them at risk for struggling. In fact, 49% of employees indicate that they had a major stressor in the past year and 26% “had a great deal of stress.” Whereas high-quality treatment and support options for those with depression and severe mental illness need to be available, building the capacity for high resilience responses allows employees to achieve their best self. Group coaching for emotional resilience can be highly effective for employees not only to bring their best self to work but also to be their best self at home and in the community. Employers can address mental health stigma through community-based partnerships that leverage multiple stakeholders’ interests. Three group coaching sessions were shown to have significant positive impacts on modifiable health factors at 1 year. In addition, notable improvements in job satisfaction and life satisfaction were recorded among employees of a large integrated health system.",

      "title": "Social Skills and Problem‐Solving Training",
      "abstract": "Abstract Social skills training is an approach to improving interpersonal functioning, based on the principles of social learning theory and the shaping of behavior through successive approximations to the desired goal. The primary emphasis in social skills training is on the clinician's use of modeling (demonstrating) specific social skills in simulated role plays, behavioral rehearsal of the targeted skills by the client in role plays, providing positive and corrective feedback following each role play to shape more effective skills, and developing home assignments for clients to practice the skills on their own. Problem‐solving training is teaching an approach to solving personal or interpersonal problems by following a standard sequence of steps: defining the problem, brainstorming solutions, evaluating the solutions, choosing the best solution(s), making a plan to implement the solution(s), and evaluating the success of the solution(s). Social skills and problem‐solving training are conducted together, and may be either the primary focus of group or individual intervention, or combined with other therapeutic techniques. These skills training methods have a strong evidence base supporting their effectiveness in a wide range of child, adolescent, and adult disorders, including developmental disorders (e.g., autism), schizophrenia, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse. These skills training approaches are also widely used in health and mental health prevention programs, improving relationships in the general population, and teaching employees effective interpersonal skills.",

      "title": "Spotlight on math anxiety",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Anxiety disorders are some of the most widespread mental health issues worldwide. In educational settings, individuals may suffer from specific forms of test and performance anxiety that are connected to a knowledge domain. Unquestionably, the most prominent of these is math anxiety. Math anxiety is a widespread problem for all ages across the globe. In the international assessments of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) studies, a majority of adolescents report worry and tension in math classes and when doing math. To understand how math anxiety takes effect, it has to be regarded as a variable within an ensemble of interacting variables. There are antecedents that facilitate the development of math anxiety. They concern environmental factors such as teachers’ and parents’ attitudes toward their students’ and children’s ability in math, societal stereotypes (eg, on females’ math abilities), or personal factors such as traits or gender. These antecedents influence a number of variables that are important in learning processes. Math anxiety interacts with variables such as self-efficacy or motivation in math, which can intensify or counteract math anxiety. Outcomes of math anxiety concern not only performance in math-related situations, they can also have long-term effects that involve efficient (or not-so-efficient) learning as well as course and even vocational choices. How can math anxiety be counteracted? A first step lies in its correct diagnosis. Questionnaires for the assessment of math anxiety exist for all age groups, starting at primary education level. Help against math anxiety can be offered on different levels: by educational institutions, by teachers and a change in instructional approaches, by parents, or by the affected person. However, much more research is needed to develop effective measures against math anxiety that are tailored to an individual’s characteristics and needs.

Furthermore, \nthe more attention that is given to learning and training, the \nbetter are the results for retention and transfer. Hence, distraction, or divided attention away from learning/training material \nis undesirable. This commonsense dictum is manifest in many \nforms, but some of these forms are not entirely intuitive, as discussed in other chapters and below, as they are refl ected in a \nvariety of attention-related training strategies.

      "abstract": "Workplace bullying refers to repeated, unreasonable actions of individuals (or a group) directed towards an employee (or a group of employees), which is intended to intimidate and creates a risk to the health and safety of the employees. Workplace bullying often involves an abuse or misuse of power. Bullying includes behavior that intimidates, degrades, offends, or humiliates a worker, often in front of others. Bullying behavior creates feelings of defenselessness in the target and undermines an individual’s right to dignity at work. Bullying is different from aggression. Whereas aggression may involve a single act, bullying involves repeated attacks against the target, creating an on-going pattern of behavior. “Tough” or “demanding” bosses are not necessarily bullies, as long as their primary motivation is to obtain the best performance by setting high expectations. Many bullying situations involve employees bullying their peers, rather than a supervisor bullying an employee. This paper highlights the reasons for bullying, its consequences and how to prevent this menace in Education Workspace.",

These examples serve to highlight the practical, everyday importance of attention. It is an often-mentioned human behavior because we all seem to appreciate that processing of any form of environmental information requires us to attend to that information. Most ``accidents'' are caused by failures or decrements of attention. This fact is now well-documented by studies of motorists using cellular telephones. Furthermore, attention is basic to all learning. As attention for new, incoming stimuli decreases, learning decreases. Clinicians recognize that all forms of therapy involve some form of learning. If the individual receiving treatment is not relegating the amount and type of attention required by a task, then incomplete, incorrect, or even no learning takes place. We also recognize that tests of other domains of cognition, such as language and executive skills can yield invalid assessments of those skills secondary to attentional deficits.",

The problem arises when we begin to make assumptions that classroom training can do either one of these effectively.

For organizations that are providing training in order to influence what people do...has there been consideration to the fact that what they might be trying to influence is a longstanding behavior or the fact that the work environment doesn’t support the desired change?

      "title": "Developing Your Idea for a Research Project",
      "abstract": "People may find themselves in school with a requirement to develop a research proposal or even to conduct a study. Others, for example, military officers, may be required to conduct research as they seek promotion through the ranks. These people are often at a loss about even how to begin. There are numerous strategies for identifying research problems of interest. First, identify the problems or issues that come up repeatedly in your practice area. What are the unsolved problems that take considerable staff time? What client/ family or institutional issues often give rise to frustration among the staff? What processes of care could be done better? What nursing practices or protocols are under review in your institution for revision? Any of these ideas could give rise to various types of studies. A survey or qualitative study could be designed to identify and better understand issues, or to explore how clients, families, or staff perceive them. A quasiexperimental or experimental study could be designed to compare the usual way of doing something with a new, improved way. An outcomes study could be designed to assess the impact of a policy or protocol change, or to test a clinical pathway. Such a study might be based on findings of the quality assurance staff. Perhaps in your institution there is a debate about resource allocation or shifting lines of authority, which may directly affect the way your unit cares for patients. Perhaps a study could be designed that will bolster your ability to advocate effectively on behalf of your clients and colleagues. I often suggest that people interested in identifying a research topic keep a pocket notebook in which they jot down their ideas as they arise. Nurses are often amazed at the long list of ideas that they quickly generate. Another fruitful approach is to consider what research the current literature in your area of clinical practice or expertise suggests. Most published research will include mention of further questions for study that have been raised. State-of-the-science review articles are extremely useful in identifying what is known about a given clinical topic as well as where the knowledge gaps or uncertainties lay. In addition, many clinical articles identify issues about which little is known, or about which the available information is contradictory or inconclusive.",

Deliberate practice involves goal-directed activities, which tend to be repetitive and to enable rapid feedback. Preferably performed individually, these activities tend to be effortful and not enjoyable. They can be carried out just for a few hours a day (but not so often that they become inefficient or even hurtful). This framework limits the role of inherited factors to motivation, general activity levels, and height in sports. No role is given to talent with respect to cognitive abilities. The deliberate-practice framework has been influential in the field of expertise research, and a large number of studies have been conducted to understand the role of practice in areas such as sports, games, the arts, and the professions. There have also been controversies surrounding this framework.",

      "title": "The Expiration of the Obligation to substitute for Fulfillment",
      "abstract": "When we talk about the discharge of obligation, we refer to the situation where a person stops fulfilling their commitments or promises. There can be several reasons for this. One common reason is the inability to fulfill obligations, which can happen due to significant pressure on the person, either from other commitments or difficult circumstances. In such cases, the person may find themselves unable to fulfill their promises and obligations. Another reason could be a lack of interest in one's obligations. For example, the commitment may no longer be important to them, leading the person to ignore their obligations and bypass them without consideration. Alternatively, the person's surrounding circumstances may change, making the commitment unattainable. This can happen when there are changes in the person's economic, health, or social status. In such cases, the person may find themselves unable to fulfill their obligations due to the changes in their life. It is important to note that the discharge of obligation can have a negative impact on personal and professional relationships. When a person fails to fulfill their obligations, they lose credibility and others' trust in them. This can lead to deteriorating relationships and loss of professional opportunities. Therefore, it is important for a person to be honest and committed to their promises and obligations to maintain good relationships and achieve success in life. For the importance of this topic, I have written this brief research to understand how the discharge of obligation through a substitute for performance works. The discharge of obligation through a substitute for performance means that the person has not fulfilled their obligations or promises. There can be several reasons for this, such as the inability to fulfill obligations, lack of interest in obligations, or even changes in circumstances that make the commitment unattainable. Sometimes, the discharge of obligation can have a negative impact on personal and professional relationships, as the person loses credibility and others' trust in them. Therefore, it is better for a person to be honest and committed to their promises and obligations to maintain good relationships and succeed in life. Acceptance by the creditor, in the event of fulfilling his right, in exchange for what is intended by it to be replaced by all his dues and the deserving thing that almost serves as a substitute for this fulfillment. There are two pillars for fulfilling in exchange. There must be an agreement between the creditor and the debtor to replace the original place of fulfillment with the transfer of ownership of something else from the debtor to the creditor. The eligibility must be available in both parties, and the will of both parties must be free from defects, without any mistake, fraud, coercion, or exploitation, and the agreement must have a place and reason. The reason is to fulfill the original debt, and the place is to replace the original place with the transfer of ownership of something else from the debtor to the creditor. The agreement to fulfill in exchange should be proved according to the general rules of evidence, on the condition that if the creditor proves that he accepted to receive something he is not entitled to without reservation, then it is assumed, until the evidence proves otherwise, that he agreed for it to serve as a substitute for fulfillment. Agreement on the fulfillment in exchange is not enough; it must also be implemented by actually transferring ownership from the debtor to the creditor. Consequently, fulfillment in exchange cannot be done through a will, such as if the debtor bequeaths money to fulfill the debt, because a bequest can always be revoked and ownership of the bequeathed does not transfer to the beneficiary during the life of the testator. Also, fulfillment is not achieved if the debtor retains the right to reclaim the property he handed over as fulfillment of his debt.",

      "abstract": "There is evidence that beliefs (cognitive vulnerabilities) and goals (to prove self-worth) contribute to depression but little consideration of how they work in tandem. Synthesizing research on beliefs and goals leads us to four propositions: (a) People with cognitive vulnerabilities often adopt self-worth goals (seeking to prove self-worth and to avoid proof of worthlessness). People with the opposite beliefs often adopt learning goals. (b) Stressors trigger depression largely because they lead people with self-worth goals to focus narrowly on goals to avoid proof of worthlessness. The same stressors do not lead people with learning goals to become depressed. (c) People with goals to avoid proof of worthlessness adopt defensive self-handicapping behaviors (e.g., effort withdrawal, rumination) when dealing with stressors, because those behaviors serve their goals. The same stressors lead people with learning goals to adopt constructive, problem-solving strategies. (d) A key to alleviating depression is fostering a shift from self-worth goals to learning goals and from the beliefs underlying self-worth goals to the opposite beliefs.",

      "abstract": "Apart from general practice, most of the helping professions now have an established culture of clinical supervision.1 Some professions, like counselling, consider supervision to be essential for sustaining reflective practice, and they have made it a requirement for continuing accreditation. Other professions, such as nursing, seem to be moving in that direction.2 Although it is sometimes seen as part of management, clinical supervision is properly regarded as something non-hierarchical, nonjudgmental, and focused on the practitioner rather than the organisation.3 It addresses the need for support and development, and it is also anchored in an awareness of performance standards, patient safety, and public accountability.4\n\nSupervision can be used to address the emotional impact of patient encounters, and to examine the technical aspects of case management, and issues within the team and workplace.5 There are many approaches to supervision, including one-to-one sessions or group meetings. These activities all share the same purposes.

      "abstract": "Abstract NOTE: The first page of text has been automatically extracted and included below in lieu of an abstract Student Preconceptions and Heuristics in Learning Design Introduction One conundrum in teaching design is that students will learn and practice a design method and later abandon that method in favor of a “seat-of-the-pants” approach. It is as if they had not learned the method initially. This sequence of learning and then abandoning begs a question: “What went wrong in the initial learning?” One major finding in the cognitive literature offers an answer to this question. The naïve preconceptions that students bring to a subject directly interfere with their learning.1,2 These preconceptions can interfere so strongly that some students don’t actually learn. When the learning session concludes, the students’ understanding reverts to their prior misconceptions. Consequently, in order for the new learning to take root, those preconceptions must be engaged and addressed during the learning. It seems reasonable that preconceptions affect design learning as well. A number of disciplines (most notably physics3) have extensively identified common student misconceptions. These lists of misconceptions are discipline specific, that is, misconceptions in one discipline do not identify misconceptions in an unrelated discipline. However, once misconceptions are classified within a discipline, instructors can engage them as part of teaching the course. This perspective highlights a fundamental hurdle for design instructors: students’ preconceptions about how to do design are not clearly identified. Without this knowledge, design instructors cannot systematically engage and address these preconceptions. Consequently, student learning in design is hampered. The intent of this study was to identify preconceptions students bring to design and to frame them in terms of the cognitive literature. The preconceptions were explored using two sequential focus group discussions based on the questions, “What did you learn about design?” and “What did you need to un-learn to do design?” The participants in this study had completed an intermediate level design class. The class used multiple design-build-test projects supported by lectures to teach design. The semester following this class, one design team was selected for the focus group discussions because they initially demonstrated low design ability but performed at a high level by the end of the term. The data supported two findings: 1. Knowledge flows back to students from their own design as real-world constraints are enforced. As the students learn from their design, they develop a conceptual framework of how their design works or does not work. As this conceptual framework develops, misconceptions can also develop within that framework. These misconceptions can be very robust, require multiple interventions to resolve, and interfere with correct understanding of",

      "abstract": "There are two ways for a situation to be uncertain. Subjective uncertainty refers to not knowing facts. Objective uncertainty refers to future events that have not been determined yet. A wide ranging literature review finds that subjective uncertainty inhibits behavior, increases conserving resources and willpower, and stimulates search for information – though in crude, sometimes dysfunctional fashion. In contrast, objective uncertainty calls for action, reflected in agentic control, increased arousal, and greater willingness to take risks. Again, some responses are irrational, such as exerting more effort for less expected reward, and betting more on uncontrollable future than past events. With both kinds of uncertainty, attention is mobilized and emotion is prolonged. Our review uncovered multiple signs that some uncertainty is beneficial and heightens enjoyment as a kind of spice of life, or, in some cases, as a welcome hope that a bad outcome might still be avoided.",

      "abstract": "Leaders play a crucial role in fostering (or inhibiting) cultures of learning. Their influence relates both to their own attitudes towards learning and to the ways in which they do (or do not) encourage learning for other people – both within their own teams and across functional and organizational boundaries.\r\n\r\nBeing open to learning involves feeling that the challenges of one’s role are recognised by others, especially those who have authority or sway over our careers. Recognition of the real difficulties and paradoxes that MPS leaders face might, therefore, help to encourage organizational learning which is constructive and rewarding for both individuals and the organization. However, securing such recognition is not straightforward in a policing context, where scrutiny is intense, risk is high, failure is inevitable, attributions of fault are often individualised, and even ‘damage limitation’ takes considerable leadership skill, effort and care.\r\n\r\nSome of these leadership challenges can be crystallised as various forms of asymmetry, or things being off-kilter or out of balance. These are significant for individual leaders and their organizations, because they can reflect and/or reinforce various forms of behavioural and cognitive bias and dissonance. The specific instances of asymmetry explored in this paper are:\r\n\r\nAgency\tHaving more responsibility for, than control over, events\r\n\r\nResponse\tReceiving and/or expecting more blame than praise\r\n\r\nReason\tExperiencing and/or expecting interpretations of failure based more on individual fault than on task or situational complexity",

These results are not uncommon in CFS and are supported by increasing research evidence (1,2).

Chronic procrastination which refers to a variety of postponing behaviors in a diverse settings of daily life is related to psychological problems such as anxiety, depression, and low self-efficacy, and etc. In addition, chronic procrastination can produce low academic/job performance and health problems. Research on procrastination and its relation with various psychological factors has identified that procrastination is not laziness or a lack of time management skill but rather than a complex property with cognitive, behavioral, and emotional variables. In addition, as studies have found that procrastination has different characteristics in the cognitive, motivational, emotional process, attempts have been made to classify subtypes of procrastination. The investigation of typological characteristics will help us offer sophisticated and effective therapeutic interventions. For a better understanding of relation between procrastination and adaptation/health, future study needs to take a multiple perspective approach to process variables involving in the development of procrastination.

Assertiveness is a learnable skill rather than a personality characteristic. The first step in assertiveness is recognizing the nature of one's problem in order to avoid the objectionable and usually ineffective practice of trying to solve other people's problems. A simple assertive approach is to suggest a solution. A more structured technique involves identifying the behavior that is causing a problem and expressing one's feelings about the problem (I-messages). The most powerful technique combines portions of suggested solutions and I-messages with a clear statement of consequences (DESC scripts). Although there may be a small number of circumstances where they are appropriate, acquiescence (temporarily forgoing one's interpersonal freedoms or role responsibilities) or aggression (insisting on one's own solution to the detriment of others) have several disadvantages.

Ego depletion is thought to undermine the capacity or willingness to engage executive control, an important determinant of success for many tasks. We examined whether ego depletion improves performance on a task that favours less executive control: insight problem solving. In two experiments, participants completed an ego-depletion manipulation or a non-depleting control condition followed by an insight problem-solving task (i.e., matchstick arithmetic). Participants in the depleting condition demonstrated greater insight problem-solving accuracy than those in the non-depleting control condition. Priming theories of willpower did not impact these results. Although ego depletion is widely regarded as a \"state of impairment\", attendant decreases in executive control may foster insightful thinking.",

      "abstract": "Workflow, loosely defined, is the set of tasks—grouped chronologically into processes—and the set of people or resources needed for those tasks, that are necessary to accomplish a given goal. An organization’s workflow is comprised of the set of processes it needs to accomplish, the set of people or other resources available to perform those processes, and the interactions among them. Consider the following scenario:These same methods that an organization uses to get work done, however, can begin to show stress under trying circumstances. When the ward is full and it takes 12 hours for a room to be readied for the next patient, that impact is felt throughout the organization. When the number of small interruptions outweighs the amount of planned work done in a given hour, that impact is felt in slower progress, lower job satisfaction, and potentially lower quality of care. In many situations, it is very clear to all what needs to get done. Where organizations differ is in how they do it. The examination of how an organization accomplishes its tasks often concerns the organizations’ workflow.In health care, as in other industries, some workflows are designed, while others arise organically and evolve. The systems and methods by which organizations accomplish specific goals differ dramatically. Some organizational workflows seem more straightforward than others. Most often, when workflow processes are looked at in isolation, the processes appear quite logical (and even efficient) in acting to accomplish the end goal. It is in the interaction among the processes that complexities arise. Some of these interactions hide conflicts in the priorities of different roles in an organization, for example, what the nursing team is accountable to versus the physician team and its schedule. Organizations also adapt workflows to suit the evolving environment. Over time, reflecting on organizational workflows may show that some processes are no longer necessary, or can be updated and optimized.",

      "abstract": "In this article, existing research investigating how school performance relates to cognitive, self-awareness, language, and personality processes is reviewed. We outline the architecture of the mind, involving a general factor, g, that underlies distinct mental processes (i.e., executive, reasoning, language, cognizance, and personality processes). From preschool to adolescence, g shifts from executive to reasoning and cognizance processes; personality also changes, consolidating in adolescence. There are three major trends in the existing literature: 1) All processes are highly predictive of school achievement if measured alone, each accounting for ~20% of its variance; 2) When measured together, cognitive processes (executive functions and representational awareness in preschool and fluid intelligence after late primary school) dominate as predictors (over ~50%), drastically absorbing self-concepts and personality dispositions that drop to ~3-5%; and 3) Predictive power changes according to the processes forming g at successive levels: attention control and representational awareness in preschool (~85%); fluid intelligence, language, and working memory in primary school (~53%); fluid intelligence, language, self-evaluation, and school-specific self-concepts in secondary school (~70%). Stability and plasticity of personality emerge as predictors in secondary school. A theory of educational priorities is proposed, arguing that (a) executive and awareness processes; (b) information management; and (c) reasoning, self-evaluation, and flexibility in knowledge building must dominate in preschool, primary, and secondary school, respectively.",

Systematic examination of these variations is crucial for illuminating the dynamic nature of learning and development – the ways that people construct activities under the influence of multiple factors interacting in complex ways, in context, over time. A study of adults learning to use a computer program illustrates three important patterns in the dynamic variation of adult cognitive microdevelopment: (1) each person’s performance levels vary within a range between upper and lower attractors during dynamic construction of a skill. (2) Performance moves through different pathways from a novice pattern to a transitional pattern characterized by scalloping (repeated building up and collapse of complex performance) to an expert pattern. Social scaffolding plays an important role in moving a learner toward the upper attractor. (3) Each person functions at diverse levels depending on demands of the task, domain, background, scaffolding, and capacity and thus shows asynchrony in level, not simple consistency. Tasks and situations attract specific skill levels that are often below people’s highest capacities.",

Chaplains vary widely in professional and personal backgrounds and experiences, which they often draw on in their work. Personal experiences can lead them to enter the field, enhance their empathy and strengthen their commitment. They have frequently faced significant trauma (e.g., parent's death) or helped family and/or friends with end-of-life challenges. Chaplains often entered other fields first (e.g., clergy, business or healthcare), but they often had incomplete or incorrect prior knowledge about the field. Prior experiences can also affect their work (e.g., in recognizing the power of silence). A sense of personal \"calling\" frequently leads chaplains to find their work deeply rewarding and sustaining. These data, the first to explore how and why chaplains enter the field, have critical implications for future practice, education and research.",

      "abstract": "The learning process is closely related to basic and high-order cognitive processes (i.e. attention, memory, and executive functions). Considering this, the learning process should be affected by the same stimuli which affect other cognitive processes. It's known that environmental stimuli modulate cognitive processes, especially emotional stimuli. However, knowing the influence of emotion on cognitive processes, there is little information about how emotionally salient stimuli affect cognitive processes, as well as learning from cognitive sciences. Most research focuses on how emotions facilitate attention, memory, and executive functions in educational contexts, but considering emotional contexts or emotional interactions, not the emotional features of the stimuli used in the learning process. In this chapter, we hypothesized, based on empirical and theoretical evidence, the different areas of learning in which emotional salience can be applied, differentiating whether it can serve as an advantage or disadvantage in the learning process.",

      "abstract": "The death of a patient is always a significant event; however, the unexpected death of a patient is immeasurably more significant and can strike the physician with devastating force, stressing her or his ability to cope to the very limit. There are several reasons for this. They range from professional (Was the death a result of incompetence or negligence? Were other professional factors involved that could have been foreseen, dealt with, or avoided?) to psychological (Was the professional psychologically attached to her patients, in general, and to this patient, in particular?) to spiritual (Did her personal beliefs and values affect her outlook on death in a way that might cause personal turmoil?). However, there is one factor that is almost invariably overlooked, yet it goes to the very heart of the situation. It concerns the ethical legitimacy of the feelings that are being experienced, and centers on 3 notions that are basic to medicine as a profession: the notion of a patient, the concept of healthcare, and the nature of medicine itself. What follows is a brief sketch of how these factors function, how they are interrelated, and how they may be resolved.\r\n\r\nReaders are encouraged to respond to George Lundberg, MD, Editor of MedGenMed, for the editor's eye only or for possible publication via email: ten.epacsdem@grebdnulg",

      "title": "Curriculum and Organisational Issues",
      "abstract": "The subject of problem-based learning can raise some surprisingly strong emotions, both in terms of the right process to use and the right curriculum model. For example, on the PBL Initiative Web site (director, Howard Barrows, n.d.), the minimum essentials for PBL are stated, and include: “Problem-based learning should not occur within a single discipline or subject.” Specifically for medical education, the recommendations are further specified: Problem-based learning must be the pedagogical base in the curriculum and not part of a didactic curriculum. Problem-based learning should not be episodic, added on to or mixed in with more traditional, didactic, teacher-directed, passive, memorization-based and lecture-based educational methods. (PBL Initiative) This requires a large-scale intervention, obtaining commitment, collaboration, and consensus from staff in multiple subject areas, followed by much planning and training. It can be quite discouraging for a teacher who can see many benefits in the PBL approach and would like to try out PBL “in the small.” While there are numerous benefits for implementing PBL throughout a curriculum—we will discuss in more depth later in the chapter—there is an alternative view of PBL as a pedagogical approach, one that can be applied at several levels, from a single session to a fully integrated curriculum. Ranald Macdonald (2001) puts it like this: So, what is the big deal with PBL? For me it’s nothing more nor less than the fact that problems, tasks, queries (Boud, 1995), or the every day necessity to learn to meet unexpected situations, form the starting point for learning. The real motivation for using it, whatever ‘it’ is, is a desire to improve the quality of student learning and to prepare students for future learning needs by giving them greater responsibility for their own learning now. As such, it doesn’t matter whether we adopt PBL across a whole programme, within a single subject, or as the basis for a single learning experience. It is the intention to provide a need to acquire knowledge, develop skills, or demonstrate applied understanding that is the starting point for PBL. In this chapter, we will explore some of the curriculum and organizational issues of implementing PBL, both “in the small,” that is at a module level, and “in the large,” throughout the curriculum.",

      "title": "Inverse Reinforcement Learning of a Dictionary of Primitive Tasks",
      "abstract": "Human behaviors feature a huge variety both in their nature and in their complexity, yet understanding and imitating them is a key requirement for robots to collaborate with humans or even to be accepted in their living environments. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) [6] consist in learning, from observation of a behavior, a reward function that models the agent’s intention, that we hence denote as task. Previous work in IRL [5] have shown that instead of directly mimicking the observed behavior, learning a model of the task can provide better generalization to new contexts. Often, one can think of common human behaviors as having a combinatorial structure in the sense that these complex behaviors can be understood as combinations of several simpler behaviors. For example, a child learning to play a new ball game won’t learn from scratch how to grasp a ball, how to throw it, or how to run. While observing a demonstration from the new game, the child would not focus on every position of each body joint during the demonstration, but rather recognize a set of basic behaviors, e.g. running to a position while keeping the ball in hands and then throwing the ball to an other position. In similar situations, a learning system would be expected to leverage the combinatorial structure of the demonstrated behaviors to improve its learning capabilities and eventually learn tasks of increasing complexity. The typical decription of IRL focuses on learning a single task from an expert, which, for non-trivial models of states and actions, already requires a huge number of demonstrations. Therefore one often uses adequate features to keep the number of required demonstrations feasible, which, however, requires prior knowledge on the task. In this work, we propose to learn a dictionary of features from several related but different tasks in order to reduce the amount of demonstrations required for each task and achieve transfer of knowledge between tasks. Some recent work addresses aspects of these questions. Levine et al. [4] introduce an algorithm to learn features to efficiently represent a task; Jetchev and Toussaint [3] present an inverse feedback learning approach to a grasping problem and demonstrated that enforcing sparsity of the feedback function is a way to discover the features relevant to the task. Babes-Vroman et al. [2] present an EM-based algorithm that performs clustering on unlabeled demonstrations of several tasks. Almingol et al. [1] also recently developed similar ideas. In this work we introduce an algorithm, based on the gradient IRL algorithm of Neu et al [5], to learn a dictionary of primitive reward functions that can be combined together to model the intention of the expert in each demonstration. Not only does it learn from demonstrations of several tasks, as in [2], but it also enables transfer of knowledge from one task to another. We performed two experiments on a toy problem on which we compare our factorial algorithm to learning separately the parameters that represent each task, denoted as flat learning. More precisely, we generate a random dictionary of features and n distinct composite tasks that are linear combinations of the dictionary elements; n experts then show demonstrations for each tasks, that are observed by both flat and factorial learners. While the flat learners independently learn a model of each task, the factorial learner reconstructs a dictionary, shared amongst tasks together with mixing coefficients. We evaluate the learners on each learned task by measuring their average performance on the MDP corresponding to the demonstrated task. We also compare the results with the ground truth dictionary and more naive strategies to build features. The results demonstrate that our approach enables the learning of the shared structure of the tasks; they furthermore demonstrate and illustrate the fact that this approach enables more accurate representation of new additional tasks from only one short demonstration whereas the classical inverse reinforcement learning approach fails to generalize to unobserved parts of the space due to the lack of adequate features. The comparison of our algorithm with naive approaches also shows that these approaches also fail to learn the relevant structure of the demonstrated tasks.",

      "abstract": "Why do we do what we do? This article reviews research on nonconscious and conscious processes and reveals the dominant role of the nonconscious mind in human behavior in general and in leisure behavior in particular. Neural preparation for voluntary action starts well before a conscious intention to act. The nonconscious is the default system, and it seeks to avoid any kind of straining activity. Much of human behavior (e.g., TV watching) is driven by stimulus cues in the environment, and people struggle with choosing demanding cognitive and physical leisure activities. Occasionally, though, the conscious mind intervenes and overrides the default system resulting in engagement in activities that increase neuroplasticity and neurogenesis. The task is difficult, however, as the nonconscious mind operates best in the freedom of leisure where the triggering of explanations and excuses for not doing demanding activities is most likely. The struggle is further compounded when people typically use up their finite self-control resources at work, thus leaving little or nothing of these for resisting participation in less demanding and potentially less beneficial leisure. Ironically, freedom in leisure, which is supposed to be a good thing, poses two major problems: (1) the nonconscious effect, when it facilitates the acceptance of excuses for not doing demanding activities, and (2) the conscious effect, when \"should-do\" leisure activities (e.g., exercise) stir up reactance and conscious resistance to a possible loss of freedom. As a result, freedom in leisure undermines, consciously and nonconsciously, one's initiative for self-development activities when it, in theory, would be expected to promote involvement in various kinds of self- and health-enhancing activities.",

      "abstract": "In order to perform at the highest level in educational settings (e.g., students in testing situations), individuals often have to control their impulses or desires (e.g., to study for an upcoming test or to prepare a course instead of spending time with the peer group). Previous research suggests that the ability to exert self-control is an important predictor of performance and behavior in educational contexts. According to the strength model, all self-control acts are based on one global energy pool whose capacity is assumed to be limited. After having performed a first act of self-control, this resource can become temporarily depleted which negatively affects subsequent self-control. In such a state of ego depletion, individuals tend to display impaired concentration and academic performance, fail to meet academic deadlines, or even disengage from their duties. In this mini-review, we report recent studies on ego depletion which have focused on children as well as adults in educational settings, derive practical implications for how to improve self-control strength in the realm of education and instruction, and discuss limitations regarding the assumptions of the strength model of self-control.",

La forma de enfrentarse a situaciones dificiles e incontrolables dependera de que tan preparada se sienta la persona para hacerlo, es decir, que tan autoeficaz sea. Las investigaciones sobre autoeficacia muestran que el lograr una meta de forma exitosa depende en gran medida de que tan capaz se sienta uno mismo para lograrlo y no tanto en funcion de las verdaderas capacidades que tenga, ya que mientras mas capaz se sienta, hara mayores esfuerzos e invertira mas tiempo, lo que lo llevara a terminar la tarea exitosamente.

      "abstract": "Online or distance learning presents the cortical asset for equality, engagement and inclusion. However, these concepts do not guarantee success. There are still some challenges in choosing methods of how to use and combine online tools successfully as well as on the tool design. For instance, low engagement with online learning environments is frequent and diverse. This issue may be because there is no careful thoughtfulness of practices or the tools used themself are too awkward or do not support well the contextual needs of the learners. Simple issues such as internet connection, tool ecology mismatch and choice of practices are also crucial for design consideration. Our framework follows cognitive brain research as it provides a clear starting point of combining design and practices for better online learning. Some of the brain research findings fit design and learning and are known to all but demonstrate to be true by brain research recently (For example, issues such as physical activity as well as active self-controlled thinking help learning. Similarly, sleeping enough boosts learning, constructive and timely feedback enhance learning, and having and keeping attention is crucial, but dependent on working memory and meaning-making also provides the long term memory and transferability.

      "title": "Effective Supervision: An Adaptive and Relative Process <sup>1</sup>",
      "abstract": "Summary and Conclusions 1. A ttempts to discover specific supervisory behaviors related to effectiveness of supervision have had limited success. The results are frequently conflicting and inconclusive. Specific supervisory acts may be effective in some situations but not in others, effective with some subordinates but not with others. 2. The response of a subordinate to a supervisory act depends upon the meaning of the act to the subordinate, not only upon the nature of the act itself. This meaning always depends upon the relationship of the supervisory act, as perceived, to the expectations, values, and interpersonal skills of the subordinate. 3. All of the perceptions, expectations, values, and interpersonal skills of the subordinate influence his response to each act of his superior. Supervision is, therefore, an adaptive and relative process in the sense that a supervisor, to be effective, must always adapt his behavior to fit the expectations, values, and interpersonal skills of his subordinates. 4. The converse is equally true. For effective interaction, the subordinate must relate his behavior to the expectations, values, and interpersonal skills of his superior (or peers). 5. This does not deny the importance of universal principles in supervisory‐subordinate relationships; it indicates only that a broadly applicable principle must allow variation in interpretation in such a way that meanings , not necessarily acts, are consistent with the principle. This broadens rather than restricts the range of applicability of basic principles. Current managerial theory and practice with regard to supervision and supervisory training must be re‐appraised in the perspective of being an adaptive and relative process.",

      "abstract": "The term, passive-aggressive mainly covers the hidden hostility of passive-aggressive behaviors that lead to counter-productive reactions at workplaces. Whether malicious or unintentional, passive aggressive behaviors damage relationships, interrupt workflow, cause unrest and spread of negative feelings in the organization. Moreover, a passive aggressive employee’s behaviors affect the big picture of an organization’s productivity on the whole negatively and it’s also very hard and depressing to work with coworkers or bosses who often act passive-aggressively. Employees usually reflect passive-aggressive patterns and signs because it’s such a tactic for conflict-avoidance face to face and it’s more comfortable way of expressing covert feelings of anger to their supervisors or coworkers. For instance, stalling, sarcasm, postponing, the silent treatment, withholding information, and procrastination are common and certain signs of behaviors that passive-aggressive employees show at workplaces. In sum, in this conceptual paper, passive-aggressive behaviors will be identified in detail and the ways to handle with passiveaggressive employees at workplaces will be outlined. Then, in conclusion section, recommendations will be made in order to reduce negative effects of passive-aggressive employees at workplaces",

PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to review multiple issues that can co ntribute to invalid symptom reporting and performance. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors relevant to normal behavior, including observations from social psychology and behavioral economics, are important in the context of invalid symptom reporting and performance. These factors, which include pre-injury traits and beliefs (e.g., beliefs about prognosis and symptoms after TBI), factors at the time of initial treatment (e.g., expectations of recovery, nocebo effects, stereotype threat), and thoughts and feelings during evaluations (e.g., anger, resentment, injustice), may be important explanations. To best serve our patients, further research is needed to illuminate these relative effects on performance compared to \"not trying.\"",

      "abstract": "In recent years, research has provided increasing understanding of behavioral pathways that can contribute to employee well-being, including obtaining recovery outside or inside of work, getting sufficient sleep, engaging in health behaviors, or undertaking positive actions at work in certain ways. On the other hand, there can be challenges for individuals to actually engage in or benefit from these pathways to well-being–for example, individuals may find it challenging to pursue recovery experiences and activities, to get sufficient quality sleep, to engage in health behaviors, or to reap benefits for well-being when acting positively at work. These challenges can be external (e.g., constraining and detrimental factors in the organization and the workplace) or internal (e.g., self-regulation or motivational issues on the part of employees themselves). Papers in this symposium shed light on external and internal factors that can create such challenges for employees' pursuit of well-being, as well as conditions and factors that may help to address these challenges. These papers span a range of topics related to employee well-being, such as work recovery, sleep, health behaviors, and proactivity, and they employ a diverse set of research designs including diary studies, couple-dyadic study, field and online experiments. This symposium aims to move forward our understanding of fostering well-being in work organizations by both revealing potential challenges and providing useful implications.",

One’s growth mindset comprises a variety of cognitive and motivational factors (e.g., learning goals, effort beliefs) and the perception that skill attainment and outcome in any domain are tethered to personal effort. A fixed mindset encompasses goals, beliefs, and perceptions that skill level is not malleable or impacted by effort. Structural equation models tested investigated direct and indirect pathways of mindset and motivational variables (i.e., learning goals, effort beliefs) with reading outcomes (i.e., word reading, fluency, reading comprehension) in a diverse sample of fourth grade students ( n = 408) with reading difficulties. Results revealed a direct impact of fixed mindset (−0.21 to −0.36) and effort beliefs (0.18–0.31) on all standardized, reading-based outcomes. There were no significant mediating pathways. Results are juxtaposed to other research in this area, and practical implications are discussed. Growth mindset appears a robust predictor of positive academic outcomes, and it may be beneficial to facilitate growth mindset in classrooms.",

      "abstract": "When taking a turn at talk, a speaker normally accomplishes a sequential action such as a question, answer, complaint, or request. Sometimes, however, a turn at talk may accomplish not a single but a composite action, involving a combination of more than one action. I show that factual declaratives (e.g., \"the feed drip has finished\") are recurrently used to implement composite actions consisting of both an informing and a request or, alternatively, a criticism and a request. A key determinant between these is the recipient's epistemic access to what the speaker is describing. Factual declaratives afford a range of possible responses, which can tell us how the composite action has been understood and give us insights into its underlying structure. Evidence for the stacking of composite actions, however, is not always directly available in the response and may need to be pieced together with the help of other linguistic and contextual considerations. Data are in Italian with English translation.",

      "title": "Repetition in Mandarin Chinese: An Exploration of Functions, Types, and Interactional Function",
      "abstract": "Repetition is a common feature in everyday spoken discourse and serves various communicative functions beyond simple reiteration. This study categorizes repetition into two main types based on its position in a turn: (1) repetition at the beginning of a turn, which combines with other elements to form a complete turn, and (2) repetition forming an independent turn, where the repeated content stands alone. The study employs conversation analysis (CA) to examine naturally occurring data from telephone conversations between family members, friends, and some institutional talk. Through a bottom-up approach, the study explores the dual functions of repetition in conversation. The findings reveal that repetition serves several social and communicative functions, including linking turns, initiating corrections, expressing attitudes or emotions, and seeking explanations. For example, repetition at the beginning of a turn often facilitates the smooth continuation of a conversation, while repetition in an independent turn can initiate a correction or invite clarification. Additionally, repetition can signal the speaker’s stance or emotional response to prior content, influencing the course of the interaction. This study highlights the complexity of repetition as a conversational tool and emphasizes the importance of context in interpreting its function. The research suggests that future studies should further investigate the diverse roles of repetition in communication, requiring comprehensive corpus data for deeper analysis.",

      "abstract": "The paper presents several assistive technology solutions that may be used to help people with moderate to severe/profound intellectual and multiple disabilities reach relevant goals such as strengthening object-manipulation and ambulation responses and carrying out multistep tasks. For each of the technology solutions, the paper examines (a) the specific function (i.e. the way it helps people achieve the goal targeted) and (b) the possible role over time (i.e. whether it might serve as a temporary or permanent form of support). The basic functions of the assistive technology solutions presented entail: increasing people's motivation, supplementing people's cognition (working memory), and bridging the gap between people's motor, sensory/orientation, and verbal functioning and the functioning level required to achieve the goals targeted. Based on the knowledge available to date, the role of the technology solutions over time may be considered: (a) modifiable, with the possibility of reducing or even completely fading out the use of such solutions, when their function is to increase people's motivation or support people's cognitive/memory performance, and (b) practically unalterable when their function is to bridge the gap between people's limited sensory, motor, and verbal skills and the skill level required to reach a relevant goal.",

      "abstract": "Mobbing, a rising issue in the occupational health area, has recently been paid attention more and more in the academic and business settings. Mobbing is a series of action having multidimensional features socially and psychologically, and it is frequent in occupational environment. Mobbing may present itself as behaviors, words, acts, gestures, or writings that affect personality, dignity, physical, and psychological integrity. Early 1990’s were the time studies about mobbing started to be done, indicating its negative effects on both individual and the working place. These extend from stress and depression to psychosomatic disorders, and even chronicle diseases and cardiovascular problems. Workplace mobbing is repetitive, unreasonable malicious behavior directed toward an employee or a group of employees, that creates risk to health and safety. It may manifest as intimidation, physical violence, discrimination, threats, social isolation, and destabilization. The most prominent result is lack of continuity. Organizational problems, time pressure, lack of leadership and task definition etc. are defined to be potential risk factors. For prevention, there must be an organized intervention including a strategically approach towards mobbing and a positive environment at workplace. There is a need for standardization, and studies to define and evaluate mobbing behavior in order to make a comparison between different cultures and occupations. In this review article mobbing was examined with the view of public health.",

In removing the incipient problem just before, or very shortly after, it becomes response ready, accountability for it is avoided. Three environments for embedded self-correction are described: (1) remediating a possibly untoward action regarding the interlocutor; (2) adjusting a problematic impression of self; and (3) removing something that sounds \"silly\" or is susceptible to an infelicitous or improper hearing. Speakers act rapidly to remove possibly available inapposite hearings by extending possibly complete turns (e.g., by adding increments), thereby avoiding exposing or becoming accountable for the problematic items, or delaying ongoing actions. Findings suggest that it may be possible to correct error without engaging the usual mechanisms of conversational repair.",

If it works, and you like it, do it some more. If it's not enjoyable to you, stop it. If the activity is not generating results, adjust it, or replace it with something else that works better. A third component to this list is accountability. Discipline around new activities is implemented best if somebody holds you to doing what you intend to do. You need somebody to ask you about what you are doing, somebody for you to report to.",

There is a sudden experience of helplessness, loss of control, fear for one’s own life, and the humiliation of having been violated. The victim may run out of internal and external reference elements. Objectives Describe the factors that influence the development of Post-traumatic stress disorder after experiencing traumatic experiences. Methods Review in the literature of the different factors that influence the subject’s response to the traumatic experience. Results 1) Predisposing and precipitating factors: – characteristics of the traumatic evento: severity of the stressor agent: dose-dependent, Characteristics of the same: sudden, prolonged, repetitive, intentional; decrease the ability to control the situation and develop effective coping strategies; they question basic cognitive schemas; the symbolic meaning of the traumatic evento. – characteristics of the person (predisposing factors of vulnerability): genetic-constitutional vulnerability, adverse experiences in childhood, previous traumatic events: increased vulnerability, personality characteristics, recent stressors or life changes, inadequate support system, use of alcohol, perception locus control more external than internal, pre-existing psychiatric symptoms: neuroticism, anxiety, depression, critical ages of development: time of greatest vulnerability (11-16 years). 2) Perpetuating and empowering factors: sharing traumatic events, seeking the logic of the facts, rupture of affective ties. 3) Elements of Resistance: tendency to selectively remember the positive elements in autobiographical memory, acceptance of a certain dose of uncertainty in life, perceiving themselves as survivors, perception of the stressful stimulus as less threatening, Less physiological reactivity to stress, use of humor, positive emotions counteracting during the traumatic process. 4) Elements of Resilience: ability to extract and assimilate positive elements from negative situations. Conclusions Trauma threatens 3 basic assumptions of life: the world is good, the world has meaning, the self has value. The knowledge of these mentioned factors allow a better psychotherapeutic approach to Psychic Trauma. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

Career advancement and satisfaction depend on managing these two apparently opposing forces. Serendipity, seizing unexpected opportunities to initiate a new research pathway, and planfulness, thoughtful mapping out of a research program, are intrinsic to determining one’s professional pathway. In this chapter, I offer thoughts about how to use serendipity wisely, and how not to be paralyzed by planfulness through considering when and why planfulness and serendipity paid off or not. Among my conclusions, (1) serendipity takes one in unexpected directions; and serendipity does not always feel like opportunity; (2) there is no way to predict what exactly will work out or not. As in the stock market, past performance is not an indicator of future performance, and (3) timing is not everything, but it plays an oversized role.",

      "title": "Types of non-standard communication encounters with special reference to Russian",
      "abstract": "The way we speak in communication situations is determined by two major factors: (1) situational: where, on what topic, and with whom we speak, what our role is in the speech act, and (2) personal: what our linguistic background is. The first factor means that conversation is very different at home, in the street, at work, and at a reception. It also reflects the way people communicate in various roles: as a teacher, as a clerk at a service desk, as a parent, as a professional or amateur volleyball player, as a priest at a wedding, as a tourist, etc. A person can have several roles during her/his life, or even during a single day, as can easily be seen from the examples just mentioned. It is not by chance that systematic scientific interest in the first factor started with rather standardised situations of major social significance, such as doctor-patient and pilotcontroller conversations. In this paper, I will consider the second factor determining our communicative behaviour: our linguistic background. I will try to give a short overview of Russian research on these issues through some concrete examples. Evidence from other languages, including Finnish, is given in order to describe parallel and (for most readers of this volume) more familiar cases. In view of the lack of research on the topic, I will also put forward questions and hypotheses on the nature of these phenomena. In order to describe different cases of this kind, I first define some basic categories of speakers and introduce an important element of our communicative behaviour, namely the use of a so-called adaptation mode.",

However, many lecturers often forget this and instead focus on just the lecture instead of the audience (to the point that some lecturers do not even look at the audience). Needless to say, focusing on just the lecture often makes the lecture itself a failure. The audience's understanding of a topic is the goal. To maximize or optimize this level of understanding, it is very important to routinely observe the audience, gauge their level of interest and/or connection to the lecture, and to adjust the lecture accordingly. In this chapter, we will focus on the very important mechanism of observing the level of interest of the audience as well as on the process of correctly interpreting visual and verbal feedback.",

Kerentanan stress pada ABBS dapat muncul dalam proses pemberian layanan khusus kepada mereka dan akan semakin meningkat bila mereka tidak mendapat layanan khusus. Stres sebagai sesuatu yang tidak nampak dan kondisi ABBS yang juga secara fisik tidak dapat dibedakan dari kesulitan belajar pada umumnya menjadikan guru maupun orang tua memberikan label serta penanganan yang tidak semestinya kepada ABBS. Banyak orang tidak menduga bahwa stres pada ABBS dapat muncul seiring pemberian layanan khusus kepada mereka. Faktor sekolah dan guru khusus dinyatakan Rubenzer (1987) sebagai pemicu stres pada ABBS. Guru khusus yang hadir untuk memberikan layanan khusus untuk ABBS ternyata juga dapat memicu stres sehingga guru perlu berhati-hati dalam berinteraksi dengan ABBS. Tanda-tanda stres pada ABBS dapat menjadi patokan setiap reaksi ABBS pada proses belajar mengajar sehingga upaya pencegahan maupun pengurangan stres dapat dilakukan. Pencegahan stres pada ABBS dapat dilakukan dengan memperkuat mental kepribadian ABBS dengan mengacu penelitian longitudinal Goldber et al (2003) yang mencakup; a) kesadaran konsep diri, b) proaktif, c) pantang menyerah, d) penetapan tujuan, e) stabilitas emosi. Pengelolaan stres yang dapat dilakukan oleh guru pengurangan sikap, perilaku dan lingkungan yang dapat menjadi pemicu stres.

      "title": "What binds professional judgment?: The case of teaching",
      "abstract": "Introduction\nJudgements in teaching include both instructional (epistemic) and regulative\n(moral) aspects. Teachers have to exercise professional judgement when selecting\nemphasis for the content to be taught, designing a sequence of contents in a speciﬁc\ntopic, choosing correct examples to demonstrate a concept, interpreting learners’\nerrors, dealing with cultural differences among learners, and so forth. Some of\nthese decisions are subtle, others are explicit. Some are made in situ and others\npre or post facto. Broadly, there is an agreement that professional judgement in\nteaching derives from theoretical knowledge (educational theories and subject\nmatter knowledge; this chapter will concentrate on educational theories), and from\nworking knowledge (variety of contextually speciﬁc experiences). What is less clear\nis how theoretical knowledge, which is formal, systematic, ordered and context\nindependent, informs teachers’ professional judgement that is situated and\ncontext-dependent. Concepts developed to explain this relation such as ‘reﬂection\nin action’ (Schon 1983) and ‘situated learning ‘(Lave and Wenger 1991), locate\nprofessional judgement in everyday professional practice, attempting to create ﬁner\ndistinctions within informal learning, but neglect the role of theoretical knowledge\nin the exercise of professional judgement. This is a serious neglect (Muller 2009;\nYoung 2010; Young and Muller 2010; Winch 2010; Kotzee, 2012) that must\nbe addressed, if teaching is to be considered a ﬁeld of expertise; if a judgement\nmade by teachers is to be distinguished from an ordinary judgement. Placing\nteachers’ judgement primarily in experiential knowledge contributes to further\nde-professionalisation in teaching.",

      "title": "The Interview",
      "abstract": "However much preparation you have done, for most candidates the interview day itself can be somewhat daunting or even downright frightening. The first part of this chapter focuses on how you can reduce any anxiety through both careful planning and a few simple exercises and tips. The second part of the chapter deals at a practical level with what happens in the interview itself so you will know exactly what to expect. This chapter does not deal with how to respond to interview questions (with the exception of where you do not understand what has been asked). Preparation and answering of interview questions has been discussed in great detail in Chapter 5. Most candidates will have a degree of interview nerves and it can be helpful to remember that other interviewees are likely to be feeling similar to you. A little bit of anxiety, as opposed to complacency, is often useful to fuel the desire to achieve and ensure you go the extra mile to get the job. However, if anxiety really takes hold and a candidate appears dysfunctional to the panel it can be viewed disadvantageously, with panel members questioning (internally, at least) whether you would be equally dysfunctional in a stressful clinical situation or when leading something important. Much of what we are about to cover deals with controlling those nerves and giving you the best shot at a confident performance on the day. There is much that can be done to reduce nerves and although a significant amount of this is practical and common sense, it is worth reminding ourselves of the following: • The more prepared you are, the calmer you will feel, so start your interview preparation early • When you go to the pre-interview visit, physically find out where the interview room is so that you can find it more easily on the day of the interview (it’s one less thing to worry about and we all know how one part of a hospital can look much like another and even the best signage isn’t going to direct you to room F1238B)",

First, the students may lack the background knowledge and experience needed to understand the lab's purpose and procedure. The whole event is a mystery to these students. Second, even if background information were adequate, many students may not understand the connections between this knowledge and the laboratory experience. They do not understand that the experiment is an attempt to test a hypothesis in a way that one variable is tested, another variable is affected and many variables are held constant for a fair test. These difficulties leave them no choice but to simply try and muddle through one by one, like a recipe.",

Two corollaries require consideration in designing effective skill learning programs. i) Neuro-behavioral constraints, imposed on whether neuronal plasticity is triggered and allowed to proceed, must be satisfied; otherwise, the skill may fail to consolidate into long-term memory. These include the amount of task iterations afforded, task scheduling, behavioral relevancy and the degree of consistency of the to-be-learned experience over a required timewindow. ii) The performance of a given task reflects qualitatively different task solution routines in different phases of experience. Practice, given time and sometimes time-in-sleep, can trigger processes whereby new procedural knowledge and qualitative changes in task solution, emerge and consolidate. These emerging changes in procedural knowledge result in differences in the ability to transfer gains, across stimulus, context and task parameters.",

It is argued that performance decrements can be expected to occur as a result of general factors or as a result of specific impairments of particular human skills. General effects happen when environmental motion, simulated or real, reduces motivation (due to motion sickness), increases fatigue (due to increased energy requirements), or creates balance problems. Specific effects of moving environments on task performance may only be expected through biomechanical influences on particular skills such as perception (interference with oculomotor control) or motor skills (such as manual tracking). There is no evidence for direct effects of motion on performance in purely cognitive tasks.",

      "title": "Habilidades de autorregulación y evaluación on-line del proceso de resolución de problemas matemáticos",
      "abstract": "La resolucion de problemas matematicos es muy frecuente en la edad escolar. Sin embargo, se trata de una actividad compleja, cuya correcta ejecucion depende de multiples factores. En este sentido, la evidencia cientifica sugiere que, para ser exitosos, los estudiantes necesitan, entre otras cosas, ser autorregulados en su actividad de resolucion de problemas, ejerciendo un control eficaz sobre sus procesos cognitivos, afectivos y conductuales. No obstante, estudios previos senalan que estudiantes en diferentes etapas educativas muestran a menudo dificultades para gestionar estos aspectos. Una evidencia a favor de esta afirmacion procede del analisis del proceso metacognitivo llevado a cabo por los estudiantes durante estas tareas. Este analisis ha revelado la existencia de patrones de resolucion ineficaces por parte de muchos estudiantes; con escasas habilidades de planificacion y de evaluacion de la actividad, asi como una marcada preferencia por procedimientos familiares como la ejecucion de calculos como medio para resolver los problemas. Estos patrones de resolucion ?denominados procesos en esta Tesis Doctoral- se traducen a menudo en un bajo rendimiento en la tarea, asi como en la formulacion de juicios poco realistas acerca del resultado alcanzado. Este componente de juicios esta estrechamente relacionado con la ?calibracion?, o grado en el que la percepcion de una persona sobre su ejecucion se corresponde con su ejecucion real, establecida esta en funcion de una medida objetiva como la puntuacion en un test. La calibracion supone un importante mecanismo metacognitivo, y ejerce un efecto positivo sobre el rendimiento en matematicas y resolucion de problemas. No obstante, los estudiantes son a menudo imprecisos en sus juicios, mostrando un exceso de confianza. Estos sesgos de percepcion tienen ademas a ser estables, con efectos negativos sobre el rendimiento, pero tambien sobre el esfuerzo, la persistencia y el interes de los estudiantes hacia la asignatura o la tarea. Esto hace preciso examinar los factores relacionados con la formacion de estos juicios. Un aspecto importante en esta Tesis Doctoral es la distincion entre los juicios realizados antes (predicciones), y despues (postdicciones) de la ejecucion. Los ultimos han mostrado ser mas fiables y precisos, puesto que se basan en el feedback procedente de la realizacion de la tarea, y serian informativos de mecanismos de monitorizacion durante la misma. Este aspecto hace a estos juicios especialmente interesantes desde el punto de vista del analisis del proceso en resolucion de problemas. No obstante, el potencial explicativo del proceso sobre estos juicios no ha sido explorado hasta la fecha. Adicionalmente, pocos de los estudios realizados con el fin de establecer los determinantes de estos juicios se han hecho en Educacion Primaria, ni se han realizado desde un punto de vista comprensivo, centrandose en aspectos aislados en su lugar. En este sentido, la presente Tesis Doctoral ha tenido estos objetivos: - Disenar y poner a prueba un metodo de evaluacion del proceso en resolucion de problemas matematicos. - Delimitar el potencial explicativo del proceso en la precision de los juicios realizados tras la ejecucion de estas tareas. - Analizar el efecto que otras variables cognitivas, afectivas, motivacionales y conductuales tienen sobre estos juicios. Se conto con 524 estudiantes de quinto y sexto curso (10-13 anos), los cuales realizaron dos problemas matematicos verbales basados en la vida real. Los resultados indicaron la presencia de patrones de resolucion de problemas poco efectivos y un bajo rendimiento en las tareas. No obstante, las estrategias de representacion y organizacion de la informacion mostraron ser importantes en el exito en resolucion de problemas. Los estudiantes fueron ademas poco precisos en sus juicios, mostrando un exceso de confianza. Los mas calibrados mostraron estrategias de planificacion mas eficaces en resolucion de problemas, mientras que los poco calibrados tendieron a emplear estrategias basadas en ensayo y error. El rendimiento en matematicas mostro ejercer un efecto sobre la calibracion, explicando ciertas diferencias previas en planificacion. La precision de los juicios se relaciono tambien con: mejores habilidades de funcionamiento ejecutivo en planificacion, organizacion, memoria y atencion, y menor impulsividad; creencias, motivaciones y actitudes mas positivas hacia las matematicas; y un mayor tiempo empleado en la resolucion de problemas. Finalmente, el rendimiento en matematicas, la utilidad percibida de la asignatura y el tiempo en resolver el primer problema matematico predijeron significativamente la precision de estos juicios, clasificando correctamente al 71% de la muestra. Estos resultados muestran la utilidad del metodo de evaluacion disenado como medida del proceso de resolucion de problemas matematicos y la necesidad de considerar un amplio rango de variables cuando las diferencias en calibracion quieren ser explicadas.",

      "abstract": "The chapter highlights a number of common problems evident in many aspects of leadership practice. The main focus is on the concept of vision and the point is made that the rhetoric associated with it often does not match the reality of day-to-day organizational life. This applies in three ways. First, it is apparent that many organizations do not have a clear vision or strong sense of where they are trying to get to. Second, many organizations have a vision, but are not very successful at communicating it, so it becomes a vision in theory only, with no actual impact at a practical level. Third, it is not uncommon for tokenism to mean that many employees are aware of the vision but only pay lip service to it, so once again it has no purchase at the level of actual work practice. Finally, the futility of fighting a culture (instead of seeking to change it) is highlighted.",

      "title": "Developing confident decision-makers",
      "abstract": "FigureQ I'm a new manager in a nondirect care area. Staff members frequently call me for guidance when a decision needs to be made, even after hours. What can I do to get them to make decisions on their own? First, realize that your staff members don't know your style yet and you don't know theirs. Assess the situation to determine if the guidance being sought is to test your knowledge or whether staff members are fearful of making the wrong decision. There are several steps you can take to get your personal time back and develop your team. You can start to turn the tide with four simple words: “What do you think?” This question will demonstrate that you respect your staff members' thoughts. When employees feel respected in the workplace, it enables them to feel confident in their decisions.1 Corresponding with asking their thoughts, delegate some decisions to your direct reports. This will demonstrate that you trust them. Recognize that the employee may not make the same decision or take the same action as you. Evaluate the results before commenting on or correcting the employee's actions. If you react too quickly without a thorough review, you'll lose your team's trust. After review, if your employee's decision/action didn't match that of prudent practice and organizational expectation, then you need to take other actions. Next, work on developing your leadership style. Consider situational leadership, in which you assess each staff member's developmental or maturity level, from novice to expert, and provide the support that he or she needs to complete a task.2 Developmental levels are matched with leadership actions such as telling or directing, selling (coaching), participating (supporting), and delegating.3 If you ask a staff member to perform a task that he or she has never done before, you want him or her to know what to do to be successful. This calls for telling or directing. Use selling (coaching) when an employee is competent but has a low motivation level; you must “sell” the task to him or her. When you know that a staff member is very competent but his or her commitment is variable, you can be supportive through the task. For a seasoned employee who's committed to the task, you can delegate authority to him or her to make decisions and take actions.4,5 Using a model such as situational leadership will help you make better assignments for your staff members, which will result in increased trust and team growth. By matching up the employee's skill with the task, he or she will be more confident when making decisions, thus seeking less decision-making guidance from you. This process takes time but, ultimately, you'll motivate your team and keep them engaged.",

Unfortunately, much evidence suggests that many important concerns, including teacher performance issues, continue to be unaddressed and unresolved.

The majority of concerns identified by these leaders were about behavioral issues, with others being about attitudes, relationships, effectiveness, and capability. Concerns were found to persist longer than is desirable, and leaders reported difficulty in resolving them.",

      "abstract": "In a significant minority of people, involuntarily job loss can result in symptoms of job loss-related complicated grief (JLCG). The present cognitive-behavioral framework is introduced to explain the underlying processes that may lead to the development and maintenance of JLCG symptoms. Three core processes play a central role, namely (1) negative cognitions related to the job loss and misinterpretation of one's grief reactions; (2) anxious and depressive avoidance strategies to cope with the job loss and its consequences; and (3) insufficient integration of the job loss into the autobiographical memory. These core processes are assumed to interact and reinforce each other, leading to JLCG symptoms. The three core processes can be influenced by certain risk factors, including circumstances surrounding the loss, personality traits, and characteristics of the social environment. JLCG symptoms can lead to additional psychological and practical problems, such as anxiety and depressive symptoms, lower employability, and reduced likelihood of re-employment. This paper explains and illustrates the three core processes with vignettes. Implications of the model for preventive measures and psychological interventions are introduced. It concludes with suggestions for future research on JLCG symptoms.",

También aportan modelos de procesamiento productivo de dicho feedback. La patología es más una cuestión de incapacidad de aprender del feedback que de distorsiones o conductas disfuncionales per se. La relación de uno consigo mismo es crucial de cara al funcionamiento efectivo. Aprender a mantener una relación productiva con uno mismo ante los problemas es la meta de la psicoterapia.

      "title": "Shifting from “parent” to “partner”",
      "abstract": "FigureQ I'm replacing a unit manager who operated in a “mama manager” style by making top-down decisions and micromanaging. How do I set the tone of ownership and accountability rather than dependency? With the pressures inherent in healthcare, all too often managers regress under stress and get caught up in a hyper sense of responsibility, with the need to control making it difficult to move decisions out to those who must make them work. Your question reflects the insight that a manager's effectiveness is measured by what happens in his or her absence. The better you do your job, the less staff members need you; it's all about developing people rather than controlling people. Start by sharing your perspectives on management in the context of improving teamwork, morale and, ultimately, patient care. To be transparent about your intent, use the 4 Ps as a visual framework:1 Purpose—the why behind the what to develop a high-performing team and provide quality care Picture—key initiatives, systems, and structures to foster ownership of practice, such as unit-based councils or task forces, routine staff meetings with reports, behavior norms, and goal setting Plan—steps and time frames to develop team agreements or ground rules, skill set training around problem-solving and teamwork, accountability partners, bedside report, and progress toward unit goals Part to play—individual commitments to adhere to ground rules, use skill sets offered, assess personal learning needs, develop a network of peers from high-performing units to learn best practices, and attend specialty organization meetings. Begin setting expectations by sharing three things you need from staff members and eliciting three things they need from you to work as a team. You might ask that when they bring you a problem, they offer an idea for how to solve it. They may ask you to share real-time feedback or advocate for needed system changes. Use this same approach at a peer level to develop three to four team agreements around what staff members need from each other to improve their teamwork. Examples include assuming positive intent; talking to each other, not about each other; and zero tolerance for chronic negativity. Discuss progress in staff meetings, focusing on what's going well. Your value of teamwork will also be clarified by having the team read The Five Dysfunctions of a Team, which highlights key themes of trust, healthy conflict, commitment, accountability, and skill set development.2 It's worthwhile to perform a team assessment so staff members can decide which of these areas to prioritize. Relative to the unit council, start with their “felt need” rather than assigning issues because this promotes ownership. Use a four-part process for problem-solving. State the problem on a flip chart and then ask, “How do we help this happen?” Follow this by brainstorming options to deal with the issue and creating an action plan. The action plan should include who will do what by when, the expected outcome, and who needs to know. This process takes less than an hour and should be shared in staff meetings. It highlights how to go from problem processing to being proactive and offers a good mental model for all. Speaking of mental models, keep in mind that the overall effort in culture change is to move from dependence (a reactive victim mindset) to independence (ownership of practice) to interdependence in which staff members effectively collaborate with other departments, build networks, and take part in professional organizations. When you defer to your staff members' expertise on an issue, provide teamwork training, or fund a trip to a professional meeting, you're creating experiences that change what people believe. When their beliefs change, their actions change and when actions change, you get better outcomes. This is the nitty gritty of culture change. Most important, model the behaviors you expect, pace yourself, and trust the process. Remember the adage “don't push the river, it flows by itself.” When you see a light in your staff members' eyes, you'll know you're doing the right thing.",

      "title": "The Science and Sanity of Listening",
      "abstract": "Introduction Listening, we are told, is a vital part of our daily lives. Listening is the only way we can properly learn new information or understand how to do things. Beyond this, one often hears, is necessary for esthetic pleasure, relationship building, and to advance one's career. Still, it seems to be an aspect of communication with which many people struggle. Indeed, although aware of the instrumentality of listening, even trained communicators often fail to listen correctly or at opportune times. This article will argue that part of the difficulty with may not come from a true failure to listen, but from the abstract nature of word listening itself. Listening is done in a variety of situations and for a variety of reasons, many of which do not involve an overlapping skill set. When one listens to music, one is not involved in the same sort of activity as when one listens to a friend vent after a difficult day of work or when one listens to one's employer give instructions on a new procedure. The wildly different nature of these activities and the skills involved in them mean that one can easily be listening, and yet simultaneously fail to listen. In fact, as will be shown later, some forms of actually preclude other forms; that is to say that in the case of AA. Because of this, is a slippery term and one who wishes to become a good listener is inevitably prone to failure. On the other hand, there are a series of tools that come from the discipline of general semantics that allow us to properly navigate thorny abstract terms such as The purpose of this article is to use some of these tools to help us come to a better understanding of the abstract nature of the term listening. The article will show that through the application of what general semanticists refer to as can become a less abstract and more manageable skill set, which will allow us to perform better the basic operations that fall under the abstract heading of To accomplish this, the article will first examine the literature arising from the field of interpersonal communication regarding listening. Next, the article will consider how the notion of extensional devices, which comes from the discipline of general semantics, can be applied to better understand the concept of listening. The article will go on to show that applying these devices to the types of can help clarify the that is needed at a particular time and a particular place. Finally, the article will recommend procedures whereby a communicator can apply the devices for his or her to arrive at a saner experience. Listening in Interpersonal Communication Listening is a popular subject among scholars of interpersonal communication for a number of reasons. The fact that interpersonal scholars are often teachers and that is understood as an important part of our students' lives undoubtedly plays a role in the reason for the popularity of the subject matter. According to Buckley, Students listen to the equivalent of a book a day; talk the equivalent of a book a week; read the equivalent of a book a month; and write the equivalent of a book a year (1992, p. 622). According to another study, college students spend 55% of the time they spend communicating in (Emanuel et al., 2008), a number that only rises as they enter the workforce (Wolvin & Coakley, 1981, 1996). The need for teaching about appears evident, and so research by teaching professors logically flows as an outgrowth of this necessity. Another reason that is such a popular subject for researchers of interpersonal communication is that is understood as having such an intense impact on the interpersonal relationship, the most common unit of analysis in interpersonal communication. Most people see as among the most important interpersonal skills (Wolvin, 1984). …",

Many internalizing behaviors can be present together, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, anxiety, or depression. Eating disorders are often accompanied with anxiety and/or depressive disorders, and those identified with anxiety or depression may have symptoms of both. Interventions are needed to help individuals manage their internalizing behaviours. Interventions that have been successful in treating depression include cognitive behavioral therapy, problem-solving skills training, cognitive restructuring, pleasant activity planning, relaxation therapy, self-management training, family involvement, and interpersonal psychotherapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy is a combination of cognitive and behavioral interventions. Although anxiety management/relaxation training is not a traditional depression intervention, there have been studies that prove it is an effective strategy for improving depression.

There is now much evidence that young children tend to the latter mode of interpretation and, in effect, often fail to conserve the question. Children are sensitive to indications of purpose and may try to make sense of the question by wondering about the purposes of the experimenter in asking it. Or they may have regard to purposes which are internal to the task structure, where these exist. Or they may concentrate on impersonal features of the array, as Piaget took them to do.

Business writing must earn a reading. You are probably both a reader and a writer of business documents. Consider writing with your reader's hat on for a moment. Do you read everything that crosses your desk? Do you read every word of the things you do read? Do you read everything from the first word through in sequence, or do you dip into things? Almost certainly, the answers make it clear that not all writing is treated equally. Some documents are more likely to be read than others. Of course, some subjects demand your attention. Who ignores a personal note from the managing director? But the fact that some things have to be read does not make their reading any easier or more pleasurable. Good writing, which means, not least, something that is easy to read and under stand, will always be likely to get more attention than sloppy writing. Yet we all know that prevailing standards in this area are by no means universally good. Why is this? Maybe it is education or lack of it. Often school assists little with the kind of writing we find ourselves having to do once we are in an organization. Maybe it is lack of feedback perhaps managers are too tolerant of what is put in front of them. If more of it were rejected and had to be rewritten, then more attention might be brought to bear on the task.",

      "abstract": "Decision making is the most significant aspect of management, it is a central activity of management. This is due to the fact that in the process of decision making a manager is involved in and responsible for every decision which he has made. Pesantren, from the beginning of its existence in the field of education, social, and religion, has been developed to be an institution in which the structural system of organization is applied. In Pesantren, Kiai is the key figure, he is respected by the people because of his charisma. Kiai is not only a person who takes care of every dimension of pesantren life, but also the manager of pesantren. Kiai involves in all process of decision making in pesantren. Decision making is the core of leadership. In making decision its need the involvement of reason (reasoning activity or intellect activity) which would be guaranteed the accuracy of the decision. The implementation of the process of decision making by an organization will make it more accurate in viewing its problems. As the result of this, any sudden decision or uncalculated decision could be avoided. In making decision it is important to consider the following aspects: (1) The satisfaction aspect; (2) The acceptability of decision; (3) The effectiveness of decision. The leader of pesantren or any other educational institutions should try to improve his competency in making decision. The capability of making decision can be developed if the leader has the data of his institution and understands his environment. He should also use new information which correlated with his institutional problems. The mechanism of decision making in Pondok Pesantren Sidogiri Pasuruan and Pondok Pesantren Darul 'Ulum Jombang are studied here because of its uniqueness. The decision resulted on the positive development of pesantren and its policy can be accepted by environment. Besides that pesantren Sidogiri and pesantren Darul 'Ulum become a model of other pesantrens in Pasuruan and Jombang regency. How successful the decision making in Pondok Pesantren Sidogiri Pasuruan and Pondok Pesantren Darul 'Ulum Jombang are compared with theory of decision making in this modern era is become the main factor conducting this research. Based on that background the problem of this research will be formulated as the following points: (1) How is the process of decision making in Pondok Pesantren Sidogiri Pasuruan and Pondok Pesantren Darul `Ulum Jombang?; (2) What are the basic values of decision making in Pondok Pesantren Sidogiri Pasuruan and Pondok Pesantren Darul 'U1um Jombang?; (3) What factors are influenced in the process of decision making in Pondok Pesantren Sidogiri Pasuruan and Pondok Pesantren Darul `Ulum Jombang?; (4) Who are involved in the process of decision making in Pondok Pesantren Sidogiri Pasuruan and Pondok Pesantren Darul `Ulum Jombang?; (5) How effective is decision making in Pondok Pesantren Sidogiri Pasuruan and Pondok Pesantren Darul 'Ulum Jombang?. In answering those problems, the researcher use qualitative research approach by using research design of observational case study (single case design). The discovery resulted by this research and theory are developed by using phenomenological thinking. Informants are chosen by using snowball sampling technique. This technique is implemented by following up the suggestion of the first informant to the other informants in collecting data by considering its relevant. The data collected by using the following techniques: (1) Conversation; (2) Observation; (3) Documentation. The collected data are analyzed by: (1) Reduction of the data; (2) Presentation of the data; (3) Concluding data The validity of the data are examined with the following ways: (1) Triangulation source; (2) Triangulation method; (3) Discussion with friends. Th e result of this researched is presented in the following themes: A. The process of making decision in Pondok Pesantren Sidogiri Pasuruan and Pondok Pesantren Darul `Ulum Jombang are developed by: (1) Identifying the problems; (2) Analyzing the problems; (3) Creating new alternative; (4) Comparing and choosing the best alternative; (5) Deciding; (6) Implementing and controlling the decision; (7) Evaluating. B. The basic of decision making is syari'ah law and its utility (maslahah) for the ummah especially for the santri. C. Factors that influenced the process of decision making are internal and external factors. Internal factors consist of information, funding, human ,resource: ability of the teacher and other leader (intelligence, approach, method, technique in decision making). External factors consist of economic, social politic, law and culture. D. The person that involved in decision making in Sidogiri are: Coordinator Daerah/Korda (district coordinator), Komisi 1-VI (commission 1-VI), Pengurus finsionaris Harian (functionaries committee), Pengurus Pleno (Plenary committee), Majelis 'Aly (The highest Committee), and Pimpinan Pengasuh (Teachers leader). The person that involved in decision making in Darul Ulum are: (1) MPP (Majelis Pimpinan Pondok Pesantren Darul Ulum), (2) Pengasuh Pesantren (Teachers leader), dan (3) District Leaders in Pondok Pesantren Darul Ulum Jombang. E. The decisions are very effective. Because the high or less quality of decision will be accepted by the societal member or Pondok Pesantren Sidogiri and Pondok Pesantren Darul 'Ulum. From the result of the research it can be concluded that participative decision making by using religious approach is very effective.",

One of the most important locations of this degradation of growth-promoting thought takes place at the site of the transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next. The supervisee is on the one hand being taught and at the same time needs to discover for herself a way of doing things that truly belongs to her. This chapter discusses these tensions giving illustrative examples suggesting that supervising must join the list of the impossible professions.",

      "abstract": "Recognizing and documenting problems in practice and engaging in self-study are not necessarily the same thing. Acting on the problems, issues or concerns that attract attention in teaching and learning about teaching requires an acceptance of the need to seek alternative perspectives and to seek data that is outside of the self. It is in the reporting of self-study that the complexities and interrelationships between research and practice can inadvertently be overlooked or lost. Therefore, paying careful attention to what shapes a self-study is an important factor in reporting on self-study and this distinction between doing and reporting requires careful and ongoing attention.",

      "abstract": "En esta contribucion intentamos profundizar el analisis sobre el proceso de formacion de los tesistas durante el desarrollo del doctorado. Planteamos algunas reflexiones considerando los estereotipos de director caracterizados por Farji-Brener (i.e. indiferente, sobreprotector y con comportamientos alternativos) y tambien algunos estereotipos de tesista (i.e. indiferente, sobreprotegido y con comportamientos alternativos), discutiendo los fundamentos pedagogicos subyacentes en este proceso. Como se trata de una relacion entre dos personas, los posibles resultados del proceso no solo variaran de acuerdo a las caracteristicas dominantes del director, sino tambien de acuerdo a las caracteristicas del tesista y de la interaccion entre ambos. Es decir, como pueden darse diversas combinaciones, en algunos casos el proceso sera optimo o muy bueno, mientras que en muchos casos lo que se produce es una relacion desorientador-desorientado. Una primera conclusion es que cuando el director propone comportamientos alternativos a la indiferencia o la sobreproteccion, el resultado no sera necesariamente una buena experiencia de aprendizaje para ambas partes. Por otro lado, si el objetivo principal es formar investigadores academica- y psicologicamente independientes, capaces de realizar trabajos originales y creativos, el proceso de ensenanza-aprendizaje deberia apoyarse en metodologias alternativas a la ensenanza tradicional. Es decir, deberia centrarse en como ensenar (aprender) a pensar, mas que en la cantidad de informacion y entrenamiento que se transmite (adquiere) durante el desarrollo de una tesis doctoral.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The author notes that professionals long to be involved in initiatives that will generate great success and hope to experience personal reward and meaning doing that work. But in her experience and research in the past 15 years, she has observed that many are failing to experience the success and reward they need and want. She noticed some common, repetitive patterns emerging in terms of what professionals were dealing with in their careers and jobs and pulled back the lens to identify what’s at the heart of this widespread experience of unhappiness, disillusionment, and disengagement. The article proceeds from addressing a core question: “What is missing from the lives of professional men and women who feel they can’t experience the joy, success, reward and impact they deserve and want?” Seven specific career‐thwarting “power gaps” professionals face are identified and examined in detail: (1) not recognizing your special talents, abilities, and accomplishments; (2) communicating from fear not strength; (3) reluctance to ask for what you deserve; (4) isolating from influential support; (5) acquiescing instead of saying “STOP!” to mistreatment; (6) losing sight of your thrilling dream; and (7) allowing past trauma to shape and define you.",

      "abstract": "Although procrastination has devastating negative effects on performance, many of us employ common myth-like justifications for it, thereby attempting to alleviate the guilt and stress that commonly accompany putting things off when we know we should not. Working better under pressure, being more creative at the last minute, and avoiding tasks because of perfectionism are three rationalizations that we often give for delay. The consequences of procrastination include missed deadlines, health and financial problems, guilt, stress, and work that isn't our best. To overcome a tendency to procrastinate, focusing on avoiding it is not the best response. Instead, adopting a task-oriented, problem-solving focus or set of strategies can work even for people with a long history of putting things off. These strategies include increasing the perceived value of a task, adjusting expectations for success, reducing impulsive temptations, and approaching larger projects or those with longer timelines in smaller segments with progress checks along the way. Procrastinators can learn how to change their approach to getting work done and thereby reduce their tendency to delay.",

      "abstract": "Review Objectives/Questions: The objective is to perform a cross-cutting, integrative study to determine the ‘state of knowledge’ relevant to interventions for self-care. The overall research Question for the integrative study is: What is the evidence on interventions to initiate or enhance individuals’ self-care activities across population groups in the Cochrane repository of systematic reviews? Criteria for considering studies for this review: Types of participants: This integrative study will consider systematic reviews that focus on individuals who engage in or have the potential to engage in self-care activities. For example, individuals who have the potential to engage in a new (perhaps specific) self-care activity would be individuals recently diagnosed with a chronic disease such as asthma or diabetes mellitus. Individuals who currently engage in self-care activities (but may require ongoing support or encouragement) would be individuals who currently perform self-care activities to address chronic disease, injury or disability. Changes in life, such as a decrease in visual acuity with aging, may require an adaptation of self-care activities. Types of interventions)/phenomena of interest: This integrative study will consider systematic reviews that describe intervention strategies focused on initiating or enhancing self-care activities. Types of outcomes: Outcomes of interest for this study include: the successful engagement of the individual in self-care activities` the sustainment of self-care activities` or health outcomes. The successful engagement in self-care activities would be indicated by the individual actively performing all (or some aspects) of a new self-care behaviour. For example, a child recently diagnosed with diabetes mellitus may begin to check their own blood sugar levels but rely on a parent to inject the insulin. The sustainment of self-care activities would be indicated by the individual actively continuing to perform a self-care behaviour that was already part of their repertoire. For example, an adolescent diagnosed with asthma as a child and who continues to use an inhaler to prevent asthmatic attacks. These outcomes would generally be measured by observation or self-report through Questionnaires or participant diaries. In some situations, for example with children, parents may provide the report on the outcomes.",

      "abstract": "There are several potential problems which the Speech Communication instructor may face in evaluating students' performance: including: (1) students may neglect to recognize the multi-cultural classroom context (including ethnic and religious differences); (2) different world-views can result in clashes of opinions; (3) morality can Le perceived differently by representatives of two or more cultures; (4) students may perceive the instructor as biased for various reasons; (5) students may alter their ideas purposely to meet the instructor's expectations; and (6) the instructor's post-speech or post-debate critique may be misunderstood as criticism of certain ideas. Given the subjective and multifaceted nature of ethical codes, evaluatory practices are most objective when based on standards recognized and employed by both instructor and students. Standards of ethics are numerous, and must be taught (perhaps selectively) in order for the instructor to establish a common basis shared and understood by the class. At the basic level of evaluation are the standards of listening with an open mind, paying attention to dissenting opinions, promoting cross-cultural exchanges, and tolerance of expression. At the second level are suggested standards of evaluation including: the ethics of means and ends; the ethic based on intent toward the audience; warranted claims; and contextual ethics.

This thought process can be influenced by external factors or extrinsic motives (such as reward and encouragement from others) and internal factors or intrinsic motives (such as personal interest).\r\nLearning can happen anytime and anywhere. In school, motivation for learning can have a profound influence on students’ effort, persistence and choices in the classroom in the short term, and can affect students’ academic achievements in the long term.

Obedience issues are related to regulations. Humans prefer disobedience, if there are rules to obey, so violations occur here. This has happened since in the Garden of Eden. And it continues to grow in various aspects of life to date. Obedience is a decision to serve the obedient leader. Service and obedience are two things that are side by side like Siamese twins. Through expressions that contain teaching that is so strict, that if someone likes to serve or feels called in a certain field of service, but has a rebellious heart to the leader, it is showing a failure to understand the meaning of a service. Obedience of the servants is clearly very instrumental in solving the problem that is happening.&#x0D; Abstrak Indonesia&#x0D; Taat atau ketaatan adalah sikap yang tunduk kepada wewenang, menjalankan apa yang diperintahkan, mematuhi apa yang dituntut atau menjauhkan diri dari apa yang dilarang. Persoalan ketaatan terkait dengan peraturan. Manusia lebih suka tidak taat, jikalau ada aturan supaya taat, sehingga terjadilah pelanggaran di sini. Ini telah terjadi sejak di Taman Eden.

Melalui ungkapan yang mengandung pengajaran yang begitu ketat, bahwa jikalau seseorang suka melayani atau merasa terpanggil dalam bidang pelayanan tertentu, namun memiliki hati yang suka berontak kepada sang pemimpinnya, itu sedang menunjukkan adanya kegagalan dalam memahami arti sebuah pelayanan.

Despite many studies in the field, there is very little uniformity in research results to indicate which trait or situational factors spell the difference between and failure for entrepreneurs. The objectives of this paper are: (a) to review the growing dissatisfaction with the research into key entrepreneurship personality traits, (b) to identify conceptual difficulties which limit progress in the field, and (c) to recommend alternative research designs to dig deeper into the causes of and failure. ENTREPRENEURSHIP TRAITS: THE QUEST FOR THE RIGHT STUFF Does an entrepreneur's result from having the right stuff (1)? Can a stable set of traits be identified which distinguishes successful entrepreneurs from unsuccessful entrepreneurs? Timmons (2), for example, offers the following characteristics as success traits: * total commitment, determination, and perseverance * drive to achieve and grow * orientation to opportunities and goals * persistence * tolerance for ambiguity, stress and uncertainty * calculated risk taking * low need for status and power * integrity and reliability * ability to learn from failure. While traits such as these are often assumed to be valid determinants of success, the fundamental question is whether we can actually demonstrate a causal relationship between traits and entrepreneurial success. Researchers have addressed this issue by measuring the traits of successful entrepreneurs and contrasting them with the traits of entrepreneurs who failed. Some researchers document that certain traits do indeed distinguish successful entrepreneurs. McClelland (34), for example, reported that highly successful entrepreneurs were distinctive in terms of initiative, assertiveness, and achievement orientation. Highly successful entrepreneurs did not differ, however, in traits such as self-confidence, persistence, and persuasion. Unfortunately, other researchers have reported quite different results. Cooper (12), for example, reported an actual decline in optimism among entrepreneurs as experience increased, while Karagozoglu and Brown (29) reported that ability, rather than personality, was positively correlated with success. Brockhaus (7) is often cited for his article which reviewed the risk-taking propensity of entrepreneurs. His statistical analysis disconfirmed a high level of risk-taking for entrepreneurs. Tucker (50) also reported that risk-taking was not a significant differentiating factor. Similarly, in a study of 378 entrepreneurs, Hay, Kash, and Carpenter (24) found that internal versus external locus of control did not differentiate successful from unsuccessful entrepreneurs, even though significant differences were expected. There seems to be growing dissatisfaction in the entrepreneurship literature with the search for key traits. Ginsberg and Buchholtz (23) concluded their study by saying, light of the divergences reflected in the results, it could not be concluded that entrepreneurs are a different breed as far as personality characteristics are concerned. Carsrud (10) reported similar results, reporting no clearly established links between business and personality characteristics. Similarly, Gartner (21) suggested abandoning the trait approach altogether and focusing on what entrepreneurs do rather than what they are. One apparent trend in the research is that the most sophisticated studies generate the most disappointing results, whereas anecdotal reports offer the most glowing descriptions of essential traits (see Table 1). In a relatively sophisticated study, Perry, Meredith, and Cunnington (40) compared the economic performance of a number of entrepreneurs in a single industry. Using multiple regression analysis, they reported that personality trait data washed out except, possibly, for achievement motivation (no significance level reported). …",

      "title": "MO‐F‐137‐01: Controlling Stuff, Beating Stress, and Finding Work‐Life Balance",
      "abstract": "Many busy professionals are susceptible to stress, burnout, and other work‐related conditions that detract from their quality of life. Medical physicists are no exception, and in some ways are even more susceptible to these pressures and difficulties than other professionals. The challenges to maintaining physical and mental stamina are real and fast‐changing due to advances in technology, economic forces, and generational shifts and trends in the workforce. A stressed or burned‐out individual is probably working harder than he or she needs to due to inefficient workflow. Such people tend to take a lot of work home with them, negatively impacting their priorities outside the workplace. As the stress mounts, it is typical to feel that one needs to “get organized” or improve “time management” in order to improve the situation. Most such efforts fail, if they are even begun.There are a number of popular approaches to time management and goal‐setting which fail to address these challenges because they take an unrealistic approach. These methods fail because they don' t give the user control over his or her situation. Unpleasant and difficult circumstances generate the most stress when the individual feels out of control. A successful approach to time, task, and stress management must be based on principles, but these principles must be tied to implementing clear and simple practices. This session will introduce a set of principles for managing time, tasks, and resources, beginning with attention. Examples of specific practices that support the principles will be discussed. The meaning of “work‐life balance” will be explored as it relates to the medical physics profession. Attendees will learn an approach to controlling their attention and focus so they can move toward aligning their day‐to‐day activities with their longer‐term goals. Learning Objectives: 1. Explain what work‐life balance means to you. 2. Describe the principles of self‐direction and control that are needed to align activities with goals and priorities. 3. List three practices that lead to greater personal control and greater efficiency.",

      "abstract": "During our entire life span, we spend time in the activity of learning (anything from basic survival skills to highly intellectual processes), but this activity occupies most of the time during the first years of our lives. The classroom becomes then the official learning space that is designed to be conducive to this activity. The learning process, regardless of the task difficulty, is not a mechanical one. It requires a mental process, concentration, and attention in various degrees. Distractions can be detrimental to the learning. Most of the learning activities that occur at school settings require some kind of oral communication (teacher-student or student-student), and these activities call for appropriate room acoustics. In the presence of high levels of background noise, human beings have other resources to better understand the signal of interest. Those can be visual cues, previous knowledge of the topic, or mental ability to “fill in the blanks” in the received speech. The last two are abilities that come with age and experience. The purpose of this study is to better assert the importance of acoustics parameters in the design of classrooms and their relation to student achievement.",

      "title": "Understanding How Humans Learn and Adapt to Changing Environments",
      "abstract": "Compared to other animals or to artificial agents, humans are unique in the extent of their abilities to learn and adapt to changing environments. When focusing on skill learning and model-based approaches, learning can be conceived as a progression of increasing, then decreasing, dimensions of representing knowledge. First, initial learning demands exploration of the learning space and the identification of the relevant dimensions for the novel task at hand. Second, intermediate learning requires a refinement of these relevant dimensions of knowledge and behavior to continue improving performance while increasing efficiency. Such improvements utilize chunking or other forms of dimensionality reduction to diminish task complexity. Finally, late learning ensures automatization of behavior through habit formation and expertise development, thereby reducing the need to effortfully control behavior. While automatization greatly increases efficiency, there is also a trade-off with the ability to generalize, with late learning tending to be highly specific to the learned features and contexts. In each of these phases a variety of interacting factors are relevant: Declarative instructions, prior knowledge, attentional deployment, and cognitive fitness have unique roles to play. Neural contributions to processes involved also shift from earlier to later points in learning as effortfulness initially increases and then gives way to automaticity. Interestingly, video games excel at providing uniquely supportive environments to guide the learner through each of these learning stages. This fact makes video games a useful tool for both studying learning, due to their engaging nature and dynamic range of complexity, as well as engendering learning in domains such as education or cognitive training.",

      "title": "Self-Efficacy in Nursing Students",
      "abstract": "Senior baccalaureate nursing students would enter nursing profession very soon. Some even jump to the nursing carrier just after their graduation. Self-efficacy in senior nursing students help them to feel competent in meeting the entry level in clinical fields and to accept this challenging role. Self-efficacy is a good indicator to predict nursing students' performance in clinical practice (1). Educating future generations of competent registered nurses requires courage and commitment. Self-efficacy is the belief in one’s ability to take actions to manage a future situation (2). Self-efficacy have grounded in social learning theory in humans which has basic primary drives (e.g. hunger and thirst) and secondary drives. Secondary drives evolve as rewarded or reinforced behaviors. Self-efficacy is among the secondary drives. The feeling of “I can do” gives a person a sense of mastery over one’s environment (3).\r\n\r\nIncreasing self-efficacy may foster independence and confidence (4). Evidence suggest that job satisfaction and intention to stay in a profession are enhanced by a strong sense of practice self-efficacy (5, 6). Bandura reported that students with low levels of self-efficacy would tend to avoid situations that led to failure in the past (4). When this occurs in nursing it can lead to an educational catastrophe. This leads to this issue that students would avoid specific tasks that they perceive may result in failure during their education (7, 8). These students would have less clinical self-esteem and may leave their profession. This may describe some part of high attrition in nursing students (9).\r\n\r\nIf students believe in their capabilities, they would use their maximal efforts in different situations. Self-efficacy is vital for nursing students and clinical nurses. Nurses with low self-efficacy would not take needed actions for their patients. In current situation that nursing errors can have devastating consequences for nurses, they naturally may not initiate tasks that are not sure about their abilities to avoid making mistakes (2).\r\n\r\nTo overcome this problem, students must see success on the tasks they had expected to fail. McLaughlin et al. examined the association between personality and self-efficacy to predict academic performance and attrition from nursing programs. Results showed that higher occupational self-efficacy could significantly predict higher final marks as well as higher rates of program completion (9). Gibbons suggests, verbally validating student learning, providing positive feedback and positively supporting can increase students' self-efficacy (10). There are some suggestions to improve self-efficacy of nursing students:\r\n\r\n\r\n- Students should have this opportunity to practice clinical skills in skill labs under the supervision of a clinical educator.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Students should receive continuous and effective feedbacks throughout their study in clinical courses.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Clinical educators should provide wide range of clinical experiences for nursing students.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Students should be encouraged to act independently and under indirect supervision of clinical educators, when they reached to a certain level of competency.",

      "abstract": "The stressful states (e.g. the state of illness, sickness, acute or chronic pain, comatose and perioperative states) can be considered as psychological states in which we are more susceptible to all suggestions, including the deliberate or involuntary, direct or implicit ones. Under these conditions whether conscious of unconscious, peoples' thinking processes change, become literal, direct and somewhat paranoid, overly sensitive for not only to the direct, but to the implicit, inner meanings of communicative messages, as well. Research evidence shows that even the comatose people may maintain contact with the environment, therefore the conversation around and other communicative effects may serve as a special suggestion. These messages can be (unconsciously) interpreted by the patients following different logic than it would have been processed in the waking state. Treating people who are in these special stressful states one should carefully analyze all of the meaning layers of his/her communication, to make the helpful, positive suggestions more effective, and avoid the negative, destructive ones. The possible negative suggestions are those words, labels, and actions, that may be proper from practical, economical or organisational point of view, but we do not take their implicit suggestive meanings into considerations. The paper gives a detailed overview about the role of suggestions used during the management of a patient in intensive care situations, and some guidelines are outlined to make our (possible) negative suggestions to be helpful and positive.",

      "title": "Thinking about Thinking",
      "abstract": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults is associated with various cognitive deficits. First, we explored metacognition in adult ADHD. Metacognition refers to “thinking about thinking”, the awareness and regulation of our cognitive processes. To illustrate, think of driving down the highway. If you notice you get tired and less concentrated (self-awareness), you could drive to the nearest gas station and rest (self-regulation), so when you drive again you might be more concentrated. Patients with ADHD may show deficits in some aspects of metacognition, but other aspects may not be affected. This raises concerns about the widespread reliance on self-reports in clinical assessments and calls for a multidimensional assessment approach. Metacognition influences daily functioning (rated by patients and their relatives), which may have important implications for treatment strategies. Second, we investigated the impact of basic processes on higher order functions. The rationale is: if the foundation is impaired, any functions building on it may be affected. For example, if someone in a conversation does not register and encode some information (basic process), they may be unable to remember and act on it later (higher order function). A central finding is that basic processes may be part of the foundation of cognitive impairment in adult ADHD. This was replicated with different tests in an independent sample, reinforcing the importance of basic processes. As stimulants may improve basic processes, clinicians could use deficits in basic processes as indication that stimulant treatment may be beneficial.",

Because of the impact of such stress human bedy systems, most people do not plan to engage in air traffic control as a lifelong occupation. Surgeons and teachers do make such a commitment. Surgeons may argue, Yes, but you teachers do not have life and death in your hands. To which teachers appropriately respond, True, bat when you are working with one patient, at that moment (s)he is your only responsibility. You aren't also responsible for othcr patients to see that they are working diligently to rec dvcr thea health. And you don't have to keep your eye some patients that are apt to disorganize the sheets or pour out their medicine.

      "abstract": "Vision is not simply the ability to read a certain size letter at a distance of 20 feet. Vision is a complex and adaptable information gathering and processing system which collects, groups, analyzes, accumulates, equates, and remembers information. In this review, some of the essential components of the visual system and their disorders which can be physiologically and clinically identified, i.e., the oculomotor, the accommodative, and the fusional vergence systems have been discussed. Any dysfunctions in these systems, can lessen the quality and quantity of the initial input of information into the visual system. Deficiencies in one or more of these visual subsystems have been shown to result in symptoms, such as blurred or uncomfortable vision or headaches, or behavioral signs such as rubbing of the eyes, eyes turning inward or outward, reduced job efficiency or reading performance, or simply the avoidance of near point tasks. In addition, these signs/symptoms may contribute to reducing a person's attention and interest in near tasks. The goal of vision therapy is to eliminate visual problems, thereby reducing the frequency and severity of the patient's signs and symptoms. Vision therapy should only be expected to be of clinical benefit to patients who have detectable visual deficiencies. In response to the question, \"How effective is vision therapy in remediating visual deficiencies?,\" it is evident from the research presented that there is sufficient scientific support for the efficacy of vision therapy in modifying and improving oculomotor, accommodative, and binocular system disorders, as measured by standardized clinical and laboratory testing methods, in the majority of patients of all ages for whom it is properly undertaken and employed. The American Optometric Association reaffirms its long-standing position that vision therapy is an effective therapeutic modality in the treatment of many physiological and information processing dysfunctions of the vision system. It continues to support quality optometric care, education, and research and will cooperate with all professions dedicated to providing the highest quality of life in which vision plays such an important role.",

EnglishStress can be defined as a situation in which the subject perceives difficulties or disability in their resources to dominate or exceed certain demands, external or internal, thus carrying a characteristic physiological and behavioral activation. Several physiological response of stress components influence the learning and memory processes. Teenagers usually present certain eating habits, which result in an unbalanced eating pattern. Those eating habits, which promote health at short, medium and long term, should be taught by way of nutrition education programs.

Special attention is given to parameters that merit attention when working on current life issues, such as: differentiation between capacities for assertive anger and explosive rage (and other aspects of emotion regulation), differentiation between internal experience and outside behaviour (and other aspects of reality-testing), patient's dangerousness to self and/or others, etc.",

One of the major obstacles to the conduct of both psychological and educational research on play is the dominance of player‐centered definitions of play itself, wherein the important control variables are implied to reside exclusively in the aptitudes and predispositions of the player. A more useful approach may be to model play as ordinary adaptive behavior, in the manner of biology and formal cybernetics. The important feature of such models is that the variable sets residing in (a) the structure of the plaything and (b) the structure of the large play environment may be systematically entered into the psychological equations that represent the control of play activity and, hence, of its learning outcomes. An important feature of such heretofore neglected variables is that they are readily measured and/or manipulated, a feature not characteristic of players' mental states and aptitudes.",

In testing oral abilities or writing there is hearable and seeable data to assess, while in receptive skills it is difficult to assess the process which occurs consciously or unconsciously in the brain system. However, taking any passage and designing simple items and addressing it to students cannot give the expected results on the measuring reading comprehension of students. Due to the unobservable process in reading assessment, designing reading tests cause major difficulties for test designers. For instance, on measuring a particular skill it is impossible to measure that particular skill since it is cannot be observed cause of conscious process in the brain and the teacher cannot know exactly student uses that particular skill which is intended to measure by the test designer. While reading there is several stages to achieve ultimate comprehension of the text including decoding the symbols into words, transforming the words into meaningful content, and understanding them. As a second language reader, this process may contain extra stages.",

      "title": "Introduction to the psychology of planning",
      "abstract": "The terms \"plans\" and \"planning\" can be used to refer to many different aspects of cognition and cognitive control in everyday life. One use of the term \"plan\" is to describe a procedure for achieving a particular goal or desired outcome. For example, when we ask a friend or colleague \"So, what's the plan?\" we are often hoping for a set of directions to guide our thoughts and actions. That is, we are hoping for directions on what to do and when to do it, and this in turn might tell us those things that are most important and those things to watch out for. Ideally, the plan that is shared should be complete (that is, the contents and their ordering satisfactorily accomplishes the goal), efficient (the component thoughts and actions should hopefully have been evaluated and optimized), and foolproof (the instructions should be easy to memorize, monitor and execute, with little chance of things going wrong). However, in everyday life, plans may still be useful without offering explicit guidance or instructions. A map of the London Underground or an architect's diagram detailing the layout of a house may also be properly referred to as plans, but they provide a representation or overview of a project or problem, rather than a set of directions. This type of plan refers to the appropriate organization of knowledge, and facilitates integration of the component parts of a problem, allows for mental simulation to generate and evaluate new ideas, and affords increased understanding to test and detect problems before they occur. That is, although these plans may themselves bethe result of prior planning, they additionally offer a representation or framework of a problem in such a way that helps promote future plans and planning. For example, a clear understanding of the current state of play and what needs to be done, together with a knowledge of the different means and methods at our disposal may greatly facilitate the efficiency of achieving our goals. Through using planning and problem-solving tips and strategies, a selected subset of (hopefully useful) new alternatives may be discovered more quickly and more efficiently than would be the case if one used only pure trial or error, or if one systematically explored each and every possibility in turn.",

      "title": "Psychological safety and leadership",
      "abstract": "FigureWith all the talk of safety cultures over the past 20+ years, you would think we would have achieved work environments with psychological safety. Maybe you have in your organization, and kudos if that's true. I've heard many stories of staff, and leaders, who still don't feel safe speaking up, even if it would prevent an error. Remaining silent just isn't okay. This is Nursing Management's annual safety issue, and the concept of psychological safety for all team members at every level shouldn't be an elusive lived value. What does it mean? Basically, that you can speak up, admit mistakes, ask a question, disagree, voice a concern, or make a suggestion without fear of punishment or humiliation—a culture where open and honest communication is welcome. Psychological safety isn't limited to patient safety and can be applied to any aspect of your work, even delicate conversations about an employee's attendance or performance. In the context of patient safety, it could result in a near miss not becoming a \"hit\" or proactive process improvement for broken or inadequate systems. The opposite of psychological safety is bullying and/or being shut down. How many of us have heard these words: \"Don't question my orders, just do it, now\"? The humiliation and embarrassment from abuse of hierarchical power or bullying by a peer can shut you down for a long time. Even a perceived lack of inclusion implies a lack of psychological safety, connecting the concept with our diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. We must support staff members who've been victims of a psychologically unsafe culture. After being silenced, it's unlikely a person will speak up again. Breaking that cycle is up to us. It takes effort and practice to create this type of culture. Be curious, draw people out, and recognize it publicly when it happens. Of course, you have to speak up clearly and respectfully at all times. Communicating effectively is a learned skill all nurses need to acquire, preferably as early as their undergraduate curriculum. Communication skills are as important to nursing practice as clinical skills. An example of a structured communication methodology is the TeamSTEPPS system (www.ahrq.gov/teamstepps). Designed for healthcare, this system has helped many teams improve the environment for safety. One of my favorite TeamSTEPPS techniques is the stop-the-line \"CUS\" approach: Saying \"I'm Concerned, I'm Uncomfortable, this is a Safety issue.\" As leaders, we must set the tone and role model the behaviors. We don't want \"yes\" to be the answer to everything. If this is the case, we won't learn, grow, or innovate. When psychological safety is present, team effectiveness and high performance are improved, maybe even predicted. Beware, it does slow things down. Another factor is the team itself—knowing and working with each other regularly creates a foundation of trust, which makes a huge difference. If nursing or multidisciplinary team members are new to the team, psychological safety can suffer. Creating an environment of inclusion for everyone from the chief to the clinical nurse, pharmacist, nursing assistant, respiratory therapist, housekeeper, and clerk is mission critical. When all voices are heard and valued, not diminished, the environment for safety improves. Your leadership matters in making psychological safety alive and well for your team, and for yourself.Figure[email protected]",

      "title": "Compounding conflicts of interest: including an author's own work in a systematic review",
      "abstract": "Authors' conflicts of interest may distort both the conduct – what is ultimately \"done\" during the research – and also how their research is received; that is, it may have an impact on the credibility and trustworthiness of the work. As authors, we are generally expected to declare any relationships that may lead to actual or potential conflicts of interest that apply to our work as a result of who we are and how we have gone about it. Financial conflicts of interest are a common and easily recognizable example. As systematic reviewers, in an attempt to establish a thorough assessment of health care practices (insofar as the available evidence will allow), we industriously spend a fair amount of our time sorting out biases in the available research. Some biases are inherent and due to the design of the study or topic being investigated; for example, selection bias in observational studies or performance bias where blinding to the intervention may be impossible. The more difficult to elucidate, however, are those biases that arise due to issues with the conduct of the work and, in some cases, who is conducting the work. Considering both the type of research and who is doing the work, it is worth noting there is even greater potential for some unique conflict of interest in our realm of evidence synthesis. While proofreading a recent issue of our journal for publication, I noted that in two of the systematic reviews, members of the review author team were also authors of multiple included studies in each review. Unlike those of us who claim to be methodologists and apply our diverse arsenal of evidence synthesis methodologies and methods1 across a range of diverse topics, it is not uncommon for authors to conduct a systematic review in their own field of research and interest. Considering the review question has most likely arisen from studies generated by the research team's previous work, it is similarly not uncommon for reviewers to find that their own research is eligible for inclusion in the review. It is important to recognize that the inclusion of one's own studies in the review will instantly raise the specter of potential conflict of interest and cast doubt over the credibility of the work. Why? Despite our best efforts, some of the fundamental and defining features of a systematic review rely on subjective processes. This includes essential steps, such as study selection for inclusion in the review, and critical appraisal or assessment of methodological quality. All reviewers use available resources to ensure consistency and transparency, including detailing transparent eligibility criteria in the protocol, and identifying various tools that will be employed to assess methodological quality, such as checklists or domain-based tools with appropriately aligned signaling questions. However, inevitably, these processes require some judgment calls on behalf of the reviewer. Inclusion of one's own studies in a systematic review without acknowledgment suggests to the reader that the author is capable of casting an objective view over their own work, similar to any other person's work. It suggests they can do so transparently, without referring to information or knowledge about the conduct of the study that they alone are privy to and beyond what is publicly available. Accepting this at face value would seemingly ask a great deal of any knowledge user and will, by rights, leave the review at high risk of author bias. The potential for impact and risk of bias arising from the inclusion of an author's own studies may be more pronounced in JBI qualitative reviews and text and opinion reviews, where \"meaning\" is required to be established, more so than in quantitative reviews, which present a readily identifiable numerical value to include in a statistical meta-analysis. Furthermore, appraisal of the included studies in these types of reviews overtly requires the reviewers to make judgment calls regarding the investigators/authors of the work, such as whether the authors addressed their influence on the work in JBI qualitative reviews2 and, for reviews of text and opinion, to rate the credibility of the source of the opinion/expert.3 In summary, including one's own studies in a review will impinge on the credibility and validity of the review process, most importantly the assessment of methodological quality, and, ultimately, any claims to the presentation of the best available evidence and the certainty or confidence in the findings of the systematic review. In the event that any members of the review team are also authors of included studies, this will, most likely, be realized during the preparation of the review protocol. Authors should declare that, in the event a team member's own work is eligible for inclusion in the review, they have mechanisms in place to mitigate potential conflict of interest in the review process, such as abstaining from study selection and/or appraisal/risk-of-bias assessment in their entirety, and also the extraction and synthesis processes, as required. If inclusion of an author's own study is only established during the subsequent course of the review process, authors should add a declaration indicating the mechanisms they implemented to alleviate risk of author bias. Any further nuances may be qualified in the limitations of the review presented in the discussion section.",

      "title": "The Spy Ring History Test",
      "abstract": "Abstract : The 'Spy Ring History Test' is described. It is one of several, similarly structured, mental tests intended to discriminate between individual cognitive styles, and individual tendencies to learn according to different plans and strategies for exploring (or assimilating) subject matter. Form II is typical and may be referenced as representative. The test are not meant to determine absolute levels of performance, learning rate, or retention, though there may be (and, by hypothesis, there are) relations between test scores indicating stylistic differences, and a respondent's performance in specific tasks. The dimensions which have emerged as significant discriminators of style and strategy (from studies of educationally sized learning) refer to quite specific cognitive mechanisms and are most readily observed as features of continuing behavior and cognition. They are believed to have special relevance to such inherently complex and individualised activities as hypothesis formation and system design.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive conformity changes the opinion, the judgment, or the behavior of individuals and forces them to obey the norm or canon of the group or the organization. Such conformity might potentially lead to irrational decision-making as a group. Therefore, it is important for organizational managers to make efforts and take measures so that unconscious conformity behavior does not lead to serious accidents. An experiment was conducted to get insights into conformity behaviors that could potentially be risk factors of serious accidents. Put it more concretely, under a Prisoner’s dilemma situation, it was experimentally explored how the number of members in a group and the situation of other member’s decision-making, and whether the behavior is guided (derived) to cooperation or non-cooperation affected the conformity behavior. It tended that the conformity behavior to others frequently occurred when more than half of the members made the same decision, or when the decisions of other members was about to reach (gain) a majority. In short, the situation of other member’s decision-making significantly (p < 0.01) affected the occurrence of conformity behavior. The guidance (derivation) to non-cooperation significantly (p < 0.01) led to more frequent conformity behaviors than the guidance (derivation) to cooperation. In other words, it was found that the conformity phenomena more easily occurred by the guidance (derivation) to non-cooperation than by the guidance (derivation) to cooperation.",

It is also advised that the client should master one tic or habit before progressing to another. Moreover, knowledge gained from past tics or habits and tension regarding relaxation and mindfulness, styles of action, planning less, and linking thoughts and action should apply to all subsequent tics or habits. The types of event likely to lead to relapse are some of the following: fatigue; and positive and negative stress. The key to relapse prevention is to continue to put the exercises into practice, as the program draws on strengths and eventually encourages the client to feel more accepting and compassionate towards him or herself.",

Tasks involving some degree of cognitive complexity is desirable, but there is no reason to believe that certain forms of learning are better than others. What is critical is that the activity needs to be consistent and persistent. Involvement of cognitive activity at work is important and jobs that involve high stress, passive participation, and lack of complexity are associated with higher levels of cognitive impairment in later life. There is also no reason to believe that mental activities must be limited to the early years of life. People are able to learn at all ages and participation in learning is valuable for the brain throughout life. The concept of diversity refers as well to learning and mental activities. It is good to learn new things! Participation in cognitive activities throughout the lifespan both at home and at work and avoiding multi-tasking can help build cognitive reserve capacity. Cognitive activities directly impair disease processes. Being cognitively active and paying attention to the world helps to protect the brain from free radicals and toxins. Cognitive activities also assists in the management of stress.",

      "abstract": "Abstract As manifest in the domains of activity reviewed in the previous two chapters, the social interaction of primates depends on individuals’ abilities to learn about other members of their groups and how they are likely to behave in certain situations and to learn various social and communicative strategies for manipulating those groupmates for their own ends. In both of these cases the processes of learning involved may be broadly construed as social in the sense that the learning is about social interaction. However, most psychologists typically use a somewhat narrower definition of social learning to indicate situations in which one individual attempts to actually reproduce or match the behavior of another (e.g., Bandura, 1986). This narrower definition thus does not include interactions in which an individual learns a new behavior or behavioral strategy through reciprocal social interaction: an individual does A and a groupmate responds with B, as happens in the learning of a social strategy or the ritualization of a communicative gesture. Rather, in the narrower definition of social learning, the individual learns a new behavior or behavioral strategy by observing and attempting to reproduce a conspecific’s behavior in situations in which they are both aiming toward a similar goal, either physical or social. The complement of social learning narrowly defined is the process by which an individual attempts to demonstrate for another, or to teach another, how some common goal might be accomplished.",

      "title": "Cutting Corners: Neuropsychological Research into the Energetics of ADHD",
      "abstract": "People with ADHD are often subject to normative judgments by others for not doing their best, or being lazy. At school, the teachers’ urge that they should put more effort into school work, may often be phrased as a question of will rather than lacking ability. Figuratively they could be said to cut corners, in the sense that they often perform tasks the easiest way. Even though they may know the long term advantages of hard work or of performing dull tasks, they may nonetheless follow the desires of the moment. This deficit in volition or self control has been construed as an aspect of behavioural inhibition or executive functioning (EF) (Barkley, 1997) considered as a core deficit in ADHD. Executive functions exert a top top-down mediating role on other cognitive processes, such as attention, learning and motor function. An ongoing discussion is whether impaired top-down processing is sufficient to explain ADHD, or sufficient to explain the heterogeneity of ADHD symptomatology. For some time, most neurocognitive research has focused on EF functions, clearly showing that subjects with ADHD are deficient in such tasks. However, there are four problems with considering this EF impairment as the cause of disordered behaviour.",

      "abstract": "Autististen henkilöiden on tunnetusti vaikeaa asettua toisen asemaan. Täten heidän on myös vaikeaa ymmärtää toisten mielentiloja ja vuorovaikutuksellisia päämääriä sekä tehdä päätelmiä niiden perusteella. Vaikeus asettua toisen asemaan näkyy siksi myös keskustelun tasolla. Autististen henkilöiden on esimerkiksi vaikeaa ymmärtää vuorovaikutuksen implisiittisiä vihjeitä, heillä on taipumusta ymmärtää asiat kirjaimellisesti, ja heidän puheensa saattaa poukkoilla aiheesta toiseen. He saattavat myös vastata kysymykseen tarpeettoman yksityiskohtaisesti tai sitten vastata vain siihen, mitä heiltä kirjaimellisesti on kysytty. Myös aiheen vierestä vastaaminen on tavallista. Nämä tekijät voivat myös aiheuttaa ymmärrysongelmatilanteita autististen henkilöiden vuorovaikutuksessa. Tässä artikkelissa pyrin nostamaan esiin erilaisia esimerkkejä siitä, kuinka toisen asemaan asettumisen vaikeus konkreettisesti heijastuu autististen henkilöiden vuorovaikutukseen. Toisaalta tuon esille myös tapauksia, jotka osoittavat, että vaikka toisen asemaan asettuminen on autistisille henkilöille yleisesti ottaen vaikeaa, toisinaan he kuitenkin pystyvät siihen. Aineisto tulee autenttisista kuntoutuskeskusteluista, joissa 11–13-vuotiaat lievästi autistiset pojat keskustelevat toistensa ja kuntouttajiensa kanssa. Menetelmällisesti tutkimus nojautuu keskustelunanalyysiin. Tutkitussa aineistossa sanotun kirjaimellinen ymmärtäminen vaikuttaisi olevan kaikkein yleisin syy ymmärrysongelmien syntyyn (45,8 %). Myös topikaalisista hyppäyksistä aiheutuvat ymmärrysongelmat ovat yleisiä (36,1 %). Keskustelunanalyysin keinojen avulla pystytään kuvaamaan, kuinka ongelmatilanteet tarkalleen ottaen syntyvät, ja kuinka ne ratkaistaan.",

      "abstract": "Drawing on 50 years of research, this article defines workaholism as involving high motivation (e.g., being driven to work due to internal pressures) as well as high effort expenditure (e.g., having persistent thoughts about work when not working and working beyond what can reasonably be expected). Workaholism can be distinguished from concepts such as work engagement, work passion, and Type-A behavior, and valid workaholism measures are available. Regarding its antecedents, demographic and personality factors are weakly related to workaholism. Work-related factors (such as the presence of an overwork culture and high job demands) are more important. Workaholism may have adverse outcomes for a worker's mental and physical health, well-being, and family life. Workaholics do not perform better (but may well perform worse) than others. Although many interventions have been put forward to address workaholism, the effects of these are usually unclear. We conclude with a short agenda for future research.",

A two-way flow of communication is certainly desirable, If not absolutely essential, for effective managerial performance. Transmission of information is necessary for coordination of activities; and receipt of information Is necessary for control, and allows for better decision-making. The process of information exchange--communication--has been modeled to Include: Sender -> Message -> Channel -> Receiver Feedback (from receiver to sender) is usually desirable, although not technically necessary, for communication to take place. What keeps communication from being 100% effective, i.e., the interference in getting the message from the sender to the receiver, 18 “noise.” Noise can be physical or psychological, additive or subtractive. This exercise demonstrates to students how certain forms of can impair effective communication-- especially the receiving of information--and how some noise can be minimized to promote more effective listening.

      "abstract": "This chapter examines repetitional responses to polar questions that implement requests for confirmation, information, or assistance in Russian conversation, contrasting them with particle responses, such as da (‘yes’) and net (‘no’). The analysis will show that Russian repetitional responses tend to be a marked response option deployed to disalign from some dimension of the interrogative or the action it implements. For example, repetitional responses may be deployed to reassert its speaker’s epistemic authority in the service of confirming a candidate understanding, to insist on the veracity of a statement following an enactment of disbelief or doubt, to disalign from the action implemented by an information request, or – in response to requests for service – to contest the stance that the provision of assistance might be problematic. The analysis suggests that different types of repetitional responses (such as lexical vs. longer repeats) may enact more or less disaligning stances vis-à-vis the initiating action. Overall, what exactly is being accomplished via a repetitional response is sensitive to a number of considerations, including the sequential and action environment of its deployment, the design of the repetitional response, and the repertoire of available response options.",

      "title": "Occupational Burnout and the Causes, Predisposing Factors, Consequences, and Prevention Strategies",
      "abstract": "Occupational burnout is a common dilemma for employees working in long term careers. It is characterized by exhaustion, cynicism, and lowered efficiency, and it progresses through three stages. Burnout is caused by the increase of demands and the loss of resources. Sleep impairment is also significantly associated with burnout, and also has been shown to hinder the recovery. Lack of balance between work and personal life, as well as perception of stressful events can lead to developing feelings of burnout. External regulation has been associated with a person being more susceptible to develop burnout. Other personal characteristics, such as inability to handle stress, pessimism, and frequently feeling fatigued can result in a person being more susceptible to burnout. Failing to address feelings of burnout properly can result in a variety of negative consequences in the workplace, home life, and personal health. Employees can prevent burnout by balancing their work lives with their personal lives, and keep up with their personal health. In the workplace, employees should reevaluate their goals regularly and prioritize their tasks into manageable lists. Being aware of the predisposition, causes, and symptoms of occupational burnout will help us to recognize and prevent it, and help employees to feel more motivated and accomplished in their careers. 3 OCCUPATIONAL BURNOUT Occupational Burnout and the Causes, Predisposing Factors, Consequences, and Prevention",

      "abstract": "Much of the work designed to investigate the phenomena of human learning may be thought of as having its ultimate applicability in the de­ sign of effective conditions for instruction. This is true whether these condi­ tions are conceived as being arranged by an instructor, by some form of teaching machine or training device, by a set of materials like a book or film, or by the learner himself. In some general sense, therefore, it would be truly difficult to distinguish the psychology of instruction from the psychology of learning. In this first review bearing such a title, we have attempted to limit attention to studies of those variables and conditions that appear to have a fairly direct applicability to the design of instruction. Remoteness of applicability to instruction, we note with some regret, characterizes many studies of human learning, retention, and transfer, appearing in the most prestigious of psychological journals. The findings of many studies of human learning presently cannot be applied directly to instructional design for two major reasons: (a) the conditions under which the learning is investigated, such as withholding knowledge of learning goals from the subject and the requiring of repetition of responses, are often un­ representative of conditions under which most human learning occurs; and (b) the tasks set for the learner (e.g., the verbatim reproduction of verbal responses, the guessing of stimulus attributes chosen by the experimenter, among many others) appear to cover a range from the merely peculiar to the downright esoteric. This is not to imply that such studies do not further an understanding of the learning process. However, it would seem that extensive theory development centering upon learning tasks and learning conditions will be required before one will be able to apply such knowledge to the de­ sign of instruction for representative human tasks. Within the limitation of the criterion of direct applicability to instruc­ tion, our review of studies of human learning, retention, and transfer has been fairly broad. We have sought relevant reports in psychological journals and books of general orientation, as weII as in those devoted more specificaIIy",

In order to do the job effectively decisions have to be taken regarding: managing time and selecting priorities; managing meetings; managing boundaries; communicating effectively; evaluating the role; and marketing the service. Evaluation can be seen as end point activity which is based upon a consumer satisfaction model. The biography of the school and its emotional climate will need to be considered in evaluating the work. The final stage of the process is the end game phase, where the adviser is working towards ending direct work in the school.

Self-regulated learning means that the learning person understands the process of one's learning i.e. understands what one needs; understands what happens to one during such learning; one is responsible for own learning; one has acquired and independently applies learning skills. Many scholars regard reflection as being means for improvement of competent learning. Reflection in pedagogy is to be understood as a process of awareness the performance and / or action which took place in educational process or any part. Reflection is based on analysis of one's actions and/or activities. Reflection may differ both in terms of the goal as well as in terms of the subject across various stages of learning process and activities. Russian educator and psychologist A. Stepanova classifies reflection in accordance with the subject of reflection (Степанова, 2009): mood and emotional status reflection; reflection of learning content; learning activity reflection. Mood and emotional status reflection and learning content reflection are often applied in Latvian schools; while reflection on learning activities has enjoyed little recognition. Educators in Latvian schools often offer students use questions and visualisation as methods of reflection (latter is used in work with younger students), but negotiations are offer relatively rare. Educators recognise reflection better according to the actions but they lack knowledge on reflection during action thus not offering it to students. Nevertheless, some secondary education students use reflection during action in an unaware manner. Reflection on average is given 5 - 10 minutes during a lesson.",

      "title": "Technical Leadership Skills Development Through Interactive Workshops",
      "abstract": "Abstract Technical Leadership Skills Development Through Interactive Workshops Exceptional performance in engineering or science positions and careers requires detailed knowledge of the fundamentals in a specific field and related areas, and the ability to apply that knowledge to solve problems. However, these capabilities are necessary but not sufficient conditions for career success. In leadership or management positions technically-trained individuals must interact effectively with other individuals and groups within and outside of the organization to ensure that appropriate directions, goals and performance are achieved. That is, success in such positions requires that leaders solve or address sociotechnical problems, wherein a heightened level of complexity exists due to the intersection and interdependence of technical and people problems or issues. Early career leaders often find these situations to be frustrating and confusing, and may conclude that responses from others are illogical. The ability to deal with such considerations requires non-technical skillsets and a modified mindset relative to the strict technical approaches that the leader (initially) possesses. Although management/business courses address some of the issues described, they are not taught from the standpoint of how a technical mindset approaches problems; this mindset typically results in frustration and discomfort for the new leader. Furthermore, business courses are generally focused on higher level leadership/management positions, e.g., Vice President or CEO. Students and early career engineers need insight and guidance when transitioning into technical leadership roles. Specifically, they need to gain awareness of the types of issues they will face and recognize that even if everyone thought logically about the problems encountered, solutions will still be difficult due to differences in values, priorities, biases, experiences, and personalities. Non-technical skills such as emotional intelligence, conflict management, and servant/shared leadership approaches are required to make reasonable decisions and establish/maintain a well-functioning and collegial team or organization. Most graduate programs lack the resources to offer separate courses in technical leadership. However, 1-3 hour workshops offer a way to impart awareness of various challenges implicit in early career leadership roles and to discuss methods to address specific sociotechnical problems. In this talk, a workshop approach to discuss reasons why technical mindsets often lead to frustration for leaders and followers will be described and methods to re-orient the mindset offered. The approach uses 3-5 member teams to discuss mini case-studies typically encountered in early (and later) career positions that confound and frustrate leaders. The example scenarios invoked are ambiguous in that they have no “correct answer”, but rather better or poorer approaches. After each group reports their suggestions and conclusions to the other workshop attendees, consequences of the approaches offered are stressed and discussed with respect to likely reactions by team members and higher level administrators.",

      "abstract": "The resolution of a difficult task often follows a series of identifiable steps. Students of creativity have often characterized the process as a four-stage phenomenon: • Preparation: Orientation to the problem and definition of the task. • Incubation: A period of aridity or immersion in unrelated activities. • Illumination: A sudden spark of insight and the recognition of a candidate solution. • Resolution: Assessment of the candidate solution and its implementation. The preparatory phase of a difficult task involves a careful consideration of the underlying problem and a clear specification of the goals. Too often we tackle tasks without an adequate definition of the true problem, and discover too late that the solution resolves an irrelevant problem. A distinguishing feature of challenging tasks lies in their resistance to attack, and solutions do not always spring from a single session of wrestling with the problem. Often difficult issues are resolved, whether gradually or suddenly, over spaced efforts interrupted by unrelated activities. Some students of creativity take the view that incubation is a period of “intermission” in which the problem submerges into the subconscious. The lack of strict conventions in this netherworld allows for the juxtaposition of new objects in novel and even bizarre combinations. The resulting ideas possess the novelty that is an essential ingredient of a creative solution. Other writers take the view that incubation is nothing more than a period of relaxation or recuperation in which a tired mind regains its energies. Still others would claim that the incubation phase is merely a stretch of time that allows the mind to assimilate other stimuli from the environment, whether at the conscious or subconscious level. Whatever the true role of incubation, the fact remains that many of our difficult problems are resolved only after several sessions of conscious effort separated by seemingly unrelated activities. A candidate solution to a difficult problem often occurs suddenly, just like the elementary ideas that constitute them. Such preliminary solutions or “insights,” however, can be misleading or even incorrect. For this reason, the ideas must be properly evaluated.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Subjectivity is one of the elemental human needs. It is also significant since it plays a part in educational situations. A particularly important premise of subjectivity is responsibility for one's actions and, associated with this, determination of a direction for one's own activity, the exercise of control and the making of choices. Human activity takes place principally in a social context. For this reason it is important to pay attention to two‐subject relationships. Their features are above all purposefulness, bi‐directionality and co‐ordination. Two‐subject activity may be of two sorts—negative co‐operation (conflict) or positive co‐operation, co‐ordination of a line of action including dialogue and collaboration. Educational activity, particularly when directed at younger children, is characterized by different planes of functioning. The adult acts in a longer‐term perspective and formulates his aims in terms of general concepts but a small child acts in a short term perspective and formulates aims in concrete terms. A system of priorities is put forward here, a two‐task model for the educational situation which makes subjective activity possible both for the child and for the adult. In the last part of the article an experiment is described which illustrates how such a two‐task situation works with a system of priorities and the results that were obtained.",

      "title": "Actividades de la vida cotidiana y control cognitivo en demencia, deterioro cognitivo leve y pacientes con daño frontal",
      "abstract": "Realizar Actividades de la Vida Diaria (AVD) de manera autonoma es uno de los aspectos cruciales de la persona. Las AVD se han abordado desde diferentes perspectivas, sin embargo, aun existe una gran necesidad de seguir profundizando en los aspectos cognitivos necesarios para llevarlas a cabo. Una de las funciones cognitivas mas importantes para realizarlas correctamente es el sistema de control cognitivo. Este sistema permite controlar nuestra conducta en presencia de estimulos irrelevantes, asi como mantener el esquema de la actividad en memoria para completar todos los pasos. Tambien es fundamental para detectar y corregir errores que pueden producirse en el transcurso de la actividad. En este trabajo de tesis hemos observado, a traves de tareas experimentales por ordenador, la dificultad que tienen pacientes con lesion frontal para resolver tareas de conflicto tipo Stroop (conflicto Estimulo-Estimulo) y Simon (conflicto Estimulo-Respuesta) y mas aun cuando deben resolverse en presencia de otros estimulos distractores. Trasladando estos resultados a tareas mas complejas de la vida cotidiana, encontramos que, en presencia de objetos distractores que conforman tareas entre si, los pacientes frontales realizaron mas errores de comision que el grupo control. Estos errores cotidianos estuvieron correlacionados con los errores cometidos en la resolucion del conflicto tipo Simon en la tarea de ordenador. Con el objetivo de estudiar en profundidad el impacto de los objetos distractores en la realizacion de las actividades cotidianas en personas que sufren deficits ejecutivos, seleccionamos dos grupos de pacientes, uno que presentaba lesiones frontales y otro lesiones en otras areas cerebrales. De esta forma, solicitamos que llevaran a cabo diversas actividades cotidianas en presencia de distractores que elicitaban acciones entre si, introduciendo varias condiciones experimentales en las que, por un lado, compartian el mismo contexto semantico, y, por otro, compartian pasos y objetos con la tarea target. Los resultados revelaron que los pacientes frontales cometieron un mayor numero de errores de repeticion de pasos y de manipulaciones de objetos sin proposito que el grupo no-frontal. Bajo las condiciones donde se compartio el contexto, el grupo no-frontal se beneficio, mostrando menos omisiones de pasos en la tarea target. El patron contrario fue hallado en el grupo frontal. En las condiciones donde se compartieron pasos y objetos, los pacientes frontales cometieron mas manipulaciones de objetos sin ningun proposito. En los siguientes estudios, incluimos poblaciones clinicas que, a su vez, tambien han mostrado problemas en el sistema de control cognitivo, como son los pacientes con deterioro cognitivo leve (DCL) y demencia. Con estas poblaciones comparamos condiciones en las que los objetos distractores podrian usarse en conjunto para hacer una tarea (Condicion Tarea-Distractor), en las cuales el sistema de control cognitivo debe activarse en mayor medida que en las condiciones donde se presentaron objetos distractores aislados (Condicion Objetos-Distractor). Los resultados revelaron patrones similares al estudio con pacientes no frontales, por el cual todos los grupos, incluido el control, obtuvieron un efecto de facilitacion, reduciendo los errores cometidos con los objetos target en la condicion de Tarea-Distractor. Sin embargo, bajo esta misma condicion, los pacientes con DCL y demencia mostraron mas errores con los objetos distractores que el grupo control. Finalmente, y con el objetivo de analizar mas actividades, en contextos puramente familiares y observando procesos de control cognitivo mas complejos, disenamos la Escala Cognitiva de Actividades Basicas e Instrumentales de la Vida Diaria. Incluimos cuatro procesos cognitivos implicados en las AVD. Uno para evaluar la capacidad para mantener en memoria el esquema de la tarea y el orden de los pasos y los otros tres en relacion con el control cognitivo, como la habilidad para detectar errores y resolver problemas, asi como para iniciar acciones cuando corresponde. Los resultados revelaron que, mientras los pacientes con demencia obtuvieron puntuaciones significativamente mas bajas que el grupo control en todos los procesos cognitivos, los pacientes con DCL mostraron deficits en la resolucion de problemas incluso en las actividades basicas como vestirse o cepillarse los dientes. A diferencia de los pacientes con demencia, los que presentaban DCL mantuvieron una buena capacidad para recuperar y mantener el esquema de la tarea en memoria, tanto en las actividades basicas como las instrumentales. En conclusion, podemos afirmar que ante deficits ejecutivos se genera una mayor interferencia cuando se introducen estimulos u objetos distractores, incluso en la realizacion de tareas cotidianas, mas aun, si estos conforman entre si acciones que deben tambien ser inhibidas, y ademas, comparten pasos y objetos con la tarea target, provocando que se cometan errores con los objetos distractores y que incluso lleguen a usarlos. En relacion con el contexto semantico, en poblacion normal o ante problemas mnesicos y leves ejecutivos, los distractores que forman tareas que estan semanticamente relacionadas con las tareas target, pueden ayudar a recuperar la tarea en memoria. Sin embargo, la competicion entre esquemas de tareas (Target y distractora) puede generar un problema de activacion del esquema de la tarea target en pacientes con alteraciones ejecutivas mas graves, como es el caso de los pacientes con lesiones frontales, generando asi, un aumento de omisiones de pasos. Finalmente, podemos observar que estos problemas se generalizan a otras actividades y a aspectos mas complejos de control cognitivo, como la resolucion de problemas. En este sentido, los pacientes con DCL ya presentan alteraciones incluso en actividades muy basicas. Estos resultados ofrecen un marco para la rehabilitacion de estas personas, y sugieren cambios en la determinacion de los problemas funcionales que ya se observan en pacientes con DCL, que deben de reflejarse tambien en una actualizacion de las categorias diagnosticas.",

      "abstract": "Abstract General intelligence (g) is a highly practical ability that affects personal well-being in many aspects of life. This article reviews five key facts documenting its pervasive utility, and then illustrates how higher levels of intelligence enhance an individual’s performance and well-being in four realms of daily life: work, daily self-maintenance, chronic illness, and accidents. The first key fact is that people who do well on one mental test tend to perform well on all of them; that is, all mental tests correlate with one other. All measure mostly the same underlying ability factor, no matter what their manifest content or purpose. Mental abilities differ in their generality-specificity, and the general mental ability factor, g , is the most general of all. Second, high intelligence is expressed as a set of generic thinking skills that includes learning efficiently, reasoning well, thinking abstractly, and solving novel problems. These information-processing skills can be applied to virtually any kind of content in any context. Hence, third, everyday life continually requires individuals to learn and reason well. Fourth, ample evidence shows that general intelligence not only predicts many forms of success and well-being but usually does so better than socioeconomic status. More specific mental abilities add little to prediction beyond that contributed by g alone. Fifth, intelligence predicts performance better when tasks are more complex. Although higher intelligence is somewhat useful in many life arenas, it is particularly advantageous when jobs and daily tasks are more cognitively demanding. It is therefore important to know the distribution of task demands in different life areas. Four life arenas illustrate how more cognitively demanding tasks put less intelligent individuals at greater risk. Job analysis research has repeatedly shown that the major distinction among jobs is their cognitive complexity, for example, their requirements for obtaining, analyzing, communicating, and applying oral, written, pictorial, and behavioral information. Consistent with this finding, intelligence predicts job performance progressively better in higher level jobs,",

      "title": "Treatment or Accommodation for Adults With Challenging Behaviors",
      "abstract": "When an adult with developmental disabilities is referred for a significant behavior problem such as aggression, oppositional behavior, self-abuse, or destructiveness, it is customary practice in residential care settings to develop and implement a behavioral treatment plan that involves a number of interrelated steps. Typically, a history is taken to determine the strength of the behavior, circumstances related to its occurrence, and past efforts to treat it. Next, presently occurring and potentially contributing physical factors are addressed and ruled out to the extent possible by referral to appropriate medical professionals. The present status of the individual is then assessed through (a) direct observation in the individual’s natural environment; (b) interviews with the individual, when appropriate, and staff members, family, or others familiar with the person; and (c) relevant testing (e.g., as an evaluation of cognitive and adaptive skills and screening for psychopathology, Alzheimer’s disease, or other disorders) and identifying reinforcer preferences. A detailed functional analysis follows to obtain a baseline of the challenging behavior and to identify possible related environmental factors. At this point, internal factors that may be contributing to the problem behaviors as well as relevant psychiatric diagnoses are considered and, when appropriate, a referral is made for a consultation and possible medical management of the disorder. Finally, a behavioral treatment plan appropriate to the individual’s developmental level is designed and implemented, including appropriate staff training and monitoring. Typically, treatment programs involve procedures to reinforce behaviors incompatible with the challenging behavior and to apply least restrictive consequences for the referral problem. Broadly speaking, the objective of behavioral treatment is to make systematic changes in the individual’s environment, including antecedents and consequences, that will support the individual as new adaptive behaviors are learned and old problem behaviors are reduced and ultimately extinguished. The long-term goal of behavioral treatment is to have the individual maintain behavioral gains in the absence of continued treatment. The final outcome should be an improved quality of life for the person in treatment as well as the other residents and staff members whom this individual encounters on a daily basis. The professional literature is replete with studies that document the effectiveness of behavioral treatment programs, and practitioners can easily cite numerous successful treatment cases of their own. However, not all individuals with challenging behaviors experience positive treatment outcomes. We all have cases that despite our best efforts do not respond well to behavioral treatment and for some, they actually become worse. A number of factors contribute to poorer outcomes among individuals with developmental disabilities, including chronological age, a long history of problem behaviors, comorbid psychiatric diagnoses, medical complications, and an intractable treatment record. The purpose of this perspective is to suggest an alternative to traditional behavioral treatment programs that we have experienced good success with over the past 10 years. We call this approach accommo",

Un aspecto que preocupa es que los niños parecen tener una actitud positiva hacia la ciencia, pero conforme avanza su escolaridad esa actitud disminuye gradualmente, así que su actitud al arribar a la secundaria ha cambiado hacia negativa, principalmente en las mujeres. Un primer escollo en la investigación de las actitudes es que no consisten en un constructo simple, sino de un conjunto extendido de pedazos y contribuciones que contribuyen singularmente hacia la actitud global individual: la percepción acerca del profesor; la ansiedad; el valor de la ciencia; el juego y la motivación, todas ellas de la ciencia o hacia la ciencia; las actitudes de los amigos; de los padres; la naturaleza del salón de clases; los logros o los fracasos académicos en la clase de ciencia. El interés es una actitud positiva y su relación con el aprendizaje es muy importante.

      "abstract": "The technique of responses takes into account, generally, the technique of the questions. Depending on what you want to obtain directly, indirect on the long term before negotiating or during negotiation. We must keep in mind some rules, some are common sense, and others are predefined for both question and answer. Both questions and answers have to be though of, who addresses them. We proposed the following rules: avoiding the rush, not necessarily giving a straight answer, it is dangerous to answer all questions, the answer may be delayed due to poor memory or lack of documentation, it is not mandatory to give an honest answer, do not go into details only if it is in own benefit, untrusting answer, ask for information, evidence, facts, answers must be formulated and clearly articulated but in a very low tone, you can give nuanced answers, elusive. When stating the answers, you should avoid the following: frequent and insistent references to your own person, violent critiquing trends of the partner, the tendency to minimize the partner's words, avoid giving advice, warnings or arrogance, know how to make concessions based on the importance of the negotiation. The rule of concessions can go on by echeloned versions: the risk of negotiation failure, if the negotiation takes a different turn, lack of new concessions which can increase the levels of tension and danger of failure, the partner is encouraged to seek concessions, that cannot be granted, the level of hope of the partner may increase and the effect is disastrous, the desire to compromise, a better option that indicates limited room for negotiation. There are dangerous alternatives by the high level of the first installment, so that partner is happy with 70 % but the best option is based on a partner's psychological reaction to the partial withdrawal of the concession and its final restoration, showing good faith and giving partner satisfaction. The answers technique represents the entirety of possible answers to a partner on both technical questions that are used in a negotiation and on short language, to the point, maximum 125 words per minute, needs to know the questions technique so as to know the replies, at the same time, to know how to make concessions to the extent we believe is needed to win a negotiation according to the opponent's or partners personality, who wish to buy or sell.

      "title": "Quality of Life in Patients with ICD: Is It Improved or Worsened?",
      "abstract": "'Quality of life' has different meanings and entails different components, depending on the perspective of the investigator and the intention of any analysis. Although there is no exact definition of quality of life, there is an emerging consensus that quality-of-life assessment can be based on physical condition, psychological wellbeing, social activity, and everyday activity. These categories can then be further subdivided into a number of aspects such as mobility, self- care, family contact, intimacy, or negativity in terms of depression or anxiety. The approach to quality of life, therefore, must be multidimensional and involve a variety of investigatory tools (Table 1). The usefulness of many trials dealing with quality of life is limited by their unidimensional approach focusing only on restricted issues, e.g., functional status, excluding mental or psychological aspects or psychological features, leaving aside functional capacity. Future investigations of quality of life, moreover, will have to address a variety of health-associated sectors, including costs, working capacity, and social care, in addition to physical and mental integrity, since invasive therapies cause manifold interactions between the individual and the environment and vice versa. Quality-of-life research should, therefore, use an analytic model and comprehensively include predictors and response variables in a given time-frame in which the impact of therapy on quality of life is elicited [1].",

Similarly, insofar as perceiving the good things in one's life as the result of die intentional benevolence of another person or persons makes those benefits even more enjoyable, it is easy to imagine how one might be happier and healthier as a result. Obviously, much of daily life occurs without conscious control and without a second thought. Nonetheless, some people may stop periodically to savor their lives, thereby (perhaps) extracting meaning and purpose from what they are doing or what is happening to them. This capacity for mindful attentiveness and the resulting ability to make positive meaning from goal pursuits, from the benefits we receive in life, and other life activities and events may be useful terrain to explore in future work not only on hope and gratitude, but also on other positive psychological traits and virtues as well.",

      "title": "A Picture of Performance Goals in the Social Plenum: The Interpersonal Antecedents and Consequences of Performance Goals",
      "abstract": "Although competence-relevant activities (e.g., solving an academic problem) are often embedded in interpersonal (e.g., classroom), hierarchical (e.g., teacher/pupils), and norm-/value-specific (e.g., culture) settings, the study of performance goals—the desire to demonstrate competence relative to others—has mostly been conducted at the intrapersonal level alone. Drawing on the transactional model of stress and coping, the circumplex model of interpersonal behaviors, as well as on the conflict elaboration theory, the first part of this thesis reveals the interpersonal consequences of performance goals on the regulation of a specific behavior, namely socio-cognitive conflict (i.e., a situation of confrontation with a disagreeing interactant): Performance-approach goals—the desire to outperform others—predicted a highly agentic (dominant) conflict regulation, that is, the validation of one’s point of view at the expense of that of the interactant (which we labeled competitive regulation); whereas performance-avoidance goals—the desire not to be outperformed by others—predicted a poorly agentic (submissive) conflict regulation, that is, the invalidation of one’s point of view to the benefit of that of the interactant (which we labeled protective regulation). Furthermore, both the aforementioned effects were found to increase when the interactant was presented as being superiorly (vs. equally) in competence. Drawing on the literature on group goal structure, as well as on research on socialization of supervisors-based values, the second part of this thesis reveals the interpersonal antecedents of performance-based goals endorsement, focusing—more specifically—on the role of group-supervisors in performance goals socialization: Supervisor’s performance-approach goals were positively associated with the emergence over time of subordinates’ performance-approach (especially when perceiving themselves as competent) and -avoidance goals (especially when perceiving themselves as incompetent). Furthermore, providing evidence that this phenomenon essentially reflects a socialization process, both the aforementioned effects were found to increase as subordinates’ in-group identification increased, and as supervisors’ adherence to dominant Western values (i.e., self-enhancement values) increased. Taken together, these results advocate the need to study performance goals in their social plenum, that is, adopting an interpersonal (i.e., studying the effects of goals between individuals), positional (i.e., between individuals from different social positions), and ideological (i.e., between individuals following specific norms and endorsing specific values) perspective.",

The study of support talk examines how interactants seek and obtain aid in a variety of informal and institutional settings. Support talk occurs when interactants attempt to aid, assist, or help another by addressing troubles that can be mutually shared and mutually solved. Support provided can be informational (e.g., advice), emotional (expressions of caring, concern, empathy, and sympathy), or tangible (offers of goods or services). One challenge in distinguishing support talk from other forms of talk in interaction is that routine talk, especially in close relationships, can also serve a supportive function (→ Intimate Talk with Family and Friends).",

      "title": "Relationship between Academic Support with Academic Burnout among High School Students with The Mediating Role of Quality of Life in School",
      "abstract": "Several key factors affect students’ academic performance. One such important factor is academic burnout which has recently attracted considerable research attention. Burnout is a syndrome of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal integrity which results from chronic stress, heavy responsibility, time limitation/shortage, and lack of necessary resources and support for performing tasks. It usually occurs in occupations offering human services. Burnout is nowadays considered in academic situations and contexts, leading to being named as ‘academic burnout’. In school context, academic burnout refers to a state of negative feelings, lack of interest in fulfilment of the expected tasks (depersonalization), feelings of exhaustion due to academic expectations and requirements (emotional exhaustion), and finally feelings of inefficiency (ineffectiveness). Burnout could lead to several negative psychological consequences among students including emotional disturbances, negative affects, anxiety, depression, and low self-control. Therefore, it is obvious that academic burnout could have many negative consequences in terms of mental, psychological, and physical well-being. It seems academic support is an important factor which could play a key role in preventing academic burnout among students. The provision of academic support, whether it be direct or indirect, can increase learners’ interest, which can, in turn, significantly improve achievement. Academic support can take a vriety of forms. This can be either emotional, instrumental, or cognitive support. It can also include a combination of all of these different support types. It seems that the level of improvement in echievement can be determined by the kind, level, and the type  of academic supports that are provided. Academic support could be provided from different sources, namely, parents, peers, and teachers, with each playing a distinctive role. These sources transmit values and expectations to students, offer them guidance, feedback, a secure atmosphere to fulfill them, and provide them with emotional support. In addition, the quality of life is a significant environmental factor, which can affect academic burnout. The quality of life at school has received much attention due to its importance in students’ lives. It is defined as students’ objective and subjective well-being as well as their general satisfaction in terms of positive and negative experience resulting from school activities. Forming students’ general perception of welfare, well-being, and their general satisfaction, these positive and negative experiences are the result of students’ involvement in school activities, the amount of happiness experiences, and positive and negative feeling, which show students’ satisfaction with their physical presence, emotional and social relationships, and daily school activities. Research indicates that receiving sufficient social support from family members and friends leads to higher satisfaction among students. Also, some studies have shown that social support could result in decreased emotional exhaustion by developing a desirable perception of the learning environment and academic quality of life. Moreover, appropriate academic support could predict higher social integrity, better academic quality of life, and decreased emotional exhaustion and disinterestedness. All in all, identifying predictive factors of academic burnout and determining their influence on learners’ academic performance are considered highly important for controlling academic burnout in educational psychology. The present study aimed to explore the relationship between academic support and academic burnout by considering the mediating role of quality of life in school among female students. Method: This study was descriptive with a correlational design. The statistical population was all female second-round high school students in 2016 in Qom, Iran. Based on Krejeci and Morgan’s Table, 357 students were selected via stratified random sampling. The data collection instruments included Maslach Burnout Inventory, Sands and Plunkett Academic Support scale, and Ainley and Bourke Quality of life in School Questionnaire. It is noteworthy that the reliability of all the instruments were calculated, and acceptable levels of Cronbach’s alpha were achieved and reported. The obtained data were analyzed using descriptive statistics as well as inferential statistics including Pearson Product Moment Correlation, Hierarchical Regression Analysis, and Sobel Z Test. Results: The correlation results indicated that there is a statistically significant negative relationship between academic support and quality of life in school, in one hand, and sub-scales of academic burnout including academic disinterest, emotional exhaustion, ineffectiveness, on the other hand; moreover, there was a statistically significant positive relationship between academic support and quality of life in school. As to Hierarchical Regression Analysis, the results showed academic support can predict academic burnout, and quality of life in school has a mediating role in the relationship between academic support and academic burnout. Discussion & Conclusion: The findings of the present study are in agreement with those of several other studies. This could be justified by considering the fact that any interpersonal relationship between the students and teachers which is indicative of a supportive relationship leads to academic interest among students. Additionally, the more logical expectations parents have from their children and the more academic support they provide, the less lack of interest the students will experience. Moreover, academic support could possibly help students to more successfully cope with their academic stress. Therefore, social support from parents, friends, and teachers prevents academic burnout and protects students against it. Student receiving enough academic support pay close attention to their abilities and competences and do not consider their incompetence and weaknesses as barriers to their success. Increased support from parents, peers, and teachers leads to increased hopefulness, self-efficacy, satisfaction with school, and in turn, increased academic adaptation. On the other hand, students’ quality of life at school is affected and shaped by many factors including family, friends, teachers, scientific and recreational facilities, freedom of speech, free time, values and cultural differences, parenting styles, fairness, self-control, and more importantly, their interactions. Based on the findings, it should be noted that the quality of life at school could predict students’ academic burnout and be affected by difficult and irrelevant tasks and activities, limited recreation, and lack of control and academic support. Consequently, this can lead to an increase in negative feelings and a decrease in abnormal behaviors, unusual absences, and mental and physical health. Accordingly, different forms of academic support like efficient teaching, fulfilling needs, and holding happy classes could lead to improvements in quality of life at school and generally decreases in students’ academic burnout. Overall, the findings imply that academic support has a preventive role in developing academic burnout; furthermore, careful planning and effective interventions should be performed to enhance students’ quality of life and their academic guidance.",

Shyness as a personality trait may be defined experientially as excessive self‐focus characterized by negative self‐evaluation that creates discomfort or inhibition in social situations and interferes with pursuing one's interpersonal or professional goals. The experience of shyness can occur at any or all of the following levels: cognitive (e.g., excessive negative self‐evaluation), affective (e.g., heightened negative emotion), physiological (e.g., racing heart), and behavioral (e.g., failure to respond appropriately). It may be triggered by a wide variety of situational cues. Among the most typical situations are interactions with authorities and strangers, one‐on‐one opposite‐sex interactions, and unstructured social settings.",

However, sometimes what your managers, other colleagues, and from time to time clients, expect of you isn’t in line with either your own values, or on occasion the law. In some of these cases your boss, your co-workers, or your customers might want you to behave in ways that conflict with your values, your natural, innate sense of the difference between right and wrong, or your sense of what is the best course of action for your team or organization. Responding to these situations means building influence with difficult and often more senior colleagues in situations where you need to protect your core values, and where you are being pressurized into taking actions with which you fundamentally disagree.

It is important to plan your performances, and most of you will do this, even if just in a general way, such as what to do before your performance and what to do during your performance. However, the plan for the period after the performance, called postperformance, is just as important as the other two plans. At the conclusion of your performance, you will need to devise and utilize some way to relieve the excess emotion caused by performing. The postperformance evaluation phase is critical and should be ongoing. Psychological research (Maslach, 1982; Morgan, 1984) says that performers give themselves a better chance of repeating a good performance or enhancing a poor performance when they are able to evaluate it in an objective manner. After every performance, take time to reflect upon what happened before and during the performance. This is just as important for successful as for unsuccessful performances. A performance is usually unsuccessful in the head before the body fails.",

Therefore, it is necessary to treat speech with great responsibility and create situations that provide a lively, lively conversation, which will ensure activity and interest. In order to control the behavior of others through speech, the speaker must first organize his own speech. Firstof all, it implies providing a logical development of what is being said. You need to start with something, communicate something (tell, justify, instruct, refute) and end with something. People working together is impossible without verbal communication. In order to agree on their actions, to perform the functions of the organization, to give any assignment, to report on the completed assignment, to solve various other problems, people always need to say and listen to each other. This is even more true for the leader. No matter how much the technical means of activity and communication develop and become complicated, in the end people manage, they manage people. Nothing can replace living human speech, the stimulating role of that speech in the regulation of a person's behavior, provided, of course, that the speech is used properly.",

      "title": "Avoiding Cognitive Biases in Managing Wicked Problem (Presentation Slides)",
      "abstract": "Technical issues simply require an answer, direction, or application of resources to solve a problem, which many leaders do in expediency to address conflict given the constant demands and issues they confront daily. On the other hand, wicked problems or adaptive challenges are typically grounded in the complexity of the values, beliefs, and loyalties rather than technical complexity and stir up intense emotions rather than dispassionate analysis (Heifetz, Grashow, & Linsky, 2009). Wicked problems in organizations that confront managers are unstructured, and not only is it difficult to predict the outcomes of possible solutions with precision, but the ideal set of alternatives that should be considered prior to making a strategic choice is also often unclear. Addressing adaptive challenges requires a deeper understanding of people’s behaviors, motivations, loyalties, as well as organizational norms, attitudes, and processes to enact real and sustained change. This type of leadership and decision making cannot easily rely on past methods or actions. Instead, the leader must embrace the learning and risks that come with implementing tough changes that ultimately support the values and purposes of the individual and/or collective. Managers do not make flawed decisions simply because they lack intelligence, expertise, or the correct motivations/incentives. Most often than not technical solutions are used in decision-making for adaptive challenges (Kahneman, Lovallo, & Sibony, 2011). In cases where wicked problems are recognized and also acknowledged that technical solutions will only address the symptoms, managers still make poor choices because they encounter systematic traps that impair their judgment. These cognitive biases are rooted in nature and are artifacts of wicked problems and adaptive challenges. Managers find themselves vulnerable to these biases no matter how capable and intelligent they are. It is important to understand that everyone is vulnerable to cognitive biases. Intelligence, experience, and/or expertise in a particular field does not shield people from these decision traps. They are rooted in human nature. What techniques can we use to combat cognitive biases in addressing adaptive challenges? Ability to diagnose and recognize a wicked problem or adaptive challenge from a tame problem or a technical challenge is the critical first step, but recognizing an adaptive challenge alone will not prevent flawed choices because of cognitive biases (Yawson, 2015). Key cognitive biases include the confirmation bias, the sunk cost trap, the anchoring bias, and the framing bias. How can organizational leaders avoid these decision traps in addressing wicked problems? How can decision making on complex systems - the so called wicked problems or adaptive challenges - come to grips with irreducible, or deep, uncertainty without cognitive biases? This paper discusses, complex adaptive decision making in the context of four main cognitive biases: Confirmation Bias, Sunk Cost Trap, Anchoring Bias, and Framing Bias.",

      "title": "Exploring the Importance of Mentoring for New Scholars: A Social Exchange Perspective.",
      "abstract": "1. INTRODUCTION Mentoring can take many forms. In some cases, a senior member of the organization is assigned to show the ropes to a new employee or junior faculty member; in other settings, it can be a senior faculty member that a younger, junior faculty member is comfortable with when needing advice on decisions or problems they are faced with; or it can take the form of a conversation (or series of conversations) that took place early in an individual's career. In each instance, the mentor provides advice, direction, and serves as a role model for the younger individual. These relationships can be ongoing, irregular, or of very short duration; however, these interactions have a profound impact on the future direction and decisions of the younger individual. Many times these interactions provide a roadmap for the success or failure of the younger individual. In an academic setting, mentoring requires that a senior faculty member be willing to take the time to listen and provide direction to students and/or junior faculty members. Mentoring can be a rewarding, sometimes frustrating, and time consuming process; but it is a role that should be embraced by senior faculty. It is posited that through the mentoring process senior faculty members can make their most significant contribution to future generations. There are many instances where an individual's greatest legacy is not the number of publications that he or she achieved, but their influence on the future generations through listening, providing advice, serving as a role model, and helping students or junior faculty understand what it takes to be successful. Over the past decade, there has been considerable discussion that the Information Systems (IS) academic community is facing an identity crisis. Benbasat and Zmud (2003), Agarwal and Lucas (2003), Wu and Saunders (2003), Alter (2003) and Robey (2003) have provided opinions as to whether this identity crisis actually exists, and recommendations on how the crisis can be overcome. The common theme from these discussions seems to be that faculty within the IS field must undertake research that reverberates across the business community and society in general (Agarwal and Lucas, 2003). Without this type of research, the IS discipline will not be able to achieve legitimacy within the academic community or with other important external stakeholders. Identifying and completing this type of research is difficult, especially for junior faculty members. Junior faculty members are pressured by the tenure and promotion decision that typically occurs during their sixth year of employment. These junior faculties must perform well to succeed in the academic profession. We believe the productivity of these junior faculty members typically is highly affected by their academic training and by the relationship they have developed with a senior faculty member (a mentor). A mentor who has been successful in academia and who has published can generally provide direction on topic selection, method of study, possible outlets for manuscripts, and help with the review process. This type of relationship with a mentor helps the junior faculty member produce research that has the necessary rigor and relevance to be publishable in the top-tier journals of the IS discipline. Studies have examined many factors that contribute to the success of junior faculty members and have attributed their success, failure, and productivity to a complex combination of individual, institutional, and social factors (Blackburn, Chapman, and Cameron, 1981; Bowen and Rudenstien, 1992; Cook and Swanson, 1978; de Velero 2001; Golde and Dore, 2001; Hunter and Kuh, 1987). One factor that has been overlooked, particularly in the study of business schools, is the role that mentoring can have in the productivity of the junior faculty member. The few studies that have addressed this issue have reported mixed results (Blackburn et al. …",

Alternatively, learning can progress normally—exhibiting the same properties as learning does when it supports adaptive behaviour—but instead it results in the acquisition of behaviour that is maladaptive. ‘When learning goes wrong’ first highlights two instances of maladaptive behaviour—the psychological side effects of cancer treatment and the acquisition of substance addictions—and then considers how learning can be disrupted in the case of schizophrenia, and how this may contribute to learning about inappropriate things.",

      "abstract": "The Palgrave Handbook of Educational Leadership and Management Discourse is designed to add a new dimension to the discourse in the field. Most handbooks are topical presentations and/or discussions of contemporary issues or problems. There is usually no deep probing or revealing interrogations of the foundations and assumptions upon which the topical presentations are made. There is rarely any tracing of where the ideas, concepts, or metaphors in use in topical discourse originated. For a field such as educational leadership and management, which is an applied body of practice, not knowing where ideas, concepts, or metaphors of practice originated leads to unintended consequences in an application, erroneous interpretations of alleged success or failure, or a dismal repetition of undiagnosed errors. One outcome is the complete lack of reflexivity in leadership practice. Reflexivity is different than reflection. Reflection of practice refers to asking such questions as, \"Did we reach our goals, and if not, why not?\" or \"How could my leadership practice be improved?\" Reflexivity asks instead, \"How am I thinking about how I am thinking about leadership?\"",

The questions pertain to various key topics about self-processes, such as self-awareness, self-knowledge, self-regulation, self-talk, self-esteem, and self-regulation. The students’ weekly questions and their answers highlight what is currently know about the self. Answers to the student questions also allow for the identification of some recurrent lessons about the self. Some of these lessons include: all self-processes are interconnected (e.g., prospection depends on autobiography), self-terms must be properly defined (e.g., self-rumination and worry are not the same), inner speech plays an important role in self-processes, controversies are numerous (are animals self-aware?), measurement issues abound (e.g., self-reflection as an operationalization of self-awareness), deficits in some self-processes can have devastating effects (e.g., self-regulatory deficits may lead to financial problems), and there are lots of unknowns about the self (e.g., gender differences in Theory-of-Mind).",

De hecho existen algunos factores limitantes del trabajo en equipo, o piedras en las que es frecuente tropezar, que pueden condicionar el desarrollo de los proyectos si no se previenen o se identifican a tiempo, y esto es aplicable para cualquier materia que utilice la metodologia ABP. En este trabajo presentamos cual ha sido nuestro enfoque durante dos cursos academicos consecutivos a la hora de prever y supervisar cuales podian ser esos factores que limitarian, cuando no estaban ya limitando, el correcto de-sarrollo de los proyectos en sus distintas fases. Como veremos, proponemos una serie de medidas destinadas a comunicar a los alumnos con anticipacion cuales son las posibles limitaciones con las que se podran encontrar durante el proceso de ABP. Ademas hemos hecho uso de diversas herramientas orientadas a la identificacion justo a tiempo de posibles conflictos o desajustes del trabajo en equipo. Nuestros resultados muestran la importancia de tomar esta serie de medidas concretas con el fin de desarrollar el proceso de aprendizaje satisfactoriamente.",

      "title": "Learning",
      "abstract": "In spite of its critical importance within education, the problem of explaining how learning takes place, and analysing the factors that influence it, remains a somewhat confused area. Teachers, and educators generally, often blame psychologists for this, and claim that they either present them with several conflicting explanations of learning, each one based upon a different psychological theory, or a single coherent explanation with which it is admitted other psychologists would probably not agree. Yet perhaps this blame, though understandable, is a little unfair. The problem is that learning is such a highly complex activity. We each of us receive a constant and varied stream of experiences throughout our waking moments, each one of which potentially can give rise to learning, yet most of which vanish without trace from our conscious lives. What is it that makes some things memorable and others not? Why is it that a particular event can prompt learning in one person yet have no measurable effect upon someone else? Why does an individual learn readily from one teacher but not from another? How is it that we are able to make sense of our experience, and put the knowledge to good effect when it comes to tackling new situations and problems? Questions such as these and many others make the psychologist's task of understanding and explaining learning, and above all, of advising on how learning can be made more efficient and more permanent for all types and conditions of learner, an almost herculean one. Perhaps the wonder is not that psychologists have so far failed to come up with all the answers during the 50 years and more in which a systematic study of learning has been made, but that they have come up with as many as they have.",

      "abstract": "textabstractDo students who are motivated behave differently in terms of their learning in the classroom and perform better than students who are less or not motivated? Understanding if and how motivational beliefs (e.g. self-efficacy judgments or task-value beliefs) are related to academic achievement measures (e.g. course grades or achievement-related behaviours) has significant implications for education. That is, if it is true that motivation is positively (and causally) related to achievement, it would suggest that when students are motivated they would perform better in school than students that are less motivated to study. However, an answer to the question of how motivation relates to achievement is more difficult to give than is commonly assumed. From a layman‟s perspective it is obvious that being motivated to achieve is a driving force to actually engage in learning-oriented behaviours, and that such behaviours should lead to a high level of achievement. However, as will be discussed below, this relationship is more complex than a layperson might expect. Testing the commonly accepted hypothesis of the motivation-achievement relationship is the major objective of this thesis. This chapter provides an overview of the educational context the studies were conducted in, how motivation is defined, and how motivation theories developed, followed by how motivation is measured. Subsequently, it will be highlighted why the relationship between motivation and achievement can be considered a complex one. Finally, an overview of the chapters will be given.",

      "title": "Prolegomena for Considerations on Western Sport and Spiritualism",
      "abstract": "Prolegomena for Considerations on Western Sport and Spiritualism Sport activity of achievement-oriented (professional, Olympic, spectacular character) is first of all exposition of rivalry and striving for variously understood sports success (resulting from measurable or discretionary criteria). It refers to winning a competition or taking another expected place as well as to other forms of satisfaction, such as financial gratification or social (political, ethnic, professional) recognition. Spirituality is here neither an aim, nor an expected value — it constitutes rather an additional or redundant quality. A competitor focuses his/her attention first of all on the main aim assumed in planned or current rivalry. Emotional sensations which are experienced by athletes before, during or after competitions testify to mental and emotional stress which accompanies sports combat. It is also difficult to associate spirituality or spiritualism with sport for all — like, for example, that of health-oriented character — sport of the disabled, physical education, sport of playful character or physical recreation. That difficulty results from the fact that neither spiritualism, nor spirituality inspires for physical activity in the abovementioned fields; neither spiritualism, nor spirituality is the outcome of activity in the realm of sport for all. Exceptions are constituted by ancient Olympic Games as well as by some experiences connected with recreational forms of tourism mediated through achievement-oriented sport (also by pre-Columbian Native American societies and Maoris aboriginal population of New Zealand). For example Hellenic Olympic Games were a highly spiritualized form of sports rivalry — including also rivalry in the field of art, and especially in the field of theatre. They were one of numerous forms of religious cult — of worshipping chosen gods from the Olympic pantheon. On the other hand, during mountain hiking and mountain climbing there can appear manifestations of deepened spirituality characteristic for the object of spiritualization of non-religious, quasi-religious or strictly religious qualities. I would like to explain — at the end of this short abstract - that spiritualism (which should not be confused with spiritism) is — generally speaking — first of all a philosophical term assuming, in ontological and axiological sense, that spiritual reality, self-knowledge, consciousness or mental experiences are components of the human being — components of a higher order having priority over matter. They constitute, in the anthropological context, beings of a higher order than the body. Spiritualism according to its popular interpretation means spirituality. Qualities which are ascribed to that notion in particular societies can be determined on the basis of empirically oriented sociological research. They make it possible to determine various ways of interpreting and understanding that notion as well as views or attitudes connected with it.",

      "title": "A Model for Managing Anger and Conflict.",
      "abstract": "Anger is probably the most misunderstood and least expressed feeling. To understand anger, it is necessary to explore the process. Anger usually follows an experience of frustration, unmet expectations, loss of self-respect, and fear. The next stage seems to be anxiety, which may be interpreted as a disappointment, discomfort, or powerlessness. This anxiety is then immediately changed, usually without recognition, into feelings or actions of power and fight. Finally, relief is felt only after release of the negative energy in the body. The constructive way to deal with anger is to confront the situation. Guidelines for fighting fair include the following: (1) establishing the legitimacy of fighting; (2) dealing with one issue at a time; (3) choosing the arena carefully; (4) avoiding reaction to unintentional remarks; (5) avoiding resolutions that come too soon or too easily; (6) avoiding name calling; (7) avoiding cornering an opponent; (8) agreeing to disagree; (9) focusing on what is wanted rather than why it is wanted; and (10) maintaining a sense of humor. If fair or creative fighting is attempted, then three positive outcomes may result: an effective resolution may be found; everyone involved may maintain a clear sense of personal dignity throughout the conflict; or the relationship may be in no way damaged and may even be enhanced.

      "title": "Optimal Sequencing in Single-Player Games",
      "abstract": "An important problem in single-player video game design is how to sequence game elements within a level (or “chunk”) of the game. Each element has two critical features: a reward (e.g., earning an item or being able to watch a cinematic) and a degree of difficulty (e.g., how much energy or focus is needed to interact with the game element). The latter property is a distinctive feature in video games. Unlike passive services (like a trip to the spa) or passive entertainment (like watching sports or movies), video games often require concerted effort to consume. We study how to sequence game elements to maximize overall experienced utility subject to the dynamics of adaptation to rewards and difficulty and memory decay. We find that the optimal design depends on the relationship between rewards and difficulty, leading to qualitatively different designs. For example, when the proportion of reward-to-difficulty is high, the optimal design mimics that of more passive experiences. By contrast, the optimal design of games with low reward-to-difficulty ratios resembles work-out routines with “warm-ups” and “cool-downs.” Intermediate cases may follow the classical “mini-boss, end-boss” design where difficulty has two peaks. Numerical results reveal optimal designs with “waves” of reward and difficulty with multiple peaks. Level designs with multiple peaks of difficulty are ubiquitous in video games. In summary, this paper provides practical guidance to game designers on how to match the design of single-player games to the relationship between reward and difficulty inherent in their game’s mechanics. Our model also has implications for other interactive services that share similarities with games, such as summer camps for children. This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.

      "abstract": "Metamemory is defined as cognitions about memory and related processes. Related terms in the literature include metacognition, self-evaluation, memory self-efficacy, executive function, self-regulation, cognitive control, and strategic behavior. Metamemory is a multidimensional construct that includes knowledge about how memory works, beliefs about memory (including beliefs about one’s own memory such as memory self-efficacy), monitoring of memory and related processes and products, and metacognitive control, in which adaptive changes in processing approaches and strategies may be contemplated if monitoring of memory processes (encoding, retention, retrieval) indicates that alternative strategies may be required. Older adults generally believe that their memory has declined and that, on average, they have less control over memory and lower memory self-efficacy than young and middle-aged adults. Many but not all aspects of online memory monitoring are well preserved in old age, such as the ability to discriminate between information that has been learned versus not learned. A major exception concerns confidence judgments concerning whether recognition memory decisions are correct; older adults are more prone to high-confidence memory errors, believing they are recognizing something they have not encountered previously. The evidence regarding metacognitive control is more mixed, with some hints that older adults do not use monitoring to adjust control behaviors (e.g., devoting more time and effort to studying items they believe have not yet been well-learned). However, any age deficits in self-regulation based on memory monitoring or adaptive strategy use can probably be addressed through instructions, practice, or training. In general, older adults seem capable of exerting metacognitive control in memory studies, although they may not necessarily do so without explicit support or prompting.",

      "title": "Knowledge-Enhanced Multi-Behaviour Contrastive Learning for Effective Recommendation",
      "abstract": "Real-world recommendation scenarios usually need to handle diverse user-item interaction behaviours, including page views, adding items into carts, and purchasing activities. The interactions that precede the actual target behaviour (e.g., purchasing an item) allow to capture the user's preferences from different angles, and are used as auxiliary information (e.g., page views) to enrich the system's knowledge about the users' preferences, thereby helping to enhance recommendation for the target behaviour. Despite efforts in modelling the users' multi-behaviour interaction information, the existing multi-behaviour recommenders still face two challenges: (1) Data sparsity across multiple user behaviours is a common issue that limits the recommendation performance, particularly for the target behaviour, which typically exhibits fewer interactions compared to other auxiliary behaviours; (2) Noisy auxiliary interactive behaviours where the information in the auxiliary behaviours might be non-relevant for recommendation. In this case, a direct adoption of contrastive learning between the target behaviour and the auxiliary behaviours will amplify the noise in the auxiliary behaviours, thereby negatively impacting the real semantics that can be derived from the target behaviour. To address these two challenges, we propose a new model called Knowledge-Enhanced Multi-behaviour Contrastive Learning for Recommendation (KEMCL). In particular, to address the problem of sparse user multi-behaviour interaction information, we leverage a dual-perspective knowledge encoding componentthat enriches the semantic representations of items, and generate supervision signals through self-supervised learning so as to enhance recommendation. In addition, we develop a cross-behaviour learning component, which includes two contrastive learning (CL) methods, inter CL and intra CL, to alleviate the problem of noisy auxiliary interactions. Extensive experiments on three public recommendation datasets show that our proposed KEMCL model significantly outperforms seven existing state-of-the-art methods. In particular, our KEMCL model outperforms the best baseline, namely KMCLR, by 5.42% on the large Tmall dataset.",

      "abstract": "Past behavior guides future responses through 2 processes. Well-practiced behaviors in constant contexts recur because the processing that initiates and controls their performance becomes automatic. Frequency of past behavior then reflects habit strength and has a direct effect on future performance. Alternately, when behaviors are not well learned or when they are performed in unstable or difficult contexts, conscious decision making is likely to be necessary to initiate and carry out the behavior. Under these conditions, past behavior (along with attitudes and subjective norms) may contribute to intentions, and behavior is guided by intentions. These relations between past behavior and future behavior are substantiated in a meta-analytic synthesis of prior research on behavior prediction and in a primary research investigation. In everyday explanations of behavior, habits denote one's customary ways of behaving. Claiming that one performed a behavior because of habit provides an understandable explanation for an act that otherwise might seem irrational or even harmful. Habits also are featured in the popular psychology literature in the form of self-help books designed to identify readers' existing habits, evaluate habits' effectiveness in meeting goals, and establish more desirable habits. Habits are not, however, important constructs in most contemporary social psychological models of human behavior. Early in their careers, most psychology graduate students learn that frequency of past behavior, a standard indicator of habit strength (Triandis, 1977, 1980), is the best predictor of",

Similarly, teaching and learning approaches have shifted away from didactic to a more discursive methods such as brainstorming, team-based learning and case-based learning. These methods emphasize active participation and communication with team members, but having more discussion does not indicate that deep learning has taken place. Majority of these approaches require students to complete a task within an allocated time frame. Therefore, most of the time is utilized to complete a task instead of learning how to acquire a skill or learning how to learn. Important \"silent\" skills such as observation, reasoning process, and listening skills, are given less time or almost none due to time constraint within these discursive approaches, although these skills are extremely important as a doctor. Hence, it is time to think about on how best to balance the use of silence and externalize thought processes in medical education.",

The result of this service is that in the initial session the participants were given an understanding of what mental health is and the importance of mental health for a mother. Mental disorders do not mean crazy, but mental disorders that are not treated immediately can tend to result in mental disorders (insanity). Indications of mental disorders in them include excessive anxiety, stress, lack of self-confidence and depression. The factors that cause a mother to experience these mental disorders are lack of interaction, having excessive expectations about something, no one to support her, work demands, an uncomfortable environment, poor stress management, and not having time for herself. A mother who experiences mental disorders certainly has an impact on the family. So the important things to pay attention to so that mental disorders don't get worse are staying away from toxic environments, taking time for yourself, asking for support from your family, especially your husband, consuming healthy and halal food, and if necessary, consulting a psychologist and developing self-management skills.

These situations suggest that suasory influence is more appropriate under circumstances in which the interests of rational choice can be furthered. Suasory intervention, however, could well worsen an already undesirable situation. Efforts to reorient group members toward a decisional act may he so subtle as to go unnoticed, so weakly stated as to go unheeded, or so direct as to arouse animosity toward the initiator. A potentially fruitful area for future research, therefore, is the examination cf the relative effectiveness of alternative modes of suasory influence. (HOD)",

      "abstract": "Limited deliberative attention as a problem for the theory of practical reasoning HE SORTS OF PRACTICAL QUESTIONS that agents seek to answer by deliberating are markedly diverse.An agent might deliberate in order to discover the best means to some already given, welldefined end.An agent might deliberate in order to \"specify\" a general or vague end -asking herself, for instance, \"what would be the morally decent thing to do right now?\" Or an agent might deliberate in order to answer questions as open-ended as \"what shall I do today?\"or \"what shall I do with my life?\"As different as these instrumental, specificatory and more openended practical questions are from one another, our deliberative attempts to answer them share a common feature -a feature which is so familiar and so evident to reflection that it is easy to fail to be puzzled by it.In each sort of case, the domain of potential answers to her question that an agent will typically entertain in deliberation is extremely limited.Indeed, if the \"courses of action\" between which a deliberating agent chooses are individuated so as to include complex, temporally extended plans, then, in most cases, there will be indefinitely many courses of action that a finite deliberating agent, with finite cognitive capacities, will never consider -potential answers to her question on which her deliberative attention will simply never alight.This fact raises a fundamental question for the theory of practical reasoning: what determines which options an agent will and will not consider in deliberation?Common sense suggests that the deliberation of an agent who was simply arbitrary in which possible answers to her practical question she ignored and which she considered would not count as reasonable.So, in order to make a place in the theory of practical reasoning for the fact of our limited deliberative attention, we need an account that at once explains the patterns of deliberative attention that reasonable agents typically display, and allows us to see why these patterns of deliberative attention are, in fact, reasonable.",

      "abstract": "Comunicarse de manera eficaz, es decir, con seguridad, templanza, competencia y reciprocidad, es fundamental en cualquier aspecto de la vida, y muy especialmente en el trabajo, dónde es imprescindible cooperar y colaborar con los demás para satisfacer las propias necesidades y responder a las demandas planteadas. Comunicarse con eficacia o de manera asertiva es una clase de conducta susceptible de entrenamiento mediante procedimientos fundamentados en la Teoría del Aprendizaje Social. Como cualquier clase de conducta, consta de distintos componentes: cognitivos, emocionales y de comportamiento manifiesto (tanto verbal como no verbal), que deben ajustarse a una situación concreta para lograr su funcionalidad. Ello aumenta, a su vez, la probabilidad de alcanzar los objetivos planteados y de responder con certeza a las demandas propuestas, obteniéndose así una serie de ventajas, tanto personales como grupales y organizativas. Entre ellas, se puede destacar el alcanzar una mayor competencia social, autoestima, satisfacción personal, cohesión grupal, destreza para trabajar en equipo y una disminución de las tensiones y conflictos interpersonales y grupales. La obra que te dispones a ver, partiendo de un supuesto práctico como es la participación en una entrevista de selección de personal, pretende responder de una manera aplicada a las siguientes cuestiones: Qué son las habilidades sociales, para qué sirven, cómo se adquieren, qué clase o estilo de comunicación es más eficaz, qué técnicas son más ventajosas para su enseñanza y cómo puede beneficiar su aprendizaje. Esta obra es fruto de una larga experiencia en el desarrollo de programas de entrenamiento en habilidades sociales con y para distintos colectivos que deben afrontar situaciones difíciles y conflictivas, que requieren para su resolución el apoyo y la comunicación interpersonal y social. En su realización, no solo hemos puesto nuestro conocimiento del tema, difundido a través de monografías y artículos científico-técnicos, sino también la emoción que nos genera trabajar en un tema en el que creemos y sabemos puede ser útil para otras personas. Deseamos que disfrute utilizando esta humilde aportación al entrenamiento en habilidades sociales, tanto como nosotros realizándola.",

These narratives occasionally rest heavy on a researcher’s conscience or may linger in the mind.

We therefore document the following: (1) Our experiences of the issues presented by undertaking qualitative research involving challenging, difficult, or sensitive topics; and (2) Practical principles devised to overcome these issues, ensuring safety and wellbeing amongst researchers engaging in these types of qualitative research. We provide guidance for qualitative researchers of all levels of experience and expertise on how best to protect and support themselves, their colleagues, and other collaborating research staff, when undertaking qualitative research which might otherwise feel uncomfortable or overwhelming to tackle.",

El objetivo de este estudio fue analizar la relación y el carácter predictivo del funcionamiento ejecutivo en la atención plena (mindfulness) disposicional en una muestra compuesta de jugadores y no jugadores de LoL. Los resultados reflejan que los jugadores presentan una menor capacidad para focalizar actividades del momento presente en su vida diaria, una mayor ausencia de juicio y una menor predisposición que los no jugadores a proceder con atención plena. En este grupo se aprecia una tendencia mayor a presentar problemas relacionados con el control emocional, el control ejecutivo y el posible desarrollo de síntomas prefrontales. Se concluye que LoL es un videojuego que requiere de la utilización de muchas capacidades cognitivas, entre ellas la alta demanda sobre las funciones ejecutivas del usuario, factor que parece interferir con la capacidad de atención plena más allá de la pantalla. Esto indica una posible vulnerabilidad en los jugadores a presentar con mayor probabilidad síntomas prefrontales.",

Although numerous target behaviors may warrant functional assessment and subsequent reduction at the individual level (e.g., aggression, self-injurious behavior), this chapter focuses on describing the implementation of and research outcomes related to reductive interventions designed to help teachers decrease disruptive, inappropriate, off-task, or problem behavior in general education classrooms. Reductive interventions describe strategies that explicitly target reduced levels of a target behavior. These interventions may be implemented to address chronic problem behaviors that may have been unresponsive to other positive interventions. The chapter describes various reductive strategies that may be implemented at a Tier I level, such as time-out, think time, and structured recess.",

La Entrevista Motivacional brinda la posibilidad de obtener mejores resultados en la aproximacion al individuo que requiere atencion, ya que provoca modificaciones en el estadio del Proceso de Cambio. El manejo convencional de un paciente ingresado a un programa de tratamiento incluye procedimientos como la informacion verbal o escrita, educacion, entrevistas informativas o confrontacionales, metodos que no se acercan a los resultados obtenidos con la Entrevista Motivacional.

      "title": "Should we be aiming to engage drivers more with others on-road? Driving moral disengagement and self-reported driving aggression",
      "abstract": "Aggressive driving behaviours may be associated with greater crash risk in situations where drivers engage in riskier types of behaviours such as following too closely. It also appears that many drivers who do not normally regard themselves as angry or aggressive report engaging in aggressive driving acts. Qualitative studies have suggested that drivers explain these behaviours with reference to justified retaliation or beliefs that such acts ‘teach’ other drivers a ‘lesson’ or to exercise better driving manners or etiquette. Drivers may also argue that their behaviour does not have a negative impact on others. Such descriptions of motives bear a strong resemblance to the psychological mechanisms of moral disengagement. Moral disengagement is where individuals detach themselves from their usual self-regulatory processes or morality in order to behave in ways that run counter to their normal moral standards. Moral disengagement offers a potential explanation of how apparently ‘good’ or moral people commit ‘bad’ or immoral behaviours. Categories of moral disengagement are: cognitively misinterpreting the behaviour (e.g euphemistic labelling); disconnecting with the target (e.g. attributing blame to the target); and distorting or denying the impact of the behaviour. An on-line survey with a convenience sample of general drivers (N = 294) was used to explore the potential utility of moral disengagement in explaining self-reported driving aggression over and above the explanatory power provided by constructs that are normally associated with self-reported on-road aggression. Hierarchical regression analysis was used with measures of trait anger, driving anger (DAS), moral disengagement, and driving moral disengagement (an adaptation of the measure of moral disengagement for the driving context). Results revealed that the independent variables together explained 37% of the variation in self-reported driving aggression (as measured by the Driving Anger Expression scale, DAX). Driving moral disengagement was a significant predictor of driving aggression (p < .001) after accounting for the contribution of age, gender, driving anger, and moral disengagement. Moreover, inspection of the beta weights suggested that driving moral disengagement (beta = .57) was the strongest predictor for this sample, accounting for 20% of the unique variance in driving aggression (sr2 = .20). The pattern of results suggests drivers with higher tendencies to morally disengage in the driving context may respond to others more aggressively on-road. Moreover, driving moral disengagement appeared to add to our understanding of why some angry drivers do not respond aggressively on-road while others do. Seeking to prevent drivers from activating moral disengagement while driving may be worthy of exploration as a way of reducing non-violent, yet potentially still risky, forms of driving aggression.",

This paper outlines a possible model of such a process, in terms of two known principles of motivation: first, that willingness to undertake action is a function of some difference or ratio between expected result and the effort, whether physical or mental, required to attain it; and second that what is achieved is valued more highly if the effort required has been relatively great. These principles seem capable of tying together many seemingly disparate facts about age changes in learning and in adaptation to developments at work, and also in everyday interests and pursuits and in the acceptance of rehabilitative procedures. They also have implications for human relationships in old age. These are discussed with reference to loneliness, which is regarded as arising when personality characteristics make communications from and to other people unrewarding.",

But they are also examples of memory because new information is being retained from one occasion to the next. Nevertheless, in psychology learning and memory define separate bodies of research. Research on learning has traditionally dealt with how information about relationships between events is acquired, as measured by fairly long-lasting changes in behavior. Research on memory, in contrast, deals with how information is stored, retained and retrieved. The cognitive changes of interest often take place rapidly, may not be very long lasting, and may be read out in a variety of behaviors. But parts of this description apply to examples of ‘‘learning.’’ For instance, flavor aversions can form in one trial, and Pavlovian conditioning may influence a whole behavior system (Chapter 4).",

Over the course of a career, concern for grade point fades and performance in the practice setting takes center stage.

O objetivo principal do gago deve ser realizar uma comunicação produtiva por meio de um processo terapêutico que o leve a construir um modelo de comunicação no qual a informação se sobreponha a quaisquer outros comportamentos (evitação, fuga e ansiedade).",

But our personal theory of teaching and learning, if we have the time to think critically, may be a grab bag of half-examined notions: that the really important learning comes from schools and colleges (not the family and work place), that learning occurs best in organized classes run by professionals (not in jobs, social life, and play), and that it is cognitive work (where emotions are viewed with suspicion). Perhaps we assume that education should not be directed by the learners who are naive and irresponsible if left too long on their own.",

      "abstract": "For the small business advisor, consulting and counseling are part of the same continuum. Advisors' roles can be aligned hierarchically: (1) advisors may need simply to provide business information or expertise; (2) they may need to facilitate the business process, helping clients identify problems and discover their own solutions; (3) for clients holding false premises, advisors may need to engage in developmental counseling to develop business concepts or identify direction and make decisions; (4) they may need to redirect clients' energies, either because their Lspirations do not match their capabilities or because they are unable to consider the situation fully; or (5) advisors may need to intervene in crisis situations. All counseling theories involve the client in learning with the intent to change behavior. They provide.a basis for approaching these diverse situations. The Rogerian approach, involving empathy but no attempt to change people, is best for simple consulting or facilitation. An Adlerian approach, which does not oppose advice-giving, seems best for clients needing developmental counseling. The approaches of Ellis and Thorne, respectively, are most appropriate when clients need to be told their aspirations are illogical or irrational, or when crisis intervention is necessary.",

      "title": "Cognitive stimulation, training, and rehabilitation",
      "abstract": "Cognition-focused interventions for people with cognitive impairment including mild-to-moderate dementia may be classified into three categories: cognitive stimulation, training, and rehabilitation. Cognitive stimulation, consisting of nonspecific cognition-enhancing activities often in group format, produces small improvements on some aspects of cognitive ability which can be accompanied by gains in quality of life, everyday functioning, and social interaction. Cognitive training which involves repeated practice of tasks that target specific cognitive functions, often using computers, provides improvements on trained tasks that usually do not translate to nontrained tasks and have little impact on real life. Cognitive rehabilitation represents an individual approach that focuses on disability rather than cognition per se and is helpful in terms of reaching personally relevant goals and improving day-to-day performance. Data are largely lacking to support commercial claims regarding the efficacy of video games or virtual reality and augmented reality devices. There is insufficient evidence from randomized controlled trials whether cognition-focused interventions can delay or prevent cognitive decline. However, data from prospective cohort studies strongly suggest that late-life cognitive activity is associated with a reduced risk of dementia.",

      "abstract": "In this tutorial review, we discussed on the neural substrate of utility and the reason why decision-making often deviates from rationality, failing to serve people’s best long-term interests. It was pointed out that there are two valuation systems in the brain, one cognitive and the other affective. These two valuation systems perform automatic computations of values based on knowledge (cognitive valuation) and past history of learning (i.e., instrumental conditioning) and evolution (affective valuation). In the instrumental conditioning a signal such as money comes to be associated with primary reinforcer like food and thus acquires reinforcing power. Utility in economics can be equated with expectation of this secondary reinforcer, especially monetary reward. Final decision is made under the control of supervisory control system in the prefrontal cortex. The decision may wander from rationality when affective valuation system demands its request too pressingly to resist or the supervisor controller is not efficient enough to handle the situation due to temporally distracted by other tasks or for some other reasons like age (being too young or too old to be equipped with an efficient supervisory controller) and individual difference in impulsivity.",

International cooperation has led to increasingly large-scale exercises, often involving hundreds or even thousands of participants in many locations. The difference between ‘large’ and ‘small’ exercises is more than one of size: (a) Large exercises are more ‘experiential’ and more likely to undermine any model of reality that single organizations may create; (b) they create a ‘play space’ in which organizations and individuals act out their own needs and identifications, and a ritual with strong social implications; (c) group-analytic psychotherapy suggests that the emotions aroused in a large group may be stronger and more difficult to control. Feelings are an unacknowledged major factor in the success or failure of exercises; (d) successful large exercises help improve the nature of trust between individuals and the organizations they represent, changing it from a situational trust to a personal trust; (e) it is more difficult to learn from large exercises or to apply the lessons identified; (f) however, large exercises can help develop organizations and individuals. Exercises (and simulation in general) need to be approached from a broader multidisciplinary direction if their full potential is to be realized.",

      "abstract": "Social dysfunction of schizophrenia is observed in many domains including social skills, ability to conduct tasks, attention/durability, volition/motivation, stability of social life, and insight of dysfunction. These dysfunctions have been found to relate to non-social cognitive functioning to some extent. Social skills may have a strong relationship with social cognition. The intervention technique of cognitive functioning of schizophrenia, known as cognitive rehabilitation or cognitive remediation, has its main target as non-social cognition. Cognitive behavior therapy focuses on the contents of the cognitive process, while cognitive rehabilitation focuses on the cognitive process (information process) or thinking skills. Which cognitive functioning should be targeted was revealed as were theoretical models of cognitive rehabilitation, and various intervention techniques and their usefulness. It has been found that some elements of cognitive functioning, such as executive functioning, could be improved in experimental settings in efficacy studies. However, comprehensive rehabilitation including cognitive rehabilitation should be used in order to relieve social dysfunctioning or psychiatric symptoms. Some experts insisted that an individualized program with several steps, along with cognitive abilities, is required to enhance usefulness and effectiveness. Other experts said more complex cognitive functioning profoundly associated with social life should be targeted, rather than elementary cognitive functioning. The conclusions of meta-analyses of randomized controlled trails were not consistent until now, because inclusion criteria of meta-analysis was different. Finally, it was discussed how the theory and techniques of cognitive rehabilitation should be implemented in traditional rehabilitation.",

We are consistently cheerful and friendly to a difficult colleague. We accommodate the wishes of a doting parent to calm worries about her child’s behaviors. We spend many extra hours rehearsing, practicing, and readying our students for a performance. We behave kindly and compassion­ately toward a staff member with the hope of smoothing a recent conflict. Good intentions do not guarantee good results. We need to have good intentions anyway. So many problems in our lives and relationships can be solved, or at least alleviated, if we intend to do good, no matter what the outcome. One reason that good intentions are so important is that we are setting a path for ourselves: we are purposefully and thought­fully aiming to make something better by our words and actions. But, of course, we have no (or little) control over the outcome. No guarantees. We may be disappointed that the outcome is not what we wanted, but that is always a risk. And let’s not allow the outcome to diminish the constructive nature of our intent. When we attach to the outcome, we rely too heavily on expecting a desired result. • If I am kind to her, she’ll be kind to me. • If I work hard to achieve this, I will be rewarded. • If I try hard enough, I’ll see the results I want. • If I remove myself from the group, others will coax me back. • If I sulk, others will know they have hurt me. • If I share some gossip with a co- worker, we’ll become closer friends. • If I bring treats and gifts, others will see how clever and generous I am. Imagine how our disposition would change if we crafted good intent with no attachment to the outcome. • We would lessen our desire for acknowledgment of our efforts. • We would lessen our disappointment when someone did not meet our expectations. • We would lessen our dependency on others’ confirmation of our good work.",

In such a choice, when the tasks are easy, the best strategy is to prepare for both of them. As difficulty increases beyond the point at which people can perform both tasks accurately, they should switch strategy and focus on one task at the expense of the other. Across three very different tasks (target detection, throwing, and memory), none of the participants switched their strategy at the correct point. Moreover, the majority consistently failed to modify their strategy in response to changes in task difficulty. This failure may have been related to uncertainty about their own ability, because in a version of the experiment in which there was no uncertainty, participants uniformly switched at an optimal point.",

Other conditions sometimes thought necessary to experience empathic concern—the other’s perceived innocence, perceived similarity, and adoption of an imagine-other perspective—seem to have their effect on empathic concern through one or the other of the two proposed necessary conditions.

      "abstract": "Abstract : A task is labelled as a team task when people have to conduct a task that each of them could not have done alone. Team tasks consists of three components: 1. The individual tasks of the team members;2. The cooperation and coordination between team members;and 3. The motivation and attitudes of the team members. These components are vital for team performance and should therefore also be addressed during the training of teams. However, the field of team training is still underdeveloped, especially for training regarding the second component: the cooperation and coordination between team members. For some fields or aspects training concepts have been developed, e.g. cross training and Crew Resource Management training. But it is not clear whether these training concepts can be used for other kinds of team tasks. Little research has addressed the issue of the timing of training regarding the different components. In most cases the team members are first trained individually until they have mastered their own individual tasks. Them team members train together to learn how to cooperate and how to coordinate their tasks. Whether this is always the optimal trajectory is unknown. Both training in teams and training individually have advantages and disadvantages. Individial training is easier to control and the training can be adapted to one particular student. However, the three components can only be integrated when team members are training together. And this improves the transfer of knowledge and skills. Practicing with simulated team members offers the advantages of training apart and training together.",

The most common is probably the lecture, but it is often complemented, at least in the faculty of engineering, by problem solving classes, laboratory practicals, projects and sometimes also other activities, such as home assignments or essays. This project will focus on exercises and problem solving classes and how they can be improved to support better learning. So what does a good problem or exercise look like? This seems at first glance to be a very difficult question to answer since learning styles vary greatly between students and problems are designed for a particular course. Two courses that have roughly the same content, but are given in different universities, might have different examination forms. As a result, problems that are suitable in one course might not be suitable in the other. The goal of this project is not to develop a universal algorithm for problem construction. That would clearly not be possible. Instead, we will look at well known concepts and beliefs that are results from research in teaching and learning. We look at the following concepts • Motivation - High motivation influences and stimulates learning. • Transfer of Learning - Previous knowledge is used when acquiring new knowledge. • Constructive Alignment - There should be a clear link between course goals, teaching activities and examination. With this as background we aim to formulate a few ideas that can be kept in mind when designing new problems. The goal is to improve the problems used in two courses at LTH.",

      "title": "The Micro-Politics of Social Actions",
      "abstract": "My starting point is that certain actions are 'valued' over others, in ways that are not restricted to pairs of possible actions (therefore not restricted to adjacency pairs). For instance, it may be regarded in certain corporate and political worlds as better to have 'resigned' than to have been fired. The micro-politics of social action is evident in the manoeuvres by which participants implement or avoid certain actions, always remembering that the relative value of an action is a situated attribute. I consider some of the systematic ways in which participants 'position' themselves with respect to certain action environments. From among the varied ways participants manoeuvre and position themselves regarding implementing and avoiding action, three stand out: (i) avoiding taking an action, in such a way that the other responds as though the (absent action) implication had been performed (other's ascription to self of an action self might have been avoiding); (ii) disguising an action, through (mis)attributing to one's own speech an action which may differ from the action that is thereby implemented (self-ascription); and (iii) treating a prior turn/action as having been what it was not officially designed to be/do (denying, disclaiming, 'misattributing' actions) (other-ascription).",

      "title": "PREDICTING (UNDER)ACHIEVEMENT OF GIFTED CHILDREN",
      "abstract": "Gifted children may perform worse or achieve much less than expected: how can this happen and how can such underachievement be prevented? To answer this question it is theorized that personal variables (e.g. identity, cognitive and motivational factors) and environmental variables (e.g. home and school) influence or interact with each other. The environmental variables may occur at different levels, e.g., the individual level or the group level Mutual influences or interactions between variables at different levels can be integrated within an interactional multilevel theory. A first example of such a theory is constructed with the aid of four consecutive developmental models. With a child's increasing age the number of variables in a model increases because of the child's growth in cognitive complexity and the accumulating differentiation in meaningful environmental levels and situations. With these models it is possible to explain a gifted child's underachievement in certain situations and its simultaneous high achievement in others. It is also possible to predict that by changing certain environmental characteristics underachievement can be turned into high achievement.",

Your job is to learn what you can about the weekly topic through the eyes of an individual with these social status characteristics. Feel free to use lecture notes, class readings, Internet research, scholarly journals, popular press, conversations with professionals, and conversations with older adults—so long as you tell us where it came from! \n\nThink of how the intersectionality of these characteristics might influence individuals’ perspective on the weekly topic (e.g., don’t focus only on how individuals may view aging from one category such as class—instead, think about how the combination of factors might influence one’s outlook—being a working class African American female). \n\nA 250 word topic discussion will be due each week. You may choose to take a general approach to your interpretation of facts for discussion—as an alternative, your paper can be written in first-person narrative or diary format (e.g., a week in the life of an individual facing particular challenges) providing support, with research, for any statements you make. There will be a weekly discussion where we explore issues related to the topic and how these experiences differ for persons of different social status characteristics. \n\nToward the end of the semester, you will turn in your five favorite topics/write-ups, adding any new terms of research you’ve come across, as part of the semester-long assignment.",

L’article aborde cette problématique sous l’angle des stratégies cognitives, en particulier les mécanismes d’attributions causales, qui sont mises en jeu dans les situations qui impliquent une réalisation. Ces stratégies sont constituées de plusieurs processus psychologiques tels que l’anticipation du succès ou de l’échec, l’élaboration de plans d’action liés à la tâche, le recours à des conduites non pertinentes par rapport à la tâche et le biais défensif d’attribution. On résume dans cet article quatre études dont les résultats suggèrent que les jeunes en échec scolaire semblent plutôt mettre en jeu une stratégie d’autohandicap alors que ceux qui, dans une phase ultérieure, de transition de l’adolescence à l’âge adulte ont des difficultés d’insertion mettent en jeu une stratégie encore plus handicapante que nous désignons par «piège de l’échec». En conclusion, nous présentons quelques principes de base destinés à la conception de programmes d’intervention dont l’objectif est d’aider certains jeunes en situation d’exclusion à réussir leur transition vers leur statut d’adultes.",

But if the quality (representational accuracy) of our communication depends on the quality of our thinking, and the quality (degree of satisfaction) of our relationships depends on the quality of our communication, we might enjoy more satisfying relationships through working to improve our and communicating. One way involves striving to become students of by infusing our vocabularies with mathematics and general semantics terms, and using them to modify our assumptions and beliefs and so improve our usual ways of thinking-feeling, talking about and doing things. Advanced is not about what, or how much anyone knows. Advanced refers specifically (and only) to moments of awareness - the contents of which involve consciousness of abstracting: in a general semantics (non-allness, non-identifying, ???-elementalistic, heuristic, multidimensional, propositional, etc.) way about the ways we think about whatever we happen to be about or reacting with - including ourselves. Many of our problems in communication and other relationships start - depending on where we stop our thinking. In the spirit of non-allness, and conscious timebinding (seeking improvement through applying general semantics), students of remain curious-lifelong-learners: When other say It is so, students of wonder and take a structural approach: Is it - If so - How so? Grounded in the principles of and non-identity, the proposition advanced thinking is based on the following criteria culled from Webster's Collegiate Dictionary: beyond the elementary or introductory; greatly developed beyond initial stage; further on in time or course; being beyond others in progress or ideas; gradual betterment; to bring or move forward; progress in development. school of claiming to have superseded general semantics would in effect be supporting and illustrating the principle of non-allness - We cannot sense, think, imagine, understand, know, say, write, all about anything or anyone - including ourselves: could avoid many personal, communication, and other problems by just remembering this seemingly simple />ro/>osi/io«-principle. As starts where other stops, students of thinking, following a non-allness, nonidentity, propositional approach, become engaged in continuous self-educating, self-correcting, self improving way of communicating with themselves, others, and the world around them. Recognizing that there were no generally accepted everyday communication standard, Alfred Korzybski proposed using his general semantics as a general way toward improving human communication-relationships. Semantics constitutes a system about systems involving a generalization of the methods and approach of science and mathematics and includes the following interrelated propositions-pnnciples-tools: A Theory of Time-binding (tools for improvements and adjustments), a general theory of evaluation and sanity, a general theory of psychotherapy, a general theory of values, a foundation for a theory of ethics, an international common denominator for communication and mutual understanding, among others. As this system has not yet been generally recognized or accepted, we miss many useful and effective tools for improving communication-and-relationships, and for understanding and resolving many of our disagreements, conflicts, violent outbursts, and societal breakdowns. Mathematical Approach Helps us Improve Communication The progress of science, technology, and our expanding and improving knowledge of the world (including ourselves) results mainly from applying mathematics in our communicating-relationships with our diverse environments. In his book And Sanity expounding the General Theory of Time-binding, on page 728, Alfred Korzybski proposed: Science and mathematics show the working of the 'human mind' at its best. …",

      "abstract": "Eine Kompensation von Leistungseinbussen oder Handlungsschwierigkeiten ist grundsaetzlich auf unterschiedlichen Ebenen moeglich. Kompensation ist mit technischen Hilfsmitteln und medizinischer Behandlung moeglich. Solche situationsbezogene Kompensation wird durch personenbezogene Kompensation ergaenzt. Sozial-organisatorische Kompensationsstrategien setzen auf Unterstuetzung durch andere Personen. Verhaltensmaessige Kompensation versucht Verhaltensanpassungen, zum Beispiel weniger oder anders fahren. Kognitive Kompensation bezeichnet Veraenderungen in fuer die Taetigkeit relevanten psychischen Hintergrundbereichen wie besondere Aufmerksamkeit, Vorsicht oder Selbstreflexion. Bei motivationaler Kompensation wird bewusst durch erhoehte Anstrengung ein Ausgleich erzielt. Emotionale Kompensation meint die Veraenderung und Anpassung des Erlebens, der Praeferenzen und der subjektiven Wichtigkeiten an die veraenderten Bedingungen. Nicht alle Kompensationen haben bewusstseinspflichtige Voraussetzungen zu durchlaufen. Um Kompensationsstrategien im Alter gezielt anwenden zu koennen, muessen vom Betroffenen zumindest folgende drei Schritte erfolgreich durchgefuehrt werden: 1. Wahrnehmen und Akzeptieren sich veraendernder Faehigkeiten und Grenzen; 2. Erkennen und Auswahl eigener Moeglichkeiten zur Kompensation und 3. Erfolgreiche Umsetzung geeigneter Kompensationsstrategien. Selektive Optimierung mit Kompensation (SOK) traegt nach der Lebensspannenforschung zu einem guten Leben im Alter bei. Aus empirischen Befunden geht hervor, dass aeltere Kraftfahrer zum Ausgleich verminderter Wahrnehmungs- und Reaktionsleistungen vorrangig ihr Verkehrsteilnahmeverhalten veraendern und weniger ihren Fahrstil. Sie betreiben damit Selektion und Substitution auf der strategischen Ebene des Fahrverhaltens. Dass eine Kompensation selbst bei auffaelligen Verhaltensproblemen grundsaetzlich moeglich ist, wird in Deutschland auch bei der medizinisch-psychologischen Eignungsbegutachtung von Kraftfahrern anerkannt. Unter dem Gesichtspunkt der Erhaltung von Mobilitaet und sozialer Teilhabe am Alter waeren Veraenderungen durch Restitution beziehungsweise Training und Substitution gegenueber der Selektion vorzuziehen. Abschliessend werden Ueberlegungen zur geeigneten Auswahl erfolgreicher Kompensationsstrategien formuliert. Zur Gesamtaufnahme siehe ITRD D361701. (KfV/A)",

The areas of instruction dissemination are wide and varied. They are often found in the form of requirements, regulations, instructions, and warnings. They are characterized by the asymmetric top-down relations model, in which the addressee superiority is found, but at the same time the actions of addresser are independent. Instructives can illustrate a positive or a negative addressee reaction i.e. they can be accepted or not. Instructives in the web often merge with entertaining genres of playful sayings such as absurd or \"harmful\" advice.",

In this review, we discuss the evidence for the catalyzing role of affiliation goals in these two processes for a variety of positive (e.g., exercising, smoking-cessation) and detrimental health behaviors (e.g., binge drinking and eating, needle sharing). Additionally, we discuss individual difference factors that may temporarily or chronically activate affiliation goals and ultimately impact health behaviors. Affiliation goals hold many implications for future work, and for improving interventions.",

Satisfaction of these basic needs facilitates people's autonomous motivation (i.e., acting with a sense of full endorsement and volition), whereas thwarting the needs promotes controlled motivation (i.e., feeling pressured to behave in particular ways) or being amotivated (i.e., lacking intentionality). Satisfying these basic needs and acting autonomously have been consistently shown to be associated with psychological health and effective performance. Social contexts within which people operate, however proximal (e.g., a family or workgroup) or distal (e.g., a cultural value or economic system), affect their need satisfaction and type of motivation, thus affecting their wellness and effectiveness. Social contexts also affect whether people's life goals or aspirations tend to be more intrinsic or more extrinsic, and that in turn affects important life outcomes.",

Based on their defining pragmatic characteristics, we identify two generic interactional affordances RfCs offer their speakers: (1) a capacity to do questioning and (2) a capacity to forward propositional content. While these two affordances are generally utilized together, one or the other may be mobilized more strongly when bringing off challenging or disagreement-implicative actions. Drawing on interactional data in (Peninsular) Spanish and (American) English, and using conversation analytic methods, we illustrate how participants may differentially draw on these two basic affordances with respect to two major classes of “challengeables”: (1) a co-participant’s claims and assertions (or the stances with which they are delivered), and (2) a co-participant’s plans or decisions. We end with a discussion of the usefulness of an affordance-based approach.",

Socially unskilled managers produce high levels of discontent, and consequent absenteeism and labour turnover among their subordinates. All kinds of mental patients have social behaviour problems. Schizophrenics are the worst, and are found very difficult to interact with. Assertiveness, the ability to influence or control others, has sometimes been equated with social competence. The social moves or signals of the social skills model are partly non-verbal, and perception and feedback is partly of the non-verbal communication of others.

And it continues to grow in various aspects of life to date. Obedience is a decision to serve the obedient leader. Service and obedience are two things that are side by side like Siamese twins.\r\nThrough expressions that contain teaching that is so strict, that if someone likes to serve or feels called in a certain field of service, but has a rebellious heart to the leader, it is showing a failure to understand the meaning of a service.

      "abstract": "In the process, there may be four kinds of changes that demand psychological adaptation: (1) Changes in physical environment, such as moving to live with children, moving to long term care organization, or changing household equipment/structure to meet the changes of body and/or psychological functions; (2) Changes in social environment, including changes of social roles and those derived from the role changes; (3) Changes of body (physiological) structures/functions; (4) Changes of psychological structures/functions. One way or the other, an individual will the changes mentioned above, and at the same time, interpret the meaning of the changes. The first two kinds of changes provide information from outside of the self while the latter two mainly from within the self. However, how to detect the change(s) and the content detected are more important than whether the information coming from within or outsider the self. Because the meaningfulness of the change(s) constructed by one`s is based upon the changes detected. The meaning-constructing process is a top-down process that develops mainly by the command of one`s knowledge system. Within the knowledge system the attitude of illness, and death may be the core commander. Besides, one`s life goal(s)/ goal hierarchy, self concept, and self image will be effective in the meaning-constructing process, too. Many researchers focus on the of attitude toward Most societies possess noticeable degree of negative attitude toward aging and/ or the elderly. And, when a person grows older, he himself/ she herself become the target of his/her negative attitude. Some of the researchers would address this paradox as a kind of disaster when a person encounters it. Active psychological adaptation to can be achieved by optimization with compensation. With the preassumption of realistically knowing the change following aging, one can reasonably analyze- reanalyze the resources already lose, the resources remained, and the resources gained. And, based on these analysis, he/she may rearrange (reconstruct) his/her life goals, i.e. to be selective and flexible in determining the planning of living with aging. After the selection, the focus will be optimizing what one can do and compensating what one cannot do.",

Expe- riential Avoidance is a phenomenon that occurs when a person is unwilling to make contact with par - ticular pr ivate experiences (sensations, emotions, thoughts, memories) and attempts to change to w ay or the frequency of these events and the context which gives rise to them. Acceptance, as a str ategy for change, consists of not a voiding, controlling or changing the elements that form part of the psycholo - gically traumatic event. An example is presented of a client who shows experiential a voidance, and of ways to promote acceptance through Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. This form of therapy is intended to treat the excessive response to cognitive and emotional contents, and lack of skill in ma - king a commitment to change. The different phases of treatment are described, as are the results of the intervention, which were maintained for more than 1 year.",

Poor concentration, lack of confidence, increased heart rate and feeling of apprehension or sickness are common negative effects of anxiety. There are various strategies players can employ to help you control pre competition anxiety and overcome any negative side effects. Competition anxiety does not need to be a problem. With practice of relaxation techniques, you can control your pre-competition nerves and prevent them negatively affecting performance, and allowing you to reach your full potential. No matter how much you’ve trained, performance anxiety before or during a competition may occur, hindering the results of your match. Colloquially referred to as “choking,” performance anxiety is a result of overwhelming perceived stress, which leads to a decrease in athletic performance. Whether these anxieties stem from past experiences or a fear of failure, it’s an important emotion to identify and deal with. Here are a few ways to overcome performance anxiety.",

      "abstract": "Una situacion de evaluacion implica para el evaluado cierto nivel de activacion que, en prin cipio, facilita el rendimiento y pone en marcha un conjunto de respuestas encaminadas a la resolucion de la tarea que se pretende evaluar. Es por ejemplo el caso de los examenes, una situacion en la que muchos estudiantes son eva luados y de cuyos resultados depende, entre otras cosas, su promocion academica o su incor poracion al mundo laboral. No obstante, la situacion de evaluacion, a veces, supone una res puesta excesiva de ansiedad que dificulta el ren dimiento y produce una sobrecarga en la memo ria de trabajo. Esta sobrecarga interfiere cual quier respuesta cognitiva encaminada a la reso lucion de la tarea y aumenta la ansiedad percibi da. La ansiedad puede interferir en el rendimiento que la persona desarrolle ante una prueba de evaluacion tal y como es la situa cion de examen. El examen se define como una prueba en la que tenemos que demostrar nuestra aptitud en determinadas materias. Las personas que experimentan una alta ansiedad a ser evaluados sufren una merma importante en la ejecucion de tales pruebas en comparacion con aquellos que no padecen esta ansiedad. El padecer ansiedad no tiene por que estar necesariamente relacionado con los suspensos obtenidos. De acuerdo con la ley de Yerkes y Dodson, el grado de excitacion o motivacion del individuo relacionada con su nivel de ejecucion tiene la forma de una U invertida, alcanzandose el nivel optimo de rendimiento con un grado medio de excitacion. Hembre (1988) reviso 562 estudios llevados a cabo en Norte America relativos a la ansiedad de evaluacion entre 1950 y 1986, y Seipp (1991) realizo un meta-analisis de 126 estudios llevados a cabo en diferentes paises entre 1975 y 1988. Hembree y Seipp convergen en ofrecer una correlacion negativa de -.21 entre ansiedad y rendimiento academico. Se estima que entre el 15 y el 25% de los estudiantes presentan ansiedad ante los examenes (Escalona y Miguel-Tobal, 1996); especialmente cuando se enfrentan a pruebas decisivas. Que los alumnos esten o dejen de estar ansiosos en epoca de examenes poco importaria si no existiera una relacion entre ansiedad y memorizacion por una parte, y ansiedad y rendimiento, por otra. Diversos estudios han encontrado que los alumnos que se encuentran nerviosos memorizan peor.",

      "title": "Putting your past behind you: Why and how fresh starts motivate goal pursuit---and when they backfire",
      "abstract": "People often fail to exercise the self-control required to tackle their goals and improve their performance. However, many feel that we have opportunities throughout our lives to start with a clean slate (e.g., around New Year's Day, after a Catholic confession). Although the notion of fresh has long been endorsed by our culture, researchers have not systematically explored the implications of starts for people's motivation to exert effort in goal-directed activities. Across three chapters, I examine (a) how and why starts affect individuals' ability to exert the self-control needed to achieve their aspirations and (b) when starts may adversely influence individuals' motivation to improve their performance. In Chapter 1, three archival field studies demonstrate that people engage in aspirational behaviors (e.g., exercising, creating a goal commitment contract) more frequently at the start of new time periods that are initiated by temporal landmarks (e.g., the beginning of a new week/month/year/school semester, or immediately following a holiday, a school break, or a birthday). In Chapter 2, five laboratory studies show that meaningful temporal landmarks--dates imbued with meaning due to their identity-relevance or rarity--are more likely to spur goal pursuit than (a) ordinary days or (b) objectively identical but psychologically less meaningful landmarks. Further, I provide evidence for one mechanism underlying these findings: temporal landmarks (particularly meaningful landmarks) relegate past imperfections to a previous period, making the current self feel more capable of pursuing aspirations. Chapter 3 investigates the impact on individuals' future performance of tracking their performance without incorporating records of their past performance (a phenomenon I refer to as a performance reset). I propose that when individuals believe their past performance was poor, a performance reset will improve their performance by boosting self-efficacy and commitment. However, I expect resets to hurt performance by decreasing commitment without increasing self-efficacy when individuals believe their past performance was strong. One archival field study and four laboratory experiments support this hypothesized relationship between performance resets, past performance, and future performance; these studies also provide preliminary evidence that self-efficacy mediates this relationship. Chapter 4 discusses directions for future research. Degree Type Dissertation Degree Name Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Graduate Group Operations & Information Management First Advisor Katherine L.

      "abstract": "One of the factors that has a major effect on motivating a person is the person's perception of his abilities and capabilities or the so-called self-efficacy. According to theories of self-efficacy and the force field, adults often feel insecure and uncomfortable when they make direct contact with the world today because of dramatic changes and the possibility of not being able to adapt to them. In such a situation, their self-image is shaken and they lose their self-confidence. Insecurity and feelings of inadequacy cause them to lose their motivation and desire to learn. Unfortunately, most adults have a negative attitude towards adults' ability to learn. While human beings at any age have the ability to learn. Adults, like other human beings, have the ability to learn and use new technologies.Purpose of the article: To study the peculiarities of adult learning, especially the barriers to participation in educational programs, the impact of adult's perception of personal potential and learning ability on educational motivation and aspiration.The scientific novelty of the research: The study comprehensively analyzes the issue of adult education in Iran. The article substantiates the research provision that adults' perception of their own abilities has a significant impact on the learning process, and this plays a decisive role in adults’ learning motivations and the involving in educational programs and training courses.",

      "title": "Nudges that fail",
      "abstract": "Abstract Why are some nudges ineffective, or at least less effective than choice architects hope and expect? Focusing primarily on default rules, this essay emphasizes two reasons for this. The first involves strong antecedent preferences on the part of choosers. The second involves successful “counternudges,” which persuade people to choose in a way that confounds the efforts of choice architects. Nudges might also be ineffective, and less effective than expected, for five other reasons: (1) some nudges produce confusion in the target audience; (2) some nudges have only short-term effects; (3) some nudges produce “reactance” (though this appears to be rare); (4) some nudges are based on an inaccurate (though initially plausible) understanding on the part of choice architects of what kinds of choice architecture will move people in particular contexts; and (5) some nudges produce compensating behavior, resulting in no net effect. When a nudge turns out to be insufficiently effective, choice architects have three potential responses: (1) do nothing; (2) nudge better (or differently); and (3) fortify the effects of the nudge, perhaps through counter-counternudges, or perhaps through incentives, mandates, or bans.",

      "abstract": "How can individuals equip themselves to exercise leadership in the face of moral adversity? This six-session module aims to prepare students to meet moral responsibility when it is simultaneously most essential and most difficult. Moral adversity refers to situations in which a person confronts a pressing moral responsibility-to oppose wrong-doing, aid others in desperate need, or stand up for inviolable principles, for example-yet meeting that responsibility is very difficult. The difficulty may arise because the situation entails personal or organizational sacrifice, for example, or colliding duties, or unfavorable conditions-such as time pressure, uncertainty, and uncooperative third parties. The module explores two forms that leadership can take in the face of moral adversity: taking direct action oneself to meet one's responsibilities and guiding others to meet collective responsibility. By examining protagonists who encounter moral adversity and must respond to urgent and complex calls to leadership, the module aims to provide students with: (1) An understanding of characteristic challenges and complications that make it so hard to exercise leadership in the face of moral adversity; (2) A map of the process for delivering on responsibility in the face of moral adversity; (3) A developmental perspective for approaching moral adversity, which casts ethically challenging situations not solely as tests of character but as opportunities to build one's personal capacity to shoulder responsibility and exercise leadership; (4) A moral compass that outlines the personal capacity students need to build, specifying capabilities and commitments students need to develop in order to navigate through moral adversity.",

      "title": "Managing relational conflict by closing the intention and behavioural gap through the use of a 3 dimensional visualisation and simulation model",
      "abstract": "Disappointment in interpersonal relationships may arise from a gap between the intentions and actions or perceptions that each person has of their own intentions and actions and those of others (Intention and Behaviour Gap). This gap can originate from: (a) a diminished or lack of insight or awareness of own emotions and behaviours, and it's effect on others, (b) lack of awareness of the intention or the desired outcomes and (c) the gap existing between the two people as well as the (d) inability to change behaviour. This gap could be related to behaviours people have that have become known and culturally accepted as rigid and inflexible. Consequently, the person focuses on their intention with little to no self-knowledge of the displayed behaviour, thus judging their own actions on their good personal intention while judging others based on their perceptions rather than the others' intentions. This inclination amounts to self-righteousness and can increase the likelihood of frustration and anger towards the perceived bias and lack of fairness towards others. In turn, this might cause interpersonal discord, resentment, misunderstanding, and conflict.To address this behavioural gap, this study proposes the application of a 3-Dimensional, Visualisation and Simulation Model (3DVSM) to enhance insight into own and others behaviours and actions, followed by connecting one's actions to the desired intention. The ultimate goal is to instil a desire for modifying one's behaviour, thus reducing interpersonal conflict by shortening the gap between intention and action.",

      "title": "The Effects of Behavioral Inhibition: Integrating Internal Cues, Cognition, Behavior, and Affect",
      "abstract": "Abstract This article reviews the literature on behavioral inhibition and suggests that repeated attempts to inhibit motivations to act (such as emotion, hunger, thirst, sexual arousal, and drug cravings) involve conflict and have cognitive, affective, and behavioral consequences, many of which are negative. People often have difficulty ignoring motivational guides to behavior, and this often results in emotional distress and maladaptive behavior. Such suppression might produce health problems, negative affect, cognitive disruption, and eventual behavioral excess. These reactions occur whether the inhibited activity involves failure to express emotion, repressive responses to stress, or avoidance of internally motivated activities, such as eating or drinking. Although the exact mechanism underlying these effects is not yet clear, the similarities across behaviors are provocative. Whereas the benefits of suppressing some behaviors that are themselves unhealthy or otherwise costly (such as smoking) might well outweigh the negative effects of attempted inhibition, it appears to be important for the individual to be aware that these costs exist. Without such acknowledgment, society's proscriptions on expressing such motivated behaviors might exacerbate rather than eliminate a multitude of problems.",

For as he suggests, it is only by centering ourselves towards the task that the task is accomplished or towards the problem that the problem is solved. This does not mean that methods or means, or, in the broader sense, of means as ends or of ends per se , do not constitute problems. The whole problem of psychology is the means by which the organism obtains knowledge; the problem of education is that of means (the teaching), or the problem of communication is one of means (the language), or of any profession, e.g., engineering or medicine, the problem may be of means as a problem. Whichever is the case it is only so far as problems are solved that we are free to go on to tackle new ones or throw light on the more basic ones and thus enrich our lives. Problem solving, of course, does not mean that particular problems as framed are solvable. For example, if the rules state that one must connect each dot with every other dot on a piece of paper (a two dimensional limitation) with lines (straight or curved) that do not intersect, a four dot problem is solvable but a five dot situation cannot be resolved within these rules. In the latter case it may mean that the problem becomes: “can anyone solve it?” This has been the lesson of the mathematicians and the logical positivists. But what is problem solving?",

      "abstract": "Self–esteem, like self-efficacy and ability of adjust, is not present, at same rate, among all the individuals though these abilities are present in every individual to some extent. Self-esteem, self-efficacy and adjustment, make the person grow higher and higher and achieve success at the fastest rate. Most of the successful people do possess these abilities at high level, whereas weak and mostly unsuccessful lack these abilities in them. If one want to  improve and enhance one’s self-esteem, either a person have to develop of its own , or either gain through every day experiences or gain by undergoing training  for gaining life skills which may help to improve  and  enhance it. Every common man , students, professionals in day to day life come across situations/ and varied experience , in their personal and professional life , where they are unable to cope  with stress , emotions  especially anger, empathise , make decisions, solve problems, effectively communicate and listen , form strong interpersonal bonds, manage time . Due to lack of  these life skills  they are unable to  grow , prosper , achieve success  , which if they would have had would  have helped to improve and enhance their self-esteem, self-efficacy and adjustment and make them successful . Life skills for improving self-esteem, self-efficacy and adjustment include self-awareness, effective communication skills, interpersonal relationships, time management, coping stress, managing emotions, creative thinking, critical thinking, empathy and few others. These skills are very important skills essential for effective functioning of the life. There are many life skills, if developed by providing ‘life skill training’ can help the person to achieve success in his life. Researcher has designed a ‘training program’ especially for pre-service teacher trainees. Researcher have conducted a pilot study and have attempted to study effectiveness of  the life skill training of the developed ‘ training programme’  on self-esteem of teacher trainees at B.Ed. level , further performed  analysis to measure the effect of the developed ‘training program’ on self-esteem and  have presented the findings of the study conducted . The findings of the pilot study revealed that life skill training of ‘training programme’ developed by the researcher was effective on self-esteem of teacher trainees at B.Ed. level.",

      "title": "Individual and collective reflection: how to meet the needs of development in teaching",
      "abstract": "The following five core ideas explain how learning organizations function as wholes. The core ideas are central when school is examined as a learning organization. Personal mastery, mental models, team learning, shared visions and system thinking offer different angles to examine the organization. (1) Personal mastery. Without personal commitment, development is impossible. A community and an individual cannot be directed from outside. Growing means ultimately the ability to let other people grow. (2) Various deeply rooted mental models, ways of thinking and seeing things direct our daily behaviour. When evaluating teaching, the most essential thing is not to value the product only, but to value the mental processes. Individual and group reflection skills are needed there. (3) Shared vision. Appreciating views other than one's own is the most important key success factor of a team. All team members should commit themselves to sharing the vision. This presupposes plenty of discourse in the organization, because commitment cannot be imposed. (4) Team learning. The ability to genuinely learn and work together is a challenge. Collective reflection and regarding other people as esteemed colleagues fosters a good atmosphere, gives time and space to other people and will lead to a deeper understanding than one person alone can attain. (5) In systemic thinking the background is formed by system and theories. We are directed logically to only a minor extent. System thinking binds the other core factors together. This research has focused on personal mastery and mental models. The phenomena of individual and collective reflection and their prerequisites were investigated. The target group was a sample of teacher trainees in vocational teacher education. Familiarization with systematic reflection and adopting the usage of it led to a conscious professional approach, empowerment and aptness for life‐long learning. Die folgenden fünf Kern‐Vorstellungen erklären, wie Lernorganisationen als Ganze funktionieren. Diese Kern‐Vorstellungen sind von zentraler Bedeutung, wenn Schule selbst als eine lernende Organisation beurteilt wird. Persönliche Erkenntnis, Denk‐Modelle, soziales Lernen, gemeinsame Vision und System‐Denken bieten verschiedene Sichtweisen, diese Lernorganisationen zu prüfen. (1) Persönliche Erkenntnis. Ohne persönliches Engagement ist Entwicklung unmöglich. Eine Gemeinschaft und ein Individuum können nicht von außen gesteuert werden. Heranwachsen bedeutet schließlich die Fähigkeit, andere Leute an sich selbst wachsen zu lassen. (2) Verschieden tief verwurzelte Denk‐Modelle, Denkweisen und Ansichten bestimmen unser tägliches Verhalten. Bei Bewerten des Unterrichtens, gilt es nicht allein das Endprodukt zu bewerten, sondern auch die Denk‐Prozesse für die Lösungswege. Es werden Fertigkeiten der individuellen Umsetzung und kollektiver Reflexion nötig sein. (3) Gemeinsame Vision. Der wichtigste Schlüssel zum Erfolg für Lernen im Team ist die Akzeptanz unterschiedlicher Ansichten als die eigenen. Alle Mitglieder der Gruppe sollten zu den unterschiedlichen Ansichten Stellung beziehen. Dies setzt eine Fülle von Sachgesprächen in der Lernorganisation voraus, sonst ist kein Engagement zu erwarten. (4) Lernen im Team. Die Fähigkeit, mit einander zu lernen und zu arbeiten, ist eine echte Herausforderung. Kollektive Reflexion, gute Zusammenarbeit unter Kollegen, Wert legen auf gute Atmosphäre, gibt Zeit und Raum zu anderen Menschen, und wird zu einem tieferen Verständnis führen, als je ein Einzelner es erlangen kann. (5) Das systemische Denken beruft sich auf System‐ und Chaos‐Theorie. Wir sind nur zu einem geringen Teil durch Logik gesteuert. Das Systemdenken verbindet die. Hauptfaktoren unseres Denkens. Diese Forschung konzentrierte sich auf persönlicher Erkenntnis und Denkmodellen. Die Phänomene individueller und kollektiver Reflexion und deren Anfangsbedingungen wurden untersucht. Die Zielgruppe waren Lehramtskandidaten in der Berufsschullehrer‐Ausbildung. Die Gewöhnung an systematische Reflexion und deren Aneignung führte zu berufsbezogener Methode, Befähigung, Bevollmächtigung und Tauglichkeit zu lebenslangem Lernen.",

      "abstract": "Procrastination, defined as the subjectively aversive inability to initiate or complete the pursuit of a given goal, is a common phenomenon in academic contexts. This theoretical paper presents a dynamic model that centers on the role of goal focus in influencing procrastination during goal pursuit. Our central hypothesis is that focusing on the means of goal pursuit (i.e., adopting a process focus) reduces procrastination, particularly when fear of failure is high. Focusing on the means should decrease the salience of performance outcomes and thereby reduce fear of failure. This, in turn, should facilitate the initiation and maintenance of goal pursuit. In contrast, when means are perceived as unpleasant (high task aversiveness), focusing more on the outcome of goal pursuit (i.e., adopting an outcome focus) should reduce procrastination by directing attention away from the means while highlighting the importance of goal achievement. Furthermore, the model takes account of dynamic contextual factors, particularly the distance to a given deadline.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter reviews individual-level perspectives on how entrepreneurs navigate uncertainty. Integrating perspectives from research on entrepreneurial action and from research on entrepreneurial well-being, the author outlines a micro-level self-regulatory model of entrepreneurs’ uncertainty management. This model considers cognitive appraisal processes alongside immediate emotional reactions and longer-term well-being as important drivers of entrepreneurial actions (opening, closing, or nonaction) to leverage or reduce uncertainty, contingent on entrepreneurs’ uncertainty capabilities. In turn, entrepreneurs’ appraisals of action outcomes feed back to alter perceived uncertainty (reducing or creating new uncertainty), uncertainty appraisals (as challenge, threat, or irrelevant), uncertainty capabilities, and action choices. The chapter offers new insights to research on entrepreneurial action and entrepreneurial well-being through integrating cognitive and emotional processes and helps to understand when, why, and how uncertainty can result in positive or negative outcomes for the entrepreneur including eudaimonic well-being or ill-being, adaptive action or identity uncertainty, and exit from entrepreneurship.",

Supervisors or supervisees in group supervision can play the patient in different situations, and can also reverse roles when the therapist plays their patient, and the supervisor plays the therapist. Before role-playing, there is a need to set a specific goal. Playing roles in supervision can focus on (a) conceptualizing the case; (b) assessing and optimizing therapeutic strategies; (c) a better understanding of the therapeutic relationship.

      "title": "Recruitment and Retention in Youth Programs",
      "abstract": "Out-of-school time (OST) programs frequently struggle with recruitment and retention of youth in their programs. Recruitment and retention in OST programs can be thought of as two sides of the same coin: after the initial decision to try out a program, youth need to be continually recruited to keep attending, or to be retained in the program. Youth decide to participate (and to keep on participating) in programs based on a number of interacting intrapersonal, interpersonal, and contextual factors. Several approaches to understanding these factors are discussed, and suggest that youth are “active agents” in their own development; are influenced by their “ecology,” or social surroundings; and consciously plan their behavior. Youth attendance in programs is also influenced by a combination of social and peer factors, psychological processes, program structure, and context. Some specific methods and recommendations for increasing the success of recruitment and retention efforts are also provided. These recommendations are based on several youth development assumptions: (a) youth have power and ability to make conscious decisions about their activities and behaviors; (b) youth experience multiple influences on their OST program participation; (c) youth desire the opportunity to engage in “voice and choice;” and (d) authentic representation and participation of youth is crucial to all recruitment and retention efforts.?",

In middle childhood, mastering multiple academic skills, such as language, vocabulary, grammar, writing, mathematics, classifying, reversing, sorting, matching, and thereby being industrious gives energy for future development. Conversely, where a new skill is too challenging, or not taught well, for example, jumping from simple math to multiplying fractions, a child may experience feelings of inferiority or lack of confidence that can impede progress in other areas of development. Low self-esteem may also follow crises in the wider family or environment. Trauma informed interventions by teachers foster resilience. Concrete skills are used and built upon throughout life.",

      "title": "[Desire, knowledge..., belief, choice, ...and ability].",
      "abstract": "The evolution of various approaches to health education and additions from educational psychology have brought about a proposition of an easy-to-follow (thus useful) model for health educators based on five nouns: Desire, Knowledge, Belief, Choice, and Ability (Vouloir, Savoir, Se voir, Choisir et Pouvoir). 1. Desire creates the motivation which is essential to action, and can stem from: anticipating consequences; and/or an internal need to resolve problems; and/or external constraints; and/or an interest, reflecting a system of values. Motivation increases, of course, when more than one of the above factors comes into play and the effects are combined. 2. Knowledge is the cognitive competence which is acquired through direct experience, imitation of models, or \"verbal apprenticeship\" which provides the individual with a repertoire of effective solutions to various problems. 3. Belief concerns the concept of self-evaluation (or rather self-estime). An individual judges his/her capacity to act according to his/her capabilities, and the community according to its actual or potential human, financial and material resources. 4. An individual or community uses its \"knowledge\" to consider a series of possible solutions to a given problem and chooses the solution according to a base of preferences. In health, as elsewhere, all actions have positive and negative consequences. An example can be found in the alcohol/tobacco area: a certain positive image of smoking and drinking has been portrayed in many socio-cultural environments, and educational campaigns have had a difficult time convincing the public of the negative consequences of these actions. It is thus not surprising that the \"balance\" of the decision continues toward substance abuse. 5. After \"desire, knowledge, belief and choice\" have filtered potential solutions, the decisive step is left: the individual and/or community execute an action according to their ability to succeed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "title": "Keynote Address 4 : “On the Active Psychological Adaptation toward Aging”",
      "abstract": "In the aging process, there may be four kinds of changes that demand psychological adaptation: (1) Changes in physical environment, such as moving to live with children, moving to long term care organization, or changing household equipment/ structure to meet the changes of body and/or psychological functions; (2) Changes in social environment, including changes of social roles and those derived from the role changes; (3) Changes of body (physiological) structures/functions; (4) Changes of psychological structures/functions. One way or the other, an aging individual will “detect” the changes mentioned above, and at the same time, “interpret” the meaning of the changes. The first two kinds of changes provide information from outside of the self while the latter two mainly from within the self. However, how to detect the change(s) and the content detected are more important than whether the information coming from within or outsider the self. Because the meaningfulness of the change(s) constructed by one`s “knowledge system” is based upon the changes detected. The meaning-constructing process is a “top-down” process that develops mainly by the command of one`s knowledge system. Within the knowledge system the attitude of illness, aging and death may be the core commander. Besides, one`s life goal(s)/ goal hierarchy, self concept, and self image will be effective in the meaning-constructing process, too. Many researchers focus on the “paradox of attitude toward aging”. Most societies possess noticeable degree of negative attitude toward “aging and/ or the elderly”. And, when a person grows older, he himself/ she herself become the target of his/her negative attitude. Some of the researchers would address this paradox as a kind of “disaster” when a person encounters it. Active psychological adaptation to aging can be achieved by “selective optimization with compensation”. With the preassumption of realistically knowing the change following aging, one can reasonably analyze- reanalyze the resources already lose, the resources remained, and the resources gained. And, based on these analysis, he/she may rearrange (reconstruct) his/her life goals, i.e. to be selective and flexible in determining the planning of living with aging. After the selection, the focus will be “optimizing” what one can do and “compensating” what one cannot do.",

Some of the problems now evident in screening programmes, such as low attendance or high levels of anxiety following participation are due in part to an under‐investigation of the psychological processes and outcomes critical to achieving the goals of screening programmes. These goals include high rates of informed participation and satisfactory psychological outcomes of such participation. The development of psychological models in this area may help in documenting the factors mediating and moderating responses to screening, and may suggest interventions likely to facilitate the achievement of the goals of a screening programme.",

      "abstract": "Self-control allows us to volitionally regulate our impulses or immediate desires in order to achieve more desirable long-term goals. However, exerting control over the self does not always work efficiently. For instance, going to the gym might be harder after a stressful day at work during which I had to force myself to keep working on rather challenging or frustrating tasks. The strength model of self-control assumes that there is only a limited amount of self-control strength available at a given point of time: If I had to control myself, my self-control resources can become temporarily depleted and I am less adept at exerting self-control in subsequent tasks, making task failure more likely. The present chapter introduces the basic theoretical assumptions of the strength model and presents findings of the so-called ego depletion on sports-related performance. Furthermore, the strengths and weaknesses of the strength model on a theoretical and a practical level will be discussed. Finally, alternative self-control models as well as practical recommendations on how to improve self-control performance in sport and exercise settings will be presented.",

It is impossible to speak without conveying a message, whether it be as simple as establishing personal contact with someone in the form of phatic communion, or as complex as a discussion between two experts on a fine technical detail. In the former case the topics which normally occur concern the health of the interlocutors, the weather and good wishes for a successful day; rapid switching of topics is normal. In the latter case, when specialists meet and discuss a highly technical topic, the conversation is usually restricted to that single topic alone. At times it is the set of circumstances, the situation, which is the dominant feature, the feature which determines what is to be discussed — for example, an evening spent with friends, when there may be many shifts of topic and no single one predominates; what is important is the interpersonal activity, preserving friendliness and a casual atmosphere.

Unfortunately, almost all the investigators who have attempted to study fatigue of this type have adopted methods taken over with very slight change from those which have proved valuable in the study of simple muscular fatigue. They have chosen elementary operations usually considered to require some ‘mental’ effort—such as easy calculations, word or colour recognition and naming and the like—have repeated these operations over and over again for long periods, and have tried to express the resulting fatigue in terms of the diminution in quantity or quality of the work done. The skill fatigue of daily life is not set up under such conditions. Routine repetition of simple actions is not a characteristic of any highly skilled work, and least of all of work having a strong ‘mental’ component. The operations involved here are marked by complex, co-ordinated and accurately timed activities. The stimuli in response to which these activities are set up are neither simple nor do they usually fall into an order of fixed succession.",

El estres puede ser producido por diferentes circunstancias, las cuales son diferentes para cada persona y estas se presentan en diferentes aspectos de la vida del individuo, es decir, se puede presentar a nivel familiar, educativo, profesional, entre otros dependiendo el individuo que se desee analizar. “… Recibir una calificacion reprobatoria en un examen de fisica, llegar considerablemente tarde a una junta importante, o jugar tiempos extra a muerte subita en un partido de hockey”.

El estres laboral ha sido estudiado desde hace mas de tres decadas por lo que es posible encontrar definiciones al respecto; McGrath, en 1970 definio el estres laboral como “el desequilibrio sustancial (percibido) entre la demanda y la capacidad de respuesta del individuo bajo condiciones en las que el fracaso ante esta demanda posee importantes consecuencias (percibidas)”.

      "abstract": "The “self‐serving bias” refers to people's tendency to attribute positive outcomes or successes to internal or personal factors (such as effort or ability) and to attribute negative outcomes or failures to external or situational factors (such as task difficulty or luck). Variously labeled as “defensive,” “egocentric,” or “egotistic” attribution, the bias accounts for people's greater tendency to take credit for success than failure (e.g., having a perfect score in school examinations because of innate intelligence or hard work as opposed to having a low score because of unfavorable test conditions; doing well in a boxing match because of exceptional strength and skills as opposed to doing poorly because of unfair rules). The bias is also evident in people's tendency to assess morally ambiguous situations in ways that are concordant with their interests; or in people's perceptions of fairness – namely when they arrive at judgments of what is fair or right that favor self‐interest. More generally, the bias is said to involve a cognitive/perceptual process distorted by the need to maintain and enhance self‐esteem (Forsyth, 2008). It is hence said to be influenced by both motivational (e.g., self‐enhancement) and cognitive (e.g., locus of control) factors (Shepperd, Malone, and Sweeny, 2008; Tetlock and Levi, 1982; Twenge, Zhang, and Im, 2004; Tyler and Devinitz, 1981; Wichman and Ball, 1983).",

      "title": "Insight and Judgment",
      "abstract": "Abstract Insight and judgment are complex cognitive tasks that require the utilization and integration of several different mental functions, especially higher-level conceptual thinking. Prerequisites for insightfulness include the capacity for abstraction, ability to communicate (speech and language), intact cognitive function, absence of a thought disorder, euthymic mood, and stable affect (see Chapters 2 to 6). Even patients without disturbance of these functions may have poor insight as a result of using maladaptive psychologic defense mechanisms that distort the perception of internal and external realities or alter the motivation to relate openly with another person. In addition, the examiner needs to use his or her own abstract thinking in order to determine how insightful the patient is during the interview, because this determination is itself a subjective judgment. Evaluation of the patient’s insight and ability to make sound judgments is based on both the content and the process of the interview (see Chapter 1 ). In general, the more severely ill a psychiatric patient is, the more likely it is that his or her capacity for insight will be impaired. In order more fully to explore these constructs of insight and judgment, this chapter introduces the concepts of defense mechanisms and personality. These factors may adversely impact on decision making and insight, even in the setting of intact language and cognition. Although there are slightly different psycho-analytic views about defense mechanisms and their definitions, we have chosen to mostly rely on Vallaint’s (1977) descriptions. Even though specific personality styles or disorders are not documented in the MSE (but, rather, in the Assessment section of a written psychiatric evaluation because they represent diagnoses), predominant defense mechanisms should be described in the Insight and Judgment section of the MSE if they impact on the patient’s capacity for attaining adequate insight and judgment about his or her illness and life events.",

      "title": "Team Design Characteristics",
      "abstract": "Teams are a basic building block of organizations. Over the past twenty-five years, a great deal of research has focused on what can be done to improve team effectiveness. Team design characteristics represent inputs that can be manipulated by organizational leaders and can be grouped into three broad classifications: Team Composition, Team Task Design Characteristics, and Team Leadership. The first team design characteristic—composition—focuses on the attributes of individuals who are team members and is generally captured either as the average standing on a particular trait such as mental ability or as a pattern of a characteristic such as the variability in team member conscientiousness. Teams composed of members with desirable traits generally outperform teams composed of members who do not possess desirable individual characteristics. Members with negative individual characteristics harm cooperation and are often rejected by teammates. The impact of some team members—frequently labeled the strategic core—is, however, greater than the impact of others. Team Member Diversity of individual characteristics also corresponds with team processes and outcomes, although the effect is positive in some instances and negative in others. A particularly difficult methodological issue associated with team composition research concerns missing data that occurs when some team members fail to complete survey measures. The second team design feature—team task characteristics—arises from the work itself and how the team accomplishes its prescribed tasks. Some teams have a high level of collective autonomy whereas others work under strict hierarchical control. Teams vary in interdependence with some operating such that members work together very closely and others allowing members to work primarily as individuals. Differences in reward structure also vary from teams that are rewarded collectively to teams with individual-based rewards that result in some members being rewarded more than others. Moreover, an increasingly important task feature of teams is the degree of virtuality, with some teams interacting primarily face-to-face and others interacting mostly through electronic means. The third team design feature is leadership. Teams are facilitated by Empowering Leadership that encourages the team to collectively lead itself, by Shared Leadership that exists when leadership functions are dispersed throughout the team, and by Transformational Leadership that provides teams with a vision that transcends individual interests.",

      "abstract": "Representations of “age” vary according to context, and are based on a set of values and references that give a meaning to life. Knowing and understanding both this context and its social and environmental determinants can help to use them better in the interest of the person concerned. Among the various indicators of aging, walking speed seems to give a first overall assessment of a potential or incipient fragility, which also helps to remind that it is never too late to start a physical activity... The “cognitive reserve” will become weaker with age, but it may be increased by cognitive stimulation, to offer to any senior: card games, crossword puzzles, various social or intellectual, activities etc. Cognitive stimulation appears to be associated with a reduced risk of dementia (Alzheimer’s or other). It would thus be a specific role, different from the promotion of physical activity and nutritional counseling.",

      "title": "Distinguishing It from Other Things Called Empathy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Empathic concern is distinguished from and related to seven other psychological phenomena that have been called empathy. The seven are: knowing what another is thinking and feeling (e.g., empathic accuracy); matching another’s posture, expression, or neural state (motor mimicry, imitation; perception-action model); coming to feel as another feels (emotional contagion); intuiting yourself into another’s situation (projection); imagining how another is affected by his or her situation (an imagine-other perspective); imagining how you would think and feel in another’s situation (an imagine-self perspective); and having a general disposition to think about and/or feel for others (trait empathy). Each of these phenomena can at times facilitate feeling empathic concern, but none always does. Whether any of these phenomena increases motivation to promote another’s welfare independent of its effect on empathic concern remains an open question.",

Ten conceivable states of affairs are described, which if proved to contribute to or be indicated by measured intelligence would legitimize the assertion that a statement about someone's intelligence can help to explain their degree of success at mental tasks. These are that level of intelligence is reliably related to (1) observable physiological variables, (2) variability in basic mental processing mechanisms, (3) the capacity to learn or remember, (4) fundamental thinking skills, (5) the ability to reason abstractly, (6) the complexity of a person's cognitive functioning, (7) adaptability or mental flexibility, (8) executive controlling functions, or (9) unspecified biological mechanisms, or (10) that indications of measured intelligence level precisely identify intellectual qualities that an individual possesses. The evidence fails to provide firm confirmation of the existence of any of these 10 states of affairs, indicating that measures of intelligence level have little or no explanatory value.",

One of these, the transient emotional state of boredom, is likely to be experienced by nearly everyone from time to time and is the primary focus of this chapter. The workplace may predispose to such episodes of boredom when autonomy is low, tasks lack personal meaning or are too simple or too complex, and performers find that attention is effortful or their minds wander. Bored individuals attempt to down-regulate their negative emotional state in a variety of ways, some of which are helpful and others harmful to themselves and/or the organization.",

      "abstract": "Impaired cognition and mobility are common in older adults and they often coexist due to shared pathophysiology.1 Worldwide, one new case of dementia is detected every 3 s.2 Exercise improves cognitive function and reduces the risk of mobility disability and falls.3–5Leaders in physical activity and exercise research are aiming to delineate what (e.g., type, duration, frequency and intensity) exercise should be recommended and when (e.g., midlife versus late life) it is best done for promoting cognitive and mobility outcomes in healthy individuals and in those at risk for cognitive impairment. Two other key questions are how (e.g., neurotrophic factors, cardiovascular fitness) and for whom (e.g., biological sex, gender) does exercise benefit cognition and mobility. Understanding mediators (i.e., how) could help maximise gains by enhancing intervention elements that impact key mechanisms at lower cost and/or risk. Identifying moderators (e.g., who, when)—factors that either attenuate or amplify the effects of exercise—will enable precise recommendations for individuals with similar characteristics (i.e., subgroups).In this two-part editorial series, we focus on for whom factors that may moderate the effect of exercise on cognitive function and mobility outcomes. In Part 1, we focus on biological sex and gender. Biological sex is defined as the genetics, gonadal hormones and phenotype resulting from XX versus XY chromosomes. Gender refers to the social, environmental, cultural and behavioural factors that influence individual actions and experiences. In Part 2, …",

      "title": "Precedent-Based Learning: An Approach for Studio Pedagogy in the Early Years",
      "abstract": "Precedent-Based learning is related to a very old method of teaching, particularly in the studio setting. Usually it takes the form of precedent analysis. An empirical study was conducted in order to better understand how experienced designers use precedents in the course of a brief design session. Normative theories of learning suggest that success is most likely to be achieved when students learn (1) the principles governing events or phenomenon in a discipline, and (2) ways of applying these principles to specific situations to solve problems of various kinds. We call this the didactic method. In the didactic approach there is a systematic representation of the fundamental principles of knowledge that identify a specific domain upon which a corpus of applications or problem-solving skills can be constructed. In fields that deal with professional practice, for example design, instruction appears to deviate from this pattern in significant ways. Students are rarely given robust principles (ones that hold in different contexts), let alone immutable ones, upon which they can construct designs that can be judged unequivocally or without error. Instead they are given plenty of precedents from which to learn a variety of heuristics. This type of knowledge is fundamentally tacit, situated in a context of extra-domain information, and involving pedagogy that is principally experiential. In architectural curricula, the experiential approach to learning is omnipresent. Descriptions of design instruction, or for that matter, architectural curricula within which such instruction is found, are invariably of an indirect kind. They describe the stylistic or formal attributes of the architecture that is promoted by the particular pedagogy in order to explain its characteristics, principles and techniques [5,7,8,11,19].",

In cases where deterioration in capacity is possible or even likely, it is good practice to try and support a person to make any one-off decisions or involve him in advance care planning as early as possible when he is most likely to still have capacity. Capacity to make one-off decisions may also need to be re-assessed, especially if the person's circumstances have changed. As with deteriorating conditions, it is good practice when writing the record of the capacity assessment to state that it is possible the person may regain capacity to make this decision in the future and, therefore, capacity may need to be re-assessed at a further date. Capacity is not necessarily stable and can change over time, either due to a deteriorating, improving or fluctuating underlying condition impacting on decision-making.",

      "abstract": "Numerous research projects converge on the conclusion that there are three major types of very good or highly responsive hypnotic subjects: (a) fantasy-prone individuals who have secretly spent much of their time since childhood fantasizing vividly and realistically; (b) amnesia-prone individuals who have developed special abilities for mentally repressing or compartmentalizing undesired memories, thoughts, and emotions; and (c) positively-set individuals who are maximally ready to cooperate, think-with, and imagine what is suggested to the best of their ability while letting go of contrary thoughts. The major principle that provides a deep understanding of hypnosis and hypnotic phenomena is that all hypnotic subjects are affected, albeit in different ways for different types of subjects, by four powerful behavior-determining factors that can be potentially maximized in hypnotic situations: (a) socialfactors that obligate the socialized subject to cooperate and try to actualize or realize the hypnotist's expectations and explicit suggestions; (b) the hypnotist's unique skills and personal characteristics (including creative ideas, communicative ability, and interpersonal efficacy) and the nature of the hypnotist-subject interpersonal relationship; (c) the effectiveness of the induction procedure in guiding the subject to think-with the suggestions; and (d) the depth of meaning, creativity, and \"force\" or \"power\" of the suggested ideas.",

So, this type of challenges cannot be considered as true stress True job stress is a condition that not only destroys employee desire to work, but also his or her energy, getting them to suffer both emotionally and physically.

Personal belief about capabilities to complete the task successfully show the behavioral choices, persistance, perforamnce and attitude. It helps to explain why people differ widely even having same knowledge, skills and abilities. Will I succeed or fail? Will I be liked or laughed at? Should I do it or not? Answers of these questions are based on personal efficacy (competence). Expectations of success or failure at a particular task is influenced by the sense of self-efficay in that area. High self-efficacy students engage in more effective self-regulatory strategies at each level of ability. High self-efficacy has been demonstrated by high academic achievement. On the contrary, low self-efficay destroy the personality that leads to anxiety, depression and other negative traits. Some low self-efficacious students give up on or never begin a task that leads to failure. 264 students of secondary classes from private and government high schools of Rawalpindi were randomly selected to administer a self-prepared 21 item Likert scale. Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient was applied by using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The results showed that academic achievement was associated with sense of self-efficacy. Self-efficacious students are competent to approach difficult tasks to take mastery. High self-efficacious students show their competency as they put required effort to get their targets. They are able to solve even more difficult problems. Self-efficacy increases the self competency among students.",

Tomadas por separado, estas decisiones son pequenas, por lo que es facil perderlas de vista. Y cuando ello ocurre, se puede desarrollar una brecha entre nuestros compromisos y nuestras convicciones. Los autores no juzgan el valor del contenido de esos compromisos personales. Han elaborado una herramienta neutral que le ayudara a inventariar exhaustivamente lo que mas le importa a usted. Para ello tiene que enumerar sus propios valores mas importantes y asignar a cada uno un porcentaje de su salario anual, las horas que le dedica a la semana, y la cantidad de energia que le dispensa. Al utilizar este ejercicio, deberia ser capaz de identificar las grandes brechas: valores declarados que reciben poco o nada de sus recursos, o un solo valor que absorbe una cantidad desproporcionadamente alta de ellos. Y con eso sera capaz de reajustar la asignacion de su tiempo, dinero y energia.",

      "abstract": "An important condition of the effective process of professional personal development is professional self-consciousness. It manifests in various forms related to the cognitive, emotional and volitional aspects of human mental activity.The educating process of professional self-consciousness is complicated and controversial. It involves many factors, the action of which can often lead to opposite consequences.The purpose of the article is a theoretical analysis of the structural components of professional self-consciousness, definition of the formational stages and evaluation criteria.Professional self-consciousness is a complex mental formation of a person, which is self-awareness of involvement in the profession, encourages professional self-realization and orients the person to active work in the professional field.We can distinguish three stages of professional self-consciousness formation: the stage of early professional self-consciousness that develops during the game (childhood), adolescent professional self-consciousness, characterized by prioritization in choosing future profession (middle and senior school age) and the stage of mature professional self-consciousness (university period, professional activity).The formation of professional self-consciousness at these stages is quite conditional because not every child has professional preferences. Every person following appropriate work can simultaneously form traits that reflect the characteristics of different stages of professional self-consciousness.We can distinguish three main criteria of different levels of professional students self-consciousness: cognitive, motivational-valued and activity-practical, which reveals the presence or absence of certain features that characterize professional self-consciousness.These criteria for assessing the levels of professional self-consciousness make possibility to establish the degree of presence of certain personality traits that are indicators of professional self-consciousness of each phenomenon component: a personʼs attitude to the profession, attitude to himself as a subject, to colleagues, to the object of labour.&#x0D; Keywords: self-consciousness; professional self-consciousness; structural components; formation system; stages of formation; self-awareness; evaluation criteria; levels of development; performance indicators.",

      "abstract": "WHO (2020) had noted that \"Anxiety, uneasiness, and stress are usual reactions to perceived threat or real threats, as well as it also occurs when we experience any uncertainty or unfamiliar situation(s).\" Thus, it is very much expected that individuals may experience the fear of losing their job during pandemic situation. As global GDP is continuously shrinking and many businesses are facing financial crises, which is also reflected in employee turnover. So many employees are struggling for retaining their jobs which in turn exceeds their working hours, inflexible weekly holidays, excessive workload, etc. (Nicholas Bloom, 2020), which is hampering employees' work-life balance (Kang, 2020) and resulting in stress (Hamouche Salima, 2020). So to keep the employee's morale high and keep them stress-free business, professionals specifically HR personnel have strategically planned their employees' activities to achieve business targets without challenging employees' physical and mental fitness. This chapter has given a detailed 216outline about how corporates were taking care of their employees with respect to managing their work-life and occupational stress, different activities which they planned during pandemic to keep their employees happy and stress-free, also implementation of NEW NORMAL in the current working environment.",

In the model, players work together to achieve a breakthrough in a project while facing a deadline. The target effort needed to achieve a breakthrough is unknown, but the players have a common prior about its distribution. I characterize the equilibrium and the effort path that maximizes the team’s welfare for general distributions of this target effort and show that three effects are at work: free-riding (i.e., working less), last-minute rush (i.e., working later), and a past-effort effect (i.e., working more if others worked more in the past). This past-effort effect increases or decreases the amount of work players put into the project, depending on the type of project faced.",

Work is energy directed by human beings to create value. But people are imperfect—we make mistakes, and sometimes we lose control of the work. Therefore, work is the use of force under conditions of uncertainty. A Critical Step is a human action that will trigger immediate, irreversible, and intolerable harm to an asset, if that action or a preceding action is performed improperly. Whether the human action involves clicking on a link attached to an e-mail message, walking down a flight of stairs with a newborn baby in arms, engaging the clutch on a gasoline-driven chain saw, or administering a medication to a patient in a hospital, these all satisfy the definition of what constitutes critical risks in our daily lives, professionally or personally. The overarching goal of managing Critical Steps is to maximize the success (safety, reliability, productivity, quality, profitability, etc.) of people's performance in the workplace, to create value for the organization without losing control of built-in hazards necessary to create that value.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Concern with needs of dying patients too often leads to neglect of corresponding needs of staff members who work with them. This paper describes how motivation of staff to work with dying patients can effect the job stress they encounter. It is suggested that staff often choose to work with the dying for one of six reasons: accident or convenience, a desire to do the \"in thing\" or to affiliate with a charismatic leader, intellectual appeal and a desire for mastery over pain and death, a sense of \"calling,\" previous personal experience, and a suspicion that one might some day develop the disease. Each motivation may lead to its own particular forms of stress. In addition, constant exposure to the dying can effect one's personal life and relationships with family members and friends. A number of suggestions are given for coping with job stress including: understanding one's own limits, maintaining a balanced personal life, and developing effective support systems on and off the job.",

      "title": "Bystander Training within Organizations",
      "abstract": "Although this kind of training appears to have started with respect to topics like safety and diversity, training for active bystanders is pertinent to many kinds of behavior. Training materials have been developed by a number of people (e.g., Aguilar, 2006; Scully, 2005). Who is a bystander? A bystander could be anyone who sees or otherwise becomes aware of behavior that appears worthy of comment or action. In the past, much workplace training has focused mainly on three cohorts: 1) people who do or say something (whether positive or negative) that might merit a response, and 2) people who are impacted by what is said or done, and 3) supervisors. There is a fourth cohort that is also important: there may be one or more bystanders present, who can influence the workplace climate. Bystanders can highlight positive acts that might otherwise be invisible or overlooked. They can redirect or de-escalate negative acts that might be problematic. Bystanders might be peers or teammates. They might be subordinate or senior to the person whose comment or behavior warrants reaction. Training that encourages “active bystanders” takes into account the different power dynamics and contexts that may be involved. Encouraging the positive Bystander training is designed to help people in all cohorts to note—and to commend—the achievements of their fellow workers. Such commendations often matter a lot to the person concerned and are thought to be useful in encouraging future, socially desirable behavior. (See Goldstein, Martin, and Cialdini (2008), and Patterson, Grenny, Maxfield, McMillan and Switzler, (2007) on effective persuasion and influence tactics). The hope is that training may help workers in all job categories to be good mentors to colleagues who need a bit of information or help—and for everyone who would be delighted by a word of encouragement. The hypothesis is that “on the spot” help and affirmation from bystanders may be especially effective because it is an immediate, positive, often unexpected reinforcement. (See Blanchard’s (1982) classic discussion of the “one minute manager” for similar reasoning.) Discouraging the negative",

      "title": "THE RHETORIC OF SKILL REQUIREMENTS",
      "abstract": "The of skill is a way of describing work by decomposing the human contribution into distinct components. Three important characteristics of this rhetoric are especially germane to an understanding of work. The first characteristic is that jobs and their incumbents can be fully analyzed by breaking them down into skills. Three challenges to the adequacy of the concept of skill are as follows: (1) the rhetoric decomposes a job into skills but leaves unanswered how this bundle of .skills is articulated into a skilled worker; (2) it seemingly removes the person as a concrete actor from the discussion of work; and (3) it explains outcomes in the workplace by explicating the skills people do or do not have. The second characteristic is that skills are in some obvious way. Three lessons may be drawn from workplace examples: (1) skills are labeled as important or requir,,d by people for specific reasons; (2) the sense in which a skill is required can be unclear; and (3) skill requirements are not derived in any simple way from asking people about their jobs or observing them at work. The third characteristic is that context is peripheral to skill. Workplace experience shows that context affects the opportunities that workers have to exercise skills and their motivations to do so and context need not be a simple backdrop to action. Context should be incorporated into the rhetoric of skill reanirements to provide a clearer understanding of what is involved in 'work.

      "title": "Target complicity in the confirmation and disconfirmation of erroneous perceiver expectations: Immediate and longer term implications.",
      "abstract": "The authors explored the role o f target self-presentational goals in the expectation confirmation process within the context of simulated employment interviews. As predicted, applicants encouraged to be deferential inadvertently succumbed to their interviewers' expectations; applicants encouraged to be challenging, t o advance their own agenda, did not. The challenging-motivated applicants succeeded in disconfirming negative expectations by presenting favorable information about themselves even in the face of negatively constraining interviewer questions; other theoretically relevant behaviors were not supported as mediators. Of added interest, the self-fulfilling prophecies observed for the deference-motivated applicants carried over to a 2nd interview because of changes in applicant self-perceptions following the 1st interview. People frequently hold expectations about what others are going to be like. When expectations are accurate, representing reasonably well others' personalities, abilities, or behavioral propensities, they help people prepare appropriately for social encounters. When expectations are inaccurate, however, as when based on incorrect social stereotypes or third-party hearsay, using them can have significant costs, as even erroneous expectations may greatly transform the way people think about and interact with others. Inaccurate expectations may serve as perceptual and interpretive filters, leading people to view others' ambiguous behaviors as expectation-consistent instead (for reviews, see Fiske & Neuberg, 1990; Hamilton, Sherman, & Ruvulo, 1990; Higgins & Bargh, 1987). They may also create self-fulfilling prophecies (Merton, 1948), whereby people cause others to behave in ways objectively consistent with their expectations (for reviews, see Darley & Fazio, 1980; Jussim, 1986; Miller & Turnbull, 1986; Neuberg, 1996b; Rosenthal & Rubin, 1978: Snyder, 1984). Much research has focused o n the behavioral mechanisms through which perceivers create self-fulfilling prophecies. Two mediating processes stand out as particularly important. First, a perceiver may express a tone, based on his or her expectation,",

      "abstract": "What is the time course of attention? Research using rapid-stimulus streams has suggested that it is rather slow: Attention takes half a second to recover from processing one thing before it can process the next. This period is referred to as the attentional blink, and it is thought to reflect a fundamental bottleneck in conscious processing. If this period does exist, such a limitation would have severe consequences in real-life situations in which multiple events may rapidly succeed each other (e.g., in traffic). However, findings that support the attentional blink are at odds with other findings indicating that attention is not reduced, but enhanced, following potentially important occurrences. The article reviews evidence that these opposite effects are actually closely related. The attentional blink is a consequence of selection mechanisms that are not severely limited, but have an adaptive function: They enhance perception in response to relevant information but suppress perception in response to irrelevant information. It means that humans are better geared for real life than was previously thought.",

      "title": "Thinking and curriculum",
      "abstract": "Exploring thinking It is interesting wonder about situations and consider whether thinking is involved in each, and when it is, what forms of thinking are involved, and whether they are significant education. Consider following: solving a mathematics problem, following a recipe, doing dishes, writing a story, remembering a past event, feeling sorry for someone, watching a sunset, listening music, and breathing. All these involve conscious, subconscious or unconscious brain processing, but whether they involve thinking depends on how one defines thinking--in particular, whether only conscious brain processing should be considered in that definition. For me, it seems difficult separate conscious and nonconscious thinking. Nonconscious thinking can be made conscious with development of awareness (which itself can be considered be a form of thinking). Thinking within education more often has a focus on critical, creative or metacognitive. While these might provide starting points for trying define thinking, it is difficult categorise situations, such as those above, in terms of these forms. thinking is not limited these forms, and different forms often overlap in any single activity. I would like define thinking as continuous multitask processing that is inherent in every aspect of our existing, knowing and doing while we are alive. I do appreciate, however, practicality of a definition of thinking for education that limits it conscious aspects of such processing. Traditionally, from a theoretical perspective, brain has often been compared a machine with inputs and outputs. From a systems approach, it is more appropriate, as Minsky (as cited in Varela, Thompson, & Rosch, 1991) explains, consider brain as using its processes change itself--which means that processes cannot be separated from products. For example, brains make memories, which change subsequent thinking. such a view of brain makes no mention of representation, and reflects operational closure in which the results of its processes are those processes themselves (Varela et al., 1991, p. 139). Thinking also links with philosophy and its three cornerstones: being (ontology), knowing (epistemology) and acting (ethics). Some philosophers give these different weightings, but I see them as interrelated aspects of thinking that are all relevant in domains in which we function (for example, physical, personal, social, ecological and abstract domains). I concur with statement that to live is know (Maturana & Varela, 1987, p. 174), and, for me, this implies that living/ being, knowing/learning and acting/doing are all inseparably linked with thinking. One can extend my notion of thinking and ask, Does an animal, plant, a stone and world itself think? Philosophers such as Spinoza saw thought as an inherent aspect of substance (Stevenson, 2005, p. 163) and this notion has appeal for many deep ecological philosophers (Naess, 2008, pp. 230-251). For me, it is not only people who are in a state of being, knowing and acting (and I consider animals and plants be complex, emerging living systems that are self-organising, comprised of subsystems and nested within bigger systems such as cultures and societies) but it is whether they think or not that is problematic. My view is that more is needed than just traditional views of thinking when considering school curriculum. I see a need include personal, social, cultural and ecosystem thinking. Justifying thinking in education While we think all time, and we learn think without being taught do so, our thinking skills can be improved. If this is seen as desirable, then considering it from an educational perspective requires a change of focus within schools. Such a change needs be justified from numerous perspectives in order convince policy makers and educators support changes. …",

During the empirical study it has been established that along with a sensitive type (where all components of sensitivity appear at a high level), more often than others, students of psychological and pedagogical areas of training have an emotional-altruistic type, which indicates an insufficient development of interest in another and understanding a person, as well as an intuitive type that is associated with difficulties in understanding the inner world of another. In addition, an insensitive type often manifests itself, representatives of which demonstrate an insufficient level of formation of all components of sensitivity to humans. The results obtained can be used in organizing educational work at the university, as well as in the process of developing special programs to form sensitivity to another person among future teachers and psychologists.",

      "title": "A Hierarchical Modular Architecture for Embodied Cognition",
      "abstract": "Cognition can appear complex owing to the fact that the brain is capable of an enormous repertoire of behaviors. However, this complexity can be greatly reduced when constraints of time and space are taken into account. The brain is constrained by the body to limit its goal-directed behaviors to just a few independent tasks over the scale of 1–2 min, and can pursue only a very small number of independent agendas. These limitations have been characterized from a number of different vantage points such as attention, working memory and dual task performance. It may be possible that the disparate perspectives of all these methodologies can be unified if behaviors can be seen as modular and hierarchically organized. From this vantage point, cognition can be seen as having a central problem of scheduling behaviors to achieve short term goals. Thus dual-task paradigms can be seen as studying the concurrent management of simultaneous, competing agendas. Attention can be seen as focusing on the decision as to whether to interrupt the current agenda or persevere. Working memory can be seen as the bookkeeping necessary to manage the state of the current active agenda items.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Unconscious influences permeate the everyday life of consumers. The scope of unconscious influences is greatly enhanced when the operational definition of “unconscious” shifts from the anachronistic “subliminal” one—whether the person is aware of the triggering information itself—to the far more common situation of being unaware of the influence of that stimulus. People are often unaware of how external events influence their choices and behavior, which is a good reason not to rely on self‐report measures of mediating internal mental processes. What are the main forms of mundane unconscious influence? (1) The person's primary evolved needs and motives and active goal pursuits, which operate unconsciously to exert a transformative effect on selective attention, preferences, and purchases, and consumption. These can be triggered through common external means such as grocery store handouts and emails from the boss. (2) Immediate preconscious perceptual inputs from the external environment influence seemingly “free” conscious choices. Finally, (3) postconscious processes have the same effects but come from the carry‐over of conscious experiences from one situation into the next. This is the domain of “nudges” or “priming effects” with many field studies as well as meta‐analyses demonstrating their validity and replicability.",

      "abstract": "Mathematical problem solving is a process involving metacognitive (e.g., judging progress), cognitive (e.g., working memory), and affective (e.g., math anxiety) factors. Recent research encourages researchers who study math cognition to consider the role that the interaction between metacognition and math anxiety plays in mathematical problem solving. Problem solvers can make many metacognitive judgments during a math problem, ranging from global judgments such as, \"Do I care to solve this problem?\" to minor cue-based judgments such as, \"Is my current strategy successful in making progress toward the correct solution?\" Metacognitive monitoring can hinder accurate mathematical problem solving when the monitoring is task-irrelevant; however, task-relevant metacognitive experiences can lead to helpful control decisions in mathematical problem solving such as checking work, considering plausibility of an answer, and considering alternate strategies. Worry and negative thoughts (i.e., math anxiety) can both interfere with the accuracy of metacognitive experiences as cues in mathematical problem solving and lead to avoidance of metacognitive control decisions that could otherwise improve performance. The current paper briefly reviews and incorporates prior literature with current qualitative reports (n = 673) to establish a novel framework of regulated attention in mathematical problem solving (RAMPS).",

      "abstract": "A difficult task in creating rich, exploratory interactive learning environments is building an environment that is truly engaging. Engagement can be defined as the nexus of intrinsic knowledge and/or interest and external stimuli that promote the initial interest in, and continued use of a computer-based learning environment. Complete and total involvement in a given task is described by Csikszentmihalyi's Flow Theory. Flow Theory defines the difference between enjoyment and pleasure; an optimal experience is more of a manifestation of the former. The following elements of flow are manifested in computer games and learning environments: (1) task that can be completed; (2) ability to concentrate on task; (3) task has clear goals; (4) task provides immediate feedback; (5) deep but effortless involvement; (6) exercising a sense of control over actions; (7) concern for self disappears during flow, but sense of self is stronger after flow activity; and (8) sense of duration of time is altered. The quality of multimedia assets such as images, sounds, and animations, are a key factor in interesting users in a computer game; this is an important issue in the design and development of educational software. A table shows the relationships among flow, games, and design of computer-based learning environments. Contains 14 references.

The processes that facilitate or impede conflict management among stepsiblings were explored. The 25 stepchildren in the sample had 71 stepsiblings, but they did not experience conflicts with all of them. Three conditions necessary for conflict to occur were: (1) opportunity (i.e., shared time, shared space, ability to interact), (2) intimacy (i.e., perceived closeness between stepsiblings, close friendship or familiarity), and (3) similarity (i.e., age, gender, or role in family). Sources of conflict included: (1) behaviors of a stepsibling, (2) violations of territory (e.g., bedrooms), (3) differential treatment by step/parents, and (4) disputes over resources. Stepsiblings used more than one conflict management strategy if the source of conflict was deemed important or if the relationship had developed to a level of intimacy in which they felt they could engage in more direct strategies. Strategies used to manage conflict among stepsiblings included both intrapersonal and interpersonal processes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Boring activities are not always avoidable. Yet, one can ask: Is boredom inevitable? Studies in the field of interest self-regulation suggest that it might be possible to transcend boredom and enhance motivation through the use of interest-enhancing strategies (IESs). The goal of this project is to build a model of interest and motivation self-regulation in the context of individual sports. Four IESs are examined: creating challenges for oneself, adding variety to the task, providing oneself with self-relevant rationales for performing the task, and exploiting stimulation from other sources than the task itself. The proposed model comprises the following hypotheses: (a) IESs predict higher levels of interest, in both interesting and less interesting tasks; (b) Interest in ''less interesting'' tasks predicts higher levels of self-determined extrinsic motivation; and (c) Interest in ''interesting'' tasks and self-determined extrinsic motivation predict higher levels of intrinsic motivation. Although exploiting stimulation displayed an unexpected direct negative relation with extrinsic motivation, the remainder of the results supports the proposed hypotheses. The discussion offers suggestions for future research on the role played by self-influence in the regulation of interest and motivation.",

      "abstract": "This book is predicated on the relatively uncontentious notions that discourse patterns – what people do when they talk or write – can provide trained observers with information about cognitive functions and affective states in speakers and, further, that cognitive functions and affective states may be signs of integrity of neurological function and structure. Neurolinguists, psycholinguists, aphasiologists, psychiatrists, psychotherapists and speech pathologists all take some variation on assumptions like this as their point of departure in studying brain–behaviour relationships and treating some neurological and affective disorders. However, discourse – people's talk and text – is inherently complex and apparently unstable and, worse, the neurological substrate and processes that support even superficially simple things like ‘how words are represented in the brain’, let alone ‘what happens in brains when people talk’ are matters of active debate and investigation rather than scientific givens. In the face of so much uncertainty and complexity, most of the work done on language–brain relationships has, very sensibly, centred on theoretically discrete and/or methodologically isolatable phenomena associated with particular semantic, morphosyntactic or phonological structures or processes. Work on discourse in clinical environments as another means of investigating neurocognitive (dys-)function, although often called for, has been less common.",

To encourage increased participation in exercise among elderly people, and to emphasize the value of exercise in geriatric health care, this article provides an overview of the effects of primary care based physical activity on healthy aging. It is clear from the number of recently published papers on this topic that daily participation in 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity should be recommended for elderly people. The results of physical activity interventions focusing on balance and resistance training in both home- and group-based exercises suggest that it is possible to improve physical functions and to prevent falls and disabilities in daily living. Multiple-element interventions (e. g., advice, as well as strategies to increase self-efficacy and motivation, and to eliminate barriers to participation), tailored to individual activity preferences, are likely to be more successful than more prescriptive single-focus interventions. A home-based physical therapy program can successfully enhance the independence of the frail elderly in community dwellings.",

This can be possible only when it is done in the process of true learning. Learning plays a very important role on individual behaviour, to change or improve his attitude, behaviour, abilities, perceiving skills, motivate himself. Unless an organization provides learning, the employees even resist sticking to those organizations. Learning may either be explicit or tacit; it should make the employee attain true knowledge. Explicit knowledge can be written down and given to others. Tacit knowledge is acquired through observation and direct experience. An employee acquires both explicit and tacit knowledge.Majority of the people have tacit knowledge. One must be a continuous learner. Learning may not be reflected in performance, but is reflected in behaviour and also it is not confined only to schooling.In today's society, it is lack off even at schooling also. Even at school level also it is becoming difficult to identify a student who is a good learner, who possesses discipline, values, morals, knowledge that should be for that age and good standards. The present paper discusses about the true leaning, different types of learning, knowledge, the extent to which it shows influence on the behavior, improve the thinking abilities, and finally manage learnt and attained knowledge to practicality and get it applicable to life situations and analyze it in a right and proper way.",

Some individuals are often found to be dissatisfied in the work they are doing and are not properly adjusted, to the work environment leading to frustration, state of stress, diminished productivity, etc. An Unfavourable attitude of any individual is not conducive for the work culture in any organization.  Efforts must consciously be made by educational institutions to work towards developing a positive attitude towards work in their students. If this can be done in the institution, it can be expected that there would be a transfer of this in the work situation. The success or failure of a person in a vocation depends upon, many others factors including satisfaction one derives from the vocation. satisfaction results from working in harmony with one’s own potentialities, strengths, weaknesses, etc. A well organized system of vocational information readily available to students and set up which encourages students and trains them to find out the available information about careers, from the basis for the choice of vocational e strategies.",

      "abstract": "“Intellectual styles” refers to people’s preferred ways of processing information and dealing with cognitive and other tasks. Styles comprise an all-embracing way of understanding such constructs as cognitive styles, learning approaches, career personality types, thinking styles, teaching styles, and many others—constructs with or without the word “style.” The field of intellectual styles has a history of more than eight decades. Until the early 21st century, however, the field was constantly struggling with its identity as a result of three major challenges: (a) the lack of a common language and a conceptual framework with which work on styles could be understood, (b) the difficulty in distinguishing styles from intelligence/abilities and personality traits, and (c) the ambiguity concerning the link between work on styles and work in other fields. This identity crisis was exacerbated by three principal controversial issues regarding the nature of intellectual styles: whether styles are distinct constructs or similar constructs that overlap with one another but have different labels; whether styles represent traits or states, or whether they have elements of both; and whether styles are value free or value laden (i.e., some styles are more desirable than others in terms of human learning and performance). Over the years, the aforementioned difficulties inherent in intellectual styles impeded the progress of the field and confused both practitioners and the general public. Despite these and other difficulties, the field has flourished since the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Concerted attempts at theoretical conceptualizations have given some degree of unity to disparate bodies of literature. At the same time, tens of thousands of empirical investigations based on a wide range of style models and carried out in diverse populations across the globe have consistently demonstrated the critical roles that styles play in various domains of human lives. Undoubtedly, the existing literature has proved that intellectual styles are real, distinct psychological phenomena. Moreover, research findings have scientific value as well as practical implications for human learning and performance. Nevertheless, for the field to prosper further, several major limitations with the existing work must be overcome, and investigations that take into account the fast-changing world need to be initiated.",

However, it is not sufficient, even if an individual chooses to participate voluntarily in research process, for the researchers to be able to claim that they have obtained informed consent. The consent must be of sufficiently ‘high quality’: it must not only be informed, but also valid, i.e., it must contain the following three elements: adequate information, voluntariness, and competence. Although preparing informed consent is a difficult process in general, it is particularly challenging when working with certain populations, such as clinical groups who have language and literacy difficulties, e.g., dyslexia. A lack of understanding of the basis and specific characteristics of this disorder can have negative effects on people with dyslexia (PwD) such as in the form of unwanted misunderstandings, psychological stress, negative effects on their learning processes, as well as unethical treatment in the research process. Studies have shown that PwD can be particularly vulnerable to research that might exploit, imply, or attribute unsafe practices to them and their difficulties, especially in connection with research recommendations that require written informed consent. Easy language refers to the language adaptation of a text to facilitate both reading and comprehension, particularly for PwD. Therefore, the use of the easy language guidelines for language adaptation and graphical adjustment is important when obtaining informed consent from PwD.",

Demasiado a menudo, ellas son tipicas de la forma con que se toman ?o no se toman? las pequenas y grandes decisiones a lo largo de una organizacion. La incapacidad de tomar una accion resuelta esta arraigada en la cultura de una empresa. Los lideres crean esta cultura de indecision, sostiene Charan, y pueden terminar con ella haciendo tres cosas: primero, deben generar honestidad intelectual en las conexiones entre personas; segundo, deben asegurarse de que los mecanismos operativos de tipo social ?las reuniones, revisiones y otras situaciones mediante las cuales las personas hacen negocios? tienen al dialogo honesto en el centro; y tercero, los lideres deben asegurarse de que el feedback y el seguimiento sean usados para recompensar a las personas de alto desempeno, deben hacer coaching a quienes tienen dificultades y desalentar a aquellos cuyo comportamiento esta obstaculizando el progreso de la organizacion.

L’alternative proposee a ces etudes consiste a travailler selon la methodologie des cas unique ou multiple en partant du pragmatisme des plaintes des patients, pour mettre en oeuvre des interventions centrees sur les activites specifiques de la vie quotidienne mettant en jeu les aspects fonctionnels alteres. L’objectif de cette these a ete d’etudier l’efficacite d’une telle demarche. Deux prises en charge individualisees et une prise en charge de groupe ont ete elaborees. Une premiere etude visait a optimiser la realisation des activites particulieres de la vie professionnelle du sujet a travers l’accroissement de l’efficacite de deux sous-composantes de la Memoire de Travail ; les deux autres etudes se sont focalisees sur les aspects executifs de la memoire episodique verbale et ont inclus une strategie organisationnelle de l’encodage visant a promouvoir les operations de comprehension et de structuration de l’information, dans le but d’optimiser la realisation d’activites de la vie quotidienne (lectures, conversations, sorties culturelles, suivi de programmes TV). Les resultats temoignent de l’efficacite et de la specificite de chacune de ces interventions. Un suivi a long terme a permis d’objectiver une stabilite dans le maintien des acquis et un transfert durable des differents apprentissages dans la vie professionnelle et quotidienne d’un des sujets.",

      "title": "Ethics of ignorance",
      "abstract": "Moral ignorance is ignorance about the permissibility of one’s conduct. It involves both conceptual and normative issues. We could ask what it is, and we could ask when agents are culpable for it. §1 distinguishes some main forms of moral ignorance. Agents could be ignorant of different things, for example that their conduct has a certain outcome, or that they could act otherwise. Moreover, agents may be ignorant in different ways. They might never have considered the issue, or they might have considered it, but be mistaken about it. §2 asks when agent have duties to inform ourselves better and remedy their ignorance, and what these duties prescribe. A duty to question all one’s beliefs seems to provide poor advice, while a duty to reflect to some reasonable degree is insufficiently detailed, and so unhelpful. Suggested duties of inquiry enable one to comply with other duties one has, such as the duty to maximise general welfare. §3 concerns the follow-up question: if we should have informed ourselves better, then when are we culpable for failing to do so, and our ensuing ignorance? There are two rival views on this question. Volitionism says that we are culpable for our ignorance only if we were aware that we had to inform ourselves better, while attributionism says that we are culpable whenever our ignorance is due to a lack of moral concern. §4 addresses two further issues concerning the ethics of ignorance. First issue: does culpability for ignorance come in degrees, and how? Second issue: if agents are culpable for their ignorance (or rather excused), then what does this mean, i.e. what kind of culpability is at issue?",

      "abstract": "Skill acquisition can be described as a transition from reliance on instructions or general algorithms for guiding performance, to performance based on direct retrieval of the appropriate responses given the current conditions. In most cases, attention plays a vital role in skill, with the focus of the learner's attention influencing both skill acquisition and performance. Relevant information must be attended and irrelevant information ignored, and the allocation of attention across task elements is a skill in itself. There are, however, cases in which learning occurs without the explicit intention of the learner, and some learning may occur without the involvement of attention. That is, not all learning is dependent on conscious mediation. Procedural memory, a memory system that underlies knowledge of how to perform tasks that is not available for conscious introspection, supports the expression of skill, even when declarative memory structures are damaged. The effectiveness of learning experiences depends on how feedback is attended to, whether task requirements are repeatedly called to mind, and the extent to which practiced procedures and task information are present in the actual task to be performed.",

      "abstract": "NOTA\t520\t8\t \tEs tradicional, en el campo de la cognicion, ver como se han desarrollado modelos y metodos evaluacion para las diferentes funciones cognitivas (memoria, lenguaje, funciones ejecutivas…) en los que no se termina de formalizar de una manera clara como unos procesos colaboran, o influyen en los otros. Dos de los procesos que con mayor probabilidad deben interactuar entre ellos son las funciones ejecutivas (FFEE) y la memoria. No es de extranar ya que las FFEE son un conjunto de habilidades cognitivas que optimizan los limitados recursos cognitivos de otras funciones como la atencion, lenguaje, percepcion o memoria. De hecho, nuestra habilidad interna para generar estrategias para codificar o retener la informacion dependerian del sistema ejecutivo que sirven para optimizar nuestra memoria en tareas de alta demanda o novedosas. No es un tema a ignorar, ya que tanto la FFEE como la memoria son dominios cognitivos frecuentemente senalados como marcadores de deterioro en el trastorno esquizofrenico y bipolar hasta el punto de ser considerados endofenotipos de estas patologias. Investigamos como el deficit de las FFEE no puede ser considerado independiente al deficit de memoria ya que este ultimo puede ser una consecuencia de una deficiente organizacion del material a memorizar. Una posibilidad de aportar datos sobre la interdependencia entre procesos cognitivos podria ser la utilizacion de tareas duales. Dentro de ellas, podemos considerar el uso Test de Estrategias de Memoria (TEM), que fue disenado como una herramienta para la evaluacion del efecto de la funcion ejecutiva en el rendimiento de los procesos de memoria. A lo largo de sus 5 condiciones, los sujetos van recibiendo ayuda del evaluador (estrategias) con el fin de optimizar su rendimiento en memoria. Este efecto podria ser importante de evaluar en pacientes con afectacion de las FFEE que tuviesen problemas a la hora de generar estrategias internas. El presente trabajo describe, a traves del TEM, tanto la influencia de las FFEE en los procesos de memoria en pacientes afectados de esquizofrenia y trastorno bipolar, como las propiedades psicometricas del dicho test (calculando su fiabilidad y propiedades a traves del modelo clasico y de la Teoria de Respuesta al Item) y su relacion las otras pruebas neuropsicologicas tanto en sujetos sin patologia como en sujetos con patologias psiquiatricas asociadas a disfuncion ejecutiva. Tambien y dado su uso generalizado en la evaluacion cognitiva, en este trabajo, tambien evaluamos la relacion entre las FFEE y las pruebas de fluencia verbal, asi como los limites que presentan...",

By exerting influence in spheres over which they can command some control, they are better able to realize desired futures and to forestall undesired ones. The striving for control over life circumstances permeates almost everything people do because it can secure them innumerable personal and social benefits. The ability to affect outcomes makes them predictable. Predictability fosters adoptive preparedness. Inability to exert influence over things that adversely affect one's life breeds apprehension, apathy, or despair. The capability to produce valued outcomes and to prevent undesired ones, therefore, provides powerful incentives for the development and exercise of personal control.",

      "abstract": "Addictive behaviors related to psychoactive substances are characterized by a dependence revealed by the repeated impossibility to control behavior and the continuation of the said behavior despite the subject being aware of its negative consequences. Over and beyond the significant public health issue, this topic directly concerns the world of work. Surprisingly, it remains taboo or is only approached from a moralizing angle. Should a company be the source of such behaviors or only one of the places where they are exhibited, it cannot ignore the issue. Although employers may sometimes see secondary benefits of some addictive behavior for productivity reasons (e.g. « workaholism »), this may result in a loss of efficiency of their workforce (absenteeism, accidents in the workplace, drop in productivity). Employers may be held criminally liable in the event of illicit substances being brought into the workplace. What is more, being liable for any damage or injuries caused by their employees, they must make sure they do not represent a threat to others. Last, but not least, employers are responsible for the health of their employees. This objective has been considerably strengthened by the definition of the employer’s safety obligation, by the Court of cassation, as an obligation of safety performance. In order to fulfil these obligations, employers have various control measures at their disposal and enjoy dual powers of repression and prevention. However, any action taken by the employer in the field of addiction comes up against the inalienable right to individual freedom of the employees. An employer is not omnipotent: where is the limit between the management of addictive risks in the workplace and an employee’s privacy, taking into account an employer’s obligation of safety performance.",

This 6-months period is critical to a continuing programme that encourages an active lifestyle. The participants' reasons for dropping out of programmes are many, such as the time is not right, the place is inconvenient, family and work responsibilities interfere, the exercise programme is too hard or no fun etc. Health and fitness professionals must examine all the factors of individual differences to plan programmes for adherence.",

There is a sense that boredom sometimes causes bad things to happen (e.g., substance use, self-harm) and sometimes causes good things to happen (e.g., daydreaming, creativity), but it is hard to understand what boredom does without first understanding what it is. According to the meaning-and-attentional-components (MAC) model of boredom and cognitive engagement, the emotion of boredom signals deficits in attention and meaning. Much like pain, it may not be pleasant, but boredom critically alerts us that we are unable or unwilling to successfully engage attention in meaningful activities. Whether that is good or bad rests ultimately on how we respond.",

We concentrate on job performance because it is observable and because it synchronizes with the behaviourist model of learning which figures so prominently in most thinking about training. It could well be argued that this deficiency approach is no longer adequate in our present environment in which the very nature of jobs and competences is subject to constant change.

Tentu saja perhatian secara fokus. Sehingga jika dengan suatu perhatian yang terfokus tersebut itu ilmu dapat terserap secara maksimal maka seorang siswa akan mengalami perkembangan yang cukup baik pula dan sebaliknya. Karena otak dituntut untuk berfikir dan berusaha untuk menerapkan ilmu atau yang sudah terserap melalui perhatian tadi. Kelelahan ini dapat mengakibatkan perhatian kita menjadi berkurang ataupun tidak terfokus. Saran atau sugesti bisa dikatakan sebagai penengah atau jalan keluar yang hares dilakukan ketika perhatian mulai menimbulkan kelelahan sehingga ilmu atau pengetahuan yang diserap menjadi tidak maksimal.\r\nKesimpulan yang dapat diambil dari pembahasan ini adalah bahwa terdapat hubungan antara tiga aspek jiwa campuran yakni perhatian, kelelahan dan sugesti terhadap perkembangan kejiwaan pada seorang siswa yang didapat melalui proses belajar. Penerapan pendidikan memang sangatlah penting pada jiwa campuran. Hal itu dimaksudkan agar siswa berkembang. Namun agar dapat berkembang secara maksimal memang hendaknya dibutuhkan perhatian yang baik atau terfokus.\r\nDalam proses pendidikan ternyata banyak juga dijumpai suatu kelelahan – kelelahan. Hal itu dapat terjadi mungkin dikarenakan proses pendidikan yang terlalu monoton dan kaku ataupun tuntutan harus dapat berkembang.

Comunicarse con eficacia o de manera asertiva es una clase de conducta susceptible de entrenamiento mediante procedimientos fundamentados en la Teoría del Aprendizaje Social. Como cualquier clase de conducta, consta de distintos componentes: cognitivos, emocionales y de comportamiento manifiesto (tanto verbal como no verbal), que deben ajustarse a una situación concreta para lograr su funcionalidad. Ello aumenta, a su vez, la probabilidad de alcanzar los objetivos planteados y de responder con certeza a las demandas propuestas, obteniéndose así una serie de ventajas, tanto personales como grupales y organizativas. Entre ellas, se puede destacar el alcanzar una mayor competencia social, autoestima, satisfacción personal, cohesión grupal, destreza para trabajar en equipo y una disminución de las tensiones y conflictos interpersonales y grupales. La obra que te dispones a ver, partiendo de un supuesto práctico como es la participación en una entrevista de selección de personal, pretende responder de una manera aplicada a las siguientes cuestiones: Qué son las habilidades sociales, para qué sirven, cómo se adquieren, qué clase o estilo de comunicación es más eficaz, qué técnicas son más ventajosas para su enseñanza y cómo puede beneficiar su aprendizaje. Esta obra es fruto de una larga experiencia en el desarrollo de programas de entrenamiento en habilidades sociales con y para distintos colectivos que deben afrontar situaciones difíciles y conflictivas, que requieren para su resolución el apoyo y la comunicación interpersonal y social. En su realización, no solo hemos puesto nuestro conocimiento del tema, difundido a través de monografías y artículos científico-técnicos, sino también la emoción que nos genera trabajar en un tema en el que creemos y sabemos puede ser útil para otras personas. Deseamos que disfrute utilizando esta humilde aportación al entrenamiento en habilidades sociales, tanto como nosotros realizándola.",

      "title": "Six Steps to Effective Delegation",
      "abstract": "Why delegate? The reasons to delegate work generate little disagreement: it extends the results beyond what one person can do; releases time for other tasks; develops the skills of others; puts decisions in the hands of those who are closest to the action, where facts and expertise are available; and speeds up decisions. Even though these benefits are clear, delegation is a poorly practiced skill. It may be true that you can do the task better or faster than anyone else, but, then again, you may be overestimating the uniqueness of your skills and underestimating those of others. Clearly, if you don’t break out of this trap, there is a very real limit on what you can accomplish. Recognize that feeling uncomfortable about delegation is a natural reaction; you are putting your reputation in the hands of others. One of the most difficult parts of delegating is accepting and accommodating the differences of others. Others will probably do the work differently than you would have and possibly do it better. When you accept these two aspects, you are on your way to delegating effectively.",

      "title": "The instinct to teach: Altruism or aggression?",
      "abstract": "In this paper, the term 'teaching' means activities which induce a specific change in the behavior of a member of the same species, and are adapted until the pupil reaches a certain standard of performance. Teaching in this sense is confined to man, with one group of exceptions. Other forms of social learning are observed among the mammals and even the buds. The most important is imitation, or learning by observation. Teaching by other species always involves punishment, and always leads to the separation or spacing out of individuals. It occurs 1) at weaning, 2) in maintaining status within a group, and 3) in territorial behavior. In each case an animal is punished for approaching another. Man is distinguished by using punishment not only as a deterrent but also in the teaching of skills. Such conduct is sometimes called aggressive. To give it this name is to put teaching (by punishment) in the same class as socially undesirable acts. Such a usage obscures questions that can profitably be asked. Children learn much by imitation, and are encouraged to do so. But teaching of skills (usually not by punishment) and of customs seems to be universal in human communities, both primitive and advanced. To say that there is an instinct or drive to teach adds, however, nothing to this statement. Some teaching, especially the formal process in schools, is by adults and is confined to particular societies. But, in addition, children teach younger children, sometimes evidently without prompting by elders. This is one aspect of the nurturant behavior which is perhaps a feature of all societies. Some traditions seem to be maintained solely by children. Such conduct is probably at times altruistic in the traditional sense of the term. \"Altruism\" in biological writings today has, however, a different meaning, and is therefore becoming a source of confusion. In many communities, both primitive and advanced, nurturant behavior and the teaching of young children by older children are reported to be more prominent among girls than among boys. Teaching, considered as a type of behavior, has been neglected as a subject of study. It would repay multidisciplinary investigation, especially as it appears in the conduct of children.",

The reason is not motivated of lack resources or don’t do hard work, but the reason is many times we do all the things consciously but our sub conscious mind doesn’t understand why we are behaving in certain way.

      "abstract": "All work situations can potentially generate conflicts, which can lead to risks of abuses, aggression. In any organization, there are divergences of opinion, conflict, power struggle as normal manifestations of the organization. Some of these conflictual situations are solved, but another can degenerate into aggression. Mobbing is that form of psychological aggression, exercised over a period of minimum several months by one or more colleagues over another, through a series of actions designed to discreditate and isolate that person. The role of the employee in the organization and his/her professional capacities are deliberately underestimated through various discredits, humiliations, in order to remove the person from organization. Victims of mobbing in most cases end up resigning because they no longer deal with pressure. Repercussions are psychical and social: falling confidence in professional skills, stress, deteriorating family relationships on the background of stress but also physical: depression or health problems. Also, there are consequences for the working environment of the organization regarding work performance and employee relationships. Therefore, organizations should take preventing measures to tackle this problem, as behaviour codes, prompt response to such behaviours from HR leaders.",

      "abstract": "This chapter focuses on developing self-regulated learning (SRL) and multiple source use interventions that influence learners' actions and understanding both inside and outside of school. SRL models describe how people plan, enact, monitor, control, and self-evaluate the cognitive, metacognitive, behavioral, motivational, and affective aspects of active learning. Though there are multiple SRL models, they share four premises. The first is that people are active participants in their learning. The second is that \"learners can potentially monitor, control, and regulate certain aspects of their own cognition, motivation, and behavior as well as some features of their environments\". During the Performance phase of SRL, learners engage in self-control and self-observation while learning. Self-control encompasses focusing attention and concentrating on the task, self-instruction, and help-seeking to complete the learning task. Clearly, the REading as Problem SOLVing model incorporates numerous aspects of Winne and Hadwin's SRL model, and aligns well with other SRL models such as Zimmerman's work.",

A blind spot is a regular tendency to repress, distort, dismiss or fail to notice information, views or ideas in a particular area. A blind spot emerges from a resistance to learning in a particular area. At the root of many of blind spots are a number of emotions or attitudes—fear being the most obvious, but also pride, complacency and anxiety. The information one may distort, repress, dismiss, or fail to notice is not simply written or codified information. It may consist of behaviors or emotions manifested by oneself or by other people. Information is embodied not simply in words but also in behaviors and emotions. Some people do not notice the information embedded in their own emotional responses to events.",

      "title": "<i>Q</i>-Learning for Flexible Learning of Daily Activity Plans",
      "abstract": "Q-learning is a method from artificial intelligence to solve the reinforcement learning problem (RLP), defined as follows. An agent is faced with a set of states, S. For each state s there is a set of actions, A( s), that the agent can take and that takes the agent (deterministically or stochastically) to another state. For each state the agent receives a (possibly stochastic) reward. The task is to select actions such that the reward is maximized. Activity generation is for demand generation in the context of transportation simulation. For each member of a synthetic population, a daily activity plan stating a sequence of activities (e.g., home-work-shop-home), including locations and times, needs to be found. Activities at different locations generate demand for transportation. Activity generation can be modeled as an RLP with the states given by the triple (type of activity, starting time of activity, time already spent at activity). The possible actions are either to stay at a given activity or to move to another activity. Rewards are given as “utility per time slice,” which corresponds to a coarse version of marginal utility. Q-learning has the property that, by repeating similar experiences over and over again, the agent looks forward in time; that is, the agent can also go on paths through state space in which high rewards are given only at the end. This paper presents computational results with such an algorithm for daily activity planning.",

      "abstract": "Most work in HCI focuses on interaction in the small: where tasks take a few minutes or hours and individual actions receive feedback within seconds. In contrast, many collaborative activities occur over weeks or months and the turnaround of individual messages may take hours, days or even weeks. This slow pace of interaction brings its own problems, especially when expected responses do not occur. This paper analyses these problems, focusing on the triggers which initiate activities and the way processes recover when triggers are missed or misinterpreted. Furthermore, we are able to consider processes which cross organisational boundaries. We draw on theoretical analysis, an exploratory case study of conference organisation and recent application of the techniques to a student placement office. During the studies, a pattern of recurrent activities was discovered, the 4Rs (request, receipt, response and release), which we believe to be generic to this class of collaborative process.",

      "title": "Stress and burnout in libraries & information centers",
      "abstract": "Stress has been variously defined by popular sources and researchers. A useful construct positions stress and burnout on continuum. In recent years, psychologists have become interested in the study on phenomenon known as, burnout. Burnout is an occupational stress. In organizations, different factors cause stress. One of the immediate outcomes of psychological stress is phenomenon of burn out. Some of the causing agents of burn out, of burn out are presence of severe and improper working condition at organization, improper leadership style practices in the organization and marital status. In this regard, due to development of new technology, information explosion, reduction of finance, lack of professional staff, immediate change at execute posts, specially chiefs of libraries and not using trained librarians caused which stress on the library staff which is followed by reduction of performance, job change, interferences (frustration), pre-term retirement, frequent lack of illness, burnout syndrome, consequently, in search of jobs and having official and executives roles. When there is no job stress for the librarians, they can do these most effort, stress free environment, would result in the acceleration of performance and efficacy. In this condition, proper management can no irradiate burnout. Material and Methods: This research designed and performed for the librarians employed in the libraries affiliated to Mazandaran and Babol Medical Sciences in Mazandaran Province in the North of Iran. Data were collected in the questionnaire designed for different questions. Results: 19 people were married and 11 people unmarried. Most of the participants had bachelor degree holder and 14 permanent (official elopement) employed. It is note worthy that 53.3 % of participants suffered stress (burnout). Since this study is going on, in case of acceptance the results will submit later, with detail and completed. Very little, however, has been done to measure the effectiveness of these remedies in preventing, improving, or eliminating the problem of burnout in these professionals. Conclusion: There is growing research supporting the existence of burnout among academic librarians. Many suggestions to prevent, or remedy, this condition in librarians, some of them addressed specifically to help the academic librarians, have been considered and appear promising. Proffered solutions are targeted at both the individual level, and at a level deemed more effective by most researchers, the organizational level, which includes the broadest level, that of society itself. Very little, however, has been done to measure the effectiveness of these remedies in preventing, improving, or eliminating the problem of burnout in these professionals.",

      "title": "실직이 개인에게 미치는 영향",
      "abstract": "There has been considerable research on the psychological response of job loss. The results suggest that this response is almost always negative. This review can be summarized as below; The more intensely the loss of a job is experienced, the more internal blame that is assigned, and the less reversible the unemployment is viewed to be, the higher the level of short-term stress individuals will experience. Generally, individuals who have terminated increased depression, decreased life satisfaction, increased powerlessness, increased feelings of apathy. There are two models in explaining the reactions to job loss. Learned helplessness theory suggests that when individuals are continually exposed to uncontrollable events (e. g., job loss) they corne to believe that their current situations cannot be corrected by their actions. They may be over time to become depressed, apathetic, and unmotivated to find new jobs. On the contrast, reactance theory can be used to explain some of heightened behavior and emotions that may immediately accompany the job loss. Job loss may also be the source of marital and family friction, further eroding individuals' psychological well-being. When individuals are lost their job, they consequently lose important social and psychological benefits as well. At the same time, they not only lose their old social identities, but they also gain new identities which are largely negative in society's view. The negative effects of job loss may not stop with reemployment. There are evidences that unsuccessful reemployments are found among the terminated. Also, there is some evidence to suggest that the experience of job loss leads individuals to feel less job security in future employment. Job loss has producted new symptom. It is called careerism. Careerist employees are those who put their own interests above those of their employers and co-workers. While virtually all terminated employees suffer some negative consequences from job loss, there is also substantial variance among the unemployed in the degree to which they respond negatively to job loss. There are seven general sets of predictor variables: (1) characteristics of the dismissal itself (previous dismissal history, status of the dismissal, number of other employees terminated, reasons for the job loss), (2) perceived unemployment rates, (3) individual difference variable (demographic factor, personality attributes), (4) social support, (5) corporate and union support, (6) advance notification.",

In this paper, procrastination is defined as the avoidance of the implementation of an intention. It is characterised by the avoidance of the intention and the preference for behaviour or thoughts that distract from the aversiveness of the intention. Individual difference variables, processes, and conditions are identified. Strategies to overcome procrastination are suggested.",

      "title": "Does Practice Modify the Relationship between Postural Control and the Execution of a Secondary Task in Young and Older Individuals?",
      "abstract": "&lt;i&gt;Background:&lt;/i&gt; Numerous daily activities require performing more than one task simultaneously, such as standing while engaging in a conversation. Recent studies have shown that postural control may be degraded when individuals are asked to perform a secondary task and that this effect seems to be more pronounced in older adults. Since various types of secondary tasks have been used in postural control studies, the novelty of the tasks may partly explain why dual-task interference occurs. It is known that novel tasks require greater attentional resources and thus may interfere to a greater extent with the performance of another task. Therefore, by practicing this dual-task situation, interference could perhaps be diminished. Since the dual-tasking efficiency is reduced with aging, practice could be very beneficial to older adults. &lt;i&gt;Objectives:&lt;/i&gt; The main goal of this study was to examine whether practice could modify the changes seen in postural sway when individuals are asked to perform a secondary task while maintaining upright stance and whether older individuals could benefit to a greater extent from practice than would young individuals. The second goal was to examine the dual-task performance in young versus older adults and to determine whether older individuals benefit equally or to a greater extent from practice as compared with young individuals. &lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt; Young and older individuals were asked to stand on a force platform while performing a secondary task or no task. The secondary task condition was repeated six times to examine the effects of practice. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; Practice did not modify the performance of postural sway, but did lead to an increase in speed of execution of the secondary task for both groups equally. In young participants, the amplitude of sway was decreased, and the frequency of sway was increased, indicating an increased stiffness when performing the cognitive task. Older participants showed increased amplitude of sway and increased frequency of sway in the mediolateral direction only. &lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt; Since the dual-task condition was only repeated six times, it could be hypothesized that the effect of practice would be greater, if more trials were added or if more practice sessions were included. More research is needed to verify this hypothesis.",

      "title": "Small-group and team-building process in teaching–learning of pharmacology",
      "abstract": "Human beings exhibit some characteristic behavior patterns in groups. We sometimes undertake solo journeys, but by and large, much of our experiences of life involve being engaged in groups. Societies can be seen as large groups consisting of a myriad of sub-groups. The nature of these groups can be quite varied, from a family going for a walk, to the crowd at a football game, to an internet discussion group, to a group of fellow workers. In education the group work can include managing project works; small-group teaching as in problem-based learning, case-based learning (CBL), tutorials or bedside teaching and day-to-day working as in administration, departmental meeting, etc. We frequently encounter this type of group activity or group work in pharmacology teaching–learning. Sometimes, the group works very effectively and in some instances, it does not. Remember, last time you we involved in a group activity during pharmacology teaching, some of you might have taken the role of a leader, speaker, facilitator, etc. In the education process, the group working has been studied in detail and there are some basic principles which can help a group to work effectively. Group dynamics is the study of groups and is also a general term for group processes. The field of group dynamics is primarily concerned with small-group behavior. When group patterns are combined with the study of individual development, then group dynamics can also be applied to education and therapy (as is often the case in experiential, outdoor, and adventure education). As they interact and influence each other, groups develop a number of dynamic processes that separate them from a random collection of individuals. These processes include norms, roles, relations, development, need to belong, social influence, and effects on behavior. A criterion for this assemblage to be labeled as a group can include formal social structure, face-to-face interaction, two or more persons, common fate, common goals, interdependence, self-definition as group members, and recognition by others. The ultimate aim of a group is to perform the task or accomplish a common goal; hence, an effective group can also be defined as a diverse group of people with complementary abilities (perspectives, ideas, knowledge, skills, techniques, and competencies-as we find in our students) who collaborate to accomplish common goals for which they are accountable together.[1] Common goals may be the given case scenario, as in self-directed learning or CBL. A successful group usually has to go through the following two broad phases: Task function It depicts the group's ability to successfully complete the task, which may be goals, objectives, and content of the task. It can be accomplished by following approaches, setting goals and objectives, developing procedures, getting information and data, preparing and distributing agendas/minutes, selecting idea generation methods, clarifying tasks, set time frames, selecting decision-making methods, testing agreement/reality, use problem-solving steps, coordinate individual assignments, and summarize activities. Process function It depends on the group's ability to work together, i.e., dynamics or interaction between individuals of the group. It provides for physical and social needs, encourages participation, gives support and encouragement, checks for feelings, evaluates and assesses meetings/teamwork, settles differences, facilitates the inclusion of all members, intervenes with dysfunctional behaviors, and asks and gives feedback. An effective group will have some clear qualities, as represented in Figure 1. The overall group dynamics and process, including task function and process function, have been classified into various stages. Any individual in a leadership position whose responsibilities involve getting groups of individuals to work together should both be conversant with the phases of the group process and possess the skills necessary to capitalize on these stages to accomplish the objective of forming a productive and cohesive team.Figure 1: An example of effective small group qualitiesGroup dynamics can be understood as complex from an interpersonal relationship point of view because it involves relationships between two people, relationships between a person and a group, and relationships between groups. Various researchers have defined different stages of group dynamics. Bruce Tuckman reviewed about 50 studies of groups in the mid-60s and synthesized their commonalities in one of the most frequently cited models of group development.[2] The model describes four linear stages (forming, storming, norming, and performing) that a group will go through in its unitary sequence of decision-making. A fifth stage (adjourning) was added in 1977 when a new set of studies were reviewed.[3] The typical four stages of Tuckman are forming, storming, norming, and performing. Before we discuss these stages, let us have a look at the various roles played by the individuals in the group. The following roles can be assigned to group members: Leader Like the captain of a cricket team who guides tasks and content. In pharmacology teaching, this can be a student in small group discussion who makes clear the task to be done. Facilitator Like a coach who manages group dynamics, guides, and provides support. To facilitate, is to help something (usually a process) move along. Facilitating does not mean \"solving a problem\" or \"doing it for someone\". It means doing something that makes the process run a little better. The word derives from \"facile\" which is French for \"easy\". To facilitate, then, is literally to make something easier. When a situation is too difficult, a facilitator is there to help. When a student or a group is having desirable experiences, the facilitator can be less obtrusive. The role has been likened to that of a midwife who assists in the process of birth but is not the producer of the result. These facilitators are not always subject experts. They attempt to draw on the existing knowledge of the participant and to then facilitate access to training where gaps in knowledge are identified and agreed on. Training facilitators focus on the foundations of adult education: Establish existing knowledge, build on it, and keep it relevant. For pharmacology small group exercises, the number of facilitators might be required for each session. Sharing of resources, i.e., residents can act as facilitators across subjects. However, in this case, they must be trained in facilitation skills. Members Like players participate in problem-solving. These roles can be assigned right in the beginning by the facilitator. The details of these stages are given below: Forming-Stage 1 Group members In the forming stage, personal relations are characterized by dependence. Group members rely on safe, patterned behavior and look to the group leader for guidance and direction. Group members have a desire for acceptance by the group and a need to know that the group is safe. They set about gathering impressions and data about the similarities and differences among them and forming preferences for future subgrouping. Rules of behavior seem to be to keep things simple and to avoid controversy. Serious topics and feelings are avoided [Figure 2a].Figure 2: Tuckman's stages (a-d) of small group workTask The major task functions also concern orientation. Members attempt to become oriented to the tasks as well as to one another. Discussion centers around defining the scope of the task, how to approach it, and similar concerns. Leader Leader's focus is a high task and low relationship oriented. It is mainly directive or \"telling.\" He must try to make the understanding of task easy for all members. If there is a facilitator, his focus can be on self-disclosure, openness, and listening. To grow from this stage to the next, each member must relinquish the comfort of nonthreatening topics and risk the possibility of conflict. Storming-Stage 2 Members This stage is characterized by competition and conflict in the personal-relations dimension and organization in the task-functions dimension. As the group members attempt to organize the task, conflict inevitably results in their personal relations [Figure 2b]. Although conflicts may or may not surface as group issues, they do exist. Questions will arise about who is going to be responsible for what, what the rules are, what the reward system is, and what criteria for evaluation are. These reflect conflicts over leadership, structure, power, and authority. Because of \"fear of exposure\" or \"fear of failure,\" there will be an increased desire for structural clarification and commitment. There may be wide swings in members' behavior based on emerging issues of competition and hostilities. Because of the discomfort generated during this stage, some members may remain completely silent while others attempt to dominate. This is depicted many times in students group in tutorials and in small group discussions. Individuals have to bend and mold their feelings, ideas, attitudes, and beliefs to suit the group organization. Leader Leader's focus is high task and highly relationship oriented. He is getting them together to understand the task or \"selling.\" Facilitator may focus on positive and negative feedback and create a safe environment. They need to intervene to involve the silent members and politely handle the dominating members without offending them. This is very important; otherwise, members may stop contributing to the group. You need to balance the contribution from all. Facilitator needs to channelize the energy of the group in the right direction and remind them that they have gathered here to accomplish a common task. The leader/facilitator can also set ground rules at this stage if this has not been done earlier. Ground rules can include the following: only one person speaks at a time; no cross-talking while someone is speaking; and listen to the member who is speaking and raise your hands and wait for your turn to put forward your point. The most important trait in helping groups to move on to the next stage seems to be the ability to listen. Norming-Stage Members Interpersonal relations are characterized by cohesion. Group members are engaged in active acknowledgment of all members' contributions, community building and maintenance and solving of group issues [Figure 2c]. Members are willing to change their preconceived ideas or opinions on the basis of facts presented by other members and they actively ask questions of one another. When members begin to know and identify with one another, the level of trust in their personal relations contributes to the development of group cohesion. During this stage of development (assuming the group gets this far), people begin to experience a sense of group belonging and a feeling of relief as a result of resolving interpersonal conflicts. The major task function of stage three is the data flow between group members. If this stage of data flow and cohesion is attained by the group members, their interactions are characterized by openness and sharing of information on both a personal and task level. Task Task is clear to all the members. They share feelings and ideas, solicit and give feedback to one another, and explore actions related to the task. Creativity is high. They feel good about being part of an effective group. Group settles down to normalcy. Leader Leader's focus is low task and high relationship oriented. He is now \"participating.\" Leadership is shared and cliques dissolve. Facilitator may focus on exploring differences, uncover unspoken issues and encourage self-critiques. He needs to make sure the group is progressing well in the right direction. However he need not intervene too much here, he can sit back and observe the group silently and intervene only if the group is diverting from the task. The major drawback of the norming stage is that members may begin to fear the inevitable future breakup of the group; they may resist change of any sort. Performing-Stage 4 Members The performing stage is not reached by all groups. If group members are able to evolve to stage four, their capacity, range, and depth of personal relations expand to true interdependence. In this stage, people can work independently, in subgroups, or as a total unit with equal facilities. Their roles and authorities dynamically adjust to the changing needs of the group and individuals. Stage 4 is marked by interdependence in personal relations and problem-solving in the realm of task functions. By now, the group should be most productive. Individual members have become self-assured, and the need for group approval is past. Members are both highly task oriented and highly people oriented. There is unity, group identity is complete, group morale is high, and group loyalty is intense. This can be depicted by pharmacovigilance center team in an institute working for years together as they need to report more and more ADRs every month [Figure 2d]. Task The task function becomes genuine problem-solving, leading toward optimal solutions and optimum group development. There is support for experimentation in solving problems and an emphasis on achievement. The overall goal is productivity through problem-solving and work. Leader Leader's focus is low task/low relationship oriented because now he is \"delegating.\" Facilitator may focus to encourage group toward self-intervention and self-management. Group members can have various qualities during the development of a group. These can be related to emotional stability (adjustment, self-esteem), extraversion (dominance, affiliation, social perceptiveness, and expressivity), openness (flexibility), and agreeableness (trust, cooperation). In breaking down these dimensions, it was generalized that past research has been consistent when it mentions that emotional stability, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness are all related to team effectiveness. Within extraversion, dominance was found to be a negative attribute in team members where they are not working independently and not collaborating with others. Adjustment and flexibility were noted to be important facets for team members to have where adjustment to situations is needed. Clearly, for teams to be successful, there has to be a balance between the personality dimensions. This provides well-roundedness for a person to bring to a team. Adjourning-stage 5 Tuckman's final stage, adjourning, involves the termination of task behaviors and disengagement from relationships. A planned conclusion usually includes recognition for participation and achievement and an opportunity for members to say personal goodbyes. Concluding a group can create some apprehension-in effect, a minor crisis. The termination of the group is a regressive movement from giving up control to giving up inclusion in the group. The most effective interventions in this stage are those that facilitate task termination and the disengagement process. It should be noted that this model refers to the overall pattern of the group, but of course, individuals within a group work in different ways. If distrust persists, a group may never even get to the norming stage. The groups may or may not go through these all stages and these stages might occur at different points in the group's history. The stages are usually of unequal durations and all groups may not go through these stages at the same rate. If a given group does not follow a fixed sequence of stages, it merely expresses normal variation arising from initial or contextual conditions. Dimensions of Group Process Various theories of group development exist. The model below [Table 1] combines elements of theories by Jones, Tuckman, and Banet.[2,4,5] In this model, each phase of group development is looked at with respect to group members' concerns with task and personal relations (process) functions.Table 1: Dimensions of group processSome of the aspects of the group process that an educationist would look at include patterns of communication and coordination, patterns of influence, roles/relationship, patterns of dominance (e.g., who leads, who defers), balance of task focus versus social focus, level of group effectiveness and how conflict is handled. In group dynamics, the phrase \"group process\" refers to the understanding of the behavior of people in groups, such as task groups, that are trying to solve a problem or make a decision. An individual with expertise in \"group process, such as a trained facilitator, can assist a group in accomplishing its objective by diagnosing how well the group is functioning as a problem-solving or decision-making entity and intervening to alter the group's operating behavior. Games in Understanding Group Dynamics All of the above stages and processes can be better understood by actually playing some games related to group dynamics. These games are being used frequently to make a group understand these dynamics in a better way so that they can later on use these principles in their day-to-day life. Group dynamic games are experiential education exercises that help people to learn about themselves, interpersonal relationships, and how groups function from a group dynamics or social psychological point of view.[6] Group dynamic games are usually designed for the specific purpose of furthering personal development, character building, and teamwork via a group-dynamic milieu. The group leader may sometimes also be the game leader, or between peers, the leadership and game rules can change. Some games require large spaces, special objects, tools, quietness, or many before-game and after-game needs. When aged, frail or disabled people (\"special needs\") are involved, existing games may need modification to be used. The use of group dynamic activities has a history of application in conflict resolution, anger management, team building, and many other areas, such as drug rehabilitation, communication in pharmacology encounters, and drama therapy. Some examples include dancing (some types), group problem-solving activities (or initiative tasks), ice-breakers, warm up, energizers games, leadership games, role-playing games (pharmacology communication competencies), team-building games, trust-building games, win–win games (\"cooperative games,\" \"new games\"), and physical activities for groups (drugs names on a map). Some games we have been using to train health educators to depict group dynamics include river crossing and planning to go to the moon. Components of a Group Dynamics Games Part 1: Instructions This part of a team-building exercise involves introducing the participants to the instructions for the exercise. Part 2: Activity This part of the team-building exercise is the exercise itself. This is when participants utilize the instructions and begin to participate in the actual activity. Part 3: Debriefing This is likely the most important part of a team-building exercise. The facilitator will close the exercise with a review of the purpose of the exercise and how the team accomplished it. A debriefing is important to reiterate the purpose of the exercise and to keep participants focused on the positive outcomes from the exercise. Tips for running group dynamic games are as follows: Make sure you have basic knowledge of leadership, teamwork, team development, group dynamics, and psychology. Some specific knowledge of specialist areas, such as neuro-linguistic programming and transactional analysis, is useful but not necessary If intense work is desired, then more background knowledge and experience is required to effectively perform activities Know your limits Create a comfortable physical space and a relaxed atmosphere Participants should wear comfortable clothing Ensure a minimum of disturbances during sessions (no visitors during sessions etc.,) Treat the event holistically: Care for body, mind, and spirit Be aware that we learn best (experience things most intensely) when seeing, hearing, and touching are involved at the same time (audio, visual, and kinesthetic aspects) Start with ice-breaker games Then, introduce trust-building games Then, tackle group problem-solving activities (or initiative tasks) Use an experiential learning model (e.g., do-review-plan), which includes debriefing and feedback Use time-outs to clarify problems Enjoy and have fun, but understand the serious sides of the exercises as well Always include everyone in a fair and equal way. The small-group process plays an important role in teaching–learning of students as they get better facilitation in small groups. Their involvement in small groups adds to their confidence level and participation in the learning of pharmacology. However, it is equally important that teacher involved in small-group teaching–learning is well aware of the processes in small-group teaching.",

Challenges discussed are: (1) those associated with data protection and obligations around confidentiality; (2) those resulting from the practitioner’s expertize over core societal values; (3) those engendered by the controversy surrounding psychiatric practice; (4) dilemmas arising from dual roles, particularly when they are imposed by judicial and public safety institutions; and finally (5) those associated with visions of a post-psychiatry world put forward by critics of present day practices. In each of these ways, the ethical demands borne by the practitioner in psychiatry are distinctive and beyond the ordinary, in part as the result of a multiplier effect among the factors involved. Some challenges involve ethical dilemmas, others call for particular moral strengths (or character virtues), or extra obligations in practitioners; yet others place the practitioner in situations of ethical vulnerability.",

      "abstract": "People can adjust their communication in a variety of ways for different contexts, audiences, and purposes. Although these adjustments often improve or facilitate interaction—that is, make it smoother, better, or easier—sometimes they do not. “Nonaccommodation” is a concept drawn from communication accommodation theory (CAT) and refers to adjustments in communication behavior associated with disaffiliation, expressing dissimilarity and/or obscuring information. Nonaccommodation can be defined and described in terms of either speakers’ or listeners’ experiences; it may also be intentional or unintentional on the part of a speaker. Researchers have studied nonaccommodation in terms of both its objective behavioral manifestations (e.g., <italic>linguistic divergence</italic>) and the subjective perceptions that relate to those behavioral manifestations (e.g., <italic>psychological divergence; over-</italic> and <italic>underaccommodation)</italic>. Responding to nonaccommodation effectively can be challenging, and what constitutes the “best” or “most appropriate” response often depends on contextual factors and interactants’ goals. In line with the functions of accommodation described in CAT, nonaccommodation can influence communication effectiveness as well as the nature of interpersonal and intergroup relations. Generally, nonaccommodation hinders shared understanding and increases perceptions of social distance between individuals and their social groups. Often it is also associated with less positive evaluations of the people and groups involved, as well as lower levels of relational solidarity. Nonaccommodation occurs frequently across a wide variety of societally significant contexts, including intergenerational, medical/healthcare, police–civilian, family, and educational interactions. As such, it represents an important area for both theoretical and applied research.",

Human learning is triggered in a number of different ways: by events (contingencies or discrepancies), associative learning, and complex learning (including observational learning).

In many courses, a common pedagogy is to play the simulated game on a group or team basis. Typically, each group represents the management of a firm which must make certain decisions for each play of the game. The group is expected to reach a consensus decision. However, as in the real world, the group decision may not in fact be a true consensus decision. This is perhaps highly desirable since the players can obtain considerable experience in group dynamics and group decision making. On the other hand, many of us who use simulation games have frequently heard students comment: â€œI didnâ€™t totally agree with my groupâ€™s decision and wish I could see the results of my own ideas (decisions).â€ Whatever the reason for individual differences, a potentially exciting learning experience is lost.

      "title": "NON COGNITIVE SKILLS AS THE NEW METRIC IN RECENT LABOR MARKETS – CASE STUDY: THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA IN PROMOTING AND DEVELOPING SKILLS",
      "abstract": "Recent trends seem to conclude that computerization leads to the transformation of already skilled employees into characters that possess certain criteria such as flexibility, team spirit, communication, motivation, critical thinking, adaptive, multi-tasking and innovative responses, well-being, social and collaborative problem-solving abilities, etc. The prementioned skills are usually referred to as non-cognitive skills or soft skills or socio-emotional skills and in general they are considered to be major predictors of adult professional life. In fact, it is widely accepted that part of these skills is usually acquired in early childhood as well as in primary and secondary schooling, yet it appears to be a major factor of employment dynamics and future income throughout life. On the other hand, there is lack of clarity and measurement in the process of studying, defining and classifying soft skills. As a result, at the moment there are no sufficient customized tools that specifically measure the procedures of possessing or gradually developing behavioral and attitudinal skills so consequently there is absence of proportionate skills development policies. At the same time, as internet tends to shape pedagogy and overall education and training, soft skills continue to reform constantly adding up to the present yet unsolved matter of soft skills tools measurement modeling. Meanwhile, as online markets are rapidly growing, many e-communities worldwide are promoting specific sets of soft skills, usually by posting impressive job applications or by using digital matching tools that make online recruitment more attractive, interesting and promising to both employers and jobseekers, finally augmenting the already long list of soft skills. As this has been the case during the recent years, many new non-taught personal skills have been arising. Consequently, questions and thoughts regarding their methodology development tend to be crucial. In the present paper, the above issues are thoroughly discussed and analyzed. In addition, a classification of the new skills in demand is attempted in terms of recent real labor and on line market, mainly by researching through social media platforms and focusing on the recent changes in skills demand as well the ways some of these skills are often cultivated subconsciously mainly through frequent use of social media, according to social media marketers that participated in the present research. Finally, the current paper hopes to add up to the ways new skills taxonomy may be incorporated in education and training sectors, business sectors, private sectors and policy makers by proposing ways that upgrade job skills in response to worldwide labor market's signals in order to best prepare in terms of human resource development.",

      "abstract": "In hopes of discovering how to respond to her students' work in a that heads them toward meaningful revision, a creative writing teacher singles several categories of student fiction she has trouble responding to and pinpoints common shortcomings of students' early drafts, the students respond to comments regarding revisions, and genre writers' defensiveness. Teachers' comments and suggestions should be respectful to students, yet useful. For instance, students often become hung up in sentimentality and lack of characterization or detail and become defensive when asked to revise a story that really did happen that way. Successful comments might encourage further fleshing out of some particular moments in the story. The choice of an unreliable main character, a flat predictable sentence style, passive voice, and lack of insight are problems often occurring in way altered state (involving substance abuse or insanity). Genre writers' early drafts sometimes have a lack of characterization and unrealistic settings or plots. When preachiness and predictable outcomes mar first drafts in Brady Bunch style fables, suggestions for revisions should focus on making stories open to various interpretations, without having a clear moral or point.

I suggest ways to go. And like most creative writing instructors I know, I try to phrase my comments in ways that will be respectful of and useful to my students. But what if we sometimes don't get it? What if we are biased against a genre a student is writing in? What if we are unable to see how our responses might be seen as mean-spirited or simply obtuse? Or do certain kinds of writers remain defensive about their work no matter how careful we are in our responses? In the hopes of discovering how I can respond to my students' work in a that leads them toward meaningful revision, and assuming I'm not alone there in my failures, I have looked at several categories of student fiction I know I have trouble responding to and have examined the following three areas in each category: 1) The common shortcomings of early drafts; 2) The students have responded to my comments--how they revised or didn't",

      "title": "Recognizing, Reducing and Copying with Test Anxiety: Causes, Solutions and Recommendations",
      "abstract": "Test anxiety is a psychological condition in which a person experiences distress before, during, or after a test or other assessment to such an extent that this anxiety causes poor performance or interferes with normal learning. The number of people who suffer from any type of test anxiety is increasing in modern world .If you want to take a test as a student, or if you want to be hired as an employee, or you want to get any kind of diploma or license, you have to seat for a test (or sometimes several tests). Usually we start asking about the test from those who have already experienced the test. Some say it is just a picnic but some say passing the test is almost impossible since it contains many items even things you have never learnt before. You are finally left with frustration and sinking feeling of anxiety. Under such circumstances it is quite normal to feel anxious. Test anxiety is actually a type of performance anxiety — a feeling someone might have in a situation where performance really counts or when the pressure's on to do well. In conclusion, test anxiety is the result of many interrelated beliefs and experiences. Ineffective study methods, and procrastination can lead to anxiety and a lowered self-image.",

      "title": "Task Performance in Groups",
      "abstract": "When individuals decide to work together to complete a task, they often do so in the belief that the product of their collective effort will exceed that which could be accomplished alone. Task-performing groups are resource-rich entities in that members have access to one another’s uniquely possessed knowledge, skills, and abilities and can, in many instances, reduce each individual’s workload by dividing the labor among themselves. However, faulty interaction processes often hinder a group’s ability to utilize maximally the resources available to them, resulting in a performance that falls short of the group’s potential. For example, coordination loss occurs when group members fail to combine their efforts in an optimal manner. This type of loss is especially likely when the group task requires a high level of precision or has heavy cognitive demands. For example, coordination loss is especially problematic in the context of brainstorming groups, because group members are often asked to interact with one another while simultaneously generating ideas and processing the ideas generated by others. Motivation loss occurs when individual group members fail to give their best effort to the group’s endeavor. This type of loss, called social loafing, is especially likely to occur when individual group members believe that their contributions cannot be identified or evaluated. Alternatively, free-riding occurs when group members believe that their contributions to the group product are ultimately dispensable. Finally, group interaction can result in a performance that exceeds what is expected from a simple pooling of individual group members’ efforts, although instances of such are less frequently addressed and documented within the group performance literature. Synergistic or assembly bonus effects are likely when collective work conditions emphasize strong associations between individual effort and highly desirable outcomes, as in the case of Köhler motivation gains. Furthermore, synergistic effects have been documented in instances where groups have used their increased capacity to process information to identify patterns or draw conclusions that individuals alone would find challenging.",

      "abstract": "Workers involved in 'people-work' are expected to engage in a great deal of emotion management as they attempt to convey the appropriate emotions (which they may not genuinely feel) to their clients or customers whilst perhaps suppressing inappropriate ones. Should this emotion management be unsuccessful within some industries, a customer may be lost as they choose to take their business to a competitor; however, within the 'caring' business, such as the counselling and guidance professions, a failure to display the appropriate emotion (e.g. sympathy) or a leakage of an inappropriate one (e.g. boredom) can have much more serious implications for the well-being of the client and their continued relationship with the professional. This paper will thus argue that emotion management or 'emotional labour' is a vital skill within the counselling and guidance professions, but one that can also be a significant source of work stress. Strategies for coping with the stress of performing emotional labour are suggested.",

Perceptions of control are critical for well-being, but even more so is the fit between the type of control strategy used and the opportunities available. Older adults are better able to use motivational strategies to maintain control, preserving their well-being despite increasingly limited control opportunities. Additionally, short-term changes in affective components of well-being can serve as signals of the opportunities available and the progress being made toward a goal, with positive affect resulting from goal success and leading to broader attentional focus and switching to other tasks, and negative affect resulting from failure or difficulties leading to a narrowed focus and greater persistence. Finally, goal content matters. Goal pursuits and successes lead to improvements in well-being only when congruent with implicit, unconscious motives. In addition, older adults focus more on goals that produce emotional benefits, and younger adults focus more on goals that produce knowledge and long-term benefits.",

The only way to do it well is to practise. Practise breeds habits and habits become unconscious behaviours. In that way, one always has those tools at one's disposal.

      "abstract": "Тhe article illustrates issues of perspective Music-learning theory teachers’ professional education and analyzes issues of the emotional self-regulation development during their professional vocal education, investigates the specifics of student’s adaptation to the emotional conditions of the public performance. Development of the individual’s cognitive potential is closely related with its emotional aspect development. The sensual cognition underlies the mental cognition of reality. Emotions play considerable role in the educational motivation formation: it serves as an incentive and activating function which is becoming the stimulus for energy action. Development of emotional self-regulation is the important aspect in the professional education of perspective Music-learning theory teacher. However emotions often can prevent successful musical education and upbringing processes ongoing. Excessive excitement, anxiety do not allow to develop on full the potential of music-learning theory specialty students and prevents the successful presenting of their own creative activity product. Excessive emotional excitement can cause the impulsiveness of behavior, losing focus on what is going on, the contravention of analysis, learning of academic information and the process of perception thrust. Emotional self-regulation skills formation must be an important component in the professional education of perspective music-learning theory pedagogue. Among the structure of the musical-theory learning theory student’s self-regulation are the following four components: self-esteem, self-control, self-correction, self-encourage. Methodical demonstration of personal musical performing skills on public as a must for students of music-theory learning specialties during the process of their professional education contributes to forming of the emotional self-regulation skills and keeping of self-control in stressful conditions during the public performance. The newfound skills of emotional self-regulation which were achieved during the concert performance practice, presentations to the Examination Board, perspective pedagogue can successfully transmit to the situations of pedagogical issues solutions during teaching of music-theory learning in the musical school.",

Everyone needs feedback to grow, especially the students because providing students engage with feedback, it should enhance learning and improve assessment performance. Formative feedback refers to that information communicated to the learner that is intended to modify his or her thinking or behavior for the purpose of improving learning and self-efficacy is the self-perceived ability to deal with specific situations. According to Bandura’s theory, the judgments about self-efficacy influence the choice of situations in which we are involved, the amount of submitted effort in a given situation, the time we persist in a task, overcoming the obstacles and the resistence of pressure, emotional reactions during anticipation or involvement in that situation (for example the level of stress, anxiety). The aim of this study was to examine the effect of teachers feedback on student’s self-efficacy and motivation in learning process. The participants were students aged 11-16 years (N=300).",

Design/methodology/approach – Provides details of recent cases from England and Wales that bear upon workplace stress. Findings – Explains that, for liability to arise, there needs to be an injury to heath, and this needs to be attributable to stress at work. Practical implications – Advances the view that employers can reduce the likelihood of a successful claim as follows: reduce stress in the work environment; give clear written guidance on actions that employees should take if they feel that they are stressed and ensure the message is conveyed with evidence that this is the case; have a confidential help-line that can refer stressed employees to obtain appropriate help; train managers to look out for the signs of stress and act on them; and pay special attention to anyone who has already exhibited signs of stress or had time off work because of stress. Social implications – Argues that mental disorders are more difficult to identify than physical ones. Originality/value – Claims that the threshold for employer liability remains high. The employee will find it difficult to make a successful claim for workplace stress where the person keeps the fact that he or she is stressed from the employer.",

      "abstract": "Learning is an individual process for each student. People can be aware of own learning or do not think about it at all in the diverse situations of life. However, in the pedagogical reality, the awareness of students' learning is essential as it contributes to self-regulation of behaviour and self-reflection of actions, striving towards continuous self-development. It is important to be aware of oneself mentally and physically, understanding and accepting own thoughts or feelings. The integration of all areas of personal development becomes relevant, as changes in one area are linked to changes in another. Awareness of own learning directs the learner towards the social, emotional and academic dimension, including not only awareness of the knowledge and acquired skills, but awareness of own goals, motivations, emotions, interests, the personal relevance of the learning content and also the variability of the current situation, strategies for future learning, and other elements of the learning process. Mindfulness can also be seen as a powerful 'antidote' to common mental health problems, e.g. fatigue, exhaustion, apathy, anxiety and difficulty in concentrating. Mindfulness practices can be implemented at schools as an element of the lesson, but it is also important to purposefully create a culture of mindfulness at the institutional level, which can be greatly facilitated by the professional development of teachers. Mindfulness is a mental state of being reflective in the present moment. It provides the ability to live intensely in the present moment, acceptance of own thoughts and feelings, a sense of perspective and the ability to cope with stressful situations through conscious concentration. The aim of this publication is to analyze the theoretical aspects of mindfulness, the possibilities of facilitating the learning process through mindfulness practices, as well as to carry out empirical research evaluating 16-19-year-old students` self-awareness skills, the phenomenon of the presence of mindfulness in their learning process and its impact on their learning outcomes.",

Walaupun hal tersebut sering dilakukan oleh guru di dalam kelas, namun seringkali pula permasalahan-permasalahan yang sama muncul kembali dan berulang lagi. Hal ini wajar terjadi sebab biasanya seorang guru hanya melakukan tindakan “darurat” saja yakni tindakan yang diambil untuk mengatasi perilaku yang tidak disiplin dan mengganggu pada saat pelajaran berlangsung demi tujuan jangka pendek, artinya hanya menangani masalah yang muncul pada saat itu saja dan tidak memberi efek secara permanen. \r\nKehidupan siswa dengan berbagai latar belakang tersebut mengharuskan seorang guru untuk mampu melakukan pengelolaan kelas sehingga terwujud kehidupan kelas yang dinamis dan efektif. Tindakan tersebut dapat berupa tindakan yang bersifat pencegahan dan atau tindakan yang bersifat korektif. Tindakan pencegahan atau preventif adalah tindakan untuk menyediakan kondisi fisik dan emosional sehingga siswa merasa nyaman dalam belajar. Adapun tindakan korektif adalah tindakan yang berusaha untuk memperbaiki tingkah laku siswa yang menyimpang dan merusak kondisi optimal bagi PBM. Hal inilah yang terkait erat dengan masalah kedisiplinan. Dan peran guru sangat penting dalam mengelola kelas untuk mampu menangani masalah siswa sebab disiplin adalah kunci sukses dalam segala hal. Dari kedisiplinan akan tumbuh sifat teguh dalam memegang prinsip, tekun dalam usaha, gigih dalam membela kebenaran serta pantang berputus asa.",

      "title": "The hunt for usability",
      "abstract": "Usability testing methods have not changed significantly since the origins of the practice. Usability studies typically address human performance at a readily observable task-level, including measures like time to complete a task, percentage of participants succeeding, type and number of errors, and subjective ratings of ease of use [3]. Certain types of questions are difficult to answer efficiently with these techniques. Imagine, for example, that we observe users spending longer than expected looking at a particular dialog of a software application or web page without making the appropriate selection to complete the task. Participants often have difficulty reporting their behavior and the experimenter is clueless about what went wrong. Is it because the user is overlooking the control? Is the user distracted by another element in the interface -- perhaps an animated graphic? Is the user seeing the control, but failing to comprehend its meaning? Different answers to these questions would clearly lead to different recommendations. If overlooking the control is a problem, increasing its salience is appropriate. If confusion of the control's function is a problem, changing the graphic or text label may be appropriate. If distraction is a problem, decreasing the salience of other stimuli may help. Without answers to these questions, design recommendations have to be implemented by trial and error. Recording the fixation pattern of the participant's eyes can offer additional information to help answer these questions. While this concept is not new, it has been confined primarily to military aircraft cockpit issues [2,4]. Only recently has eye tracking technology advanced to make it practical in the broader usability community. Usability studies of human-computer systems that have included eye tracking, e.g., [1] are beginning to show benefits of these techniques. However, important challenges remain.",

      "abstract": "As funcoes executivas correspondem a um conjunto de processos cognitivos que de forma integrada permitem ao sujeito dirigir intencionalmente comportamento a metas. Sao requeridas sempre que planos de acao sao formulados e quando se esta adquirindo novos conhecimentos. Sao funcoes necessarias para gerenciar o comportamento humano e garantir o sucesso na vida cotidiana. O processo de envelhecimento saudavel e marcado por um declinio das funcoes executivas, sendo esse declinio acentuado em quadros de Comprometimento Cognitivo Leve e de Demencia de Alzheimer. O objetivo desta dissertacao foi avaliar os efeitos das funcoes executivas, mesmo que indiretamente, em outros processos cognitivos em paciente idosos com envelhecimento normal, em pacientes com Comprometimento Cognitivo Leve e com Demencia de Alzheimer. Foram realizados dois artigos conduzidos atraves da analise de mediacao, objetivando investigar os mecanismos pelos quais uma variavel exerce seu efeito em outra. Os resultados dos dois estudos indicaram que as funcoes executivas influenciam tanto direta quanto indiretamente em outros processos cognitivos, sugerindo assim que seu nivel de funcionamento influencia o desempenho cognitivo de uma forma ampla e diversificada. Observamos que, especialmente no envelhecimento patologico, quando comparado ao envelhecimento normal, uma maior participacao das funcoes executivas e requerida como recurso compensatorio. Concluimos que especial atencao deve ser direcionada as funcoes executivas no processo de avaliacao neuropsicologica do idoso, uma vez que deficits executivos podem influenciar na eficiencia de outros processos cognitivos.",

The ego skills required for sustained and effective concentration will be described. Evidence will be presented that this process does not proceed conflict-free, but as a struggle subject to interruption by the building up of drive energy or irrelevant associations.

Narratives are often described as moving quickly, covering lots of ground, or going in circles, but little work has quantified such movements or tested whether they might explain success. We use natural language processing and machine learning to analyze the content of almost 50,000 texts, constructing a simple set of measures (i.e., speed, volume, and circuitousness) that quantify the semantic progression of discourse. While movies and TV shows that move faster are liked more, TV shows that cover more ground are liked less. Academic papers that move faster are cited less, and papers that cover more ground or are more circuitous are cited more.",

      "title": "Only You Can Prevent Forest Fires: Professionalism in the Workplace",
      "abstract": "Professionalism: (i) the conduct, aims, or qualities that characterize or mark a profession or a professional person; (2) the following of a profession (as athletics) for gain or livelihood. (Merriam-Webster Online). Professionalism in the workplace is expected, but what is it? What do you think professionalism is? What about the staff and colleagues you work with: How would they answer this question? Do we assume that everyone knows what the code of conduct is, or do we believe it is self-evident ? We hear all too often of our leaders' (not to mention our politicians') ignoring the principles and expectations of character associated with their professions. Teachers and administrators may invest years in their careers only to have a moment of indiscretion undermine all they have gained. Whether you are just starting out in the field of education or have been in it for years, it is important to be reminded often of what the rules of engagement are. Remember: It only takes a bit of carelessness to start a forest fire. Our behavior, our speech, and our attitude can act as matches to ignite situations we later may regret; it may take years to rebuild our credibility. This article focuses on how we act and how we treat people. In essence, we are talking about professional etiquette, which can be described as conforming to the standards of skill, competence, or character normally expected of a properly qualified and experienced person in a work environment (Merriam-Webster Online). So what is our role? As leaders and part of the community, we need to keep an ever-watchful eye out for smoldering situations or those which may give rise to negative attitudes. When we say a potential is our problem - perhaps a student is upset with a faculty member - or we respond by saying, Oh, that doesn't surprise me, we fuel the problem. Ignoring a only fans the flames; ultimately, the fire is likely to extend to politically sensitive areas of the institution. What am I saying? Only you can prevent forest fires! FORCEFUL: Being overly forceful sends potential friends and allies running. Although we may not say it, people sense it. My idea is the right one! I will raise my voice and pound my fist, letting others know to back off. It is my agenda or no agenda! The forceful person is readily apparent in meetings. He forgets to listen, and, though often the loyal opposition, he lacks tact and savvy at soliciting support for what actually may be a good idea. How do people demonstrate forcefulness in your institution? Is it a supervisor who comes from the old-school way of My way or the highway or Ours is but to obey? This is the boss who becomes paranoid and who wonders whom he can trust. At Grand Rapids Community College we work in teams whenever possible; we consider the impacts on others; and we solicit ideas from the community. Who else should be at this meeting? is a frequently asked question. This is what has made us an NCA Vanguard school. OUTSPOKEN: The outspoken quickly can become the outcast. She dismantles efforts to work together. And although groupthink is not the desired result, she seems to have an opinion on everything. Though she may mean well, she dominates conversations, igniting brush fires of animosity and gossip. Think before you speak: Don't be more confident than the facts warrant. It can be very easy to make statements that sound true but that upon closer reflection or more current information may prove not to be. What a quick way to ruin credibility! In a recent legal situation, a subpoena requested items not normally requested; having spoken with more authority than an attorney, I quickly realized that my statements were not consistent with legal interpretations. To correct the situation, I had to clarify everything with the attorney. It is OK to be wrong; just don't be wrong for long.

I artiklen vises eksempler på, at studerende nemt kan komme til at agere ud fra ureflekterede motiver i deres (projekt)arbejde med en videnskabelig pro- blemstilling. Vi trækker altid i en eller anden grad på os selv og vores livsverden i vores arbejde med en faglig problemstilling, og dette udgør både en forudsætning for, såvel som en kilde til forstyrrelser af, dette arbejde. Men endnu et aspekt kan gøre det nødvendigt at undersøge de studerendes ureflekterede motiver; menneskefagsstuderende indenfor fx psyko- logi, pædagogik, sociologi motiveres og drages ofte mod at undersøge faglige problemstillinger eller tematikker, som rummer aspekter af det, som de endnu ikke har forstået i deres eget liv. Dette er undringens baggrund, og den skaber et engagement, som er helt afgørende for, at studerende kan tilegne sig en faglig habitus. For at støtte de studerende i deres videnskabelige arbejde kan det dog blive nødvendigt som vejleder også at interessere sig for de studerendes motivation og faglige problemer ud fra et processuelt og psykologisk perspektiv. Dette kan opfattes som en overvågning af de studerendes adfærd og sproglige udtryk på et niveau, som er privat og ofte ukendt af personen selv. Denne praksis må derfor underkastes en kritisk undersøgelse og diskussion som led i at vise problemstillingerne, og hvordan de kan imødegås. Med disse forbehold argumenteres der for, at en selvrefleksiv opmærksomhed fra vejlederens side er et vigtigt uddannelsesgreb, når studerende skal tilegne sig et selvrefleksivt beredskab til at undersøge deres egen praksis. Selvrefleksion er nødvendig, hvis kandidaterne fra vores uddannelser skal rustes til at opretholde en professionalisme og videnskabelighed i forhold til de problemstillinger de arbejder med, efter uddannelsen.&#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D;",

      "abstract": "Emotion is a signal that there has been a change in the subjectively perceived state of the internal or external world, which is accompanied by a physiological response (external: impulse to action, or internal: mood altera-tion), each of which is expressed through a different configuration and designates different emotional responses (joy, sadness, fear, etc.; but also anger, rage, aggression, etc.). Moreover, emotions possess a strongly contextual-ised and specific social dimension that depends on the situation and interpersonal relations: the specific meaning is determined by the subjective and intersubjective evaluation that is attributed to the emotional event. These general considerations suggest both the importance of emotional experience in the course of development, its significance in the organisation of affective relations and its functional value as an adaptation (defence, offence, approach or control) capable of maintaining or modifying the individual's relations with his (physical and social) environment. What happens when emotions are particularly intense and dysfunctional? Several studies have found that more than 60 per cent of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) exhibit problematic emotional behaviour such as irritability, outbursts of anger, self- and hetero-aggressiveness, etc. In addition, these people experience high levels of anxiety and increased negative emotions, which can contribute to intensified feelings of distress and have a negative impact on daily functioning and quality of life. Controlling these negative emotions through self-regulation can prevent these behavioural problems.",

      "title": "The impact of focus of attention and affect on social behaviour",
      "abstract": "This chapter concerns focus of attention and its impact on social behaviour. I shall make the argument that there are two different sources of motivation behind social behaviour. One reflects a desire to please the self and involves self-focused attention. The other reflects an orientation toward others and their opinions and expectations. The former state, called self-awareness, involves standards and values that are unique to the individual. The latter state involves social norms and is manifested in impression management behaviour. Each state is associated with certain behavioural expectations or standards. When these standards are violated, transgressed, or failed, different forms of negative affect are produced, depending on whether attention is focused on the self or on others at the time the transgression occurs. Transgression or violation of personal standards results in guilt or disappointment for the self-focused person. Violations of social norms or transgressions of normative expectations produce feelings of embarrassment or shame for a person who is in the presence of others. In addition, fear of the negative affect that could be associated with transgression can itself have a significant inhibitory effect on behaviour. Although there are many commonalities in the two motivations and reactions to their transgressions, they are not identical. In fact, in many instances they produce very different types of behaviours. Each, however, serves an important and “civilising” function in a societal context.",

      "abstract": "Objetivos: dos procesos importantes en el ejercicio del poder son mobbing y anulacion de la disidencia. Estos son examinados en este articulo, comparados y contrastados con el objeto de expander las dinamicas negativas organizacionales y profesionales.\r\n\r\nMetodo: las caracteristicas y los patrones del mobbing y la anulacion de la disidencia son examinados. Sus areas de sobre posicion y sus diferencias son analizadas y discutidas.\r\n\r\nResultados: disenso es retar a un grupo dominante o a un grupo de ideas, con frecuencia, como consecuencia, se desencadenan varias represalias, tales como ostracismo, hostigamiento y censura. Con frecuencia los disidentes son sometidos a proceso de mobbing. Sin embargo, hay diferentes procesos involucrados. Algunos blancos de mobbing son elegidos porque se apartan de la norma, no porque reten a ninguna ortodoxia. Algunas formas de anulacion no involucran mobbing: un investigador disidente se le pueden negar tareas, bloquear sus publicaciones o sus solicitudes de financiamiento, pero no se le somete a ningun otro tipo de abuso. El resultado es que individuos o ideas pueden ser anuladas, sin que impliquen mobbing.\r\n\r\nMobbing y anulacion de la disidencia se traslapan en las represalias en contra de los que denuncian irregularidades. Sin embargo, la anulacion de la disidencia puede ocurrir tambien sin denuncias, por ejemplo, cuando investigadores obtienen resultados que no son bienvenidos por parte de grupos poderosos. \r\n\r\nConclusion: una mayor comprension de los procesos de anulacion de la disidencia puede ser util para entender dimensiones de poder utilizadas por algunos grupos en contra de sus oponentes. Mobbing a veces es usado para anular. Los dos procesos comparten muchas estrategias, pero, sin embargo, son diferentes. \r\n\r\nPalabras clave: mobbing, anulacion de la disidencia, denuncia de irregularidades\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nAims: two important processes involving the exercise of power are mobbing and suppression of dissent. These are examined, compared and contrasted with the aim of expanding the understanding of organisational and professional negative dynamics.\r\n\r\nMethods: The characteristic features and patterns of mobbing and suppression of dissent are examined. Areas of overlap and difference are noted and discussed.\r\n\r\nResults: Dissent is a challenge to a dominant group or set of ideas, and often met with various reprisals, such as ostracism, harassment and censorship: dissenters are frequently subject to mobbing. However, there are some different processes involved. Some targets of mobbing are chosen because they are different, not because they are challenging an orthodoxy. Some forms of suppression do not involve mobbing: a dissident researcher might be denied jobs and have publications and grant applications rejected, but not be subject to any personal abuse. The result is that individuals or ideas may be marginalised without the usual features of mobbing. \r\n\r\nMobbing and suppression of dissent overlap with reprisals against whistleblowers. Some whistleblowers are mobbed or suppressed. However, suppression can occur without whistleblowing, for example when researchers obtain results unwelcome to powerful groups.\r\n\r\nConclusion: A greater understanding of processes of suppression can assist mobbing researchers understand the wider dimensions of power used by groups against opponents. Mobbing sometimes is used to suppress. They both share many strategies, but nonetheless they are different.\r\n\r\nKey words: mobbing, suppression of dissent, whistleblowers",

      "title": "Arousal and the Causation of Behaviour",
      "abstract": "Abstract A. A number of very different meanings have been given to the term \"arousal\". These have here been distinguished as follows: (1a) Responsiveness. The likelihood at a particular moment that any one of a number of different stimuli will evoke the response appropriate to it if presented. (ib) Behavioural intensity. A variable which affects the vigour and completeness of whichever response is elicited. (2) Activation. A variable, systematic changes in which determine the kind of response which is possible (e.g. grooming or copulation). (3) Arousal as drive. A variable which explains the association together in time of a group of responses, which may be held to include alert responses, cardiac acceleration, increase in postural tonus and a variety of \"emotional\" responses. (4) Level of sensory input. A variable which regulates the level of sensory input. Mechanisms of selective attention are often included. (5) Property of a functional system in the CNS. The syndrome resulting from increased activity in the ascending activating system. Some or all of these meanings are commonly confused together, which greatly reduces their value in description and analysis. Further it is usually assumed, but with little little firm evidence, that changes in all these variables are continuous and similar in nature from deep sleep to states of extreme wakefulness. These latter states have rarely been clearly characterised. B. For a number of studies the use made of arousal as an explanatory concept is discussed. (1) Changes in responsiveness are important in behaviour, and deserve wider study and theoretical discussion. Data on behavioural intensity are scanty. (2a) Activation models can be used to explain changes in the likelihood of different acts through the course of normal behavioural cycles from one period of sleep to the next. However, except for grooming which tends to occur before and after drowsiness, most acts appear to be affected by a general progressive increase in responsiveness following awakening. The existence of a number of groups of acts, each associated with a particular range of activation (arousal) remains to be proved. (2b) Experimental manipulation of drowsiness in the chick by the administration of hexoses either into the crop or directly into the hypothalamus and other areas of the brain, has at least three relatively independent effects on behaviour. Drowsy periods interfere directly with other responses. At the same time approach to drowsiness is accompanied by a loss of inhibition in responses such as pecking. This is probably due to reduced forebrain activity since it can be reproduced by spreading depression due to KCl. Finally, familiar surroundings are treated as novel immediately after waking. The second and third effects cannot be handled by activation models. (2c) Attempts to vary activation by startling and painful stimuli have shown that some responses may be markedly and unexpectedly facilitated (e.g. copulation by electric shock). However, other startling stimuli may have no effect at all, and recovery from the stimulus does not show the sequential facilitation of a number of different acts which an activation model would predict. (3) Various cardiovascular, respiratory, thermoregulatory and other reflexes, which represent feedforward regulation of the physiological consequences of a predicted increase in exertion, have been held to be indices of heightened arousal. Their use as such is complicated by the fact that the sustained activation of such reflexes in the absence of exertion is inevitably disturbed by feedback regulation of the disturbances which result. Further, a novel stimulus can also produce preparations for immobility (e.g. cardiac deceleration), if the animal examines it carefully rather than at once responding. Attempts to explain changes in these two complexes of reflexes in terms of arousal changes have become so confusing that they are best abandoned. The pattern of alert responses shown at waking is commonly taken as the behavioural counterpart of cortical arousal. However, once waking has occurred it is not possible to identify further patterns of alert responses which can be used to characterise a series of states of progressively increasing arousal. Instead at least two phases of attention, scanning and focussed, can be distinguished over a wide range of states of responsiveness or autonomic arousal. (4) Estimates of the rate of intake or of passage of information are extremely difficult. They are complicated by the fact that studies of selective attention have shown that preliminary recognition of stimuli proceeds in channels other than that in primary use, so that any definition of arousal in terms of information passage must also consider the extent to which attention is confined to the primary channel. Evidence for the homeostatic regulation of arousal, so defined, is indirect and scanty. (5) At least two brain mechanisms are primarily responsible for different phenomena which have been ascribed to arousal. The ascending activating system (AAS) is involved in the appearance of alert responses in a previously drowsy animal, whilst the central mesencephalic grey (CMG) and its diencephalic connections appear to mediate both preparations for exertion and such \"emotional\" responses as piloerection. The relationship between the two systems and, in particular, the effects of sustained activation of the AAS in the absence of effects on the CMG require further study uncomplicated by prior assumptions about the nature of arousal. It is probable that other of the phenomena discussed here are also primarily mediated by relatively independent brain structures (e.g. focussed attention and the hippocampus).",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> The \"New View\" of occupational health and safety (Resilience Engineering, Human and Organization Performance, Safety Differently, Safety-II, etc.), has promised an updated approach to improve safety performance and outcomes. For over a decade it has been the \"hot topic\" with courses, conferences, and professional practice groups globally. However, safety outcomes remain unchanged. <h3>Objective</h3> To determine if application of New View approaches have reduced the rate and severity of unwanted safety events. <h3>Programme Description</h3> A literature review was conducted of related texts, case studies, and journal publications. Podcasts, videos, courses, and presentations by its main proponents were included. Reported implementation was assessed against evidence of outcomes. <h3>Outcomes and Learning</h3> The New View has not lived up to its promise for several reasons. New View approaches assume, and even rebrand, \"old\" practices (learning teams). Many definitions, assertions, and arguments are circular and/or internally inconsistent (\"safety,\" systems are the problem and the solution?). The multiple contextual layers that influence how \"safety happens\" are vaguely understood, dismissed, or missed – peculiar since \"context drives behaviour\" is the central New View assertion. As a result, New View applications have failed to produce evidence any measurable improvements. <h3>Implications</h3> Despite significant issues, the \"New View\" does contain important insights. One is a renewed focus on context in shaping behaviours and actions. Another is how to ensure responses to unwanted events align with effective corrective action and long-term organizational learning. These should be taken to heart by all safety practitioners within their continual improvement efforts. <h3>Conclusion</h3> The New View has yet to demonstrate an advantage over the \"old view.\" To prove otherwise, future research will need to directly and rigorously compare implementation of New View approaches to implemented \"old\" practices, demonstrating if they can achieve better safety outcomes as promised.",

      "abstract": "Careers signify an individual’s personality, habits, and lifestyle. Not finding the right career can lead to poor self-esteem, lowered self-efficacy, a lack of life satisfaction, and even depression. Various negative emotions might be experienced before or during various stages of the career decision-making process and during their performance at work. In the context of “life-career” integrations, there is a need to design specific methods of Acceptance and Commitment therapy for career counselling. Even after many trials and attempts to use ACT for career counselling there still is a dearth of robust empirical data from ACT incorporated career counselling trials. 15 students of age between 14 and 28 were invited as volunteers to participate in 6-sessions (45-minute-long) career counselling programme for each.  A wide variety of issues were discussed including career indecision, procrastination, lack of interest in present career, expectations of family members in career success, high expectations from one self, negative self-evaluation in career, lack of focus in career development, avoidance of experiences related to “evaluation of one’s strengths and challenges”. In keeping with the spirit of the ACT, a non-reductionist and a de-intellectualized framework has been designed as a tool for designing case formulations while using Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in career counselling. The framework outlines some of the prominent questions, discussions, implications of ACT strategies and some examples of metaphors and worksheets.",

From the Mentor’s perspective, many keys to success with Mentees are well known. For example, define goals explicitly. Back up your mentoring commitments with long-term investments of time, required resources, regular meetings, and a research project of mutual interest. Provide emotional and psychological support; directly assist with career development. Train mentees in the anatomy and brevity of a manuscript. Optimal mentoring is often inter-disciplinary, with the primary mentor clearly designated. Mentor on publications, posters and presentations. Regarding “Secrets” (symposium organizers assigned the title of this talk), my first Secret is to assess the passion, enthusiasm and initiative for the work as shown in the eyes, language and demeanor of the potential Mentee. Second, get to know what is &nbsp;in the applicant’s heart, as well as what is in the brain. Third, mentoring often doesn’t stop when the mentee leaves (e.g. mentors recommend their mentees for every possible award). The first phase of the mentoring job isn’t really over until publications first-authored by the Mentee are accepted, and the first job and research grant are secured. Fourth, supervised peer group mentoring can be very effective. In addition, I’ll review ten “Lessons Learned” in mentoring research, publishing, applying for funds and finding work.",

      "abstract": "“How could I apply this information?” Early diagnosis of cerebral palsy (CP) is now possible at 3 months' of age,1 catalyzing a groundswell of novel early intervention research. Treatments using passive movements (such as positioning, facilitated normal movement patterns, and stretching) are ineffective for improving motor skills.2 Moreover, infants might learn that their independent movements are unsuccessful, fostering learned nonuse and the decision not to try. Treatments with promising evidence (such as “Learningames” and “GAME”)2,3 not only include active movements but also foster a strong relationship between motor and cognition. Therapy should promote contingency-based learning4 where infants learn that their purposeful actions have meaningful consequences, enabling control of their world. To be effective, therapy should also harness neuroplasticity5 via the following key ingredients: (1) active child-initiated movements; (2) task specificity; (3) motivation; (4) high intensity; (5) repetition; (6) variability; (7) parent goal setting; (8) parent coaching; and (9) enrichment of the home environment.2,4,5 “What should I be mindful about when applying this information?” Cognitive interventions are necessary, as 1 in 2 children with CP has an intellectual disability.6 Dusing et al's single case is a novel approach, as previous physical therapy research has predominantly focused on motor interventions in isolation, or motor interventions, which may secondarily improve cognitive outcomes.2 Dusing et al take an important step forward in building the evidence base that is urgently required to improve outcomes, particularly in infants with severe motor impairment and at risk of cognitive delay. Further exploration of the intervention efficacy is keenly awaited,7 particularly at earlier ages when the greatest neuroplastic potential exists.4,5 The implications for clinical practice are that by incorporating the neuroplasticity and promising physical therapy evidence together with grounded cognition and the “just right challenge” of blended motor and cognitive skills, Dusing et al's approach may produce better outcomes—suggesting a rethink of pediatric physical therapy.

      "abstract": "Purpose – Mobility is an important aspect of well-being, activity and participation. Retiring from paid work is a transition in later life when people need to adjust to a new daily structure and fill the day with activities other than work. Life-course transitions influence demands for mobility and choice of travel mode as people adapt to new circumstances and learning processes. The purpose of this paper is to explore how mobility strategies develop during the first years of retirement. Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative analysis based on initial interviews with a total of 27 retired people during their first year of retirement and again, about three years later. Findings – Important changes during the first years of retirement included illness or a decline in physical health. Mobility had become a means of achieving certain goals after an illness, such as learning to walk, being able to drive or enjoying the time that was left. While some enjoyed not having commitments, others experienced difficulties in filling the day. The results indicate four dimensions of mobility: means of carrying out activities which are needed and desired; resources for creating activities; a leisure activity in itself; and subordinate to staying at home. Originality/value – Gives a deeper understanding of the mobility challenges people ultimately face in later life, and how these are managed, which is important for transport planning and public health policy aimed at improving mobility, activity participation and well-being in later life.",

      "title": "Intentional and Incidental Self-Control in Ventrolateral PFC",
      "abstract": "The ability to exert self-control over one’s thoughts and behaviors is crucial to successfully navigating the real world in a variety of domains, such as motor control (remaining in your seat during a boring lecture instead of jumping up and running outside), control over risky behavior (taking a sure option so as not to risk losing money), control over immediate temptation (choosing to delay a payment so as to receive a larger one at a later date), and emotional control (remaining composed and suppressing the desire to yell at someone who angered you). Each of these examples requires different actions to successfully exert control over the more desirable yet detrimental action. There are multiple clinical disorders that are related to impairments in control such as ADHD, substance abuse, and pathological gambling. Given the serious problems that may occur if one has difficulty exerting behavioral or affective self-control, it is critical to understand the mechanisms behind successful self-control and how they are changed when self-control ability is impaired. As can be noted by the above examples, self-control is a broad concept that has been defined in many different manners. A good, general definition is that self-control is “the overriding or inhibiting of automatic, habitual, or innate behaviors, urges, emotions, or desires that would otherwise interfere with goal directed behavior” (Muraven et al., 2006). As is noted from this definition, many different methods can be used to study self-control, ranging from inhibiting a motor response to regulating an emotion to suppressing the temptation to eat sweets. In addition to these explicit, intentional forms of self-control, it is possible to exert control without an explicit goal to do so (i.e., automatically or incidentally) given the right situation. For example, in priming paradigms participants are not explicitly aware that they saw a prime, but the implicit encoding of primes can cause incidental behavioral control. Additionally, it is possible to implicitly or incidentally regulate an affective response without awareness (for a review, see Berkman & Lieberman, 2009). It has been asserted that self-control ability may be like a muscle: it is a limited resource that can be fatigued with use, or trained to increase stamina (Muraven, 2010; Muraven & Baumeister, 2000; Muraven et al., 1999). Evidence for this assertion can be found in studies in which participants were required to first exert self-control in one domain, and then subsequently exert self-control in a different domain. The domains used were quite varied and included motor control (the stop-signal paradigm or squeezing a handgrip), controlling one’s temptation to eat sweets or drink alcohol, and emotional control. It was consistently found that participants who were required to exert control two times in a row were worse on the second control task than were those who performed a difficult task that did not require self-control as their first task (such as solving mathematical problems or typing a paragraph quickly",

      "abstract": "Aging is usually associated with cognitive decline, specifically of the executive functions supported by the frontal lobe. However, in line with observations about the preservation or even the increase of well-being with age, it has been suggested that emotion regulation efficiency follows the same developmental trajectory, remaining stable over time, or even increasing. Emotion regulation refers to a family of strategies aiming at modifying the nature, the intensity, the duration or the expression of emotions. These various strategies rely on different neurocognitive processes in order to be efficient. As these processes are differently affected by aging, some of those strategies appear more affected than others. Thus, elderly people tend to use more frequently situation selection strategies, such as avoiding potentially negative situations, while their ability to regulate an emotion using cognitive reappraisal (i.e., changing the meaning of the situation), a strategy drawing heavily on executive resources, appears less efficient than in younger people.",

      "title": "Goals, Plans, and Action Models",
      "abstract": "The messages spoken in everyday conversation are influenced by participants’ goals. Interpersonal scholars have distinguished two types of goals thought to influence the wording of a message: instrumental goals (primary goals) and secondary goals. An instrumental goal is related to a speaker’s primary reason for designing the message. Instrumental goals would include goals such as to ask for a favor, seek information, apologize, give advice, or change the other person’s opinion. Secondary goals pertain to more general concerns. They include goals such as to manage one’s impression, avoid offending the hearer, and act consistently with one’s values. The ability to design a message that pursues an instrumental goal effectively while also addressing (or at least not conflicting with) relevant secondary goals is associated with greater communication competence. Considerable research has sought to explain differences in the ability to design messages that effectively address multiple goals. One such factor appears to be the extent to which a speaker can adapt the language of a message to the communication-relevant features of a specific situation or hearer. If a speaker’s primary goal is to seek a favor, relevant situation features may include the speaker’s right to ask, expected resistance, and qualities of the speaker–hearer relationship. A second behavior associated with the ability to produce multiple-goal messages is suggested by research on cognitive editing. The latter research indicates that the likelihood of producing a message that addresses relevant secondary goals will sometimes depend upon whether a speaker becomes aware, prior to speaking, that a planned message could have an unwanted outcome (e.g., the message may offend the hearer). When such outcomes are anticipated in advance, the message may be left unspoken or edited prior to speaking. The ability to produce a message that achieves a speaker’s goals may also depend on the type of planning that precedes the design of a message. The plan-based theory of strategic communication views plans as hierarchical structures that specify goals and actions at different levels of specificity. The theory holds that a person pursuing a goal first tries to retrieve from memory a preexisting plan that could be modified for the current situation. When that is not possible, speakers must formulate a novel plan. Research employing indicants of fluency suggests that formulating a novel plan (which requires changes at a higher, more abstract level of a plan) makes heavier demands on limited capacity than does modifying an existing plan at a lower level of the hierarchy (e.g., speaking more slowly). Insight into how persons plan what to say has also come from research on imagined interactions, conflict management, anticipating obstacles to compliance, and verbal disagreement tasks. In an effort to better understand the design of messages in interpersonal settings, a number of scholars have proposed models of the cognitive processes and structures thought to be involved in designing, editing, and producing such messages. Action models of this sort, which generate testable hypotheses, draw from work in artificial intelligence, cognitive models of language production, and research on social cognition. Three such models are action assembly theory, the cognitive rules model, and the implicit rules model.",

(See Ministry Document pp.137-8) An Approach Accommodating a Variety of Learning Styles To accommodate the diverse learning preferences within a class, three approaches are available: 1. The teacher can prepare four sets of distinct activities for each unit of study. 2. The teacher can alter the types of activities prepared for each unit so that only one learning style is accommodated per unit of study, but that over the year, learning activities for each preferred learning style are utilized approximately twenty-five percent of the time. 3. The teacher can design units of study that are flexible enough to allow students to operate within their preferred learning style some of the time. This is accomplished by allowing for choice. The first approach would be a truly noble gesture, almost certainly leading the teacher to exhaustion and nervous collapse.

      "title": "Strategic Learning Requires Starting with the End in Mind, but What Is the Appropriate End for Students?",
      "abstract": "Only in education, never in the life of farmer, sailor, merchant, physician, or laboratory experimenter, does knowledge mean primarily a store of information aloof from doing. (Dewey, 1957, ch.14) The power of the learner's purpose or end to shape the processes of academic learning is well established. Indeed, strategies are customarily defined as means-ends analyses in which the actor starts with the end in mind and monitors progress toward that end and makes adjustments as one proceeds. The end we set for ourselves when reading, taking notes and studying powerfully influences the depth of our engagement as well as the tactics, strategies and (largely unconscious) cognitive processes we engage in during the processes of learning. I often point out to my students, for instance, that if they set as their purpose - tacitly or mindfully - to finish or their reading or other assignments, then by clearly establishing that goal they have increased the likelihood they will attain it. The problem with establishing such a purpose as this, however, is that while a student may a task, that end leaves what they aim to out of the task unspecified. a result, they are likely to get through their tasks without getting much of value out of their time and effort. When I discuss this with students, they typically recognize how consciously or unconsciously setting a purpose of merely finishing a task is not likely to be effective in terms of learning. I go on to ask them if getting through the material is not an adaptive purpose, what, then, their goal should be when they sit down to do an academic learning task like read, study or do a problem set. Thinking that they've caught on to what I'm after, they will typically answer with absorb as much information as possible, acquire or most succinctly learn. They are invariably taken aback when I respond that I do not think that this is the most effective end or aim to establish for themselves. they do not ask me directly, their knitted brows and quizzical expressions ask, If learning is not the aim of academic work, what is? In fact, I argue, acquiring knowledge is only halfway to the end that I think they should have in mind when they read, study, do problem sets, and other similar academic work. Learning, acquiring knowledge, is merely the midpoint in me process of academic learning. It is analogous to a musician, in preparation for a recital, learning the sheet music or an athlete, in preparation for a contest, learning the X's and O's of a play (say, in basketball), but not yet learning how to actually play the music or execute the play. In an effort to unpack my thinking for my students on this matter, I start by stating a truism: As your teacher I will never know what you know, I will only know and be able to evaluate what you show me you know. I cannot know the contents of my students' minds and so clearly can not assess or evaluate their knowledge. …",

      "title": "Self‐control: Information, priorities, and resources",
      "abstract": "Abstract People routinely encounter situations in which they have to decide between following their long‐term interests and seeking short‐term pleasure. An act of self‐control occurs when people follow their long‐term interests (e.g., eat healthy food, save money), whereas an act of indulgence occurs when people seek short‐term pleasure (e.g., eat tasty but unhealthy food, spend a lot of money). Avoiding the temptation of short‐term pleasures is often difficult, and sometimes indulgence can lead to harmful outcomes. For this reason, research has understandably focused on uncovering the many factors that can facilitate or undermine self‐control. However, making sense of this voluminous output is difficult without an organizing framework. This article provides such a framework, which organizes previous findings around three psychological processes: information activation and inhibition, priority setting, and responses to resource availability. The article concludes with a discussion of research ideas in areas that will be especially relevant moving forward.",

      "abstract": "Discipline is the practice of teaching or training a person to obey rules or a code of behaviour in both the short and long terms. While punishment is meant to control a child’s behaviour, discipline is meant to develop a child’s behaviour, especially in matters of conduct. It is meant to teach child self-control and confidence by focusing on what it is we want the child to learn and what the child is capable of learning. It is the basis for guiding children on how to be in harmony with themselves and get along with other people. Positive Discipline is the outcome of the activities and experiences that inculcates in the individual virtues of self – control based on Reason and not on Force. It is the outcome of Persuasion and not of Compulsion. It comes out of doing rather than of talking. Like religion it cannot be taught but can only be caught and practiced. Children need to be taught so that they understand and follow social rules. The ultimate goal of discipline is for children to understand their own behaviour, take initiative, be responsible for their choices, and respect themselves and others.",

      "abstract": "Tugas akhir ini bertujuan untuk mengidentifikasi kesulitan belajar yang dialami subyek, kondisi yang menyertai misalnya adanya gangguan konsentrasi, hiperaktif, dan sebagainya serta mencari pendekatan intervensi yang sesuai permasalahan yang dihadapi. Hasil asesmen menunjukkan bahwa subyek memiliki kesulitan menulis. Kondisi ini disebabkan oleh lemahnya koordinasi motorik halus, koordinasi visual motor dan lambatnya proses mental dalam merespon stimulus nonverbal. Kondisi ini membuat subyek kurang mampu mengontrol gerakan tangan saat menulis sehingga tulisannya sulit dibaca, sering melakukan kesalahan dalam menulis dan lambat dalam menyelesaikan tugas-tugas menulis. Beberapa teori yang dirujuk untuk dapat menjelaskan penyebab kesulitan menulis salah satunya adalah definisi kesulitan belajar dari Lerner (2003), yang menyatakan bahwa kesulitan belajar disebabkan oleh adanya disfungsi sistem syaraf yang dapat mengakibatkan adanya gangguan pada gerak motorik, persepsi, memori dan melaksanakan cross modal. Adanya pengaruh lingkungan seperti pola asuh yang kurang konsisten dalam penerapan disiplin, label yang diberikan oleh lingkungan, membuat subyek kurang memiliki motivasi berprestasi dan memiliki kepercayaan diri yang lemah. Pada akhirnya menyebabkan subyek gagal dalam pelajaran dan memiliki prestasi akademik yang rendah. Setelah melihat permasalahan yang dihadapi, maka penulis memutuskan untuk menggunakan metode pendekatan occupational therapy. Dengan metode ini diharapkan dapat membantu subyek melatih koordinasi visual motor yang dibutuhkan untuk menulis, meningkatkan kepercayaan diri dan kemandirian dalam mengerjakan tugas-tugasnya. Desain intervensi ini telah dilaksanakan selama 6 sesi dari 24 kali pertemuan yang direncanakan. Capaian dari pelaksanaan intervensi menunjukkan bahwa kemampuan koordinasi visual motor belum terkontrol dengan baik, kesadaran fonologis masih lemah dan Y belum mandiri dalam menyelesaikan tugas-tugasnya. Selanjutnya saran yang diberikan kepada ibu adalah mengupayakan terlaksananya jadwal kegiatan harian yang telah dibuat, melanjutkan program latihan secara mandiri dan bekerjasama dengan guru untuk memantau subyek. Saran kepada guru kelas, dengan memberi kesempatan memperbaiki tulisan atau menyelesaikan tugas di akhir jam sekolah, memberi kepercayaan dan pujian terhadap keberhasilan yang dicapai.",

      "title": "Can Biofeedback Increase the use of Stress Interventions",
      "abstract": "Undergraduate students struggle to incorporate stress coping strategies or self care routines into their lives that take time (e.g., yoga or exercise). However, there are many useful stress coping methods that do not require a significant time investment (e.g., deep breathing, cognitive reappraisal). These strategies can also be employed in the moment when students are facing an immediate stressor, like writing a final exam. Although these simple strategies exist, students often do not use them in the moment. It is unclear whether this lack of use is due to lack of knowledge , lack of belief that the strategy will be effective, or other factors. Our proposed study will examine these first two ideas. We will recruit participants into one of four groups: 1) deep breathing, 2) cognitive reappraisal, 3) deep breathing with biofeedback, 4) cognitive reappraisal with biofeedback. Physiological (i.e., heart rate variability) and psychological (i.e., perceived stress) measures will be assessed at baseline. Participants will then complete a stress-inducing mathematics task. Next, participants will be taught one of the two stress interventions. The stress task will then be repeated, and participants will be asked to use the intervention during the second stress task, either receiving heart rate variability biofeedback or not. Throughout the rest of the semester, participants will receive email prompts inquiring if they have used the learned intervention. We hypothesize that participants who receive biofeedback, and thus see that the intervention is effective, will use the intervention more often throughout the semester.\r\nPresented in absentia on April 27, 2020 at Student Research Day at MacEwan University in Edmonton, Alberta.

      "abstract": "The drives to make effective business decisions are essentially generated by the need for human (as opposed to professional or expert) comfort, and therefore informed and influenced by the need to make outcomes as predictable and assured as possible, and that those in key organisational and managerial positions turn to the behaviours that they have learned over the entire period of their lives, rather than to professional expertise, knowledge and influence that are available to them in their organisations. This comfort and assurance is in turn driven by the fact that it is corporate rather than personal resources that are at risk and so on the face of it ‘there is little that can go wrong’. This is much more comforting at a human level, and much less dependent on the expertise of others, than relying on emerging techniques and tools such as business and web analytics, which are harder to use professionally, and require dependence and trust at a human level. Influences on behaviour can be seen in the form of: -       Bullying, pulling rank and using power of personality and position to get decisions through an implemented -       Employing uncritical people in senior positions to reinforce comfort and assurance. Influences on decisions can be tracked through relating intended outcomes to actual results and then in turn evaluating the key drivers of the decisions present at the time. The conclusions are that a body of knowledge and understanding in this area needs to be developed and implemented. A body of learning and understanding is required to be brought to the fore, so that those who arrive in top senior and critical positions can undertake some specialist development in this critical area before taking key decisions based on their own preferences and personality and position.",

Another strategy is to think about reasons. In previous research, students who were directed to think about actions increased their study intentions more than did students who were directed to think about reasons. The present experiment tested whether thinking about actions was effective because of idea generation (coming up with the thoughts) or because of mental simulation (imagining the scenarios). In immediate and delayed measures, directed thinking about actions (but not reasons) proved generally more effective when students focused on mental simulation than when they focused on idea generation.

Performance appraisal is the time period in which to summarize the overall progress that an individual or team has made as a result of being coached, and to agree on the new goals that should be set. Common to the performance management/appraisal process are the four following steps. First, desired job performance must be defined. Second, an individual's performance on the job must be observed. Is the person or team's performance excellent, superior, satisfactory, or unacceptable? Third, feedback is provided and specific challenging goals are set as to what the person or team should start doing, stop doing, or be doing differently.

Richardson (michael.richardson@uc.edu). Center for Cognition, Action & Perception, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA; Abstract actors. Interestingly, coordination emerges even when no explicit coordination is required, for example when people are completing separate parts of the task. The present study aims to further investigate this latter form of coordination. The mere presence of a co-actor can influence an individual’s response behavior. For instance, a social Simon effect has been observed when two individuals perform a Go/No-Go response to one of two stimuli in the presence of each other, but not when they perform the same task alone. Such effects are argued to provide evidence that individuals co-represent the task goals and the to-be-performed actions of a co-actor. Motivated by the complex-systems approach, the present study was designed to investigate an alternative hypothesis— that such joint-action effects are due to dynamical (time- evolving) entrainment processes that perturb and couple the behavior of socially situated actors. To investigate this possibility, participants performed a standard Go/No-Go Simon task in joint and individual conditions. The dynamic structure of recorded response times (RTs) was examined using fractal statistics and instantaneous cross-correlation. Consistent with our hypothesis that participants responding in a shared space would become behaviorally coupled, the analyses revealed that RTs in the joint condition displayed decreased fractal structure (indicative of an interpersonal coupling perturbing and constraining participant behavior) compared to the individual condition, and were more correlated across a range of time-scales compared to the RTs of pseudo-pair controls. Collectively, the findings imply that self-organizing dynamic processes might underlie social stimulus-response compatibility effects and shape joint cognitive processes in general. Joint Stimulus-Response Compatibility (JSRC) Over the past decade, a growing amount of research has been conducted investigating joint-action via so-called ‘go/no-go tasks’ (e.g., Sebanz, Knoblich, & Prinz, 2005; Sebanz, Bekkering, & Knoblich, 2006; Tsai, Kuo, Jing, Hung & Tzeng, 2006). In such tasks, participants are instructed to ‘go’ when given a certain stimulus context (e.g., when they are presented with a red stimulus), and to ‘not go’ when given the alternative (e.g. a blue stimulus image). The compatibility aspect of these experiments lies in the spatial orientation of the stimulus relative to the location of the responding individual. For instance, if a stimulus is presented on the same side of a display with respect to where a participant is seated, the response is deemed “compatible”. Alternatively, if a stimulus is presented on the opposite side of a display screen with respect to where a participant is seated, the response is deemed “incompatible”. To examine the effects of such stimulus-response mappings in a joint-action setting, the reaction times (RTs) are compared between two conditions: one in which the participant sits on one side of the display screen and responds alone to one stimulus type (the individual condition), and another where the task requirements are exactly the same except that another participant, seated on the opposite side of the display screen, responds to the alternative stimulus (the joint condition). The general finding is that even though participants in the joint condition are performing the exact same task as in the individual condition, a greater SRC effect exists when two people are completing the task in one another’s presence compared to Keywords: joint action; stimulus-response compatibility; interpersonal coordination; pink noise; dynamical systems Introduction Social interaction is a hallmark of everyday activity.

      "abstract": "Action Learning is a well-proven method to integrate 'task' and 'process', as learning about team and self (process) takes place while delivering on a task or business challenge of real importance (task). An Action Lab® is an intensive Action Learning programme lasting for 5 days, which aims at balancing and integrating individual challenges and business challenges, as well as the 'Action' and the 'Learning' of Action Learning. However, in spite of the aspiration to balance and integrate 'task' and 'process', a tendency and a challenge is experienced: When deeply involved in delivering on a business challenge, participants tend to shy away from or see reflection on the process as disturbing or disrupting. This tendency is like a seesaw: When the pressure of the task increases, awareness about the process goes down. This account of practice aims at exposing and understanding better this tendency by sharing a study looking into what hinders and promotes mindful awareness on the process, while dealing with a business challenge in an Action Lab®. Drawing on the findings, the account of practice will share some recommendations for the Action Learning facilitator to take up the challenge of integrating task and process whenever the seesaw is tipping.",

      "abstract": "In a work place; complaints, concerns and issues arise from time to time and it is important that organizations have in a place an effective grievance handling mechanism to help address such issues as may be raised by the employees. A grievance is any discontent or feeling of unfairness and in the workplace, it should pertain to work. There are majorly five levels of employees in a manufacturing unit or company which is workers/non-managerial at bottom level followed by junior management, middle management, senior management and top management level. As there is a workforce, there always remains a feeling of competition and jealousy among the people. Researches from the past shows that when the expectation of an employee did not get fulfilled or someone who seems to be less deserving gets something, grievances raised. There are several reason identified so far for the arousal of grievance such as workload, incentives, salary hike, certain benefits, promotions, career growth etc. The common factor behind the every case of grievance is expectation of the employees. Some employees found that the grievance mechanism work right whereas some found it not so efficient.",

It is argued that when basic methodological issues intrinsic to psychophysiological and paced/self-paced studies in general are considered, along with an analysis in terms of both short-(trial-by-trial as well as trial components) term and long-term (entire task) psychophysiological and behavioral responses, the task of locating and evaluating stress within the paced/self-paced work environment becomes less elusive.

      "abstract": "Samenvatting Na onvrijwillig baanverlies kunnen mensen gecompliceerde rouwreacties ontwikkelen, waardoor ze het risico lopen om (langer) werkloos te blijven. Dit artikel beschrijft de uitkomsten van een promotieonderzoek naar de kenmerken, risicofactoren en gevolgen van gecompliceerde rouwreacties na baanverlies. Een eerste stap was het ontwikkelen en valideren van een instrument om gecompliceerde rouwreacties na baanverlies te meten. Uit de resultaten blijkt dat gecompliceerde rouwreacties en depressie- en angstklachten van elkaar te onderscheiden zijn en dat gecompliceerde rouwreacties op termijn kunnen leiden tot depressie- en angstklachten. Belangrijke risicofactoren voor de ontwikkeling van gecompliceerde rouwreacties zijn een sterk geloof in een onrechtvaardige wereld, een verminderd gevoel van eigenwaarde en frequent gebruik van ineffectieve copingstrategieën. In dit artikel wordt tevens de ontwikkeling van een vragenlijst voor het meten van negatieve cognities (gerelateerd aan baanverlies) besproken, en wordt een cognitief gedragsmodel geïntroduceerd om gecompliceerde rouwreacties na baanverlies beter te kunnen duiden. De onderzoeksbevindingen impliceren dat er een opeenstapeling kan ontstaan van psychologische en praktische problemen als gecompliceerde rouwreacties niet tijdig worden herkend. Het is dan ook van belang om kwetsbare individuen na ontslag te identificeren en te behandelen.",

      "abstract": "When performing everyday tasks our eyes are usually directed at the object or objects that are relevant for what we are doing at that moment. Sometimes it is advantageous to plan ahead, in which case our eyes can move on before the current action has finished. Moreover the eyes are not necessarily directed towards the object with which we intend to interact, but can also be directed to a position at which we expect information that is critical for successfully performing the task to become available, such as the position at which a ball that one intends to catch or hit will bounce. Thus eye movements may indicate the information that is critical for guiding an action. We measured eye movements (and movements of the head and hand) during an interception task in which subjects had to hit moving virtual targets towards a goal. The eyes were usually pursuing the target as the hand moved towards it. Gaze was seldom directed at the hand. Subjects sometimes glanced at the goal before starting to move their hand. They started systematically shifting their gaze from the target to the goal, presumably in order to see whether their hit was successful, from about 80ms before the hand hit the target, which is about when visual information is no longer useful for guiding the hand to the best position on the target. The position at which the hand intercepted the target hardly varied across trials, so the fact that subjects pursued the target with their eyes, rather than looking at the interception point and waiting for the target to arrive, suggests that we are better at judging where a moving target will be at a given time when we pursue it.",

      "title": "Why do people fail to act? Situational barriers and constraints on ecological behavior",
      "abstract": "The lack of success in dealing with the inconsistency between positive attitudes and ecological behaviors, and in explaining why people fail to act pro-environmentally is still widespread in practice and research. In our view, this has to do with three main reasons: 1) A positivity fallacy the belief shared by many researchers and practitioners that as long as people have the right (or positive) attitudes, intentions, skills, information, etc., the right proecological action should follow; thus, they disregard the importance of negative determinants in explaining the attitude-behavior inconsistency. 2) Lack of a psychological level of explanation; even when negative determinants are considered, the psychological explanation is often disregarded or incompletely identified, with most of the factors identified being socio-economical, or urban planning and architectural, etc. However, factors explaining why people fail to act can also be viewed within a psychological level of explanation, with behavior considered to be the result of an interaction between contextual variables and psychological processes. 3) Underestimation of the unconscious processes influence; contextual effects on behavior can be mediated not only by conscious perception but also by cognitive processes of which people are not aware of. Given these reasons, a model of psychological barriers and constraints is proposed (DN-Work model; “Didn’t work”) trying to integrate negative determinants within a psychological explanatory model of proecological behavior. This model aims to represent a process view regarding how a conflict between pro-ecological and anti-ecological behavioral goals can be produced, given the presence of two types of barriers and constraints: a) perceived barriers and constraints, and b) unconscious barriers and constraints. We briefly present two studies based on this model. These studies address habit accessibility as an unconscious behavioral barrier on ecological decisions to buy organic products, mediated by the effect of behavioral-goals activation from the situation. _________________________________________ *CORRESPONDENCE: RUI GASPAR DE CARVALHO, Faculdade de Psicologia e Ciencias da Educacao, Universidade de Lisboa, Alameda da Universidade, 1649-013 Lisboa, Portugal.

      "title": "A delay-discounting primer.",
      "abstract": "Impulsivity\" is a colloquial term with which nearly everyone has some commerce.Although the term is sometimes used to describe socially appropriate actions (e.g., \"she possessed an impulsive force to succeed in her job\"), more often it refers to problematic behavior.For example, children are described as \"impulsive\" when they take a toy from a peer without considering the likely consequences of doing so (e.g., the peer crying and a reprimand from a caretaker).College students are said to be \"impulsive\" when they choose to attend a party with friends rather than study for an exam scheduled for the next day.And a middle-aged adult might be similarly described if he/she repeatedly buys things \"on impulse\" without considering that payments (with interest) will come due at the end of the month.In this more frequent usage impulsivity describes a tendency to act on a whim and in so doing to disregard a more rational long-term strategy for success.Psychologists have long measured impulsivity as an aspect of personality using selfreport measures such as the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11, Patton, Stanford, & Barratt, 1995) or the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ, Eysenck & Eysenck, 1978).Such measures quantify impulsivity as it occurs in natural human environments by asking individuals to report on their tendencies to \"act on impulse\", \"spend more than I earn\", or \"plan tasks carefully\".Psychologists and psychiatrists have also classified a number of disorders as related to failures of impulse control.These include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, substance abuse, kleptomania, pathological gambling, eating disorders, and trichotillomania, among others (e.g., American Psychiatric Association, 2000;Barkley, 1997).Each of these disorders is characterized either by a failure of attention, a failure to inhibit a response, and/or a failure to consider the probable negative long-term outcomes of the behavior.In accordance with the activities of personality and clinical psychologists, the last several decades have seen experimental psychologists studying similar categories of impulsive behavior.For example, failure of attention (e.g., Robbins, 2002), inability to inhibit pre-potent responses (e.g., Winstanely et al., 2005), and the devaluation of future events (e.g., Ainslie, 1975) have received much attention.With recent findings that the latter two appear to precede and predict drug taking in rodents (Dalley et al., 2007;Diergaarde et al., 2008; Carroll, Anker, Mach, Newman, & Perry, this volume), we anticipate these activities will be the focus of much study of impulsivity and addictive behaviors for years to come.Because the primary focus of the remainder of this book is choice and the failure of future events to affect current decisions, this primer is limited to two types of this form of impulsive choice: (a) preferring a smaller-sooner reward while forgoing a larger-later one and (b) preferring a larger-later aversive outcome over a smaller-sooner negative event.Considering the first of these, when an impulsive choice occurs we may infer that the subjective value of the smaller-sooner reward is greater than the value of the larger-later one.Said another way, the choice suggests that the value of the larger-later reward has been discounted; a process referred to as delay discounting, the primary subject of this text.Delay discounting describes the process of devaluing behavioral outcomes, be they rewarding or aversive events, which happen in the future (and perhaps the past, see Yi, Mitchell & Bickel, this volume).Delay discounting would seem to be of relevance to what personality psychologists measure as \"impulsivity\" but this has not proven to be the case (e.g., Crean, de Wit, & Richards,",

      "title": "Self-Control Interventions",
      "abstract": "Research has shown self-control to be an important factor in determining behavior and outcomes in multiple contexts (e.g., health, education, workplace, interpersonal relationships). Self-control requires effortful pursuit of distal goals in favor of more immediately rewarding, proximal goals, particularly when those goals conflict. Individuals with good self-control exhibit well-developed self-regulatory skills that help them manage these conflicts or avoid them altogether. Over time, such skills enable strategic automization of behaviors in service of distal goals. Although self-control is often viewed as \"trait-like\", research has suggested that self-control can be incrementally improved. A prominent means to improve self-control is through self-control or inhibitory control training, which involves repeated engagement in tasks that require inhibition of prepotent responses. Repetition of behaviors to develop habits and training individuals on inhibitory control tasks have been shown to be effective in improving self-control. There is a need for more high-quality studies using ecologically valid behavioral measures and long-term follow-up to provide more robust evidence on self-control training interventions. Preliminary guidelines for self-control interventions suggest that practicing self-control for a specified period of time in a particular domain or self-control will improve self-control in other domains. However, research needs to develop protocols involving meaningful, engaging training tasks that are acceptable in \"real-world\" contexts.",

Mental health is very important aspect of person’s life. Mental Health refers to a state of wellbeing in which person realizes his/her own abilities, can manage normal stresses of life, work productively and effectively, and able to make contribution to his/her community [1]. If the person is not able to realize his/her abilities to deal with demand of the workplace, not able to manage normal stress of workplace life then he/she may have develop some kind of mental health problems. When it comes to the workplace there are many factors which influenced the person’s mental health. Several Factors like, shift work, monotony at work, negative emotions, unclear roles, and day to day problems, due to these factors people develop some of the mental health problems such as negative affect, depression, and psychological distress. Some specific task may carry a higher personal risk for the employee, which influenced the mental health further lead to the cause for mental disorders, and then it may lead to harmful use of alcohol or psychoactive drugs. Risk is more in those situations where there is a lack of social support and team cohesion at the workplace [2]. The present article also highlighted the need to organize mental health workshop for alcoholics at the workplace so that the positive mental health can be enhanced.",

Individuals who experience recognize that a shift in career (i.e., being ready to move on or change direction, being downsized, not earning a sufficient salary, or failing to get a promotion) is a signal that provides them with the impetus to develop stronger life/career understanding in order to meet the demands of the workplace, employment market, and life in general. is especially applicable to the growing population of forced or volunteer entrepreneurs, experienced workers entering encore careers, and young people who cannot find jobs in their area of specialty and who choose to moonlight to apply untested, but highly motivated skills. The article provides a and Sustainable Lifework Model and Process that guides the reader in creating a map that addresses five key questions: (a) Who am I? (personal strengths), (b), How do my personal strengths meet the needs of an eco-conscious society? (research), (c) Where is life taking me? (goals/intention), (d) What is life suggestion? (action plan and timeline), (e) What are my sources of support? (internal and external). Futurists forecast that, in the long run, there is a need for the world to slow down due to the global over-consumption of finite resources. This article supports individuals who would be proud to have a life of quality, not necessarily quantity. The approach to life is about the quality of relationships, not the fear-based drive for security. Introduction When exploring a new route, a hiker usually takes along a map or a guide. When driving to a new place, a driver refers to his map or electronic mapping device. Similarly, when exploring a new career path, individuals in transition can benefit by mapping out their journey and consulting career counselors, coaches, and business consultants. The authors of this article, all of whom are full or part-time university instructors and educators of both traditional age and adult students, have entered their third quarter of life. Given the large population of Baby Boomers who are drawn, or being squeezed by the economy, to exploring active aging and alternative career routes, this article is directed primarily to the Boomer population. As the post-World War Il babies turn 60, there is an increased interest in making the best of each day and decade. This may require a change of lifestyle, work style and even mind style. While this paper is primarily directed to the Boomer generation, Slow Career is an inter-generational concept. With the current economy as it is, many young people cannot find corporate jobs when they graduate and are consciously turning away from corporate greed or unsatisfactory career choices. Craving community, service, family, and sustainability, they are opting to start their own businesses or work in service professions. Society needs a new kind of knowledge worker (professionals involved in handling and using information, such as lawyers, doctors, engineers, IT professionals). Because knowledge is rapidly replicated worldwide in the 21st century, society requires creative knowledge workers with heart (i.e., individuals with social and environmental consciousness). Pink (2010) says we have a deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world. Of the authors, two of us are business professionals, and the third is a career and life transition counselor. By using the style of Hermeneutic inquiry in this paper, we discuss both our own and our students'/clients' evolving interest in Slow Career (Gelardin, 2009: March 31). The concept, defined below, is key to making life and work choices. It integrates spiritual, physical, and intellectual wellbeing, as well as financial requirements, care for the environment, service to both local and global community, and family responsibilities. …",

      "abstract": "La nostra capacita di prestare attenzione e limitata nel tempo. Quante volte capita di sorprenderci distratti o di commettere banali errori di distrazione o dimenticanze nel corso della giornata? Per ovviare a questo decadimento dell’attenzione tendiamo a concederci delle pause rigenerative, a “staccare la spina” per qualche minuto. Questo fenomeno non e circoscritto ai lavoratori o agli adulti, ma interessa anche i bambini e, conseguentemente, anche loro necessitano di brevi pause intercalate al lavoro.\r\nQuesto lavoro di Bachelor si prefigge di ricercare come una transizione proposta tra un’attivita e la seguente possa apportare benefici in termini di una maggiore attenzione degli allievi e una diminuzione degli errori da essi commessi.\r\nDurante la sperimentazione, sono stati effettuati dei cicli di osservazione in cui, al termine di una prima unita didattica di lavoro, si introduceva immediatamente la seconda attivita di 45 minuti, rispettivamente si proponeva un’attivita di transizione sotto forma di gioco cognitivo statico o gioco motorio tra le due unita didattiche.\r\nI dati raccolti, concernenti sia il numero di volte che un allievo si mostrava distratto, sia il numero di errori totali commessi dalla classe nel corso della seconda unita didattica, hanno evidenziato come proporre un’attivita di transizione qualsiasi a cavallo delle due attivita disciplinari proposte apporti benefici consistenti sia per quanto concerne l’attenzione dell’allievo, sia per il numero di errori commessi dalla classe.

      "abstract": "Las personas con altas capacidades se caracterizan por su particular curiosidad e interesesvariados, un alto nivel de aptitud verbal, un aprendizaje veloz y un buen razonamiento. Sin embargo, también pueden ser socialmente vulnerables debido a sus escasas competencias sociales. En ciertos casos también suelen mostrarse poco flexibles y con poca autorregulación emocional. Se han utilizado varias técnicas de intervención para mejorar estos procesos cognitivos y ejecutivos (metacognitivos y emocionales), entre ellos el Mindfulness o atención plena en el “aquí y ahora”, que se encarga de aumentar la concienciación del presente, desarrollar la autoobservación y promover el bienestar social y emocional. El objetivo del presente trabajo es analizar el efecto del Mindfulness en los procesos ejecutivos y cognitivos en los niños con altas capacidades, a través de una revisión exhaustiva de artículos originales publicados en los últimos cinco años. Se obtuvieron 16 artículos, de los cuales ocho fueron estudios cuantitativos y ocho artículos de revisión. Estos trabajos concluyen que el uso del Mindfulness ayuda a manejar adecuadamente los procesos ejecutivos – cognitivos y a desarrollar las habilidades sociales. Por otro lado, estos procesos se potencian cuando la familia participa en esta forma de intervención.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Action/reaction units develop conflict moment-by-moment in a confrontation between two characters and thereby advance the plot in a plausible, logical cause-and-effect manner. Simple A/R units are straightforward and easily understood, but when characters behave in illogical or misunderstood ways, complex A/R units requiring emotion and internalization are necessary to assist readers in following the story action. Numerous pitfalls abound in writing conflict, including failure to put action before reaction, gaps or tangents between action and reaction, too many characters interacting in the scene’s conflict, skipping important details, and protagonists reacting to their own dialogue or behavior instead of a back-and-forth exchange between protagonist and antagonist",

      "title": "Implementation Intentions and Generative Strategies in Prospective Memory Retrieval",
      "abstract": "Many of the tasks in our daily lives are prospective memory (PM) tasks. In a PM task, we form an intention to be completed later. Examples of PM tasks would be remembering to give a message to a friend, or remembering to take a dose of medication after a certain interval of time. The key in a PM task is that the intended action is delayed for either a specific event (giving the message when you see the friend), or after a set amount of elapsed time (taking the medication after so many hours). In the PM literature, one specific type of event-based PM task is further described as focal (Einstein et al., 2005). If the processing required to perform the ongoing task completely overlaps with the processing required to process the PM target, the PM task is described as focal (see Einstein et al., 2005). For example, in the context of a choose the best task, a focal PM task would be to ask participants to press a certain key whenever they encounter a specific word. Processing words and their semantic meanings in the service of the ongoing task would completely overlap with the processing necessary to notice the PM target. In contrast, a non-focal PM task in the context of a choose the best task would be to ask participants to press a certain key whenever they encounter a specific syllable. This would be non-focal because in order to perform the synonym task successfully, people are likely processing each word in terms of a whole semantic unit, rather than accessing the information of its component syllables. Here, the processing required to perform the ongoing task does not overlap with the processing required to process the PM target. Thus, focality of a PM task considers the relationship between ongoing task processing and PM target processing. Focal, event-based PM (e.g., Einstein et al., 2005; McDaniel, Guynn, Einstein, & Breneiser, 2004) is the focus of the current study. Gollwitzer and colleagues (Cohen & Gollwitzer, 2007; Gollwitzer, 1993, 1999; Gollwitzer & Shaal, 1998) have examined goal pursuit and goal directed behavior, especially the issue of initiating goal-directed actions. These implementation intentions can be described as condition-action statements which are structured as, When I am in X situation, I intend to perform action Y (Gollwitzer, 1993). Thus, the expected future condition is linked to a specific action (Gollwitzer, 1993). Implementation intentions are assumed to differ from mere goal intentions (I intend to reach goal Y) in that they promote the initiation of goal-directed behaviors toward achieving the goal (Gollwitzer, 1993, p. 187). Implementation intentions have significantly improved compliance in many studies and across a wide variety of settings involving goal-directed behavior, including attending cervical cancer screenings (Sheeran & Orbell, 2000), and decreasing participants' reports of dietary fat intake (Armitage, 2004). In various studies, implementation intentions have improved performance for PM tasks in older adults (Chasteen, Park, & Schwarz, 2001; Liu & Park, 2004). In spite of these promising results, little work has been done to examine implementation intentions and PM in younger adults. For the few studies conducted, the results are mixed (e.g., Einstein, McDaniel, Williford, Pagan, & Dismukes, 2003; McDaniel, Howard, & Butler, 2008). Einstein et al. (2003, Experiment 3) found no effect of implementation intentions on delay-execute PM performance. Participants were given an ongoing task with an embedded PM intention (press the slash key). Implementation intentions were manipulated between-subjects, and participants in the implementation intention condition were instructed to visualize the PM target and imagine themselves pressing the slash key at the appropriate time. Participants were given 6 seconds for visualization. Results indicated that implementation intentions did not improve PM performance relative to control participants. …",

      "abstract": "Introducción Como consecuencia de la pandemia del Covid-19 se produjeron cambios en la sociedad, siendo la educación uno de los servicios que presentó modificaciones radicales en la metodología de enseñanza y aprendizaje. Los docentes no se encontraban cualificados para una transición de trabajo presencial a teletrabajo (1) y no sólo se vieron afectados por el cambio metodológico, sino también por sus dinámicas familiares, adaptación física del hogar, desencadenando así alteraciones de la salud mental tales como, ansiedad, sobrecarga de trabajo, desgaste profesional y estrés (2). Según algunos autores el estrés surge como resultado de una relación particular entre la persona y el entorno (3). Es así, como los docentes al hacer una evaluación cognitiva en que está inmerso, sumado al elemento emocional, despliega esfuerzos cognitivos y conductuales para manejar las demandas específicas externas y/o internas que son evaluadas como excedentes de los recursos del individuo, impidiendo la autorregulación de sus respuestas emocionales ante situaciones estresantes (4). La Organización Internacional del Trabajo, reconoce que el estrés se ha convertido en un riesgo ocupacional significativo de la docencia (4). Objetivos 1. Describir las características sociodemográficas y condiciones laborales de los docentes de Chillán y Laja,durante la pandemia. 2. Determinar el estrés percibido de los docentes de Chillán y Laja en la pandemia. 3. Determinar la relación entre estrés percibido con las características sociodemográficas y condiciones laborales de los docentes durante la pandemia. Método Diseño descriptivo correlacional, de corte transversal. La muestra fueron 92 docentes de las comunas de Laja y Chillán. Dentro de los criterios de inclusión se consideró a los docentes que realizaron actividades de educación presencial, híbrida o remota, se excluyeron los docentes que llevan menos de 30 días trabajando o estaban con licencia médica. Se aplico un cuestionario sociodemográfico y laboral, además de la Escala de Estrés Percibido que posee una estructura bidimensional, y cuenta con validación en Chile, con un Alfa de Cronbach de 0,79. Los datos fueron analizados con frecuencias relativas y absolutas para las variables cualitativas, y para las variables cuantitativas se usó medidas de resumen, las relaciones entre el estrés, las condiciones sociodemográficas y condiciones laborales se compararon las medidas de resumen del estrés por cada categoría de variables. El análisis estadístico fue con el programa SPSS versión 25.0. Se consideró la aplicación de consentimiento informado, autorización del director del establecimiento y la aprobación del Comité de Ética de la Universidad del Bío-Bío. Resultados principales La media de edad fue de 39 años, el 71,7% fueron mujeres, el 43,5% estaban solteros, el 64,1%, trabaja con contrato de planta, el 43,5% lleva ejerciendo entre 6 a 15 años y el 77,2% estaba con modalidad de trabajo híbrida. El 62% del total de la muestra se clasificó como “de vez en cuando estresado” y el 33,7% clasificó como “a menudo estresado”. No se encontraron relaciones significativas entre las variables sociodemográficas y condiciones laborales con el estrés percibido. Conclusiones Se aprecia que más de 90 % de los docentes, reconocen situaciones de la vida cotidiana como estresantes durante la pandemia, por lo cual es importante implementar postpandemia estrategias de intervención de la salud mental de los docentes, con la finalidad de prevenir complicaciones, favorecer la calidad de vida personal y laboral, y evitar un impacto negativo en la calidad de la docencia entregada.",

      "title": "La vigilancia como función cognitiva en la relación entre el ejercicio físico regular y la cognición",
      "abstract": "espanolActualmente, nadie duda acerca de los beneficios que la practica regular de ejercicio fisico tiene para la salud. De hecho, organizaciones de relevancia mundial tales como la Organizacion Mundial de la Salud (OMS), no solo destacan los efectos beneficiosos sobre la salud fisica, sino que tambien senala hacia beneficios sobre la salud mental y psicologica (reduccion de estres, depresion, ansiedad). Estudios recientes han demostrado que el ejercicio fisico no solo previene la aparicion de enfermedades cronicas y trastornos mentales, sino que tambien ejerce una influencia significativa sobre mecanismos y procesos cognitivos tales como atencion, control cognitivo, memoria, percepcion o aprendizaje. No obstante, aunque se ha avanzado significativamente en este importante campo de conocimiento, no se conoce demasiado sobre este importante una de las funciones clave al rendimiento cognitivo general para las capacidades cognitivas en humanos, i.e., atencion sostenida o vigilancia. El objetivo principal del presente articulo es el de conocer de forma teorica la asociacion existente entre la practica cronica de ejercicio fisico (que resulta en diferencias individuales en capacidad fisica cardiovascular) y la funcion cognitiva (atencion sostenida en particular). Entendiendo a la atencion sostenida como una funcion cognitiva de alto nivel, que determina la disposicion para responder a estimulos relevantes y la capacidad para asignar o distribuir los recursos atencionales de manera eficiente a lo largo del tiempo. Asi, en el presente articulo se mostrara el ejercicio fisico y/o el nivel de aptitud cardiovascular como un factor que podria aportar conocimiento positivo sobre la capacidad para mantener la atencion. EnglishCurrently, Nobody doubts that regular physical exercise has beneficial effects on health. In fact, the World Health Organization highlights, not only the positive effects on physical health, but also points to benefits on mental and psychological health (reducing stress, depression, or anxiety). Recent studies have shown that physical exercise not only prevents the development of chronic diseases and mental disorders, but also exerts a significant influence on mechanisms and cognitive processes such as attention, cognitive control, memory, perception and learning. However, little is known about an inherent function to the general cognitive performance that is critical to cognitive abilities in humans, i.e., sustained attention. The general purpose of this work was give theoretical knowledge of Sustained or vigilant attention is a higher-order cognitive function that determines the readiness to respond to relevant stimuli and the capacity to effectively allocate attentional resources over time. In such case, the present work shown aerobic fitness as a factor that might positively contribute on the ability to sustain attention.",

      "abstract": "conceptualization (Theorize from the experience) Reflective observation (Reflecting on the experience) Active experimentation (Trying the lesson learnt) Social network games: factors influencing players’ engagement 80 Strengths: their enthusiasm and engagement in the activity. Weaknesses: their conclusions are not always accurate since they do not reserve time to consolidate their findings. Often they tend to center all the activities around themselves and they do not let everyone in the group contribute equally. Reflectors Reflectors are those learners who consider all the pros and cons when facing a new challenge. These learners tent to be cautious before making any assumption. When working in a group, reflectors are often quieter than other members and they enjoy observing the action making. They need to collect data and information for each topic in consideration before starting to work on it. Strengths: their tolerance and their critical observation skills. Weaknesses: their lack of decision-making. Theorists Theorists are those learners who adjust and integrate observation into a complex logical process. These type of learners study theories and they try to spot those theories in a series of fact and events. They are perfectionist and tidy and they work within a pre-establish scheme where everything has to fit. Theorists are extremely objective when approaching a task and they dislike any form of subjectivity. Strengths: their analytical skills and their logic. Weaknesses: Their rigidity for anything that does not fit their logical mindset. For this reason, it is often difficult for them to work with activists. Pragmatisms Pragmatists are those learners who are willing to experiment new ideas and theories in practice scenarios. These types of learners enjoy practical solutions for skill development based on the Social network games: factors influencing players’ engagement 81 feedback obtained. Opposite to the theorists, pragmatisms first experiment, and then they drawn theories. Strengths: their skills to get straight to the point and their realism. Weaknesses: their tendency to seize first findings for the solution of the entire problem. Influence of the learning style on the research The learning style that reflects the researcher is a mix of theorist and reflector style. In order to validate this hypothesis, the researcher has undertaken a learning style questionnaire provided during the course “Project Management tools and techniques”. The higher score have been obtained by the theorist style, just followed by the reflector style. The researcher believes that being in between two learning style is positive since there are more strengths to put in practice. On the other hand, it is also true that there are more weaknesses to take into account. The two learning styles had a huge influence on her approach to the M.B.A. modules and to this dissertation. During the selection of the dissertation’s topic, the researcher has benefited from the theorist strengths of being good at asking probing questions. As well, the disciplined approach that characterizes theorists has helped on being structured on developing the dissertation draft and on the delivery time also. The researcher has planned word count, contents to fit and dead line for each sections based on academic books about the argument. As well as the reason behind the research topic: all the possibilities have been analyzed carefully and the final decision has been made considering personal interests together with the availability of information about the topic. On the other hand, skills that belong to the reflectors have helped the researcher to draw logical conclusions from the data collected and to tie every section of the dissertation research (literature review, data analysis and conclusions) in a logical matter. The researcher has been penalized by her tendency to slow down when making certain decisions. This dissertation has been developed in a very short time limit. In this scenario, there is no time to stop and reflex about the same concept over and over again like a reflector. As well, the researcher’s low tolerance for disorder and ambiguity has created some difficulties. For instance, during the development of the data analysis section, the researcher aimed to have perfect graphs Social network games: factors influencing players’ engagement 82 (such consistency on the colour, size etc.), but this has be left aside in order to favour the flow of thinking. By being able to finalize this dissertation, the researcher believes to have been able to overcome her limitations. It has been difficult to find a balance between using researcher’s skills at their best and overcoming weaknesses that may have compromised the draft of the dissertation. The researcher strongly believes that this dissertation has been a great exercise for developing new skills and overcoming limitations, which has concluded a two years course in which those skills and limitation had been faced. Development of skills During the writing of this dissertation, the researcher has faced some critical experiences, which have been turned into a great way of learning. First of all, even though the researcher wrote a thesis for her previous university degree, this type of dissertation has been totally a new experience. The researcher was never introduced to a dissertation structure before, and terms like “qualitative and qualitative analysis” were absolutely new. It has been though to learn these notions, but this has definitely increased the knowledge acquired in this Master. The researcher has also experienced some issues in order to find a topic to suit a Master level. It has been fundamental to gather information among specialist in the sectors undertaken, asking advices to professors and talking to formal students in order to have an idea of the experience to face. Among the multiple skills the researcher has developed, the following are the most remarkable: Cognitive skills The researcher has a humanistic academic past. Developing this dissertation, the researcher has finally learnt business models and implications that are applicable for a numerous of professional profiles. The researcher is now confident on stepping up and says her opinion about economic topics at work and in the private life both. Social network games: factors influencing players’ engagement 83 Research and investigative skills The researcher has understood the importance of research. A good paper is based on influential articles and primary secondary researches which can be trusted only if they fulfill determinate criteria. Identifying these criteria was an area of lack, so the researcher has learnt how to find accurate resources that guarantee reliability and precision to papers. This skill improved allowed the researcher to be identified as a Monitor Evaluator from her peers recently and it has been considered as a valuable quality. The researcher is able to identify reliable database and professional service networks that can be used for future work related goals. Numeracy and quantitative skills The researcher knew how to pull numbers and stats using different software (Excel, SPSS among all), but she was often unable to fulfill the expectation when it comes to explaining findings and advocacy. Being able to realize a thesis based on quantitative research, the researcher feels now empowered to advocate for the data collected and present findings in an accurate manner. Writing skills The researcher is not a native English speaker, therefore writing the dissertation in English has been a massive effort. There were many occasions during the progress of this dissertation where the researcher faced difficulties. By being able to respect the word count and being understandable, the researcher has improved her writing skills. This dissertation can be used as a proof that the researcher is able to lead project in English to possible work requests. Application of learning The researcher has a previous experience of over three years in multinational companies. This experience has triggered her decision for undertaking a Master course in Business Administration since the outcome proposed was to expand the knowledge on business related subjects in various Social network games: factors influencing players’ engagement 84 scenarios. The researcher can now confirms to be able to identify patterns on several businesses and being able to apply theories learned on real word situations. The dissertation has been an exercise to improve the time management skills. The researcher is now practical and realistic when approaching deadlines and she is able to prioritize (and reprioritize) tasks depending on the urgency of each. With the regards to the M.B.A course and all the modules undertaken, the researcher has developed verbal and presentation skills, as well as team working skills. The researcher is now able to identify her role within a group. . Nowadays, big companies are in favor of the cooperation between several departments and the researcher is now able to approach the group work with more confidence. To sum up, thanks to the multiple skills improved and gained thanks to this dissertation and to this Master course, the researcher believes she will be a valuable fit for several roles in different organizations.

      "abstract": "Abstract : Creativity, the generation of new ideas that are both novel and appropriate is essential to understanding complex problems, and can be enhanced by both life experience diversity and cognitive diversity, as well as by delayed evaluation during problem solving, or can be inhibited by a lack of diversity and cognitive entrenchment. In essence, creativity is dependent on associating a wide array of novel or divergent experiences to form a new, appropriate, idea, however closed institutions such as the U.S. Army have limited pools of divergence from which to draw, relying instead on the commanders experience, which may provide exposure to many ideas over a lengthy career, but the ability to associate them into new creative ideas may be inhibited over the same time period. The same skills that allow a commander to be successful while solving routine or simple problems may actually inhibit his ability to solve complex or ill-structured problems. The importance of enhancing creativity is to balance the concrete specialized experiences, education, and intuitions developed in successful leaders with more abstract and diverse creativity in order to promote better understanding.",

Non-custodial CBTs are more concerned with employing care. In contrast, custodial treatments that lock up young offenders are focused more on the security and safety of the staff and other inmates. The notion of care in social work refers to providing “support” or anything that may be able to assist the offender in dealing with his personal or social problems. Control, on the other hand, refers to activities such as the different forms of disciplinary measures that are directed towards regulating the behavior of the offender. In this chapter, focus is given to the issue of whether these two different approaches can coexist.",

      "abstract": "At the time of teaching, the teacher has several methods used to support the learning program that has been made. One method used to train techniques is the method of distribution practice. The method of distribution practice is the principle of regulating the turnover of material in learning that is carried out through alternating arrangements of rest periods. Building knowledge has focused on distributed practices to make learning and remembering something new, easier for the brain. This paper aims to describe the steps for deciding to study time to improve the learning environment by learning distributed practice. From the discussion concluded: 1) Subjectively and comparatively there are types of distributed practice learning, namely distributed practice itself and mass practice. to show the two extremes of the break-to-work continuum, involving longer periods of rest and shorter periods of active practice (that is, work), and mass practices that involve less time in rest and longer in active practice (working) . Objectively to define both distribution schedules, especially when distributive effects on skills are continuously different from one training session. In this situation, the practice distributed can be defined as a training session in which the amount of rest time equals or greater than the amount of time in work, while a shared practice is then defined as a practice schedule where there is a greater amount of time in work than rest. 2) in general, most students learn a lot before and during the exam and ultimately are unable to remember most of the texts learned during the exam. 3) The act of learning in school is aimless, while activities that give rise to learning in the real world are goals. When the learning environment has an appropriate design, student attitudes and motivation increase. In addition to the academic success of students, he found that learning makes students happy during the learning process by giving them a rich learning experience, on the other hand psychological transformation is based on prerequisite skills, knowledge, and motives. When these prerequisites have not been developed in students, generic contradictions arise. The act of learning [not an activity] is a prerequisite for obtaining certain material, but they cannot be formed (obtained, learned) without being involved in the appropriate material. It is impossible to learn the appropriate learning actions first and then study the material. The actions, content, structure, and course are determined by the object; there is no formal action without content or aimlessly to be transferred to different materials. 4) Today The way to deliver academic information can only be understood by students when they join several new features of the academic learning environment that characterize the digital age. Without knowing how to take advantage of these new features, scholars and graduates will experience successful difficulties in the global economy characterized by three main features: competition and cost, globalization, and information intimacy.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Cravings can be overt, so that we are aware of them, or they can be covert and show up in indirect ways such as irritability. Cravings tend to be more frequent and stronger in the early phases of recovery. Cravings for substances are triggered by something external (people, places, events, experiences, or objects) or internal (feelings, thoughts, or memories). Cravings vary in intensity from low to severe, and also in how they show in thoughts or how they make one feel physically. The goals of this chapter are to learn strategies that will help clients prevent or manage their cravings, to begin tracking cravings daily over the next few months, and to identify the things that trigger client cravings in order to plan coping strategies.",

Teaching practice is seen as an activity based on a motive and carried out through a set of actions, with special attention given to the way in which students’ mathematical reasoning is promoted. The study is carried out in the classroom of an experienced grade 9 teacher. Data collection is based on classroom observations (video and audio recorded), supplemented by conversations with the teacher, and data analysis is carried out based on a model for the different teachers’ actions. The results show that discussions are strongly marked by challenging actions which arise from suggesting and guiding actions as well as from previous challenging actions. They also show the importance of the guiding actions, which sometimes follow each other or else alternate with challenging actions. A discussion segment usually ends with a suggesting action that summarizes the main aspects to be recorded by the students. In the implementation of these action plans there are numerous problems that the teacher needs to face, some of which appear in a recurrent way.",

What often happens then is that one loses direction. Lack or feedback can cause dilemmas about change in many different ways. Lack of internal feedback can contribute to the creation and perpetuation of incorrect beliefs about different individuals and work groups within the organization, informal power structures obstructing the formal power structures, and other dynamics that cause resistance to change and the system to become stuck and eventually reduce its productivity. The quality of the consultant's motivation is often a very important part of the context of the process of accepting a request and of carrying out a consultation process.",

Whenever it is shared, it binds peopletogether and increases happiness among them and alsoin their surroundings. Laughter is documented to havemany benefits being classified as (1) Physical HealthBenefits: such as boosting up of our immunity, loweringof our stress hormones level, decreasing our pain,relaxation of our muscles, prevention of heart diseasesetc. (2) Mental Health Benefits: like it adds joy and zestto our lives, eases the states of anxiety and fear whichwe often come across, relieves our stress and plays arole in improving our mood status etc. (3) Social Benefits:such as it strengthens our bond of relationships, enhancesthe spirit of teamwork, helps us to defuse conflict etc.1When we laugh a process starts which then reduces thelevel of stress hormones in our body. It stimulates andincreases our immune cells so that we can fight withthe infections with the help of our infection fightingantibodies. In this way we become strong by developingresistance to diseases. Laughter triggers the release ofendorphins which promote an overall sense of wellbeingin our mind and body and can even temporarilypromote relief of pain.2",

If we want to understand why some children become more frustrated or irritable than other children, we need to study the brain, because the brain controls behavior. To understand irritability in children, we need to learn about three things. First, we need to know how children recognize the emotions of other people, because if children are not able to understand the emotions of other children, they might get frustrated. Second, we need to learn about how it feels to get a reward, because children who expect a reward, but do not get one, can become frustrated. Finally, we can ask how we can teach children to cope better. Learning about how children’s brains work can help us to understand why some children become frustrated or irritable more quickly than other children.",

      "abstract": "Other than talent and opportunity, what makes some people more successful than others? One important determinant of success is self-control - the capacity to regulate attention, emotion, and behavior in the presence of temptation. A second important determinant of success is grit - the tenacious pursuit of a dominant superordinate goal despite setbacks. Self-control and grit are strongly correlated, but not perfectly so. This means that some people with high levels of self-control capably handle temptations but do not consistently pursue a dominant goal. Likewise, some exceptional achievers are prodigiously gritty but succumb to temptations in domains other than their chosen life passion. Understanding how goals are hierarchically organized clarifies how self-control and grit are related but distinct: Self-control entails aligning actions with any valued goal despite momentarily more-alluring alternatives; grit, in contrast, entails having and working assiduously toward a single challenging superordinate goal through thick and thin, on a timescale of years or even decades. Although both self-control and grit entail aligning actions with intentions, they operate in different ways and at different time scales. This hierarchical goal framework suggests novel directions for basic and applied research on success.",

      "title": "Inappropriate transcription (bias?) at academic meetings and conferences",
      "abstract": "Bias essentially refers to an inclination, diversion, or deviation. In terms of epidemiology and statistics, bias refers to an error in the design or development of a study that leads to inadequate interpretations (deviation from the truth), as a result of a systematic error in the study. However, there are different classifications of study biases.1,2 The clinical information of many studies is presented at various academic meetings. At the university level, recent publications in the literature are discussed at events such as journal clubs, and case thematic presentations, as well as bedside discussions. The principal objectives of these meetings are to teach the student to understand and make a systematic and accurate analysis of the medical literature; another objective could be to update students and professors on topics of common interest.3–5 There is no consensus about the modalities of these meetings, and in some cases background questions are asked, while in other cases more elaborate Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome and Time (PICOT) questions are used. The fact that the student is being assessed involves having an adequate understanding of the article to share that knowledge with his/her peers and professors. The student shall then elaborate on medical, epidemiological, and statistical concepts of the study being discussed; however, being assessed may lead the student to make the decision of omitting some aspects of the study. This may be due to different reasons, including: (1) not wanting to be questioned about a topic he/she does not master; (2) not wanting to stand out showing an in depth knowledge of the article, delivering the missing data when asked; (3) to err in the reading and then in the transcription of the study, accidentally omitting information. Any of these circumstances may result in a lack of veracity in the presentation of the methods or results of the trials, generating an inappropriate analysis of the results by the recipients of the information which may lead to a deviation from reality. This is called transcription bias, since although there is a proper way to present the data in scientific articles and this same approach may be used to submit information thereof, occasionally the mode of presentation may vary and hence ignore important and relevant information for the comprehension and analysis of the article or subject matter. The student could argue that the information was not available in the article or in the research protocol (usually published in clinical experiments and systematic reviews); however, this rises some doubts about the reason for ignoring the information. Similarly, it must be emphasized that the meeting should predefine the strategies to ensure transparency in the development of the meeting. How significant, methodical, and frequent is this limitation? One should try to establish the frequency, the type of students where this happens, under what circumstances, and also the severity of the impact, as this issue has not been previously described. It should be noted that bias is typically “systematic”, which is easy to measure in this setting. Understanding that this situation may arise forces us to question the scope and the value of these academic meetings as tools for assessing the mode of presentation, the knowledge about epidemiology, statistics, and medical topics in particular. Consequently, it is possible to establish mechanisms to mitigate the effect of these deviations through controls, either by peers or professors that allow for the identification of omissions in the presentation, as a vehicle for a permanent update of all the participants involved.

They are divided into disjunctive (with an exclusive choice) and differentiated. The reaction of a fighter to the actions of his opponent, which forces him to attack or defend, the reaction of a football player - to make a pass to a partner or shoot through the goal - are considered disjunctive (that is, we cannot simultaneously retreat and advance, pass the ball and hit the goal etc.). Differentiated reactions are the most complex type of reactions, which require great concentration of attention for the immediate selection of the most appropriate action in response, and sometimes the response has already started or switching to completely different actions. For example, an attacker who decided to strike, but saw an opponent blocking him, changes his mind and passes to a partner who is in a better position. A fencer who has started his attack must be able to intercept the opponent's counterattack and continue his own, etc.&#x0D; The performance of individual motor acts at high speed is determined by the speed of a single movement. This is, for example, the speed of movement of the leg during a kick in football or a stick during a throw in hockey, the speed of movement of the arm during an offensive shot in volleyball, throwing a javelin, javelin in fencing. The maximum speed of a single movement can be achieved in the absence of any external resistance. With an increase in external resistance, it is possible to increase the speed of movements due to an increase in the power of the forces exerted, and this depends on the explosive qualities of muscle fibers.",

There are recorded three kinds of embarrassments to communication: easily gotten over difficulties, difficult gotten over and barriers almost insurmountable. It is observed that intervene of some endogenous factors of the communication process and/or exogenous factors in the communication process. The first category factors are subjective and are manifested in misunderstandings, lack of consensus, differences of opinion, disagreements and conflicts; they are partly due to the asymmetric nature of the communication situation manager vs. subordinate.

There are times when that component is something a speaker would rather not have the coparticipant know. Sometimes, however, the speaker is willing, indeed eager, to share this material with the coparticipant, but is constrained from simply producing it then and there (the matter being possibly bizarre, risqué, or in other ways problematic). In either case, whether the problematic component is delivered or not (i.e., whether a ‘gloss’ is ‘unpackaged’) can depend upon what the coparticipant does. This report focuses on the ways in which a coparticipant's activities are implicated in the maintaining as-is, or unpackaging, of a ‘glossed’ component.

Within all types of organizations, individuals are in different job positions in accordance to the hierarchy. Within the course of putting into operation their job duties and responsibilities, they do get overwhelmed by certain factors, which enable them to be overwhelmed by job stress. In other words, in all types of job positions, individuals do get overwhelmed by the problem of job stress. There are number of factors, which enable them to be overwhelmed by this problem. Hence, throughout their jobs, they need to be well-informed in terms of their job duties and methodologies. Furthermore, they need to possess the abilities to work under stress. In addition, formation of positive viewpoints will be facilitating in doing well in one’s job duties and generating desired outcomes. As a consequence, all the members will render an important contribution in doing well in one’s job duties, achieving desired goals and objectives and meeting the expectations of individuals in leadership positions. The problem of job stress can be overcome on one’s own or through obtaining support and assistance from other members. Hence, it is of utmost significance to form cordial and amiable terms and relationships with each other. Therefore, job stress needs to be prevented from assuming a major form otherwise, it is considered as an impediment within the course of enhancement of career prospects. The main concepts that are taken into account in this research paper are, understanding the meaning and significance of job stress, causes of job stress and overcoming job stress is vital in leading to progression.",

      "title": "Intrapsychic Impediments to Effective Leadership",
      "abstract": "The psychological underpinnings of effective leadership depend on the synergy of the id, ego, and superego. Effective leadership requires an ego that is flexible, resilient to changing situations, and sensitive to interpersonal cues, with cognitive and intellectual capacities to understand business and corporate challenges. It must channel drives, especially active ones, into assertive, but thoughtful, action. As well, the ego must be able to regulate impulse expression, tolerate frustration, and work toward goals. The superego contributions include goal setting, aspiring to ideals, and playing by the rules. It must help maintain a consistent, but not overly harsh, attitude toward the self and its actions. Leadership grows, too, from learning and from identifications, both conscious and unconscious, with significant models from both childhood and adulthood. It includes a healthy regulation of narcissism that can maintain stable self-esteem in the face of failure and criticism, both from within and without. Sound object relations are also necessary, especially those that allow for an experience of objects that includes awareness of their actual (as opposed to their transference distorted) qualities. The object representations should be multifaceted enough to allow recognition simultaneously of the assets and limitations of the same person. This synergy on which effective leadership depends can be shaped and distorted by intrapsychic conflict and unconscious fantasies. Freud (1916) Freud, S. 1916.

These processes can be activated by external cues, media, illness in others, and one's own symptoms and changes in function. Illness and treatment representations include explanations of causes, expectations for symptom duration, impact on daily function, and response to treatment. Failure to meet expectations instigates help seeking, such as talking to family members or seeking healthcare. We indicate that understanding these processes is critical for developing effective interventions, though not required nor typically involved in predictive modeling. Testing a process mode such as CSM requires selecting the determinant of behavior actively impacting the outcome, for example, illness representations (symptoms) for care seeking and treatment representations (outcomes of treatment) for chronic management.",

      "title": "Sustaining evidence-based healthcare: finding the value",
      "abstract": "'Weren't you just here last month discussing a different topic?', a nurse once asked me as we were implementing a new practice change. The tone and body language said it all. We had just completed a successful implementation of a different practice change last month, patted ourselves on the back, and moved forward….to another change. After all, we had pride in our evidence-based approaches so were continually looking to improve our practices to keep up with the rapid changing and evolving healthcare landscape. Then a few months later, the inevitable happens: a practice change we successfully implemented, which initially improved outcomes, surfaces as an issue again. And the cycle repeats, which is a challenge many organizations experience.1 Not every implementation fades or has dips in effectiveness but it happens frequently enough that establishing a process to plan for sustainability is critical for continued success. Sustainability refers to the capacity and ability to maintain and sustain evidence-based practice beyond the implementation.2 Often this is further defined to incorporate a specific time period of continued practice change and outcome evaluation that provide value to the organization.3 Holding these concepts in mind helps us design strategies for both unit-level and organizational support for evidence-based practice changes. A key strategy for sustainability is creating value for the new intervention or change. The concept of value has both macro and micro level perspectives. From a macro lens, factors to consider are what the value, also known as Value on Investment (VOI), is for the organization and the current status of the organization's readiness to change.4 This includes aligning and articulating the intervention with the strategic priorities for the organization. On the other end of the value spectrum is the micro level of end-user engagement and the key importance in having those stakeholders involved and supportive of the implementation.5,6 In this issue, we see examples of successful implementation initiatives through the creation of value with end-user supported meaningful change. One area included in this issue pertains to creating value to successfully implement new screening or assessment pratices. An implementation project by de Souza-Talarico et al.7 in 2021 improved readiness to change by creating value in the need for a standardized, evidence-based, delirium screening tool in the intensive care setting. Through the development of a formal delirium-focused training program along with a follow-up audit process, value was created to aid in a successful implementation. Another implementation project in this issue highlights the importance of creating value for those impacted most by the change. Zhang et al. in 2021 explored the implementation of nutritional screening and nutritional interventions for patients scheduled for gastrointestinal surgery. In this work, the team developed implementation strategies that targeted the patients and caregivers, as well as the nursing staff, all of which are key stakeholders in this change in practice. Having the end-users understand the vision and purpose of the intervention and how it will impact their workflows and outcomes, is an essential element for overall sustainability. This should include transparency about all aspects of the change so any surprises can be minimized. Key strategies to maintain a value-focused approach include leadership engagement, effective data reporting for clear and visible progress tracking, and on-going recognition.4 The importance of creating a structure and program that incorporates value and early planning for sustainability is one of the reasons having formal programs that drive implementation work through a standardized process can aid to ensure the right steps are initially created and thought through. Programs that focus on this process as a whole, for example, the JBI Evidence Implementation Program, emphasize the importance of evaluating whether or not the change is feasible and how sustainability will be managed.8 The JBI Evidence Implementation Training Program articulates from the JBI Model for EBHC and is integral to the JBI vision and mission. This program was designed to prepare clinicians, quality improvement specialists, educators, researchers, and policy makers from all health professions to successfully lead evidence-based change initiatives. The program provides an evidence-based approach to implementation that focuses on readiness for change, establishing value, identifying barriers, and an audit-feedback-re-audit process. This process sets the foundation that re-auditing and evaluating changes after implementation is key for ongoing success and sustainability.8 When taken into the full cycle of the JBI Model of Evidence-Based Healthcare, the Evidence Implementation segment highlights the importance of putting evidence into practice and providing support for sustained improvement to achieve overall improved global health. The specific components of the Evidence Implementation segment include situational analysis (including readiness for change and ensuring value to stakeholders), the facilitation of practice change, and the evaluation of outcomes. These elements all provide support to ensure value is maintained and outcomes are sustained.2 Acknowledgements Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts of interest.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Various types of errors are shown in a mentally retarded boy (CA 12:10, Tanaka‐Binet IQ 45–50) engaging in a standardized arithmetic achievement test for first‐grade pupils. The following issues on behavioral characteristics of the mentally retarded with arithmetic tasks are discussed from a special educational point of view. 1. Production of correct solutions depends heavily on self‐regulation, motivation and metacognition levels of the retarded with arithmetic tasks. Therefore, maintaing appropriate levels of these processes is a fundamental principle in encouraging the mentally retarded to do their best. 2. How the retarded deal with a task on figures depends on how the figures appear to them. It is a perceptual problem rather than an arithmetic one. 3. While the retarded can do well on a task by manipulating the objects in question in his daily life, they cannot solve the same task in an achievement test situation. They attempt to solve a task using a familiar strategy and are difficult to change the one used. They adopt a known strategy with a clue of particular word, phrase or part of story to deal with the tasks. 4. Realization of how to use the counting principles develops step by step, but understanding process of every principle on cardinal progression is one thing and that on multiple progression is another.",

People who have features of this personality style may display a tendency to blame others to make sense of their feelings of distress when things go wrong, rather than shouldering blame themselves. Others may find people with these personality features unhelpful or unempathic towards them, especially at times when they require assistance. People with this personality style tend to take advantage of others' limitations and shortcomings. They may behave in ways that suggest a sense of entitlement or privilege at the expense of others' comfort or welfare, and may inappropriately disregard others when pursuing their own goals. When depressed they may become quite ‘hostile’ and provocative to those around, often having a hair trigger explosive response to having their needs frustrated.",

But some plans go awry. We present analyses of errors, each recorded in an incident diary, by 217 participants when something went wrong in a plan that involved someone else. Joint errors occurred for each participant on average once every two or three days. At least 77% of the errors occurred when the planners were separated from each other in ways that would be rare in face-to-face societies. Some errors occurred when participants had unstated goals that affected the plan. When an error occurred, people tended to give higher importance to the relationship with the other person involved than to the plan that had gone wrong. In 75% of errors, participants attributed the error to the other person in the plan. Some 66% of errors made the participant angry with the other person. When the relationship with the other person was not important to the participant, the error tended to cause that other person to be judged harshly, and a mental model to be formed of him or her as untrustworthy.",

In this chapter, we focus on three implications of this view for learning and instruction. First, action matters for cognitive performance and learning. Actions that are well aligned with target ideas can promote performance and learning, whereas actions that are not well aligned can interfere. Second, observing others' actions can activate action-based knowledge; therefore, learners need not produce actions themselves in order for action to influence performance and learning. Third, imagining or mentally simulating actions can activate action-based knowledge, and simulated actions are sometimes manifested in gestures, which are a form of representational action. These principles highlight the importance of actions—both real and imagined—in cognitive performance, learning and instruction. We consider implications of this perspective for instructional design, assessment, and educational technology.",

Et gjennomgaende tema i hele arbeidet har vaert hvordan erfaringer fra skoletiden kan pavirke menneskers grunnleggende tro pa muligheten for kontroll over egne livsbetingelser. Det teoretiske grunnlaget er knyttet til sosial interaksjon og hvordan mennesker pavirkes av signaler fra sine omgivelser. Herunder presenteres teorier om selvoppfatning og motivasjon for a belyse hvordan et grunnleggende behov for a tenke positivt om seg selv far konsekvenser for den enkeltes atferd i prestasjonssituasjoner. Motivasjonen for skolens laeringsaktiviteter pavirkes i takt med hvordan de oppfattes a kunne styrke eller svekke muligheten for tilfredsstillelse av dette behovet. Derfor vil mennesker vaere mest motivert for a gjore det de forventer a lykkes med, mens de forsoker a unnga aktiviteter som medforer risiko for nederlag. Motivasjonen for a opprettholde en positiv selvoppfatning er sterkere og mer grunnleggende behov enn for eksempel det a bli flink i lesing og skriving eller andre skolefag. Samtidig er skolen som organisasjon baerer av en kultur der den enkeltes prestasjoner vurderes og sammenlignes opp mot standardiserte aldersrelaterte forventninger. For personer med laerevansker eller funksjonshemninger medforer denne kulturen okt risiko for gjentatte nederlagsopplevelser, og okt behov for a beskytte selvoppfatningen. Menneskelig atferd handler om mangesidige og komplekse sammenhenger, og mestringsopplevelser kan bare forstas gjennom det som uttrykkes av de som eier opplevelsene. En vil aldri fullt ut kunne forsta og langt mindre gjengi andre menneskers erfaringer. Forskning pa dette feltet vil likevel matte framstilles ut fra en gitt forstaelsesramme. I lys av denne ma det legges stein pa stein for etter hvert a oppna innsikt i hva manglende mestringsopplevelser kan fore til. Dette sokes gjennom seks voksne personers erfaringer og opplevelser med dysleksi, med ulik alder og kjonn. Det empiriske materialet er knyttet til deres beskrivelse av erfaringer fra ulike faser og omrader i livet; skolegang, arbeid og privatliv. Datainnsamlingen har foregatt gjennom kvalitative intervju. Dataene framstilles forst som informantenes konkrete, retrospektive beskrivelse av erfaringer med fenomenet. Deretter blir kunnskapsgrunnlaget i hver enkelt beskrivelse analysert i lys av fellestrekk og likheter pa tvers av enkeltframstillingene. Beskrivelsene forstas og tolkes pa bakgrunn av teorier om dysleksi som fenomen og teorier om motivasjon og selvoppfatning. Dette settes inn en kontekstuell ramme av skolesystemets prestasjonskultur, arbeidslivets okende krav til skriftspraklige ferdigheter, og den enkeltes malorientering. Studiet soker a bidra til forstaelse og innsikt i fenomenet dysleksi og hvordan behovet for a tenke positivt om seg selv, kan fa konsekvenser for malorientering og laeringsatferd. Det peker ogsa pa hvorfor instrumentalistiske tilnaerminger alene ikke kan fore til onskede effekter av ulike spesialundervisningstiltak. En didaktisk konsekvens av en slik forstaelse innbaerer styrking av elevenes selvoppfatning og skolesystemets toleranse og aksept for forskjellighet",

      "abstract": "Abstract The highly valued goals of the self too often turn into failed good intentions. Even when the goals are important and motivation is high, they easily become difficult to achieve in the face of temptations, frustrations and obstacles. The model and research discussed here address how people can exert willpower even when the situational pull to give up is strong. Research on the basic mechanisms and dynamics that enable delay of gratification show that exertion of willpower requires one to \"cool\" or self-distance from the negative arousal of difficult and frustrating situations. Such attention control helps prevent \"hot,\" impulsive responses that undermine long-term goal attainment. The attentional control mechanisms assessed in the preschool delay of gratification paradigm are visible in toddlerhood and continue to affect important life outcomes—academic, social, and interpersonal, through adolescence to adulthood. Most importantly, they seem to serve as protective factors against the negative long-term consequences of dispositional vulnerabilities. These self-regulatory and protective processes are conceptualized within a cognitive - affective processing system model of personality.",

Yet, it is unclear when the ability to predict on and reason about the efficiency of others' actions develops. In three main and two follow-up studies, 3- to 6-year-old children (n = 242) were confronted with vignettes in which protagonists could take a short (efficient) path or a long path. Children predicted which path the protagonist would take and why the protagonist would take a specific path. The 3-year-olds did not take efficiency into account when making decisions even when there was an explicit goal, the task was simplified and made more salient, and children were questioned after exposure to the agent's action. Four years is a transition age for rational action prediction, and the 5-year-olds reasoned on the efficiency of actions before relying on them to predict others' behavior. Results are discussed within a representational redescription account.",

It is formulated as a problem, query or puzzle that the team has to investigate and may be presented in a number of ways, for example as a video or as a simple piece of text. In many ways, the problem statement is the key to successful PBL. If it does not stimulate the students’ interest or enable students to generate learning issues that relate closely to the desired learning outcomes, then there are likely to be difficulties with both team work and achieving cognitive learning outcomes. In this chapter we will explore the issues around the development of problem statements and collect advice from a variety of experienced practitioners on what makes an effective problem statement as well as what to avoid. We will also describe a possible process for the development of problem statements (triggers) and discuss examples.",

      "abstract": "The goal of this chapter is to present a review of research into attentional aspects of hyperactivity disorder. Before starting with the review, some issues, which are not mutually exclusive, will be discussed. The issues concern the appropriateness of the paradigms commonly used to study attention and the accuracy of the methods of identifying hyperactivity in children. Many attempts have been made to validate the clinical concept of hyperactivity disorder in the laboratory. However, since the manifestation of the primary symptoms of hyperactivity (inattention, impulsivity and overactivity) largely depend on the types of environments in which the child is observed, the laboratory approach may be criticized because of the limited range of situations in which the child's behaviour is studied. In addition, experimental task demands may be highly sophisticated, so that extensive training is needed before the actual experiment can start. More over, in order to keep the child 'on the track', he or she is commonly not left to perform the task alone. When all these factors are taken into account, it could be argued that the symptoms of hyperactivity may have been 'filtered out' by the time the laboratory experiment starts. Consequently, one may question the extent to which an attention deficit in hyperactivity disorder, as indicated by teachers and parents and defined by clinical diagnostic procedures, can be accounted for by laboratory data. Barkley (1991) examined the degree of ecological validity of laboratory experiments of hyperactivity.",

Stress can manifest physically and emotionally causing various symptoms such as fatigue, irritability, anxiety, and depression. It can also have a detrimental effect on an individual's general health and bring about several health problems such as hypertension, migraine, headache, cardiac diseases and many more. Stress can also impact a person's sleep, appetite, and concentration. Despite its adverse effects, stress is not always harmful. Stress, in small doses, can be a motivator, assisting people in meeting deadlines, achieving goals, and perform at their best.

      "title": "Strategies to Prevent a Plateau in Your Health and Fitness Gains",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONAdherence to both exercise training and physical activity in the United States is modest at best with estimates suggesting that nearly 50% of individuals stop an exercise program after one year. Sedentary behaviors such as watching television and playing computer games are prevalent. Often, those who participate in planned exercise that is consistent with ACSM recommendations during a given day are then sedentary the remainder of the day, potentially negating the positive health benefits of their exercise training session (1). In an effort to increase physical activity participation on a daily basis, a previous Clinical Applications column (7) recommended strategies for decreasing time spent in sedentary behavior. Infrastructure-based strategies such as the inclusion of pedestrian walkways and destinations in cities and including more physical education and after-school activities, to more individual strategies such as sitting on a stability ball at work or parking farther away from home or work were recommended as practical ways to reduce sedentary behavior. Another factor that can potentially improve adherence with exercise training and physical activity is accountability. Simply by providing an individual with someone he or she can discuss his or her exercise programming with can possibly impact exercise adherence. The “accountability coach” could be a friend, family member, or a fitness coach. An effective accountability coach may use communication strategies such as Cognitive Coaching, described in a previous Clinical Applications column (10). Cognitive Coaching uses a reflective conversation between a fitness expert and a client and is designed to identify perceived individual barriers to exercise that are prohibiting the client from achieving and/or staying with his or her fitness/activity goals and present strategies to overcome these barriers. Although some barriers may be overcome through effective communication and coaching (10), others may require alternative strategies. This article will address a specific barrier to exercise training and physical activity adherence — the plateau, and will offer practical suggestions for avoiding or overcoming a plateau.PLATEAU DEFINED The Selye general adaptation syndrome theory proposes that the human body responds to and eventually adapts to an acute stressor in an effort to minimize disruptions to homeostasis (steady state) caused by that particular stressor (5). Acute exercise creates many disturbances in the steady state environment of the human body. For example, oxygen and muscle phosphate levels are reduced, whereas the concentrations of carbon dioxide, lactic acid, and metabolic heat increase in proportion to exercise intensity. Continued exposure to a specific mode of exercise (the stressor) will promote physiological adaptations that minimize the disruptions to homeostasis. Once these adaptations have been achieved, the stress caused by the same mode of exercise over and over again will no longer be recognized as a stress and therefore will likely not promote further or significant adaptation (6). In effect, the individual will have reached a plateau. Experiencing a plateau in health and fitness gains despite continued effort can be very frustrating and result in the individual dropping out from the exercise program. STRATEGIES TO AVOID A PLATEAU The most effective way to avoid a plateau is to use some form of periodization for an individual's exercise programming. Periodization was developed in the 1960s by a Russian physiologist, Leo Matveyev (2,9), and is defined as the planned manipulation of acute training variables (intensity, duration, frequency) with the goal of progressively overloading athletes to ensure continued progress and the avoidance of a plateau. During a periodized training program, specific training variables — most notably intensity and volume — as well as planned rest and recovery are cycled in a coordinated manner through time as athletes move through training phases. These phases are designed to prepare them to compete at their peak during competition and avoid injury and/or burnout while getting there (2,4,8,9). For example, an athlete would begin with a muscular endurance phase where intensity will be relatively low and volume will be relatively high. As the athlete progresses to the next phase, which typically is a hypertrophy phase, the intensity will increase, whereas the volume may be reduced. Therefore, the purpose of periodization is to avoid doing the same specific form of training over and over for an extended period. If an individual is to continue to improve the qualities associated with physical fitness (endurance, hypertrophy, etc.), the specific stressor must be altered and thus provide a novel stimulus to the body (2,5,8,9). Although considered to be the optimal training strategy for the avoidance of a plateau, many general fitness enthusiasts and even some fitness professionals avoid the detailed planning that is such a critical part of periodization. Whereas collegiate and professional athletes often plan the rest of their lives around training, most fitness enthusiasts/general population are forced to do the opposite and attempt to fit in training/exercise around the other daily activities of their lives, making it very difficult to follow a structured, cyclical program. Therefore, individuals who do not have the ability to follow a structured plan for an extended period may need a more practical and fun way to manipulate his or her training and avoid stagnating his or her progress and experiencing a plateau of gains. This manipulation of an exercise program can be done by increasing cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and/or metabolic demands. The Table provides examples of how different modes of exercise can be modified in a simple and effective manner to provide a different stimulus to the body, perhaps preventing a plateau. For example, incorporating trail walking or jogging will promote elevations in heart rate, respiration rate, and energy expenditure more than which would be seen by walking or jogging on a flat surface (3). Alternatively, pairing resistance exercises into circuits will decrease the rest intervals between sets. This combination will improve the time efficiency of exercise as well as increase the cardiovascular and metabolic demands of your client's training session.TABLE: Practical Ways to Manipulate Training to Impact PlateauCONCLUSIONS The current Clinical Applications column briefly addressed practical and simple-to-implement strategies for avoiding the dreaded plateau that we all have experienced in our exercise programming. One or two of these recommended strategies may be all that is necessary to make a difference in your results. The next Clinical Applications column will present information on a much-requested topic, that of exercise testing and prescription strategies for individuals with type 1 diabetes. Interestingly, despite the substantial impact that exercise may have with type 1 diabetes control, there is a paucity of data-based studies on this population in comparison with other special populations and therefore a need to present information to serve this population.",

Bislang gibt es einige Befunde zu der Auswirkung eines Feedbacks auf die unmittelbare Leistung, nicht jedoch auf die mittelfristige Leistung in einer Phase ohne Feedback. Es ist zu erwarten, dass die Form der Leistungsmotivation hier eine entscheidende Rolle spielt. Fur Personen, die das Ziel haben, besser zu sein als andere, kann ein negatives Feedback eine Bedrohung des Selbstwertes darstellen und daher demotivieren. Mittelfristig sollte jedoch die Bedrohung des Selbstwertes abnehmen. Daher ist zu erwarten, dass Feedback mittelfristig die Leistung steigert. Fur Personen, die das Ziel haben, ihre Kenntnisse zu verbessern, stellt ein negatives Feedback keine Bedrohung des Selbstwertes da. Daher sollte sich Feedback anfanglich positiv auf die Leistung auswirken. Diese Personen lieben jedoch das Gefuhl, sich Kenntnisse selbst zu erarbeitet zu haben. Feedback verdirbt den Spass am selbststandigen Explorieren und Losungen finden. Feedback sollte daher - nach einer anfanglichen Leistungssteigerung- mittelfristig zu einer Verringerung der Leistung fuhren.

      "title": "Higher Education in the Twenty-First Century; What's the Mission?",
      "abstract": "The \"mission\" of a sector of society can encompass a range of possibilities. Sometimes, the mission is broad. Sometimes, it is narrow. Sometimes constant, sometimes changing. Missions serve as guideposts. They articulate a central purpose or goal, which should help to structure decisions and actions: as examples, who should be served, exactly what should be done, how the work is carried out, which measures can determine whether the mission is actually being realized, and, if not, how a course can and should be corrected.Whole sectors or spheres can have missions. Broadly speaking, the health care sector works to provide physical and mental well-being for individuals and society. Within the sector, one encounters a range of professionals (researchers, nurses, doctors, pharmacists) as well as settings (hospitals, offices, laboratories, clinics). Some personnel are focused on a particular area, illness, or demographic group, while others are generalists. Some institutions are private; others are public; a few are composite. The direction or foci may shift as the needs of individuals change, or societies evolve, or as the leadership across organizations changes. But the fundamental purpose of restoring or maintaining health is not-and should not be-obscured or lost.This might seem straightforward so far.However, as we turn to the sector of higher education, the concept of mission becomes more vexed. As early as the sixteenth century, the Jesuits used education as a way of defining the word mission-to educate and spread the word of Christ. But as colleges and eventually universities spread throughout the world, the mission broadened from religious purposes-for example, preparing young people for work in secular professions, training scholars in the sciences and other disciplines, or giving members of certain demographic groups an opportunity to meet peers, as well as individuals from other, more diverse backgrounds.1In the United States, the missions of the earliest institutions of higher education were rooted, at least in part, in Christian (Protestant) values. Universities sought to respond to a need for a learned clergy; indeed, roughly half of Harvard College's earliest graduates went on to become ministers. Over time, however, the religious mission of American universities began to fade. Modeled after German institutions that focused on training students for specific professions, higher education increasingly centered on preparing citizens for work and contributing to society, notably in science and technology. In these ways, the sector broadened its mission to meet new needs. By the nineteenth century, universities began to feature a plethora of professional schools, along with a broader, more secular curriculum. And as the twentieth century unfolded, increased funding for public education attracted more citizens with varied backgrounds, interests, and aspirations.2Today, as evidenced in this volume of Dædalus, tertiary institutions all over the globe exist for a range of purposes-to provide professional training, to teach and conduct research in an ever-expanding array of disciplines, to educate underserved populations, to focus explicitly on globalization, climate change, the arts, and/ or to cultivate specific political viewpoints and orientations. Indeed, many of the institutions have different stated missions. Even within one country or region, institutions of higher learning may be \"all over the map.\"Like health care organizations, educational institutions within and across countries may not have precisely the same mission. But we contend that, at the very least, each institution and its stakeholders should have clarity about its own central mission.Our own extensive research focused on liberal arts and sciences (hereafter, \"liberal arts\") at universities in the United States provides a troubling perspective, one that might come to pass soon for others around the world. We have observed and documented a disturbing lack of consensus among key stakeholders about the purpose(s) of higher education, both within single institutions and across the sector.Based on in-depth interviews of more than two thousand individuals across ten disparate campuses, we have found striking dissociations. Most notable, while students, parents, alums, and trustees view university primarily as the necessary path toward a future job, most faculty and administrators believe that the university experience is an opportunity for intellectual transformation, the time and place to prepare students for lifelong learning and citizenship.We suggest two reasons for this major misalignment.One explanation is what we call mission sprawl-the promotion of multiple missions on a single campus. Rather than a set of focused goals, we find that institutions that invoke the liberal arts attempt to pursue a myriad of goals for too many disparate groups of people, thus obscuring their own primary reason(s) for existing. As examples, in their mission statements, many institutions of higher learning trumpet keywords such as leadership, globalization, career preparation, and social and ethical services. As shown in the word cloud in Figure 1, the list goes on! While an entire sector may be able to address this gaggle of promises, it is difficult-indeed impossible-for a single institution to take this all on, in addition to intellectual development. In an effort to please its customers, a vast number of institutions of higher learning have lost a sense of the who, what, where, and why, as each relates to their mission.A second explanation for these misalignments among stakeholders involves universities that not only try to do too much, but also appear to be conflicted about what they are trying to do. Sometimes, single institutions promote explicit missions, clear and accessible statements of intent often found on their website and in their brochures, alongside implicit missions, underlying messages that all too often conflict with what is stated publicly. These inconsistencies and conflicts are signaled by placement of buildings on campus, decisions about securing and allocation of resources, and/or the ways in which \"success\" is publicly defined (for example, by employment statistics and salaries of graduating students).Our own university exemplifies this tension. Harvard College (for undergraduates) has long promoted Veritas, or truth, as its motto and on its logo (the Veritas shield). However, this word does not appear in the official mission statement (nor does it appear in the mission statements of any of Harvard's other graduate and professional schools). If you talk with any Harvard student about his or her college experience, rarely, if at all, would you hear the word \"truth,\" nor would you likely hear it from a parent or a member of one of the governing bodies. It is fair to say that at this institution, \"truth\" is overlooked, or even, taken for granted.3 Further, as recent events have documented, various constituencies have strikingly different aspirations.4In what follows, we place the mission of higher education under a microscope. Specifically, we identify four key dimensions of a mission for higher education: audience, content, place, and intended impact. One might call this a journalistic or interrogative approach, an attempt to gather the key parts of a school's story-the who, what, where, and why we mentioned above-with the ultimate goal of helping individual institutions, as well as the overall sector, to achieve clarity on missions in general.The institutions described in this volume provide illustrative examples of how one might consider missions. While it may be easy to answer just one of these questions (that is, focusing entirely on \"who?\" or \"why?\"), a more challenging task for leaders in higher education would be to identify where their institution lies along all of these dimensions. If institutions of higher education can answer these four questions, we believe they will be well equipped to align stakeholders around their priorities and to hold themselves accountable to their goals. But identifying and articulating a clear mission is just the first step. It is also important to consider how to demonstrate and measure progress toward achieving it, as well as identifying barriers and attempting to remove them.Like any business trying to understand its customers or clients, institutions of higher education cannot realize any sort of goal for their students without a deep understanding of who is on campus. Indeed, most universities include a word in their mission statement about an intended audience-a group of individuals that the institution aims to serve. This dimension of mission is crucial, not only in guiding students who are making decisions about where to matriculate, but also for universities as they think about how to address their population's specific desires and needs.In the United States, a number of institutions define their audience in terms of a particular demographic or geographic group. Historically Black colleges and universities, women's colleges, and Hispanic serving institutions are clear examples of institutions that have an explicitly stated mission to serve students of a particular identity. For this type of school, the audience is the defining or distinctive feature of the mission, a characteristic that sets it apart from other institutions of the same size and selectivity level.Serving a particular target audience can also be a driving force for many schools around the world. In some cases, entire universities are founded on the premise that they will cater to a specific population or demographic group. Sometimes, these are populations facing societal barriers, such as unequal access to higher education and/ or to positions of leadership.Take the example of the Asian University for Women (AUW), a private university located in Bangladesh. As described by Kamal Ahmad, AUW is designed to serve female students in different parts of Asia who would not otherwise have access to an undergraduate degree.5 Founded as an antidote to gender-based discrimination in many parts of Asia, AUW's mission focuses on empowering women who have been economically or socially marginalized by society. In order to align its audience with its goal of promoting intercultural understanding, AUW recruits students who demonstrate particular characteristics in their application-for example, tolerance and a desire to combat injustice. While the school is still meant to serve an international student body and has now reached women from seventeen countries, AUW homes in on an audience that is more narrowly defined than that at most other institutions.Alternatively, other institutions take a deliberately wide-ranging approach to their audience, seeking students from a multitude of ethnicities, socioeconomic levels, and/or geographic regions. A textbook case is New York University Abu Dhabi (NAUAD), a collaboration between NYU and the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. A liberal arts university, NYUAD is part of NYU's global network of schools and one of its three degree-granting campuses.In her case study, Mariët Westermann describes how NYUAD's undergraduate student body has been designed to be quintessentially international, representing students from one hundred twenty-five countries.6 While Emerati citizens make up more than one-fifth of the student body, the overall student population is meant to represent a wide range of nationalities, languages, and ethnicities, with no majority group. As with AUW, NYUAD's admissions officers look for certain qualities in prospective students that align with the school's broader goals, such as a desire to learn alongside individuals from different countries who carry differing backgrounds and opinions.The school's focus on attracting an international audience is an important piece of NYUAD's broader goal of educating global citizens and fostering intercultural understanding. Despite the school's distinctively international audience, other dimensions of the school's mission, such as its particular location, have come to the forefront of public discourse. The decision to place the institution in a region with a difficult history of human rights has long proved contentious among some faculty members and students at NYU's home campus.7 Though the school has assured these parties that NYUAD will maintain the same level of academic freedom that exists in New York City, this is a case in which different dimensions of missions have the potential to clash or diverge. What does it mean for such an internationally diverse audience to study and take courses in a country that places constraints on freedom of academic expression? This factor signals possible tension between the school's audience, the who, and the content that is allowed, the what.In addition to audience, a mission might also refer to the content, or subject matter, an institution focuses on. For some institutions, a content-centered mission may revolve around a particular educational program or set of courses. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology focuses on educating students in science and technology. St. John's College, which contains campuses in both Annapolis, Maryland, and Santa Fe, New Mexico, is best known for its distinctive curriculum focused on great books. Indeed, at the center of many of the innovations described in this volume is the curriculum-crafted and shaped to meet identified needs pertaining to specific knowledge and/ or skills, economies, and political contexts.The recently launched London Interdisciplinary School (LIS) foregrounds a mission that is driven by its innovative curriculum and pedagogy. The school addresses a seeming shortcoming in the UK higher-education system-a lack of courses that cut across disciplines and a discrepancy between what students are learning in the classroom and the problems they might wish to address in their future careers. As its name signifies, this school embraces a deliberately interdisciplinary approach to teaching and learning, one that pushes students to explore issues in technology, climate change, and other contemporary problems from a variety of angles. Notably, the institution distinguishes itself from schools with a liberal arts mission by emphasizing practices of integration and synthesis. According to Carl Gombrich and Amelia Peterson, students at LIS learn how to make the fields \"speak to each other.\"8 Whether graduates will ultimately pursue distinctive careers or do so in innovative ways remains to be determined.Minerva University is another example of a school that is driven by a distinctive general education program. Like The London Interdisciplinary School, Minerva University was designed with the goal of preparing students to address and perhaps contribute to the solution of complex contemporary global problems. As described by Teri A. Cannon and Stephen M. Kosslyn, Minerva's curriculum addresses this goal not only by exposing students to a variety of academic areas, but also through a strong focus on the development of particular skills and capacities.9 Minerva's courses aim to provide students with cognitive tools, such as \"habits of mind\"-critical thinking techniques that become internalized over time. So far, its graduates are an impressive lot. Time will tell whether Minerva can catalyze other such educational entities.In considering the question of what, course offerings and curricula are not the only answers. Many institutions of higher education-including some with religious underpinnings-center on the dissemination of particular values, principles, and beliefs. What Isak Frumin and Daria Platonova describe as the socialist model of education was founded with the explicit goal of shaping a \"new Soviet person.\"10 In the wake of Soviet nation-building in much of the twentieth century, higher education was meant to produce individuals with a deep understanding of Marxism as well as a commitment to the collective state good. Although values-based (or \"class-based\") education was a core pillar of Soviet education, it can also be found to varying degrees in other models of higher education. As Frumin and Platonova note, a focus on character development-or what is sometimes now referred to as \"formative education\" -has grown in popularity around the world.Universities will also be shaped by the location in which learning is taking place: the where. In most cases, a university will operate statically in its home country, the region in which the school was conceived. In other cases, universities may intentionally operate outside of their home country, providing students with opportunities to learn in new cultural, political, and economic contexts-ones connected organically and organizationally, or set up on an ad hoc basis.Consider the case of Northwestern University Qatar (NU-Q). For this institution, geographic location is a paramount part of the mission. As described by Marwan M. Kraidy, the campus is a part of Education City in Doha, Qatar, a multicultural city with a large number of expatriates.11 Northwestern's decision to form a partnership in this region was deliberate; the school has a specific mission of developing research and teaching capacity in the Global South, a phrase that refers to economically disadvantaged nations within the Middle East, Latin America, Asia, and Africa. Furthermore, NU-Q views the Global South not as a geographic region but as an \"intellectual space\"-an area in which to develop scholarship that may well be distinct from that of the West. This commitment to the Global South may show up in other dimensions of its mission. For instance, the curriculum intentionally features authors from Arab, African, and Asian countries.Notably, NU-Q enjoys support from its host country in carrying out its mission. The project grew out of a partnership between Northwestern University and the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development. As demonstrated earlier by the case of NYUAD, however, a school's values and aims for students can sharply conflict with the agenda of those in power in the region. Additionally, what it means to serve the \"Global South\" remains unclear-as does how that constituency relates to BRICS.12 The degree of economic development or opposition to Western developed or democratic societies and values needs to be clarified.A stark example of these challenges is Hungary's recently shuttered Central European University (CEU). As described by Michael Ignatieff and Ágota Révész in separate contributions, CEU was Hungary's last independent university in Budapest.13 Founded and funded by Hungarian American philanthropist George Soros, who sought to create a top-tier research university that could serve as a \"hub\" for students in the Central-Eastern European region, CEU was designed to be a center that would promote critical thinking on complicated issues and foreground the values of an open society.Despite the university's laudable reputation in Europe and in the world, the institution was ultimately shut down by Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. An autocratic leader, Orbán saw the institution as a threat to Hungarian national sovereignty and perhaps to his own increasingly authoritarian rule. This governance decision, which sparked large protests in Budapest, demonstrates the push and pull that can emerge between an institution's locale, on the one hand, and defining aspects of missions for liberal education, such as the principle of academic freedom, on the other.Going beyond a specific location, online forms of education are becoming increasingly popular. These offer learning opportunities, degrees, certificates, and other types of credentials to students of all ages, including a growing number of adult learners. In his essay, Richard C. Levin describes the outpouring of online offerings, from university-led courses held remotely to start-up platforms focused on the acquisition of vocational skills.14 This mode of education has already made an enormous impact on the sector, primarily by expanding access to faculty-led courses around the world and broadening the province and scale of higher education. We cannot predict how education will be affected in the long term by large language models and other AI-supported tools, but they hold the possibility to both promote and distort current approaches to teaching and learning.Missions for higher education can and, we believe, should illuminate a university's greater purpose, footprint, or influence in society. While the what may drive an institution forward, it can also beg the important question of \"for what?\" What is the larger impact the school is trying to create in the world or in a given community? What will student learning lead to? This dimension of mission may in fact be the crux of our journalistically inspired framework. Institutions must be able to shape and clarify a raison d'être, or a strong sense of why.One way to conceptualize an institution's impact is by considering the influence of the university on individuals. Hardly worthy of debate, one fundamental purpose of all institutions of higher education should be the learning that takes place in the classroom. Indeed, mission statements for universities frequently include phrases such as \"intellectual discovery\" and \"transformation.\"Documenting students' intellectual growth throughout the university experience is one way to understand a school's impact. Several tools can help, such as oral or written exams, public performance, and standardized tests administered and scored by external entities. Olga Zlatkin-Troitschanskaia describes an innovative way of understanding students' learning trajectories today-during a time in which they are increasingly gathering information from online sources.15Specifically, the PLATO (Positive Learning in the Age of InformaTiOn) research program seeks to understand how students navigate and acquire knowledge online, as well as their capacities for skills such as \"Critical Online Reasoning.\" PLATO stands out as a noteworthy effort to investigate what most institutions of higher education seek to accomplish (that is, student learning), or at least what many say they prioritize. And, importantly, it documents the numerous forms of mislearning across fields of study-and how they might be addressed.An additional way to conceptualize impact is by examining the role of higher education in furthering national interests. Traditionally conceptualized as a public good, universities have been seen by some countries as instrumental in driving economic growth or global influence.16 For example, in his essay on higher education in India, Jamshed Bharucha describes how a sizeable youth population has been seen as a \"source of economic hope\" for the country.17 Hence, new policies in the country have sought to expand higher education to reach a greater proportion of the university-aged population in India. As another example, Frumin and Platonova describe how Soviet education was traditionally seen as a way to develop a \"state good,\" which meant that universities were viewed as a mechanism (or \"engine\") for advancing communist ideals, aspirations, and accomplishments.18 Although the Soviet system, once supported and nurtured, no longer exists, its methods and goals can still be seen in many places.Beyond individual students and countries, higher education can also aspire to improve society and the world. A number of schools have begun to examine their broader impact by concentrating on climate change and sustainability. For these schools, intended impact does not focus on enriching individuals, but rather on enriching the greater good.The University of Tasmania in Australia, cited by Fernando M. Reimers in this volume, has an explicit mission of centering rigorous climate action efforts.19 One way of capturing this kind of influence is through the Times Higher Education impact rankings, a measure of how well universities address the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (or SDGs). As Reimers notes, the SDGs have been integrated into the missions of several institutions of higher education around the world, but their short-and long-term effects remain unknown.Notably, problems can emerge when there are misalignments or disagreements within an institution around the school's sense of why. Such misalignments seem to have played a role in the dissolving of Yale-NUS College, a short-lived but noteworthy endeavor born out of a partnership between Yale University and the National University of Singapore (NUS). At the project's inception, Yale and NUS shared a clear impetus for the partnership: to expand liberal arts education in Singapore. Despite this mutual intention, the project proved to be rife with challenges. The Yale administration was viewed in Singapore (and perhaps elsewhere) as trying to impose a set of political values on the institution. Simultaneously, faculty members on the home campus worried about the preservation of academic freedom in a context that was vulnerable to Singapore's nationalist trends and policies. As the partnership dissolved, NUS demonstrated a different vision for the school-one emphasizing specialization (with a few common courses) over the broad liberal arts agenda that Yale had embraced.As Pericles Lewis, the founding president of Yale-NUS, writes in this volume, \"in any institution, multiple goals are pursued by multiple constituents.\"20 When these goals are too far away from one another, however, we find that institutions will be troubled. Alignment around the question of why is instrumental to institutional success-and may even be necessary for its ultimate survival.In this essay, we have provided one possible framework for thinking deeply about missions in higher education. Specifically, we tease apart four essential elements of a mission: audience, content, place, and intended impact. If institutional leaders seek to define their university's central purpose-and hold their institution accountable to that purpose-this framework may prove a helpful place to start.But articulating a central mission is just one piece of the puzzle. As the value of higher education is being currently questioned, doubted, and scrutinized around the world, we believe that it is crucial for institutions not only to think deeply about mission, but also to align stakeholders around the facets of the mission. Alignment occurs when the expectations and goals of all stakeholders (in this case, students, professors, administrators) are in sync with one another and when they are mindful of the priorities of the institution and of the broader sector. Based on our own earlier studies of how professionals in various domains carry out high-quality and socially responsible work, we have found that alignment of the key parties is critical to the health of any sector of society.21 When reflecting on the alignment within an institution, university leaders might ask themselves: What are the goals of this university? What are our students' goals? Does the faculty body share these goals? If not, what can we do to address these discrepancies?Writing in early 2024, we realize that alignment has become an especially critical goal for the United States. Indeed, situated at Harvard University, we can confirm that disagreements surrounding the central mission of higher education are all too evident. In the midst of a series of high-profile presidential resignations at universities nationwide and fierce attacks on universities from many political corners, the purpose of higher education-or the why for the sector-has become a contentious issue. At the extremes, some constituents posit that the university should focus primarily on the goals of diversity, equity, and inclusion, while others argue with equal fervor that institutions should prioritize free speech, argument, and debate above all else.Though the goal of creating strong alignment around the mission of higher education may be a lofty one, we believe that the pursuit of common ground is essential-not only for the flourishing of individual institutions of higher education, but for the thriving (and indeed, survival) of the sector at large.As the essays in this volume suggest, missions for higher education are wide-ranging. Many institutions focus sharply on serving a particular audience, while others focus on specific skills and areas of knowledge that students should acquire. Some institutions craft a mission that centers on their schools' respective geographic locations, while others are preoccupied primarily with their university's larger footprint in the world.Our discussion of the fourth dimension addresses the impact and influence of mission-the why of higher education. Both Zlatkin-Troitschanskaia and Reimers focus on the effect of specific academic programs on students-in one case, how students process new information (and misinformation), and in the other, how students come to care about climate change.22 But as social scientists, we know that demonstrating the overall impact of the higher-education experience is extremely challenging. At the same time, it is important to find ways to demonstrate its \"value add\"-the ways in which it can and should make a difference for individuals and society.In the United States, there have recently been efforts to assess the impact of the standard four-year education in the liberal arts. As an important example, the Collegiate Learning Assessment (CLA) was launched in 2000. In this standardized test, students are not probed for content knowledge, but rather for skills involving critical thinking and problem-solving. Analyses of the CLA point to disappointing results from students-sociologists Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa found that 45 percent of students indicate little to no significant change over the first half of the undergraduate experience.23 Other efforts to measure impact have been more encouraging. In 2021, social psychologist Richard Detweiler published an empirical study affirming positive outcomes of higher education across one thousand individuals.24 However, while he collected promising and rigorous data, the study was based on retrospective accounts of the undergraduate experience from ten, twenty, and forty years earlier. We do not know whether these graduates are truly different-and if they are, why. Nor do we know whether similar effects could be documented today.In our own national study of higher education in the United States, we put forth a new measure called Higher Education Capital (HEDCAP).25 This instrument aims to focus assessment of intellectual capacities over the course of the undergraduate experience. Accordingly, HEDCAP denotes the ability to attend, analyze, reflect, connect, and communicate on issues of importance and interest.Specifically, we blind-scored one thousand student interviews about higher education, looking for evidence as students discussed the university experience. Among the varied responses, we considered as evidence any questions that clarified or lent insight to our understanding of students' experiences; connections between different questions throughout the interview; clear articulation of a point of view with coherent examples; and/ or description that included comparison and contrast of their own perspectives to others'. In brief, we assessed their ability to engage in and carry on a conversation about something they knew well! We used a simple scoring method, ranging from little to no HEDCAP to a lot of HEDCAP. Importantly, we found that while most students across ten schools show evidence of \"some\" HEDCAP, in comparing first-year students to graduating students, across all schools, the data show \"growth\" over the duration of their university education. But more important, HEDCAP improved much more on certain campuses than on others. Determining the reason(s) for this pattern would be crucial to replicate this result elsewhere.HEDCAP is our own attempt at demonstrating that higher education can-and should-make a difference in the subsequent lives of its graduates. Some of the national and international ranking systems also attempt to do the same, by comparing the academic \"quality\" of institutions. But as Gökhan Depo points out, rankings are not only flawed-they do not capture what we think should be one of higher education's primary goals.26 One might even assert that rankings contribute to mission sprawl! Indeed, while the Times Higher Education World University Rankings are widely regarded around the world, their criteria prioritize research productivity, citations per professor, and industry income-rather than student learning, which HEDCAP and the CLA at least seek to address. According to the criteria featured in the rankings, one might assume that the sector promotes individual prestige, productivity, and profit, rather than intellectual capacities and growth.To prove its worth beyond jobs and employment for individual gain, we need to be clear about the original educational aims of higher education and hold institutions and stakeholders accountable to delivering on what the mission promises. And to use the example of our own home institution, if seeking \"truth\" represents the key purpose of an institution of higher learning, every stakeholder-including faculty and administrators on campus-should be able to easily articulate that mission and ultimately embody it.To be sure, change and innovation are necessary for any sector. If a sector is to educate a diversity of students from around the world so that they can address new health, environmental, and political challenges, constant adjustments need to be made. As several essays in this volume testify, new institutions have been developed to educate those individuals who have been underserved and did not have access to a quality education, new teaching pedagogies and academic programs have been created to engage students in \"real world\" problems, and even the physical boundaries of buildings and classrooms have been stretched to new places-online and across the globe. However, especially at this time of change, we need institutions to double down on the central animating idea of mission and make their own mission clear and verifiable. And, to put our cards directly on the table: we hope to preserve what has, at its best, been special and distinct about higher education-providing for all students a rich intellectual experience, one that should last a lifetime and contribute to a larger collective good.We are grateful to the Kern Family Foundation for supporting our research on higher education and to Christopher Stawski for his helpful wisdom and support.",

      "abstract": "Abstract : Jobs with variable requirements such as security guard positions involve long periods of relative inactivity or the performance of repetitive tasks interrupted by emergencies demanding alertness and rapid and accurate decision-making. They are particularly difficult to staff because those people who are most able to cope in emergencies are probably most likely to be bored during normal conditions. This report reviews the literature on work-related boredom and integrates what is known about worker characteristics, objective characteristics of the task, and subjective feelings about the job that are related to being bored at work. Repetitiveness, reduced complexity, constraint, and underutilization of skills contribute to job-related boredom. People who are intrinsically motivated, who introduce change into the situation by varying aspects of the job, or who are active daydreamers or visualizers are less bored or better able to cope with boredom when it occurs. Approaches that hold promise for decreasing boredom include selecting people with high tolerance for boredom, training them in coping techniques, emphasizing the importance of the job or career development, increasing self-control over how the tasks are performed, and redesigning the jobs by increasing complexity or decreasing constraint. Because boredom has not been the topic of much research, the results of the review were limited to the identification of hypotheses that require further testing.",

      "title": "Behavioral objectives: some perspective, please.",
      "abstract": "The behavioral (instructional, educational) objective approach to curriculum and instruction is both rational and, in theory at least, simple and straightforward. Essentially this approach advocates the precise specification of the desired goals of an educational program, course, unit or class, etc. in the form of unambiguously defined, observable and measurable, terminal learner behaviors. These previously delineated goals are then used to guide the selection and organization of content and learning experiences. They also serve as criteria by which students are evaluated and the effectiveness of the curriculum can thereby be assessed (Popham, 1969, p. 35; Eisner, 1967, p. 250).\n To take issue with this widely accepted approach is to invoke a twofold risk. First to quarrel with such an overwhelmingly logical approach to curricular matters, one that has so well succeeded in establishing at least theoretical direction to many educational programs, is to lay oneself open to accusations of irrationality, an undesired, and hopefully undeserved, descriptor. Second, and more important, it is possible that faced with a position which questions the wholehearted acceptance of the behavioral objectives concept, frustrated and objective-weary nurse-teachers may too quickly opt for some other approach and lose the benefits that these valuable tools can provide.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Recent research and reviews question the adequacy of psychological models for research on instruction and learning. Six models—stimulus variation, organismic variation, multiple variation, interaction, stimulus mediation, and goal setting‐may be, in some cases, too simple and, in other cases, too complex to account for classroom learning. Perceptions of the social environment can make the models more parsimonious, serve as potent covariates, and account for additional variance in instructional research; they can also serve as interesting independent or dependent variables in social‐psychological inquiry. Several important generalizations can be made about social environments; and a number of research problems and priorities can be identified in the areas of theory, validity, evaluation, and educational goals.",

While everyone mentions on success in the outcome of design thinking, no one talks about the mistakes and misunderstandings arising during the implementation of design thinking. Especially for Thai design students, errors often affect to the reduction of efficiency in finding solutions. The purpose of this paper is to study the errors in the use of the design thinking and the differences in the process of the use of the design thinking by Thai students through collecting data from the test. This is also to understand feeling while applying design thinking from interviews from the analysis of the data obtained with the basic cultural influence and Thai educational system. It was revealed that errors occurred in 3 stages of design thinking that conflicts with the main objectives as follows: 1. Empathize - Thai students are reluctant to go out and face problems in real situations and accept the information without questioning and without asking questions 2. Define - hesitation and uncertainty in making decisions on identifying problems and 3. Ideate - uncomfortable feeling and refusing to work with others. From the summary of the errors found, the results of the study are: Presentation of design thinking suitable for Thai students. This is a model that focuses on encouraging correct practice in each stage to reduce errors and increase the potential for design thinking.",

      "title": "Four tactics for improving behavior analytic services.",
      "abstract": "Applied behavior analysts are developing and supplanting existing children's services in many states. While many elements may determine success and failure with a particular child, some practices will greatly enhance success with clients. Four tactics are considered here: (a) shared basic knowledge of behavior analytic principles (b) application of the correct behavior analytic model of child development (c) a functionalist perspective that allows for individualization of treatment; and (d) consumer profiling. The Importance of Shared Basic Knowledge of Behavior Analytic Principles Behavior analysis services are greatly in demand for work with children in school, home, and community settings. Behavior analysts work as members of a team. Typically, they design programs that are then implemented by other people. In a school setting, the behavior analysts may be working with teachers and teaching assistants. In home situations, they will be working with families and staff to implement programs. Usually the behavior analysts do not work directly with the children (or do so infrequently for assessment purposes). Instead, they function as consultants working with staff and family implement the programs. For consistent and effective implementation of programs, it is essential that the individuals involved understand what they are doing and why. Therefore, it is imperative that the behavior analysts be able to communicate effectively about behavioral principles to people working directly with the child. Those implementing the plans must be able to identify the function(s) of the (problem) behaviors for the individual child and which factors in the environment are causing and/or maintaining the behaviors. It is not enough, for example, for a parent to follow a recipe for a token system, time out, or an incidental teaching protocol. Just as rote learning without understanding in children rarely generalizes to effective learning, so too individuals working to change problem behaviors will not be effective in doing so without understanding the principles involved. For example, using time-out when problem behavior is maintained by escape from an aversive task would likely function as a reinforcer and thus would fail to decrease problem behavior. Furthermore, motivation to follow through on all aspects of a plan, (particularly aspects which may be boring for the helper or be met with resistance from the child), often depends on understanding why these procedures are important. The premise here is that when all involved have the same basic knowledge of behavioral principles, it is easier to plan together, implement, and reassess treatment plans as a team. In order to take the role of team leader and educator of other team members, as described above, the behavior analyst should possess certain basic competencies. Shook and Favell (1996) list basic competencies which behavior analysts should be expected to demonstrate. This list was compiled through a national survey conducted by the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation as a means of updating the Florida Behavior Analysis Certification Examination. Two hundred fifty-six individuals from 35 states participated in this survey. All were certified behavior analysts in Florida or Oklahoma or full members of the Association for Behavior Analysis. The results were compiled into a list of 108 competencies (divided into 12 content areas) which were judged by the respondents to be important skills in behavior analysis. These competencies, (see Shook and Favell, 1996, or Shook, Hartsfield, and Hemingway, 1995, for the complete list), include skills relating to conducting a behavioral assessment using various methods to collect assessment information, summarizing and interpreting this information and designing treatment programs based on these. In addition, credentialed behavior analysts must be able to identify the characteristics of behavior analysis (and distinguish between behaviorism, the experimental analysis of behavior and applied behavior analysis) and identify legal and ethical considerations (e. …",

      "abstract": "Orientation: Current theories of repeat entrepreneurship provide little explanation for the effect of failure as a ‘trigger’ for creating successive ventures or learning from repeated failures. Research purpose: This study attempts to establish the role of previous failures on the ventures that follow them and to determine the process of learning from successive failures.Motivation for the study: Successive failures offer potentially valuable insights into the relationship between failures on the ventures that follow and the process of learning from failure.Research design, approach and method: The researchers investigated a single case study of one entrepreneur’s successive failures over 20 years.Main findings: Although the causes varied, all the failures had fundamental similarities. This suggested that the entrepreneur had not learnt from them. The previous failures did not trigger the subsequent ventures. Instead, they played a role in causing the failures. Learning from failure does not happen immediately but requires deliberate reflection. Deliberate reflection is a prerequisite for learning from failure as the entrepreneur repeated similar mistakes time after time until he reflected on each failure.Practical/managerial implications: It confirms that failure is a part of entrepreneurial endeavours. However, learning from it requires deliberate reflection. Failure does not ‘trigger’ the next venture and educators should note this.Contribution/value-add: Knowing the effect of failure on consecutive ventures may help us to understand the development of prototypes (mental frameworks) and expand the theory about entrepreneurial prototype categories.",

      "title": "Complex conversations",
      "abstract": "FigureAs a nurse leader, you encounter one common denominator every day: people. Networking with people and building relationships are the foundations of everything you do. And although the work is rewarding, it can also be emotionally draining at the same time. Not all conversations are the same or have the same significance. Some conversations are impactful, charged with emotion or with the potential to evoke strong feelings.1 When these types of conversations evolve, they can become difficult to navigate and manage. Complex conversations require skill and a consistent approach to garner positive outcomes; promote healthy relationships; and support cohesive, highly functional teams.1,2 According to the American Organization for Nursing Leadership, nurse leaders must hone the skills of effective communication and relationship building to be successful leaders within an organization.3 As with any skill set, dedicated practice and training are required to develop proficiency and competency.4 This article shares practical tips and strategies for the successful management of complex, often difficult, conversations. Do this first Most leaders dread engaging in difficult conversations with team members. This can lead to not addressing problems in a timely manner or a lack of proper preparation for complex discussions. Before beginning a difficult conversation, it's important to focus on the expected outcome(s) of the interaction in advance. Keep expectations for the conversation realistic. A team member's unhealthy behaviors won't magically disappear because of a single conversation—it takes work to accept that there's a problem and then develop an agreed-upon solution. Sometimes, a problem requires several conversations over time to achieve expected outcomes. Planning your strategy before the conversation adds value to the interaction and increases your potential for success. If you're looking to change behavior, focus on creating healthy conversations that catapult you toward that goal. When preparing for the conversation, it's important to understand contributing factors that may predispose the situation to conflict or angst. Antecedent conditions are those conditions or influences that serve to propel situations toward conflict; they may or may not be the cause but serve to influence the environment or relationship. Antecedent conditions can affect the outcome of a difficult conversation if you aren't prepared to address them. In nursing, antecedent conditions may be incompatible goals, differences in values and beliefs, task interdependencies (especially asymmetric dependencies, in which one party is dependent on the other but not vice versa), unclear or ambiguous roles, competition for scarce resources, differentiation or distancing mechanisms, and unifying mechanisms.5 Giving thought to each of these possibilities allows us to be more prepared before engaging in a difficult conversation. Identifying and addressing potential conditions decreases the challenges in the conversation and creates an environment for a more successful outcome. For example, if there's a situation of unclear or ambiguous roles, this needs to be addressed before you can move forward toward resolution. Design the interaction Preparing the environment for the conversation is important. Right time, right place, and right people are all significant when setting the appointment. Have ample time set aside for the conversation so the meeting isn't rushed but make a time limit. Select a private area because often the matters discussed are confidential. Lastly, the right people should be at the table. Depending on the issue to be discussed, additional personnel may need to be present, such as a representative from the human resources department. Framing the conversation from the beginning allows all participants to understand the ground rules and goals. Set the agenda and provide boundaries and expectations for every participant. Setting expectations for tone of voice and respect may also be valuable for participants to hold each other accountable, paving the way for a healthy dialogue to occur. Be prepared to keep the dialogue on track and proceeding in a healthy manner. Consider these five points for damage control during a difficult conversation: gain and maintain control, be objective/neutral, maintain calm, word criticisms carefully, and adhere to policies and procedures.6 You should be mentally prepared for confrontation and aware of possible misunderstanding of intentions and motives.7 Don't oversimplify the issue; be disrespectful of participants; allow lashing out, shutting-down behaviors, or silencing of participants; allow preconceived notions to interfere or feelings and emotions to rule the conversation; or lose focus on or commitment to the goal.7 And remember that everyone must own their contribution to the problem.7 Steer the dialogue exchange There are several techniques for navigating difficult conversations, including storytelling, the talking stick, the broken record, the Situation-Behavior-Impact (SBI) model, listen to collaborate, and confrontation. You may decide to slightly change one or combine two or more to create what you think will work best for your impending conversation. Storytelling. This technique is best used when two people don't agree on the details of the shared experience. It allows for participants to share, with equal time, their perception of what occurred in the conflict. Once the first individual has shared what happened, including how it made him or her feel, the second individual must repeat back what he or she heard. Next, the two individuals change roles and repeat the process. This negates the opportunity for either person to agree or disagree with what the other has stated because it's his or her \"story.\" You then facilitate by leading the conversation through steps to resolution and how to move forward to reconciliation.8,9 Talking stick. The talking stick technique is valuable when you have individuals who attempt to monopolize the conversation. It has fewer boundaries than storytelling and can be used with individuals who are more seasoned. Each person has the opportunity to discuss how he or she feels but can only talk if holding the stick. You're responsible for holding them accountable and monitoring talk time so that both participants are equally participatory. Once you sense the discussion is completed, the conversation then navigates toward resolution.10 Broken record. This technique is about redirecting and refocusing the conversation to focus on the reason for the meeting. It's most often used between a leader and team member. In this situation, you would use a phrase such as, \"I understand you're aware of a coworker who's been tardy; however, today we're here to discuss your attendance issues.\" Each time the team member brings up the other employee, consistently refocus the discussion back to him or her, repeating the same phrase.11,12 SBI. This technique can be used when you anticipate a conversation that may be particularly challenging regarding feedback. Focused on the behavior rather than the individual, SBI was developed as a framework to provide organization and structure for any feedback situation.13 The three steps of situation, behavior, and feedback are used to build the conversation pieces. The intent is to design your conversation around the unhealthy behavior, not the team member. The conversation should address the situation using specific details so the individual has a clear understanding of what behavior needs to be addressed. Lastly, you marry the behavior with what resulted in the situation. SBI may be the best choice when you need to address the behaviors of individuals who have no insight into their own actions. You frame the conversation in such a way to facilitate self-reflection. The goal is for the individual to realize how his or her behaviors impact the team. Listen to collaborate. People listen in different ways in different situations. You can be listening for information, such as when you ask for directions or listen for a solution when you have a broken piece of equipment. However, it's particularly important to listen when you need to collaborate in a difficult situation. Monitor your emotions so you can obtain all the information you need to have a successful, healthy conversation. Consider these seven steps to collaboration: start with empathy and insight listening, use your eyes, listen for feelings, don't be fooled by anger, acknowledge, normalize the feelings, and uncover inferences and assumptions.12 The main idea with this technique is to discover triggers that cause emotional highs and attempt to remove those obstacles. Be calm and work with individuals to promote resolution. Once emotional highs enter the conversation, you're no longer operating with rational thought but rather responding to those emotional triggers. Confrontation. Although confrontation has a negative connotation, it's an effective tool for resolving conflict when used appropriately.5,14 The five steps are identify the problem, explain how the problem is affecting you personally, explain what you want to happen, ask if the other person is willing to do what you've asked, and decide on the follow-up timeline and plan.4,11,13,14 These steps may involve some negotiation and/or revisiting until there's agreement. It's important to always use \"I\" statements when interacting in a confrontation-style conversation. Avoid using \"you did\" statements because this automatically places blame and creates a defensive response. Once the conversation turns adversarial, you've lost the opportunity for resolution and a productive outcome. Define the solution It's difficult, if not impossible, to avoid a certain amount of anxiety when involved in a difficult conversation; however, if you experience resolution, you've been successful. Depending on the situation, resolution may be a handshake and verbal commitment or a written contract. Every participant should walk away in agreement with the plan to move forward. Successful navigation To be successful as a leader, it's imperative to develop trusting relationships and communicate effectively, motivating those around you to maximize their personal potential. Navigating complex or difficult conversations within your work team requires forethought, planning, and practice. We've offered tips and useful strategies to manage these conversations in a fair and consistent manner. As we've mentioned, strong communication skills evolve over time with experience and are refined with continuous growth and development, which requires a reflective intrapersonal understanding of self and a strong interpersonal skill set to be truly effective. There are excellent resources available that focus on leadership assessments, emotional intelligence, and communication styles to help you become a more skilled communicator.",

Pese a la relevancia que tienen estas experiencias como primer contacto con la realidad del ejercicio profesional, no se ha investigado cuál es su impacto en la formación de los estudiantes. En este artículo, a partir de un marco teórico centrado en Hannah Arendt y del análisis narrativo de relatos de estudiantes, se busca comprender cómo operan los pensamientos congelados en sus experiencias como practicantes preprofesionales.A partir del análisis, se han identificado los siguientes pensamientos congelados: (i) trabajar en exceso es necesario para aprender, (ii) el maltrato es válido si les ocurre a todos y (iii) el propio rol consiste en cumplir los encargos sin pensar ni cuestionar. Aunque estos pensamientos son transmitidos a los estudiantes en situaciones de incumplimiento legal, maltrato y comisión de faltas éticas, suelen actuar conforme a lo esperado sin decir ni hacer algo. Predomina el miedo a no ser valorados y se deja de lado cualquier proceso de reflexión donde puedan cuestionar lo que les indican. Hay, sin embargo, casos donde los estudiantes dudan de si tales pensamientos son correctos, pero el conflicto interno queda sin resolver.La relevancia de este trabajo radica en mostrar parte de lo que acontece en un ámbito formativo que tiene gran impacto en el aprendizaje, pero que ha sido desatendido. Particularmente, muestra modos en los que factores anímicos, como el deseo de ser reconocido y la duda respecto a la propia valía, funcionan como barreras en los procesos de pensamiento y acción. Finalmente, a nivel de reflexión pedagógica, se presenta a la pedagogía socrática como aproximación que puede tener buenos resultados a nivel de la formación ética de estudiantes que viven situaciones como las analizadas.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue, as a psychophysiological state, is a normal human condition experienced as a result of mental or physical activity that consumes one's biological resources. In order to relieve its symptoms and to restore human's ability to continue work, a return to a fresh, relaxed state is required. It is usually obtained by an adequate amount of rest and/or sleep, but under the presence of some disadvantageous factors, such as too hot or too cold microclimate, high levels of noise at a workplace, work overload, psychological stress, lack of motivation, and others, e.g., family or health-related problems, this needed amount of rest simply may not fit into a normal 24-hour cycle of activity, resulting in the fatigue built-up. A fatigued worker becomes prone to performance deterioration, loss of concentration, misjudgment of his/her environmental safety, hazardous behaviors, anxiety and sleepiness. Therefore, worker's fatigue management is essential for improving productivity and quality of work, as well as for building worker's satisfaction, motivation and overall wellbeing. To supervise fatigue, appropriate tools for its measurement are required. This paper presents an overview of existing methods of fatigue measurement, including psychological (self-reports and questionnaires), physiological (i.e., changes in various body functions), and performance related (e.g., reaction time, sensory abilities) ones.",

      "abstract": "Self-control processes regulate thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that are critical for every day functioning and for overcoming life’s different circumstances. Researchers have suggested that these processes may draw on a common inner resource. Specifically, it has been argued that self-control tasks can deplete self-control processes, leading to ego-depletion on subsequent task performance. Importantly, the question about ego-depletion remaining global or in a particular domain of task is still on ongoing debate. Therefore, in the present research, we investigated in a series of experiments whether initial cognitive or emotion controls would affect differently a subsequent performance on a cognitive task. However, our results did not show any evidence of ego-depletion effects...",

      "abstract": "In workplaces, stress is normal. Stress is both physical and mental. It may be caused by major events such as a change in responsibilities or expectations at work, and job promotions, loss, or changes. Smaller, daily events also cause stress. This stress is not that apparent, but the constant and cumulative impact of the small stressors adds up to a big impact. This big impact affects a worker's physical and mental sense of well-being. Too much stress can cause physical, emotional, and behavioural problems. It can cause defensiveness, lack of motivation, difficulty concentrating, accidents, reduced productivity, and interpersonal conflict. Minor problems such as sleep-loss, irritability, backaches, or headaches may also happen. When employees suffer from the problems mentioned above, they are unable to work with high efficiency. Sometimes, managers may discover that the productivity of the company has declined but do not know the reasons. Since the causes of stress are various among employees, it is hard for managers to solve all the potential problems without receiving reviews from employees, which is an essential ingredient for the long-term success of a company or an organisation.",

      "title": "\"I know it but I can't say it\": Using self-report to understand the experience of inner speech in aphasia (P1.211)",
      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE:\nMany individuals with aphasia make comments such as, “I know it but I can’t say it.” We provide opportunity for them to describe more precisely what this means, exploring implications for our understanding and treatment of word retrieval deficits in aphasia.\nBACKGROUND:\nFew studies have examined the subjective experience or clinical relevance of inner speech in aphasia. We hypothesize that there are at least two discrete internal experiences of anomia:\n•\tRecognizing an object or concept but failing to find its name (“I know what it is in my head”)\n•\tFinding the name and saying it correctly in one’s head but not out loud (“I can say it in my head” i.e., successful inner speech, sIS)\nDESIGN/METHODS:\nSubjects (N=30) are adults with chronic aphasia resulting from unilateral stroke who participate in a structured questionnaire. We ask, “Do you ever know what you want to say but you can’t say it?” then describe the different perceptions reflected by our hypothesis. We ask subjects to identify how frequently they perceive each of these two experiences and to describe their behavioral/emotional responses.\nRESULTS:\n80[percnt] of subjects to date endorse the specific experience of sIS. Individual subjects endorse different frequencies of the two inner speech experiences. Preliminary voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) shows distinct lesion distributions associated with each experience, with higher frequencies of sIS associated specifically with inferior frontal lesions.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nMost people with aphasia report experience of internal word retrieval processes that surpass overt naming ability. Their subjective reports suggest that they can distinguish between the two distinct internal experiences of anomia reflected by our hypothesis. Preliminary VLSM results further support the dissociation. We suggest that these two experiences reflect differing levels of lexical access: sIS relies on phonological access, whereas the perception of “knowing it” relies on semantic or lemma access.

      "title": "Dual Psychological Processes Underlying Public Stigma and the Implications for Reducing Stigma",
      "abstract": "People with serious illness or disability are often burdened with social stigma that promotes a cycle of poverty via unemployment, inadequate housing and threats to mental health. Stigma may be conceptualized in terms of self-stigma (e.g., shame and lowered self-esteem) or public stigma (e.g., the general public's prejudice towards the stigmatized). This article examines two psychological processes that underlie public stigma: associative processes and rule-based processes. Associative processes are quick and relatively automatic whereas rule-based processes take longer to manifest themselves and involve deliberate thinking. Associative and rule-based thinking require different assessment instruments, follow a different time course and lead to different effects (e.g., stigma-by-association vs attributional processing that results in blame). Of greatest importance is the fact that each process may require a different stigma-prevention strategy.",

      "title": "What does it mean to be accountable?",
      "abstract": "FigureQ There's a lot of conversation about accountability in my organization. Our leadership meetings specifically mention “being accountable and holding employees accountable.” What's the best way to do this? Accountability can be a confusing term—just use a popular search engine to find the definition and you'll end up with a variety of answers. If we break down accountability into two parts—the personal value and the action of holding others accountable—we can see how one affects the other. It sounds simple, but taking responsibility for your actions or lack of actions, including taking ownership of a project, can be very difficult, especially when, as a leader, you have to say that you were the reason for a failure in your area of responsibility. How many times have you heard your leader say, “I messed up?” It takes courage to confess that you were at fault or didn't perform to the expectation. Accepting responsibility for your actions is an excellent way to role model for your direct reports. In contrast, pointing fingers at others, blaming, and excuses lead to a lack of trust in leaders; these are all ways of not being accountable for actions and outcomes. By demonstrating answerability, you can assist in building a successful team and holding team members accountable. There are key components and steps that can guide staff members, starting with ensuring that they know the expectations. It's difficult to reach a goal if you don't know what the goal is; however, be sure that the goal is realistic. For instance, if you're trying to improve patient experience scores, start by evaluating the baseline and set a reasonable goal from that baseline. If your unit is at the 50th percentile, it isn't realistic to hit the 90th percentile in 1 month. Instead, set a goal to reach the 60th percentile in 3 months. It's easier to gain a commitment when goals appear attainable and have associated timeframes. Improving commitment means including others in setting the goal. Utilize the individuals and groups doing the work when establishing your goal; they know what they can and can't do. Gaining a commitment also occurs when there's advertisement of the goal so that others are aware of the expectation. Post information in break rooms and newsletters. Also, make sure that you communicate the goal to your leader to solidify your own commitment and accountability. Recently, I was working with a nurse leader who wanted to improve her unit's compliance with medication verification barcoding. She approached the goal in phases to increase staff involvement and commitment. During each phase, she posted the unit's compliance data, as well as each individual's compliance. This is a way to measure goal attainment and provide feedback to staff. Inspecting the outcomes allows you to acknowledge desired performance and stipulate a consequence for those who don't comply. In the barcoding example, the leader made public who was meeting the established goal. She also had a prize drawing as an added incentive. Focusing on good performance tends to reap increased performance from those involved and others around them. The Business Dictionary defines accountability as “the obligation of an individual or organization to account for its activities, accept responsibility for them, and to disclose the results in a transparent manner.”1 This definition decreases confusion by encompassing what it means for leaders to be accountable and the components needed to hold others accountable.",

They are typically exhibited by young children and individuals with intellectual disabilities. Tantrums are operant behavior. That is, they are acquired and strengthened because they produce an environmental change (e.g., access to a preferred item or activity, escape or avoidance of a task). Assessment of tantrums involves a description of their frequency and the conditions under which they occur, as well as identification of the environmental variables that maintain them. Treatment of tantrums may include medication, parent training, or both. However, most recent treatments are based on the function or purpose of the tantrum, and may include breaking the relationship between tantrums and the environmental changes they produce, providing free access to the item or event produced by the tantrum, strengthening an alternative behavior that produces the same outcome as the tantrum, or a combination of these strategies.",

This theory one leadership style or another will be more conducive to group effectiveness.\r\n Fielder has considered the effects of stress on leader behavior and group performance. In general, he found (1) that low-stress conditions tend to require relatively managing, controlling leaders, while situations of moderate or interpersonal stress tend to require permissive, considerate leaders and that task-oriented leaders perform better in highly stressful conditions ; (2) that leader intelligence correlates with group performance primarily under low stress conditions or under conditions which are free of anxiety for the leader, while group member intelligence contributes to group performance under high-stress conditions and those which are anxiety-arousing for the leaders; (3) finally, that total group performance does not appear to strongly affected by the range of stress present in the laboratory studies which were discussed here.",

      "title": "Motivating and Counseling the Unemployed",
      "abstract": "textabstractDuring a ‘learning goal orientation’ training course for unemployed people, one of the participants, a woman\nin her forties, had a lot of resistance to participate in the course. I persuaded her to stay and assured her that all\nshe had to do was sit down and watch. She persevered in her idea that this was a waste of time and even tried\nto convince me that I was also wasting my time. Two weeks after the training course, I called her for a follow-up\ninterview to measure her job-search intentions and behavior. Her first response was: “I have to apologize for my\nbehavior. After the training course I passed a temporary agency for elderly people and remembered what you\nhad said about trying different strategies. And guess what, I now have a job and not just any job but exactly\nthe job that I have wanted for so long”.\nThis anecdote illustrates the potential impact that employment counseling and training courses can\nhave on individuals who have lost their job. Losing one’s job is a life event with far reaching economic,\npsychological, and physical consequences (McKee-Ryan, Song, Wanberg, & Kinicki, 2005; Paul & Moser,\n2009) and is considered to be one of the top 10 traumatic life experiences (Spera, Buhrfeind, & Pennebaker,\n1994). Besides these consequences, unemployment also deprives a person of the additional gains from\nbeing employed, such as time structure, personal identity, interpersonal contact, and activity (Jahoda,\n1982; Warr, 1987). Furthermore, the negative consequences of being unemployed tend to increase with\nincreasing duration of unemployment (Rowley & Feather, 1987).\nUnemployment affects a substantial number of people in present day economies. For example, in the\nfirst three months of 2012, 11% of the labor force in Europe and 8.2% of the labor force in the United\nStates were unemployed (Eurostat, 2012; U.S. Department of Labor, 2012). Approximately half of these\nindividuals were long-term unemployed (i.e., more than six months) at that time. These numbers equal\nthe numbers of the 1980s recession.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Personal goals guide behavior toward a desired outcome, motivate behavior over time and across situations, provide direction and meaning, and contribute to the acquisition of skills and subjective well-being. The adaptiveness of goals, however, might vary with dimensions such as their orientation toward the achievement of gains, maintenance of functioning, or the avoidance of losses. We argue that goal orientation is most adaptive when it corresponds to the availability of resources and the ubiquity of losses. In line with this argument, younger adults show a predominant orientation toward the promotion of gains, whereas goal orientation shifts toward maintenance and avoidance of loss across adulthood. This shift in goal orientation seems adaptive both regarding subjective well-being as well as engagement in goal pursuit. A second goal dimension that has been largely overlooked in the literature is the cognitive representation of goal pursuit primarily in terms of its means (i.e., process focus) or its ends (i.e., outcome focus). This chapter investigates the antecedents and consequences of goal focus. In particular, it highlights the importance of factors related to chronological age (i.e., the availability of resources, future time perspective, goal orientation, motivational phase) for the preference for and adaptiveness of an outcome or process focus. Finally, we posit that a process focus leads to more adaptive behavioral and affective reactions when people encounter failure during goal pursuit.",

      "title": "The Spontaneous Thoughts of the Night: How Future Tasks Breed Intrusive Cognitions",
      "abstract": "Everyone has had the experience of trying to clear one's mind before going to sleep, only to have intrusive cognitions about future tasks (e.g., giving a speech, solving a financial conundrum) perturb consciousness. Similar cognitions can interfere with other goals (e.g., to concentrate while driving). We propose that intrusive cognitions are far from indeterminate and reflect the 'prospective' nature of the brain. We hypothesize that they are triggered automatically by future tasks that may benefit from forethought. Accordingly, during a meditation-like exercise requiring one to clear the mind of excess thought and focus on just one thing (breathing), participants reported more intrusive cognitions about a future task that could benefit from forethought than when they anticipated no future task or anticipated a task that, though of comparable difficulty and content, could not benefit from forethought. This finding illuminates conditions such as rumination and the prospective nature of the brain.",

      "title": "When the managerial merry-go-round stops: A case study of how disconfirming episodes affect the identities of expert football managers.",
      "abstract": "Due to the highly competitive nature of top-level football (i.e., top domestic league or international standard) expert football managers often undergo several disconfirming episodes throughout their careers (e.g., job loss, public criticism, unsuccessful interviews or career moves).However, little is known about how such episodes are experienced and impact identity.Therefore, the following case study aims explore the affect, if any, disconfirming experiences had on the identities and self-concept of three, unemployed, top-level football managers.Narrative constructs reveal that during disconfirming episodes' managers experience feelings of anger, a loss of self-respect, disappointment, and sadness.Further, they also report how confusion regarding their future career prospects leaves them in a state of limbo (i.e., identity interference), whereby they were unsure as to how, when or if they should cease their commitment to a valued identity.When the managerial merry-go-round stops. When the Managerial Merry-go-round Stops: A Case Study of how DisconfirmingEpisodes Affect the Identities of Expert Football Managers There are only two types of manager.Those who have been sacked and those who will be in the future.~ Howard Wilkinson, Chair of the League Managers Association.Recent years have witnessed a surge of public interest in the career trajectories of football managers 1 .Betting companies offer odds on who will be sacked first, the sports sections of newspapers and websites are filled with stories about which manager is insecure in their job, and fans around the world pontificate with friends and colleagues over their respective manager's future.Despite this considerable public interest and calls from several scholars (Kenttä, Mellalieu, Roberts, 2016;Lavallee, 2006; Gordon & Lavallee, 2004), little research has thus far been conducted within the population of sports managers (Lavallee, 2006).Instead, the extant literature has primarily focussed on athletes' experiences of adjustment difficulties during disconfirming experiences (e.g., career termination, unsuccessful junior to senior transitions, club initiated transfers, and injury).Research conducted within an athlete population, however, has argued that the competitive environment of elite sport limits opportunities for post-career planning (Lavallee, 2005; Lavallee, Gordon, & Grove, 1996; Taylor & Ogilvie, 2001).Given that both managers and athletes operate within the same environment -albeit facing different challenges -it is likely that managers will report a similar lack of post-career planning.Lavallee ( 2006) lends weight to this notion and suggests that managers report an unwillingness to consider a career outside of management.Given that the average tenure of managers in the English football leagues is 1.66 years (League Managers Association, 2017) and that 50% of first time managers fail to achieve a second managerial position (Bridgewater, 2010), this is problematic.Further, Lavallee, Gordon, and Grove (1997) suggests that while working in management may allow sport-related identities and social support networks to remain intact, managers are vulnerable to identity related difficulties should they cease to maintain a career in management.Shavelson, Hubner and Stanton (1976) define self-concept as the way a person generally perceives him-or herself, based on their experience and interpretation of their environment.The primary role of such generalisations is to organise and guide the processing of self-related information, acting as a selective mechanism which determines how information is structured and ultimately, attended to (Strachan, Sheilds, Beatty, & Glassford, 2012).As such, the process is relatively fluid and is in part influenced by the views of significant others and one's own behaviour.In contrast, identities are formed at a more conscious level and are based on the individual's traits and characteristics, their social relations, and the roles and social group memberships in which they occupy.As such, identities help us to make meaning and evaluate what is important to us within a context (Oyserman, Elmore, & Smith, 2012).Although the self-concept includes the cognitive generalisations held about a specific role, role-identity refers to the self-descriptive and internalised social role an individual occupies (Owens, Robinson, & Smith-Lovin, 2010).Like a police officer with a criminal or a parent and child, each role occupied is accompanied with role expectations, reinforces membership, and creates a unique identity (Hogg, 2006).Within football, Mills (2015, p. 610) describes the social pressures unemployed managers experience and the diminutive influence this may have on identity:",

      "title": "Concentric Circles Dialogue Exercise",
      "abstract": "The context: I adapted this process from anti-racism training for interreligious classroom and conference settings. It also lends itself to intra-group dialogue. This process works best for groups of twenty or more. The pedagogical purpose: (1) To build community; (2) To provide an opportunity for students to share their religious/spiritual stories, including family backgrounds, values, beliefs, and commitments; (3) To practice both listening and speaking as integral to dialogue; and (4) To work against religious stereotypes by providing opportunities for participants to encounter adherents of other religious traditions as individuals. Description of the strategy: Students sit in two concentric circles facing each other. Begin the session by asking students to introduce themselves to their partner. The session is a series of questions (generally four to six) pertaining to each person's experience of their religious or spiritual tradition. Participants frame their responses in “I” statements. Only one person may speak at a time. Each partner is asked the same question in a given time frame (two to five minutes). The facilitator designates partners to begin with the inside or outside circle, and gives a signal when it is time to switch partners. After both partners have answered the question, the inner or outer circle moves around the circle until each participant has a new partner. With each rotation, ask deeper questions. Sample questions: What is your religious/spiritual tradition and what are you most proud of from that heritage? Growing up, what did the adults in your life teach you about religious differences? When and how did you first become aware of religious differences? Today, what is your greatest fear in interreligious dialogue? What do you hope to gain from interreligious dialogue? Lastly, evaluate the experience with the group: How was that exercise for you? What was the most challenging? New insights? Why it is effective: This process emphasizes that dialogue is about speaking and listening. The kinetic movement around the room reduces anxiety, and the sequencing of the questions brings a depth to the discussion quickly. The process helps students hone critical thinking skills, such as interpreting experience, to develop metacognitive awareness of their interpretative processes, and to cultivate deep listening and working to understand others. Rather than favoring students with cultural and linguistic advantages, this method allows democratic access to the process.",

Kecemasan biasanya direfleksikan lewat kata-kata berupa\r\nkeluhan dan menunjukkan sikap pesimis dan tidak jelas dalam menyampaikan isi\r\npesan yang akan disampaikan. Kondisi seperti ini, tidak jarang membuat individu\r\ntakut, cemas, dan khawatir yang seringkali diwujudkan dalam perilaku\r\npenghindaran terhadap peristiwa tersebut. Ketika mengalami kecemasan individuindividu\r\nbiasanya tidak mengalami ketegangan yang subyektif (subjective\r\ntension) tetapi berperilaku (overt behavior) dalam cara-cara yang mengganggu\r\ninteraksi sosial. Individu yang gugup dan terhambat dalam penyampaian pendapat\r\ndi depan umum menjadi kurang efektif secara sosial. Kecemasan dapat ditinjau\r\nmelalui tiga komponen, yaitu: Komponen fisiologis (physiological components),\r\nseperti badan berkeringat, muka merah. Komponen kognitif (cognitive/perceptual\r\ncomponents), berupa keyakinan bahwa sesorang menilai negatif terhadap dirinya.\r\nKomponen perilaku (behavioral components), dalam bentuk upaya seseorang\r\nuntuk menghindari situasi yang membuat dia merasakan kecemasan sosial atau\r\nsocial anxiety.\r\nPenelitian ini didesain dalam bentuk penelitian kuantitatif, dengan\r\nmenggunakan metode eksperimen one group pretest-posttest design dan\r\nmengambil lokasi di MAN Yogyakarta III.

      "title": "The Mere Urgency Effect",
      "abstract": "In everyday life, people are often faced with choices between tasks of varying levels of urgency and importance. How do people choose? Normatively speaking, people may choose to perform urgent tasks with short completion windows, instead of important tasks with larger outcomes, because important tasks are more difficult and further away from goal completion, urgent tasks involve more immediate and certain payoffs, or people want to finish the urgent tasks first and then work on important tasks later. The current research identifies a mere urgency effect, a tendency to pursue urgency over importance even when these normative reasons are controlled for. Specifically, results from five experiments demonstrate that people are more likely to perform unimportant tasks (i.e., tasks with objectively lower payoffs) over important tasks (i.e., tasks with objectively better payoffs), when the unimportant tasks are characterized merely by spurious urgency (e.g., an illusion of expiration). The mere urgency effect documented in this research violates the basic normative principle of dominance—choosing objectively worse options over objectively better options. People behave as if pursuing an urgent task has its own appeal, independent of its objective consequence.",

What facilitates the setting of adherence goals, and what guarantees acting on them?

Fluid reasoning is the ability to reason, form concepts, and solve problems, particularly when confronted with a novel task or unfamiliar situation. Several studies have found extremely high correlations between fluid reasoning and WM capacity. Executive functions include mental processes responsible for cuing, directing, and coordinating multiple aspects of perception, cognition, emotion, and behavior during purposeful, goal-directed, problem-solving behavior. Nearly all experts in executive functions agree that WM is one of the executive functions. Attention is a complex, multifaceted psychological process that influences cognition, learning, behavior, and performance.

Across studies of attention and memory and a range of allied areas, including academic achievement, judgment and decision making, and neuropsychological assessment, optimal outcomes are found when performance times align with peaks in circadian arousal, a finding known as the synchrony effect. The benefits of performing in synchrony with ones’ chronotype (and the cost of not doing so) are most robust for individuals with strong morning or evening chronotypes and for tasks that require effortful, analytical processing or the suppression of distracting information. Failure to take the synchrony effect into consideration may be a factor in issues ranging from replication difficulties to school timing to assessing intellectual disabilities and apparent cognitive decline in aging.",

      "abstract": "Many interventions targeting cognitive skills or socioemotional skills and behaviors demonstrate initially promising but then quickly disappearing impacts. Our article seeks to identify the key features of interventions, as well as the characteristics and environments of the children and adolescents who participate in them, that can be expected to sustain persistently beneficial program impacts. We describe three such processes: skill-building, foot-in-the-door and sustaining environments. We argue that skill-building interventions should target “trifecta” skills—ones that are malleable, fundamental, and would not have developed eventually in the absence of the intervention. Successful foot-in-the-door interventions equip a child with the right skills or capacities at the right time to avoid imminent risks (e.g., grade failure or teen drinking) or seize emerging opportunities (e.g., entry into honors classes). The sustaining environments perspective views high quality of environments subsequent to the completion of the intervention as crucial for sustaining earlier skill gains. These three perspectives generate both complementary and competing hypotheses regarding the nature, timing, and targeting of interventions that generate enduring impacts.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Do not make these erroneous, simplistic assumptions: (1) Psychological phenomena need non-Skinner-box concepts for their understanding; (2) All natural and performance-management contingencies are the direct-acting contingencies of the Skinner box; (3) The delayed delivery of a reinforcer is reinforcement; and (4) A contingency will be ineffective, if it involves a delayed outcome. Delayed-outcome performance-management contingencies can be effective, if their outcomes are sufficiently sizeable and probable, if they involve deadlines (in the case of performance maintenance contingencies), and if the performer knows the rule describing the contingency. The main function of rules describing delayed-outcome performance-management contingencies is their creation of noncompliance as an aversive condition. The performer then escapes or attenuates the aversive condition by complying with the rule. However, the aversiveness of noncompliance is a function of our preschool behavioral history. For example, such early childhood training determines the proximity to the deadline before noncompliance becomes aversive enough to motivate compliance. Thus, early childhood training determines the amount of performance management needed to obtain reliable performance; so we all need Jewish mothers, or their surrogates, if we are to avoid the need of excessive performance management.",

The task interruption and resumption protocol described in this research is tailored to test the activation of cognitive goals (e.g., a goal to think more abstractly). Cognitive goals may be pursued even during the interruption period; thus, to prevent this, the protocol involves cognitive distraction. The protocol consists of several stages. Specifically, the initial stage includes the goal activation process, where the treatment (versus control) condition receives a manipulation to activate the cognitive goal being tested by the researcher. In the next stage, participants are presented with the introduction of a task that is perceived to either satisfy or not satisfy the cognitive goal of interest. Importantly, this task is interrupted a few seconds after it begins. The task interruption forces a delay period and introduces a cognitive distraction to prevent the automatic pursuit and fulfillment of the cognitive goal. After the interruption period, participants are given a choice between resuming the interrupted task and abandoning the interrupted task to complete an alternative task instead. Among participants whose cognitive goals had been activated at the earlier stage, the task resumption rate should be higher if the task was perceived as an opportunity to satisfy (versus not satisfy) the goal. Such a finding would provide empirical evidence that the cognitive goal has been activated and pursued.

      "title": "\"The Map Is Not the Territory It Represents\": Consequences on the Evaluation-Intervention Process",
      "abstract": "A teacher meets a student during recess to discuss his behavior in class. The psychologist of the school board presents the results of a child's evaluation process. During a meeting aiming to establish a personalized intervention plan, we discuss the learning difficulties and behavioral disabilities of a student. In such situations, words are used to express one's self, to convey information, to develop a point of view, to verbalize emotions. .... Language is indeed an essential communication tool. One uses it spontaneously with the assurance that it will convey precisely what one desires to transmit. During the exchange, precisions are given; perspectives are stated and developed; and arguments are presented. Everyone thus relies on language to express a thought, but since language is often taken for granted, it is scarcely or never questioned. (1) When John is identified as being at risk, or as having a low self-esteem, or if he is diagnosed with opposition/provocation trouble, what do these terms tell us about him in particular? In short, what is a word? What is language? Can the category at risk associated with John can be considered true to who he is in reality'? To answer positively is actually to consider language as a mere copy or a reflection of reality; in other words, like a reflection in a mirror! A radically different perspective would be to consider language as a concerted means of communication, a social convention. Considered as such, when one affirms that John is at risk, one refers to certain rules, or certain socially agreed upon standards in order to assert that such is the case. (2) According to such a perspective, rather than being conceived as simple reflections of reality, words would be considered social agreements entailing order or collectively giving meaning to situations or to things around us. A student has failed an important evaluation; he frequently hands back unfinished papers; he always postpones his work; and one could add any other such observations concerning his adaptation to the school setting or its apprenticeships. In Quebec, due to the Ministere de l' education's (2000) definition, the label at risk could certainly be considered on the basis of such a set of observations. The obvious difficulties of the student would thus be evaluated or weighted according to the predictability of his academic failure. (3) Would the appellation at risk be considered as a reflection or a faithful mirror of this particular case? If so, wouldn't it be possible to reverse the operation and, from that designation, obtain an accurate description of this student? Obviously the answer is negative. What should be concluded then? In brief, how relevant is it to inquire about the meaning of language? What benefits can be drawn from such an inquiry in regard to planning an approach to help and support a student in difficulty? Alfred Korzybsky's widely cited formula Map is not the deserves careful consideration in order to clearly grasp the issue of language's meaning. The aim of the present paper is to clarify the significance of this apparently trivial claim in the case of an evaluation--intervention plan. Indeed, one admits the usefulness of a roadmap or even its necessity for travel. In the same way, the description of a child's situation might be helpful even though it does not cover the overall territory. Certain therapists, as it will be shown in this paper, make an explicit use of this metaphor of the map and the territory to orient their intervention plan. Map Is Not the Territory First consider this story reported by Korzybski (1951): In a railroad compartment an American grandmother with her young and attractive granddaughter, a Romanian officer, and a Nazi officer were the only occupants. The train was passing through a dark tunnel, and all that was heard was a loud kiss and a vigorous slap. After the train emerged from the tunnel, nobody spoke, but the grandmother was saying to herself, 'What a fine girl I have raised. …",

      "abstract": "Problem solving and decision making are both examples of complex, higher-order thinking. Both involve the assessment of the environment, the involvement of working memory or short-term memory, reliance on long term memory, effects of knowledge, and the application of heuristics to complete a behavior. A problem can be defined as an impasse or gap between a current state and a desired goal state. Problem solving is the set of cognitive operations that a person engages in to change the current state, to go beyond the impasse, and achieve a desired outcome. Problem solving involves the mental representation of the problem state and the manipulation of this representation in order to move closer to the goal. Problems can vary in complexity, abstraction, and how well defined (or not) the initial state and the goal state are. Research has generally approached problem solving by examining the behaviors and cognitive processes involved, and some work has examined problem solving using computational processes as well. Decision making is the process of selecting and choosing one action or behavior out of several alternatives. Like problem solving, decision making involves the coordination of memories and executive resources. Research on decision making has paid particular attention to the cognitive biases that account for suboptimal decisions and decisions that deviate from rationality. The current bibliography first outlines some general resources on the psychology of problem solving and decision making before examining each of these topics in detail. Specifically, this review covers cognitive, neuroscientific, and computational approaches to problem solving, as well as decision making models and cognitive heuristics and biases.",

Theories on human action serve as the point of departure for establishing two currents of thought explaining action or non-action by people. Two working principles are proposed, i.e., that it is necessary to both know and rely on human beings. These two principles are expressed in two premises: \"Only by knowing individuals and their living circumstances is it possible to take efficient and on-going action in health,\" and \"No one can care for someone else's health if that person does not wish to do so himself/herself.\" The author goes on to raise seven theses: 1. There is no such thing as one person knowing and another not knowing; rather, there are two people who know distinct things. 2. Education is imparted not only through educational programs, but in all health-related action. 3. Ignorance is not a void to be filled, but a plenitude to be changed. 4. Education should be dialogical and participatory. 5. Education should reinforce people's self-confidence. 6. Education should seek to reinforce the effort-achievement model of knowledge. 7. Education should promote individual responsibility and collective cooperation.",

To address intractable or wicked problems, characterized by having multiple stakeholders with competing perspectives and by an absence of obvious solution, it may be necessary first to unlearn existing responses and to ask fresh questions to illuminate what is as yet unknown. Action learning privileges questions over solutions in seeking learning from action on organizational challenges, whilst critical action learning is a variety that employs insights from critical social theory to promote critical reflection and unlearning in this process. The article breaks new ground in claiming: first, that unlearning in the context of the wicked problems of social work is characterized less by the discarding of outmoded knowledge and routines and more by a critical unlearning that opens up new possibilities of not knowing and non-action; and second, that critical unlearning is much more likely to take place when supported by a deliberated and social process such as that provided by critical action learning.",

Having too much time to complete a task can slip easily into feelings of boredom. The sense of having too little time can be a major contributor to work-related stress. Even where tasks can be finished comfortably within a given time, dissatisfaction can still arise if the tempo of work remains unchanging. Indeed, introducing variety into the pace of work is an important means of reducing the monotony inherent in many jobs. Where such variation in the tempo of work does not occur naturally, many employees will seek to create it, at times by speeding up their work pace and at other times by working more slowly. This breaking up of the working period into distinctive segments, each with their own temporal characteristics, is one strategy that many work people employ to 'get through' a monotonous working day (see Chapter 8).",

      "title": "Varieties of Executive Dysfunction in Autism.",
      "abstract": "This paper presents four studies which illustrate the variety of deficits in executive function displayed by individuals with autism. The concept of executive function is used to encompass all the mental operations which are involved in self-reflective and goal-directed behavior. Four forms of executive control are addressed: mental disengagement, coordination of two separate acts into a goal-directed temporal sequence, cognitive flexibility, and planning. The results of the first two studies indicate that subjects with autism are impaired in the processes required for learning behavioral strategies which involve a counter-intuitive or arbitrary association between response and target. The dysfunction may result from stuck in set perseveration, recurrent perseveration, or failure to sustain a plan of action in the absence of environmental cues. Results from the third study indicated a deficit in the processes required to shift attention from a salient dimension or category and engage attention upon a previously irrelevant stimulus. Results of the fourth study showed that subjects with autism are unable to find efficient solutions to planning problems which require a depth-first search to anticipate obstacles and the cognitive flexibility to change plans so as to avoid these obstacles.

      "abstract": "Learned helplessness is defined as the mental situation appearing after a person is not able to control the actions or chain of actions due to a negative event or many events. According to experimental findings, in an individual who experiences uncontrollable cases, a decreasing effect in the capacity of learning the behaviors to be produced in the controllable cases is observed. Ensuing helplessness arising from this occurring goes on affecting mentally. Learned helplessness is a phenomena happening after a person mentally interprets a situation and indicates this to the behavior. This affects the individuals’ success and failure. The discourses systematically analyzing the learning processes in different aspects, which is really fairly complicated, and trying to explain what learning is, what for it happens in a certain way, and how it happens can be generally observed in two category; behaviorist and cognitive. Behaviorists observe the learning as the relation between stimuli and reaction and generally explain it being learnt of observed behaviors (Ersanli, 2002). Cognitive development consists of thinking, memory, and changes in the language. Cognitive development, according to the schemes occurring in the mind, happens by realizing the new items according to this scheme and absorbing them to it, and adapting them (Kucukkaragoz, 2002). In this study, the effect of phenomena of learned helplessness to the individuals’ success has been worked in behaviorist and cognitive approach. In this study there is a relation between an individual’s success and learned helplessness. Moreover, it was observed that the sex and the economic situation also affected the success. it was understood that the rate of anxiety is higher among the individuals in the low and middle class. Girls were also seen having higher anxiety because of their emotional behaviors. But in the case there was no high emotion mode, their mark average was higher than the boys. It was seen that low anxiety mode affected the success positively.",

      "title": "Managing Leadership Dilemmas",
      "abstract": "Some of the most complex and challenging problems that arise for educational leaders are actually “leadership dilemmas.” This type of dilemma, which must be owned by the leader, contains a strong tension between a desire to achieve the goals of the organization and simultaneously preserve positive relationships. Performance appraisal is one of the main contexts in which this dilemma arises for the leader. In most cases it is not recognized or is avoided because of its potential to create conflict and unpleasantness. Common avoidance approaches include polarizing the strands of the dilemma and attending to either an organizational demand or a relationship concern, and in such cases the problem is only partly solved and resurfaces at a later date. Because there is often a high level of anxiety experienced by both parties in staff appraisal situations, the avoidance of dilemmas is ubiquitous and poor performance is not confronted. Consequently, many significant issues that impact on student learning are not attended to effectively, and these problems persist and recur. When educational leaders are motivated to deal with these extremely difficult problems, they must engage in a learning loop that allows them to reflect on and change values that do not lead to long-term problem resolution. They must be willing to surface and confront the conflict inherent in a leadership dilemma. This involves understanding the nature of a leadership dilemma and being able to analyze the defensive theory of action that blocks learning when conflict is present. It involves knowing about and practicing an alternative theory of action that can guide efforts to be productive in addressing the problem. In order to manage leadership dilemmas, specific skills for double-loop learning, such as the Triple I approach, must be acquired and internalized so that productive conversations can occur.",

      "abstract": "Pembimbing: (1) Dra. Siti Suminarti Fasikhah, M.Si (2) NiÂ’matuzahroh, S.Psi, M.Si\r\n\r\n\r\nKecerdasan emosi sangat berpengaruh pada prestasi seseorang, baik dalam hal prestasi akademik maupun prestasi non-akademik. Bahkan menurut Goleman, Kecerdasan Emosi memiliki peran yang dominan daripada IQ terhadap prestasi seseorang. Dengan memiliki kecerdasan emosi yang tinggi ia akan cakap dalam mengelola emosi diri, berempati, memotivasi diri serta menjalin hubungan dengan orang lain termasuk orang baru. Seorang individu yang memiliki kecerdasan emosi yang tinggi dikatakan memiliki kemampuan yang didasarkan pada pengaturan diri, atau kemampuan menangani impuls dan emosi. Dengan kemampuan tersebut, seseorang akan dapat mengungguli individu lain dalam suatu hal. Begitu pula dengan self-efficacy, dimana self-efficacy adalah suatu keyakinan atau kepercayaan individu terhadap dirinya mengenai kemampuan dirinya untuk berhasil dalam melakukan suatu hal dan menghadapi suatu permasalahan atau rintangan, maupun tugas yang diberikan. Mereka yang memiliki self-efficacy tinggi akan dengan senang hati menghadapi tantangan, sedangkan mereka yang memiliki self-efficacy rendah untuk mencoba pun tidak berani, tidak peduli betapa baiknya kemampuan mereka yang sesungguhnya. Dari hal tersebut dapat dikatakan bahwa rasa percaya akan kemampuan diri meningkatkan hasrat untuk berprestasi, sedangkan keraguan menurunkannya.\r\n\r\nVariabel yang digunakan pada penelitian ini adalah variabel bebas dan variabel terikat. Dimana kecerdasan emosi sebagai variabel bebas dan self-efficacy sebagai variabel terikatnya. Populasi dalam penelitian ini adalah seluruh anggota Club Olahraga Bola Voli MVC (Malang Volleyball Club). Instrumen penelitian ini yaitu skala Kecerdasan Emosi dan skala self-efficacy menggunakan jenis skala Likert. Teknik pengambilan sampel yang digunakan adalah purposive sampling, dengan sampel berjumlah 50 orang atlet. Validitasnya menggunakan korelasi product moment sedangkan reliabilitasnya menggunakan t-score.\r\n\r\nHasil penelitian yang diperoleh dari penelitian ini menunjukkan adanya hubungan yang positif dan sangat signifikan antara Kecerdasan Emosi dengan self-efficacy dengan nilai koefisien korelasi (r) = 0,577 dan probabilitas kesalahan (p) = 0,000. Artinya pada atlet Bola Voli MVC yang memiliki Kecerdasan Emosi yang tinggi ia juga akan memiliki self-efficacy yang tinggi, begitu pula sebaliknya. Efektifitas pengaruh Kecerdasan Emosi terhadap self-efficacy adalah 33,3% sedangkan sisanya 67,7% berasal dari variabel yang tidak diteliti. Saran bagi peneliti selanjutnya diharapkan dapat menyempurnakan penelitian dengan menggunakan metode penelitian yang berbeda dan menggunakan variabel yang lebih lain yang diperkirakan dapat memiliki pengaruh lebih besar terhadap self-efficacy, seperti kelekatan antar individu dalam tim, regulasi emosi, kepribadian atlet, pola asuh atau pun latar belakang kebudayaan.",

      "abstract": "Why do some employees perform poorly? Most managers would answer that question by ticking off a list that includes weak skills, insufficient experience, inability to prioritize assignments, and lack of motivation. In other words, they would contend that poor performance is the employee's fault. But is it? Not always, according to the authors. Their research with hundreds of executives strongly suggests that it is the bosses themselves--albeit unintentionally--who are frequently responsible for an employee's subpar achievement. According to the authors, bosses and their perceived weak performers are often caught in a dynamic called the set-up-to-fail syndrome, which tends to play out as follows: A boss begins to worry when a subordinate's performance is not satisfactory. He then takes what seems like the obvious action by increasing the time and attention he focuses on the employee. But rather than improve the subordinate's performance, the increased supervision has the reverse effect. The subordinate, in perceiving the boss's lack of confidence in him, withdraws from his work and from the boss. And the relationship spirals downward. What is a boss to do? First, he must accept the possibility that his own behavior could be contributing to the problem. Second, he must plan a careful intervention with the subordinate that takes the form of one or several candid conversations meant to untangle the unhealthy dynamics in the relationship. The intervention is never easy, but the time and energy invested in it usually yields a high payback.",

An action just makes this learning explicit and, when it is iterated, reinforces learning. Practice is needed and then the learning situations become difficult to organize and understand. Practical or action learning is always problem centered, unlike theoretical learning. To create an efficient learning situation one needs to take care of the realization of all the various conditions. The main philosophical problem is related to the practice-internal loop between action and learning. When action learning forces one to accept a method, this may mean the highest achievement or a mere technical capability, depending on the nature of the individual case. Skills are useful but also problematic. Intuitively, an action is just that, an action, and not another thing.",

Without an explicit consideration of levels of analysis in both research and practice, leadership cannot be right. In particular, leadership theory without levels of analysis is incomplete, leadership data without levels of analysis is incomprehensible, and leadership practice without levels of analysis is ineffective. After introducing and reviewing some levels-of-analysis work, this chapter highlights how to specify levels of analysis in leadership theory, research, and practice, and offers guidelines for future leadership researchers and professionals.",

In general this is an illusion: there are costs, but they are frequently hidden. The costs of an unfriendly work environment, for example, might appear at home rather than on the job. Or they may be reflected in work productivity, but not recognised as related to problems in the setting.

Chez l'individu son choix d'une carrière ou d'un emploi, même s'il est influencé par une connaissance de ses aptitudes et de celles que semble exiger l'emploi, est ordinairement motivé par certaines impulsions, ou tendances à. l'action, fondamentales. Celles‐ci fonctionnent aussi à déterminer chez lui beaucoup d'autres intérêts et occupations. Par des questions appropriées des étudiantes d'université furent encouragées à décrire ces intérêts et occupations et leurs raisons pour les poursuivre, aussi bien que pour leur choix d'une carrière. Les réponses montrent, dans les cas divers, l'influence des impulsions suivantes: la conformité au milieu social, l'activité humaniste ou humanitaire, l'indépendance, le plaisir, le pouvoir, la supériorité, l'admiration. Les étudiantes semblaient se partager en trois groupes principaux: les deux premiers de ceux‐ci étaient dominés presque exclusivement par l'impulsion de la conformité, laquelle, cependant, produisait dans les deux groupes des types assez variés de comportement. Chez les étudiantes du troisième groupe d'autres impulsions étaient aussi fortes, sinon plus fortes, que celle de la conformité; chez quelques unes elles menaient à de vifs conflits avec celle‐ci. Il était moins probable que l'impulsion humaniste luttât avec cella de la conformité.

Diese funktioneren dadurch, dass sie gleichzeitig viele andere Interessen und Vorlieben bestimmen. Man regte Universitätsstudentinnen durch passende Fragen an, diese Interessen und Vorlieben und die Gründe, aus denen sie sie verfolgten, und die Gründe ihrer Berufswahl zu beschreiben. Die Antworten zeigten in verschiedenen Fällen die Wirkung folgender Triebe: soziale Anpassung, humanistische oder humanitäre Tätigkeit, Selbständigkeit, Freude, Macht, Überlegenheit, Bewunderung. Die Studentinnen schienen sich in drei Hauptgattungen zu teilen: die beiden ersten wurden fast ausschliesslich vom sozialen Anpassungstrieb beherrscht, der aber ziemlich verschiedene Typen von Benehmen in den beiden Gattungen hervorrief. In jenen der dritten Gattung waren andere Triebe ebenso stark wie oder noch stärker als die soziale Anpassung und kamen in einigen Fällen in scharfen Konflikt mit demselben. Es war weniger zu erwarten, dass der humanistische Trieb mit sozialer Anpassung in Konflikt geraten würde als die anderen Triebe. Die Häufigkeit und die Bedeutung dieser Triebe sowohl wie die Art der Funktion wurden in Beziehung gesetzt zu der sozialen Umgebung des einzelnen Menschen.",

      "title": "Training and Professionalization",
      "abstract": "Abstract Contemporary sociologists generally trace the process of the transformation of an occupation into an independent profession in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Historians of medieval and early modern history trace the roots of professionalization much earlier, either in the Middle Ages or from the sixteenth century onwards. Of course it depends on one ‘s concept of professionalization. Instead of going into sociological debates as to how that process should be defined, we will limit ourselves here to some of the main components of professionalization in medieval and early modern society. It concerns primarily the ‘learned ‘ professions and consists of the following elements: (1) Education: the professional possesses a theoretical knowledge based on specialized and uniform training; (2) Organization: the professional is set apart from non-professionals by various signs and symbols; he is a member of a professional, self-regulating organization which sees to the competence, knowledge, and integrity of its peers; the professional is subject to self-control by codes of conduct; (3) Autonomy: in exercising his specialized knowledge the professional uses his own judgement and authority and thus he enjoys autonomy, restrained by responsibility; (4) Service: the professional is expected to provide service and to put the client ‘s interest above his own.",

      "abstract": "The topic of anonymity is conceptually and practically challenging. Among reasons for this are the multiple elements across different levels of analysis, varied contexts, and the variety of goals and dimensions that cross-cut these; 2) conflicting rationales and values; and 3) contested and/or opposing social, cultural and political trends and counter-trends. In order to better understand anonymity, this conceptual analysis article raises and suggests possible answers to the following questions: what are the major types of information that can be associated with anonymity? (nine are identified, such as location and attitudes); what do we mean by personal information (using a series of concentric circles, distinctions are drawn between individual, private, intimate, unique and core identification); what are some of the major factors affecting behaviour involving anonymity, and judgments of anonymity (e.g., the structure of the communication and the type of activity involved); what are the major values that support or oppose anonymity? (e.g., openness in communication vs. accountability); what trends and counter-trends encourage or discourage anonymity (e.g., technologies that make the meaningless meaningful as against increased freedom of choice with respect to identity); what broader principles are relevant to public policy in the area (e.g., informed consent and reciprocity); and what kinds of questions should be asked in setting policy (e.g., clear statement of goals, awareness of unintended consequences).",

The former include arisen (actual) and unarisen (potential) unwholesome or hindering thoughts and emotions such as desire and doubt. The latter include accepting, nurturing and supportive arisen and unarisen wholesome ones such as good will and generosity. Metaphor, story and exercise are used. It is explained how the effort required of self-liberating speech, action and livelihood is not so much the effort of doing but of not-doing. That is, the effort of letting go. One exercise involves a switch from reacting to an advertisement to the higher level of observing one’s reaction to the advertisement. Another shows how to cultivate a mind of loving-kindness toward others.",

      "abstract": "Burnout is a psychological state of exhaustion caused by excessive stress. Those who are involved to help others such as social workers, counselors, nurses, and pastors are more prone to be burnout than others. Burnout happens due to the constant demand in their mission and leads to reduce their productivity leaving their feeling extremely helpless, hopeless, and resentful Burnout can causes can threaten emotional and spiritual health as well as physical health. It is different from stress. Stress is the matter of too much while burnout is the matter of not enough. The person who is experiencing burnout feel empty and don't see any positive change in his situation. The purpose of this article is to examine why Korean pastors are easily burnout and propose the biblical and constructive solution to overcome it. Korean pastors are in crisis because of the following reasons; 1) continuous demands without any proper compensation, 2) not vivid results in their ministry, 3) excessive ministry tasks, 4) the attitude of devaluing of rest, 5) low payment. This study is suggests several ways to improve the emotional and spiritual dilemma caused by the burnout. First, pastors need to reconfirm the calling from God. Second, they need to empower others by the team ministry. Third, they need to monitor the network and strengthen it. Forth, they need to reserve the margin physically, emotionally and spiritually.",

It shows how these linguistic resources are adapted to different praxeological, temporal and participant‐related environments. Declaratives are used for first instructions, task‐setting and post‐trial discussions. They exhibit complex syntax and do not call for immediate compliance. Their high degree of explicitness conveys how the action is to be carried out. Imperative instructions overwhelmingly correct ongoing actions of students or respond to their failure to produce expected actions. They exhibit minimal argument structure. They are reminders which presuppose that the student monitors the scene and can perform the action unproblematically. They index that requests have to be complied with immediately or even urgently.",

      "abstract": "Imagine a learning scenario between two humans: a teacher demonstrating how to play a new musical instrument or a craftsman teaching a new skill like pottery or knitting to a novice. Even though learning a skill has a learning curve to get the nuances of the technique right, some basic social principles are followed between the teacher and the student to make the learning process eventually succeed. There are several assumptions or social priors in this communication for teaching: mutual eye contact to draw attention to instructions, following the gaze of the teacher to understand the skill, the teacher following the student's gaze during imitation to give feedback, the teacher demonstrating by pointing towards something she is going to approach or manipulate and verbal interruptions or corrections during the learning process [1], [2]. In prior research, verbal and non-verbal social cues such as eye gaze and gestures have been shown to make human-human interactions seamless and augment verbal, collaborative behavior [3], [4]. They serve as an indicator of engagement, interest and attention when people interact face-to-face with one another [5], [6].",

      "abstract": "Korban kecelakaan lalulintas terus berjatuhan, sampai\r\nmerenggut nyawa. Sedangkan jika bicara kecelakaan, umumnya selalu\r\ndisebut-sebut penyebabnya karena faktor human error (atau kelalaian\r\nmanusia). Kelalaian yang dimaksud, boleh jadi karena pengemudi\r\nkelelahan, lalu mengantuk, sehingga tidak lagi fokus atau kehilangan\r\nkonsentrasi dalam mengendalikan kendaraannya.\r\nHal lain yang dimaksudkan kelalaian, karena tidak memeriksa\r\nkendaraan secara seksama sebelum keberangkatan. Tekanan angin pada\r\nban tidak diperiksa, atau membiarkan ban gundul tidak segera diganti,\r\nsehingga sangat mudah pecah terutama dalam kecepatan tinggi. Ada faktor lain yang tak kalah menjadi masalah di jalanan, adalah gangguan\r\nfaktor nonteknis pada pengemudi. Rasa kesal karena macet, hingga\r\ningin segera sampai ke tujuan sering membuat tekanan psikologis.\r\nAkibatnya muncul ketidaksabaran, sehingga terjadi saling serobot dan\r\nmencuri jalur orang lain.\r\nKetika kita mengemudikan kendaraan, faktor akal, emosi, dan\r\nkadar keagamaan (spiritual) seseorang sangat berperan. Meski seorang\r\npengemudi termasuk orang yang pintar dengan IQ tinggi, namun kalau\r\nemosinya tinggi cenderung untuk mengemudikan kendaraan secara\r\nagresif. Hal yang perlu di ingat sebelum membawa kendaraan adalah\r\nmelakukan perencanaan perjalanan dengan baik agar pengemudi bisa\r\nmengetahui karakteristik atau kondisi jalan yang akan dilalui. Di jalan\r\nraya, pengemudi juga dituntut untuk bisa memantau kondisi lalulintas\r\nsecara keseluruhan, khususnya keadaan mobil-mobil yang ada di depan.\r\nTidak hanya itu, mata seorang pengemudi hendaknya tidak melihat ke\r\ndepan saja, tetapi sewaktu-waktu juga harus melihat keadaan sekeliling\r\nagar kalau ada sesuatu yang mendadak bisa dilakukan antisipasi yang\r\ncepat dan tepat.\r\nDi samping itu, pengemudi juga harus mempunyai keberanian,\r\nnamun bukan untuk berperilaku agresif, tetapi lebih ditujukan untuk\r\nbisa mengambil keputusan yang cepat dan tepat di jalan raya, bisa\r\nberkonsentrasi, serta memiliki reaksi atau respons yang baik, satu kesalahan bisa berakibat fatal bagi pengemudi sekaligus\r\npenumpangnya.\r\nTerlebih lagi, bila mengamati kecelakaan lalu lintas jalan di\r\nIndonesia, kemungkinan besar kita dapat menerima pernyataan bahawa\r\nsebagian besar kecelakaan disebabkan oleh kesalahan manusia\r\nmengingat tingginya tingkat kepedulian masyarakat akan masalah\r\nkeselamatan berlalu lintas.\r\nWalaupun demikian, secara konsisten pada tahun-tahun terakhir\r\nini, faktor utama (dalam kecelakaan) yang disebabkan oleh kesalahan\r\nmanusia adalah mengemudi kendaraan dengan kecepatan tinggi serta\r\nkesulitan mengambil tindakan yang tepat, dan pengaruh alkohol2.\r\nSetiap orang di anggap mengetaui atau mengerti akan adanya\r\nundang-undang serta peraturan-peraturan yang berlaku. Oleh karena itu,\r\nmaka setiap orang yang mampu memberikan pertanggungjawaban\r\npidana, tidak dapat menggunakan alasan bahwa ia tidak dapat\r\nmengetahui akan adanya suatu peraturan atau perundang-undangan\r\ndengan ancaman hukuman tentang perbuatan yang telah di lakukannya.\r\nTidak mengetahui atau tidak memahami akan adanya perundangundangan,\r\nbukanlah alasan untuk mengecualikan penuntutan atau\r\nbahkan pula alasan untuk memperingankan hukuman. Adalah suatu kejanggalan sebenarnya untuk menyebut bahwa\r\nseseorang mengerti akan adanya undang-undang, padahal orang itu\r\nsendiri memang sama sekali tidak mengerti dan bahkan hendak\r\nmembuktikan bahwa dirinya buta huruf misalnya. Namun, untuk\r\nkepentingan keadilan dan kepastian hukum maka di tentukan suatu asas\r\nhukum, bahwa semua orang di anggap mengetahui akan adanya\r\nperundang-undangan serta peraturan yang berlaku. .\r\nDilatarbelakangi oleh permasalahan tersebut maka penulis\r\nmengadakan penelitian untuk ini, dengan tujuan agar dapat mengetahui\r\nlebih lanju. Untuk itu adapun batasan ruang lingkup penelitian ini\r\nadalah sesuai dengan judul penulisan yaitu : “FAKTOR-FAKTOR\r\nPENYEBAB TERJADINYA KECELAKAAN LALULINTAS DI\r\nKOTA PADANG”.",

The world of ideas is very different from the world of action. Three differences in particular between the conditions for ideas and action can create difficulties in achieving consistency and control. The first concerns the actual content of ideas and actions. Second, ideas may develop one way in contexts in which ideas are of central importance, and in another way in contexts in which action is the more crucial. This can give rise to problems of control. Finally, ideas may sometimes arise and change and disappear more rapidly than actions. This affects the possibility of reconciling consistency with control. The discussion focuses on the problem as it affects groups with a constituency-actor structure, although some problems may be similar to those experienced by individual human beings.",

And in some cases, tasks are so complex that they cannot be taught in terms of predefined observations and actions, but must instead be represented as a set of strategies, tactics, and heuristics that are sufficiently abstract that they can be applied to new circumstances that cannot be anticipated by the developers of training materials.",

The first 2 principles are focused on knowledge acquisition and the last 2 on skill acquisition. Nevertheless, the principles converge on similar prescriptions: Contrary to intuition and common practice, the trainer is recommended to increase the complexity of the training situation rather than use the simplest methods available.",

There seem to be considerable skills demanded on both sides during the process of entering into an “engagement” and lack of care and sensitivity in the early stages can often lead to disappointments, frustrations and unfulfilled (but perhaps undisclosed) expectations. This article looks at one particular consultancy relationship where inadequate attention was focused by the external consultant on these particular issues of the role. In fact, the need to be “of assistance”, “to help” and “to display a competence” with the client resulted in too much attention being placed on a deep diagnosis, and its reflecting back to the client at too early a stage of the engagement. Rather than facilitating the relationship it is suggested that it in some ways it seriously disenabled the client group to accept the diagnosis made in order for effective and collaborative work to proceed.",

      "abstract": "ResumenEn este trabajo se aborda el estudio de los procesos volitivos o autorregula dores de los que deben valerse las personas para hacer frente a los obstáculos que aparecen en el curso de la acción. La tarea experimental pedía a los sujetos que eligieran entre dos candidatos (presentados a través de una serie de atributos o rasgos de personalidad) aquél con el que posteriormente pasarían a mantener una conversación sobre «problemas íntimos». Se analiza cómo proceden las personas ante la aparición de un obstáculo (información adicional que contradice la elección o el rechazo realizado) que impide el curso de la acción en la que están embarcados obligándoles a posponer la intención en curso. En concreto se estudian qué contenidos intencionales almacenados en memoria se activan (se reconocen después más rápido), o se desactivan (se reconocen después más lentamente) ante esta situación. Los resultados obtenidos: 1) dan apoyo al estatus especial que la información intencional tiene en la memoria; 2) confirman los efectos beneficiosos sobre la ejecución de la aparición de obstáculos cuando la intención está pospuesta; 3) aunque con ciertos matices, muestran la existencia de un proceder volitivo genérico. Es decir, los sujetos proceden de forma similar tanto cuando se inhibe la tendencia de acción principal, como cuando se activan las competitivas. Además, dichos obstáculos parecen actuar activando en memoria la información relativa a esa intención, y no tanto a costa de desactivar la información sobre las tendencias competitivas.",

McCroskey coined the concept with his graduate students during his time on faculty at Michigan State University, and published the first article in 1970 utilizing the term. CA is generally defined as people’s fear or anxiety related to actual or anticipated communication with others. As many of the references in this article will show, McCroskey went on to author or coauthor dozens of publications concerned with CA over the years. CA is divided into two general categories: trait CA and state CA. A person has trait CA when he or she has fear or anxiety about speaking across the entire spectrum of communication contexts. On the other hand, state CA occurs when a person has fear or anxiety about speaking in just one situation or context. In other words, people may be low in trait CA but have high state CA in certain situations. For example, someone may experience fear or anxiety about communicating with a physician during a medical consultation (i.e., high state CA), but not have any other fear or anxiety surrounding communication in other interpersonal contexts (i.e., low trait CA). Research into CA has generally been focused on finding ways to reduce CA among individuals, as it has usually been framed as a negative attribute.",

Lack of motivation is also another factor that can influence the output of any task or activity conducted by a user. This also applies to students within an academic context, where the distractions and lack of motivation can have a negative impact on their learning and results. In this paper, we propose 'Taskification', a task management mobile application, which incorporates core gamification features. The objective of this application is to increase student engagement and motivation during tasks such as coursework or exam preparation.",

      "title": "The Self Course: Lessons Learned from Students’ Weekly Questions",
      "abstract": "In this paper, I tentatively answer 50 questions sampled from a pool of over 10,000 weekly questions formulated by students in a course entitled \"The Self\". The questions pertain to various key topics related to self-processes, such as self-awareness, self-knowledge, self-regulation, self-talk, self-esteem, and self-regulation. The students' weekly questions and their answers highlight what is currently known about the self. Answers to the student questions also allow for the identification of some recurrent lessons about the self. Some of these lessons include: all self-processes are interconnected (e.g., prospection depends on autobiography), self-terms must be properly defined (e.g., self-rumination and worry are not the same), inner speech plays an important role in self-processes, controversies are numerous (are animals self-aware?), measurement issues abound (e.g., self-recognition as an operationalization of self-awareness), deficits in some self-processes can have devastating effects (e.g., self-regulatory deficits may lead to financial problems), and there are lots of unknowns about the self (e.g., gender differences in Theory-of-Mind).",

      "abstract": "Ata datas recentes non se prestara interese dabondo ao efecto da emocion sobre a memoria prospectiva. Ao empregar metodos tradicionais de inducion emocional asumiuse que o estado de animo xerado se manteria constante ao longo da proba. Isto non e so un erro, tamen se afasta da funcionalidade real deste tipo de memoria na vida cotia, onde a emocion aparece de maneira puntual afectando aos factores que participan na sua codificacion, retencion e recuperacion. As tarefas do laboratorio deberian poder poner en funcionamento estes aspectos para estudar como a emocion afecta aos elementos que participan na memoria prospectiva por separado e non de maneira conxunta. Diferentes estudos investigaron como o contido emocional das claves de recuperacion e a tarefa prospectiva, afectan a memoria prospectiva, e tamen se propuxeron enfoques que tentan comprender como as consecuencias positivas ou negativas de realizar a tarefa prospectiva poderian afectar a sua lembranza posterior. Este ultimo punto teria aplicacion en campos onde se poida mellorar a probabilidade de execucion de condutas programadas, como son as condutas preventivas (por exemplo, non superarei o limite de velocidade, non adiantarei indebidamente, etc.), potenciando a lembranza das consecuencias asociadas a sua non realizacion.",

      "title": "A ‘game’ Technique to Improve Cognitive Ability in the Elderly with Dementia: Implications for Care Management",
      "abstract": "AbstractDementia is the progressive decline in cognitive function due to damage or disease in the body beyond what might be expected from normal aging. It is a non-specific illness syndrome in which affected areas of cognition may be memory, attention, language, and problem solving. Higher mental functions are affected first in the process. Especially in the later stages of the condition, affected persons may be disoriented in time (not knowing what day of the week, day of the month, month, or even what year it is), in place (not knowing where they are), and in person (not knowing who they are or others around them). This paper reported the use of a technique involving a game that focuses on two cognitive functions - memory and problem solving. The 'game' was developed by first experimenting with a few essential perceptual factors such as vision and hearing in the elderly with dementia. On the basis of the observation, we came up with two games (i.e., memory and problem solving) that were later used in training to improve cognitive functions of the elderly with dementia. After three sessions of training that ran across two months we compared the reaction times and scores of the participants from the two games. The results suggest an improvement in the memory as well as problem solving abilities of the elderly. These experimental results are hoped to contribute as a method in the rehabilitation of the elderly with dementia.",

      "abstract": "conceptualisation (AC) Figure 2.1 The Kolb Learning Cycle First, learners are involved fully and freely in new experiences (CE). Second, they must make/have the time and space to be able to reflect on their experience from different perspectives (RO). Third, learners must be able to form, re-form and process their ideas, take ownership of them and integrate their new ideas and understanding into sound, logical theories (AC). It is these middle two elements in the cycle that can be strongly influenced by feedback from others. This moves towards the fourth point (AE), using the enhanced understanding to make decisions and problem-solve, and test implica- tions and usage in new situations. The experiential cycle does not simply involve having an experience, or ‘doing’, but also reflecting, processing, thinking and furthering understanding, and usually ‘improvement’ the next time something is encountered or done. By extension, this cyclical process has a part to play in even the most abstract and theoretical disciplines where the academic is concerned to help the learner acquire the ‘tools of the trade’ or the modes of thinking central to the discipline, such as in philosophy or literary criticism. The teacher needs to be aware that in practice learners do not cycle smoothly through the model, but may get stuck, fail to progress or ‘jump about’. The way in which the learner resolves these tensions will have an effect on the learning outcome and the development of different types of strength in the learner and, as will be seen, may pertain to personality traits and/or disciplinary differences. Reflection is a key part of experiential learning as it ‘turns experience into learning’ (Boud et al., 1985). Because of misunderstanding, overuse and its passive and negative connotations, reflection has had a worse press than it deserves, but it is also true that the research evidence about how it works is lacking. To learn from experience we need to examine and analyse the experience; this is what reflection means in this context. It may be a similar action to the one that we may consciously or subconsciously use when taking a deep approach to learning. Reflection and reflective practice are not easy concepts. With regard to higher education they may be applied to the learning of students, and equally to the professional development of the lecturer (see Part 3). Schon (1987), in examining the relationship between professional knowledge and professional competence, suggests that rather than looking to another body of research knowledge, practitioners should become more adept at observing and learning through reflection on the artistry of their own particular profession. ‘Reflection on practice’ (on experience) is central to learning and development of knowledge in the professions. Recognised ‘experts’ in the field exhibit distinct artistry. This artistry cannot be learned solely through conventional teaching methods – it requires role models, observation of competent practitioners, self-practice, mentors, experience in carrying out all the tasks of one’s job and reflection upon that practice. Support in developing reflection is often necessary, for example by using prompts and feedback. Such reflective practice is a key aspect of lifelong learning. 16 ❘ Teaching, supervising, learning",

      "title": "The effectiveness of cognitive behavioral interventions in reducing stress among nurses working in hospitals: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this review is to present the best available evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral (CB) interventions in reducing stress, preventing burnout, improving mood states, and reducing work absences among hospital nurses. The specific review questions to be addressed are: 1. What is the effectiveness of CB interventions in comparison to usual care in reducing stress, preventing burnout, improving mood states, and reducing work absences among hospital nurses? 2. What is the effectiveness of CB interventions of different formats (for example, didactic teaching, workshop, role play) in reducing stress, preventing burnout, improving mood states, and reducing work absences among hospital nurses? 3. What is the effectiveness of CB interventions of different intensities (for example, different duration and frequency of sessions) in reducing stress, preventing burnout, improving mood states, and reducing work absences among hospital nurses? Usual care is defined as either no intervention or general stress management interventions such as massage therapy, yoga, meditation, and mantra. Background Nursing is a stressful profession. The main causes of stress include an intense work environment, emotional burdens, a lack of organizational support, and dysfunctional relationships with co-workers.1 Many studies have indicated that work related stress is associated with physical and mental health problems including hypertension, ischemic heart disease, peptic ulcer, asthma, and depression.2-5 It has been estimated that 30% of all work-related disorders are linked to stress.6 Additionally, high levels of stress suppress the body's immune system. A study of 82 emergency (ER) nurses in Singapore reported that their stress levels were high and the IgA and lysozyme levels in their salivary glands were low, therefore indicating a suppressed immune system, when compared to 50 nurses in the general ward.7 Job stress also increases absenteeism which results in higher staff turnover and affects the quality and continuity of patient care.4 The monetary losses associated with stress amounts to 9.2 billion EUR in Europe, 1-1.2 billion EUR in the United Kingdom, and 6.6 billion USD in the United States (USA).8 Stress is defined by Selye as the “physiological response of an organism to any demand for change\"9(p.533) and the consequence of the interaction between a stimulus and response.7 Selye's theory of stress and illness also differentiates between “eustress” and “distress\". Eustress is a positive response to the environment and facilitates growth; however distress is a negative response that leads to physical and psychological maladaptation.10 In 2003, Mimura and Griffiths undertook a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of current approaches to workplace stress management for nurses.11 Seven randomized controlled trials (RCT) and three prospective cohort studies were identified and reviewed. The studies included 782 nurses working as mental health nurses, registered nurses, student nurses, or care assistants. Of those studies, three were conducted in the USA, two in the UK, two in Taiwan, and three in other European countries. Interventions involved education, role playing, relaxation, music, exercise, humor, and cognitive techniques. Stress levels were measured by the Perceived Stress Scale, Psychiatric Occupational Stress Scale, a modified version of the Nursing Stress Scale, DeVilliers Carson Leary Stress Scale, State Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Maslach Burnout Inventory. In four studies, significantly decreased levels of stress were observed after stress intervention. The mean difference was from -8.5 to 9. No meta-analysis was performed and the quality of research identified was weak. Programs that provided personal support were more effective than programs that used environmental management to reduce stress.31 Managing stress is important asif stress is not well managed, it can develop into burnout with emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment.12, 13 Nurses may withdraw from their patients both emotionally and physically, furthermore they may become detached from their job and carry negative attitudes toward patients.13, 14 Their quality of care and service to patient may also suffer. Numerous studies have indicated that cognitive behavioral therapy is effective in modifying dysfunctional cognitions and improving an individual's ability to deal with stressful events.15-17 Cognitive behavioral therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on modifying dysfunctional cognitions and promoting education of appropriate behaviors for coping with stress and emergent situations.18-21 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) In CBT, the person is encouraged to develop and apply adaptive conscious thought and problem solving. The person is taught to recognize and change pathological thinking at two levels of autonomous processing: automatic thoughts and schemas.22 Automatic thoughts are cognitions that appear rapidly in our mind while facing an incident. Unconsciously, people may be aware of the presence of automatic thoughts but do not subject them to rational analysis.22,23 Schemas are the principal beliefs that act as templates for information processing, thereby allowing humans to screen, filter, code, and assign environmental meaning to information.22-24 Previous studies indicated that people with depression or anxiety often experience maladaptive or distorted automatic thoughts.22,23 As a result, these thoughts lead to painful emotions and dysfunctional behavior. These individuals feel hopeless, have low self-esteem, and feel as though they are failures.22 They have automatic thoughts predicting danger, harm, loss of control, and are unable to manage threat. There are errors in their logic for automatic thoughts and cognitive errors in their pathological styles for information processing.22,23,25 Cognitive Behavioral Intervention Program According to Mercer, the components of a CBT program include cognitive restructuring, problem focused coping, emotion focused coping, the systematic approach, and lifestyle changes.9 For cognitive restructuring, the Activating Event Beliefs Consequences (ABC) model can be used to help individuals understand the distortions and irrational beliefs that increase their stress.26 Individuals are taught to alter their belief system by rewriting their distorted thought into an adaptive coping statement in a daily record. Ultimately, individuals enhance their sense of control and reduce their overall stress level.9 Problem focused coping includes time management that prioritizes and breaks down larger tasks into smaller ones; assertive training to express thoughts effectively without offending others; and monitoring of stress intensity and intervening when individuals become overwhelmed by environmental stressors.9 Emotion focused coping includes diaphragmatic breathing or focusing on visual, auditory or tactile distractions while facing stressors, taking time outs by removing themselves from stressors or by doing other things, and systematic desensitization through the practice of relaxation techniques. In the systematic approach, individuals are taught to identify their stressors. They then generate strategies to change or modify their environment. If the stressor cannot be managed, individuals will also learn skills for managing the emotional impact.9 Finally, lifestyle changes include eating a healthy, well-balanced diet by reducing sugar intake, processed food and caffeine; regular physical activity; adequate sleep; and scheduling pleasant events. These changes are tailored to each individual. The cognitive behavioral stress management program is most often conducted in eight to 16 sessions.9 In 2010, Orly et al. conducted a randomized controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral intervention (CBI) comprised of 16 meetings for cognitive intervention and stress reducing behavioral skills. The authors examined the effect of CBI on the nurses' sense of coherence (SOC), perceived stress, and mood states. A pre-post test was designed for two groups of 36 nurses. This study found that the CBI group had significantly decreased levels of stress and fatigue and significantly increased SOC and mood states. These finding suggest that CBT intervention can decrease stress and increase mood in nurses. The study limitations, however, were not testing the long term effects of CBI, the small sample size, and therefore, the lack of generalizability of the findings.18 Significance of the review Reducing stress, preventing burnout, and improving mood states are essential to optimize the physical and mental health among nurses. The results of this systematic review will provide vital information for assisting nurses in dealing effectively with the high complexity of their nursing work and job demand. A preliminary search of the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Library of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, CINAHL, DARE and PROSPERO databases has already been performed.

      "title": "Locus of Control: Implications for Clinical Nursing Practice",
      "abstract": "Abstract Compliance, adherence, and a therapeutic alliance are terms that, when used in a health care context, refer to the process whereby a patient assumes the various tasks that comprise a therapeutic regimen. When a patient is said to be compliant there is the suggestion that he has been coerced; when he is said to be adherent it appears that he is conforming to some norm or standard set for him; when he forms an alliance it seems he has negotiated what it is he will do to care for himself. Coercion, conformity, and negotiation make up a continuum that varies in the degree to which a patient is active in the decisions being made about himself, or inversely, the degree to which others determine the patient's behavior (Barofsky 1978). All too often a person's experience with the health care system is coercive, thereby restricting the individual's need to freely direct and control his life affairs freely, which in turn leads potentially to noncompliance behaviors. Individuals perceptions of their control over the environment and its relationship to other areas of cognitive functioning and to behavior have aroused considerable interest. Health beliefs and behaviors, however, have received little attention as a specific area in which to investigate perceptions of control. Since many health actions depend on voluntary behaviors and many health programs are predicated on an assumption of controllability, patients'expectancies concerning control seem to be a worthwhile area for examination. Locus of control, an individual difference construct from social learning theory, has shown some promise in predicting and explaining specific health‐related behaviors. Yet compliance problems, being highly complex, are not easily reducible to a single simple explanation. This paper will review research demonstrating the utility of locus of control in understanding health behaviors. A method for incorporating the construct into the nursing process will be described. Using this framework as a basis, the author will explore methods of increasing client participation in treatment programs while maintaining a therapeutic alliance.",

With their reinstatement into the Paralympics, along with the Special Olympics in the United States, athletes with II are also garnering more public attention. This chapter reviews research on athletes with II, in three areas. First is the psychosocial dynamics of sport participation. For instance, it appears that many athletes with II have difficulty maintaining motivation, yet they possess task and ego-type goals like all athletes. Psychological skills for performance enhancement are then discussed. Goal setting, for example, is an excellent tool for helping athletes with their motivation. The last area covered is research on support personnel. A defining feature of athletes with II is their reduced cognitive and functional abilities, communication limitations, and slower ability to develop sport skills. Some athletes might take substantial time to learn psychological skills, whereas other athletes may pick up various skills quite readily. Similarly, coaches may need more patience for athletes whose attention wanders or are easily distracted.",

      "title": "Item-Difficulty-Aware Learning Path Recommendation: From a Real Walking Perspective",
      "abstract": "Learning path recommendation aims to provide learners with a reasonable order of items to achieve their learning goals. Intuitively, the learning process on the learning path can be metaphorically likened to walking. Despite extensive efforts in this area, most previous methods mainly focus on the relationship among items but overlook the difficulty of items, which may raise two issues from a real walking perspective: (1) The path may be rough: When learners tread the path without considering item difficulty, it's akin to walking a dark, uneven road, making learning harder and dampening interest. (2) The path may be inefficient: Allowing learners only a few attempts on very challenging items before switching, or persisting with a difficult item despite numerous attempts without mastery, can result in inefficiencies in the learning journey. To conquer the above limitations, we propose a novel method named Difficulty-constrained Learning Path Recommendation (DLPR), which is aware of item difficulty. Specifically, we first explicitly categorize items into learning items and practice items, then construct a hierarchical graph to model and leverage item difficulty adequately. Then we design a Difficulty-driven Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (DHRL) framework to facilitate learning paths with efficiency and smoothness. Finally, extensive experiments on three different simulators demonstrate our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

      "title": "The effectiveness of family interventions on psychological distress and expressed emotion in family members of individuals diagnosed with first-episode psychosis: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The overall objective of this review is to examine the effectiveness of family interventions (i.e. education, psychoeducation, communication and coping skills training, problem-solving training and cognitive-behavioral therapy) for family members of persons with first-episode psychosis. The specific review question to be addressed is: What interventions are the most effective in impacting on family members’ psychological distress and expressed emotion? Background Psychosis is a disorder with a variety of symptoms that include so-called ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ symptoms.1,2 Positive symptoms include behaviors that reflect higher than usual functioning of sensory perception, such as hallucinations, delusions and disorganized thinking or behavior. Negative symptoms include behaviors that reflect a decrease in, or loss of, normal functioning, for example, in the areas of self-care and social functioning resulting in poor grooming or hygiene and social withdrawal behaviors.3 First-episode psychosis (FEP) is used to define a person who has those features for the first time,3,4 and is often accompanied by a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorder.5 FEP usually occurs during mid-adolescence to early adulthood (15-24 years of age) and is called a transitional phase.6-8 The annual incidence rate of FEP was 30.4 and 16.7 per 100,000 in the UK (in 2000-2001) and Australia (in 1997-2000) respectively, with ages ranging between 15-29 years.9,10 Moreover, the incidence rate of FEP is high in certain immigrant groups. For example, among black ethnic minority groups (ages ranging between 27.5-29 years) the incidence of FEP was 50.2 per 100,000.11,12 The critical period for initiating treatment is within two years of onset of FEP;13 approximately 60% of FEP patients achieve remission if treatment is initiated during this period.14 However, negative consequences of FEP are still experienced, including decreased occupational performance, social impairment and difficulty making decisions,15-18 which together, contribute to a lower quality of life.19 In addition, individuals experiencing FEP are considered at higher risk of suicidal ideation;20-22 violent behaviours;23-25 homicide;26 and substance misuse, particularly cannabis use.27 Family members of individuals with FEP play an important role in providing support; however, they often experience psychological distress themselves, especially during the critical period as they have no prior involvement in caring for persons with psychosis.28 They worry about the future of, and strange behaviors displayed by, their ill family member,29-31 and parents feel a sense of loss of their ‘normal’ child after onset of FEP.32 Family members of individuals with FEP also describe their first-time experience of caring for a person with FEP as burdensome and unpredictable.33 The caregiving tasks required are extensive and intense and can lead to emotional distress.32-36 Some coping strategies include adjusting expectations,35, 36 and fostering hope in their child while engaging with the new role of being a caregiver.33 Baseline data of 124 carers showed that approximately half used adaptive coping strategies including self-talk, problem-solving and reframing.37 The experience of accessing mental health services for the first time can be difficult for many caregivers and they can feel overwhelmed with this activity. For example, some find it difficult to make appointments with specialists and then face the difficult situation of having to take their ill family member to an emergency department to be subsequently hospitalized.38 Some parents have also claimed that their ill family members received inappropriate treatment, especially when the FEP diagnosis was not made around the time of admission.7,39 Moreover, following a diagnosis of psychosis, caregivers report encountering stigma related to mental illness.38,40-41 Overall, caregivers experience stress at the onset of FEP, comprising emotional distress, difficulties in accessing mental health services and in adjusting to their new role as caregivers. Caregivers need support from mental health providers to enable them to provide care for ill relatives. At the critical period, interventions for families and individuals with FEP assist the latter by shortening treatment duration, achieving full remission and decreasing the risk of relapse.42Interventions, including psychoeducation, communication skills training and problem-solving skills training are implemented for caregivers.43 Previous studies have shown that family intervention can reduce relapse,1, 44 and decrease the length of hospitalization.45 Recently, family interventions that incorporate a cognitive component have been shown to help reduce the likelihood of individuals with FEP experiencing a second episode of psychosis.44, 46 Participating in psychoeducation about the illness and treatment increases caregivers’ knowledge and psychological well-being,6, 47-50 and reduces their depressive symptoms and negative views toward ill relatives.51 However, psychoeducation can have a variable effect on caregivers’ expressed emotion,52 burden and coping skills.50, 53 It is important to note that these interventions produce multiple outcomes, which can be positive and/or neutral, and contain a variety of components and modules, such as delivering information, communication skills training and problem-solving training. Therefore, it may be beneficial to investigate which kind of family intervention is effective and which specific outcome is achieved. To date, family interventions place emphasis on specific components during the critical period. Studies indicate that medical treatment information increases caregivers’ knowledge and positive attitude towards patients,2 and communication skills training improves individuals’ psychotic symptoms and social functioning.54,55 These findings confirm that specific components of family interventions may be crucial and lead to good outcomes of care. Recently, studies have shown that incorporation of a cognitive component, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), within family interventions significantly improves caregivers’ stress appraisal.44 Moreover, caregivers’ negative experience of caregiving, including burden, anxiety and depression, are reduced after participating in such interventions.56 A randomized controlled study found that carers who participated in bibliotherapy had positive experiences of caring for a child with FEP and their psychological distress decreased.57 Although previous studies have evaluated family interventions, only one systematic review has been undertaken. This review focused on persons with psychosis, early intervention services, CBT and family interventions at the critical period (the first three to five years following onset of psychosis).58 Three studies were included in the review and family interventions were varied in terms of their mode of delivery. Results demonstrated that patients who received such interventions were less likely to relapse and be readmitted to hospital. The effectiveness of family interventions covering the onset of psychosis up to two years following diagnosis is still under investigation. No Cochrane Library or Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports have been undertaken on this topic. Therefore, the objective of this systematic review is to examine the effectiveness of family interventions for family members of individuals diagnosed with FEP, ranging from the onset of illness up to two years. The review can provide the most up-to-date evidence to inform practice. In so doing, it will contribute to better outcomes in enhancing caregivers’ psychological well-being while providing care to family members with FEP during the critical period.",

      "title": "Learning",
      "abstract": "In spite of its critical importance within education, the problem of explaining how learning takes place, and analysing the factors that influence it, remains a confused area. Teachers, and educators generally, often blame psychologists for this, and claim that they either present them with several conflicting explanations of learning, each one based upon a different psychological theory, or a single coherent explanation with which it is admitted other psychologists would probably not agree. Yet perhaps this blame, though understandable, is a little unfair. The problem is that learning is such a highly complex activity. We each of us receive a constant and varied stream of experiences throughout our waking moments, each one of which potentially can give rise to learning, yet most of which apparently vanish without trace from our mental lives. What is it that makes some things memorable and others not? Why is it that a particular event can prompt learning in one person yet have no measurable effect upon someone else? Why does an individual learn readily from one teacher but not from another? How is it that we are able to make sense of our experience, and put that knowledge to good effect when it comes to tackling new situations and problems? Questions such as these and many others make the psychologist's task of understanding and explaning learning, and above all of advising on how learning can be made more efficient and more permanent for all types and conditions of learner, an almost herculean one. Perhaps the wonder is not that psychologists have so far failed to come up with all the answers during the 50 years or so in which a systematic study of learning has been made, but that they have come up with as many as they have.",

Unfortunately, majority of the employees are the victims of verbal aggression, emotional abuse and even violence any time in the organizations. Workplace incivility simply means rude, hidden aggressive and discourteous behaviors and it can be dangerous for both the organizations and the workplaces. Workplace incivility has been somewhat overlooked due to its less intense nature comparing to aggression. In fact, usually the instigator of an uncivil behavior is not even aware of the harmful effects of his/her act toward the victim. Workplace incivility is often overlooked but it might cost too much for the organizations since it leads to poor workplace climate, job dissatisfaction major negative outcomes like employee turnover and employee turnover. Whether intentional or not, from disrespecting other coworkers to verbal aggressions or insulting others, unacceptable behaviors should be detected by the management and the measures must be taken immediately to stop the negative consequences of the workplace incivility. In this conceptual study, uncivil behaviors at workplaces will be defined in detail, theoretical framework will be formed and the actions that must be taken to reduce and prevent incivility in the workplaces will be recommended.",

Un mazo de tarjetas didacticas consiste en una serie de tarjetas que contienen informacion que debe de ser aprendida. Normalmente contienen una pregunta y una respuesta, en una forma libre: puede tratarse de una pregunta tipica, completar una palabra que falta en una frase, reconocer un determinado objeto, una formula, etc. El estudiante lee una de las caras de la tarjeta e intenta recordar la respuesta (recuerdo activo). Tras expresar verbalmente o mentalmente la respuesta, la coteja con el dorso de la tarjeta (repaso pasivo). Dependiendo de si la respuesta ha sido correcta o no, el estudiante podria separar el mazo de tarjetas en dos grupos, las que ha respondido correctamente y las que no. Posteriormente, optimizaria su tiempo dedicandose en exclusiva a repasar las tarjetas cuyas preguntas no ha recordado y de nuevo separarlas en los dos grupos mencionados. Este esquema puede perfeccionarse usando mas grupos e intercalando las tarjetas de una forma cuidadosa. La aparicion de aplicaciones informaticas (moviles, de escritorio y web) han hecho muy manejable este sistema en su vertiente digital, anadiendo prestaciones fisicamente imposibles, como tarjetas de mas de dos caras o multimedia.

      "title": "Adjustment, Emotional Control and Perceived Loneliness among Adolescents",
      "abstract": "Adjustment is the behavioral process by which humans and other animals maintain equilibrium among their various needs or between their needs and the obstacles of their environments. A sequence of adjustment begins when a need is felt and ends when it is satisfied. Hungry people, for example, are stimulated by their physiological state to seek food. When they eat, they reduce the stimulating condition that impelled them to activity, and they are thereby adjusted to this particular need. In general, the adjustment process involves four parts: (1) a need or motive in the form of a strong persistent stimulus, (2) the thwarting or no fulfillment of this need, (3) varied activity, or exploratory behavior accompanied by problem solving, and (4) some response that removes or at least reduces the initiating stimulus and completes the adjustment. Social and cultural adjustments are similar to physiological adjustments. People strive to be comfortable in their surroundings and to have their psychological needs (such as love or affirmation) met through the social networks they inhabit. When needs arise, especially in new or changed surroundings, they impel interpersonal activity meant to satisfy those needs. In this way, people increase their familiarity and comfort with their environments, and they come to expect that their needs will be met in the future through their social networks. On-going difficulties in social and cultural adjustment may be accompanied by anxiety or depression. Psychology of Adjustment is an applied Psychology course that teaches the basics of human adjustment in everyday life. Applications of the concepts taught in this course help students understand themselves better, change their behaviors, and enhance their relationships. The term adjustment is often used as a synonym for accommodation and adaptation. Strictly speaking, the term denotes the results of equilibrium, which may be affect by either of these processes (Monroe, 1990). It is used to emphasize the individual’s struggle to along or survive in his or her social and physical environment. Good (1959) sates that adjustment is the process of finding and adopting modes of behavior suitable to the environment or the changes in the environment.

The major difference between the social actor/professional position and the research position is the fact that a social or professional actor is often called upon to conduct actions to transform the reality that surrounds them, whereas the researcher conducts comprehensive analysis of situations or actions. Research, particularly when it concerns social practices, has the recurrent challenge of converting professional/social questions into research questions. Most of the terms used in the humanities and social sciences – the sciences of education and training are no exception – are primarily social concepts, distinguished from scientific concepts because the former refer to everyday social or even professional practices and not interpretations of reality as do the latter.",

      "abstract": "Wildlife professionals in the United States are in a paradoxical situation, often expressed in statements such as: \"My professional responsibilities make it impossible to find time to be as thoughtful about my work as I would like.\" Many wildlife professionals who find themselves in this situation figuratively throw up their hands when presented with an opportunity to consider novel ideas or explore new possibilities and declare: \"I'm too busy; I have more to do than ever before with no time left over to think about new ideas and approaches let alone create them.\" If the wildlife profession addresses this conundrum openly and mitigates the detrimental consequences it has on individuals and their effectiveness, we suggest enhanced conservation will occur. Toward this end, we explore three questions: (a) what is preventing wildlife professionals from setting a greater priority on taking time to reflect critically about their work? (b) what are the perceived consequences of the current condition? and (c) what are people doing to reduce the problem? The root of the issue is manifold, from the fallacy of equating activity to productivity, the normalization of \"busyness\", and a tendency towards action bias, to additional institutional challenges at the organizational level. Efforts to improve the situation will be a substantial undertaking, likely requiring simultaneous interventions at multiple levels guide individual and organizational prioritization processes, implemented over time, and continuously renewed. This article describes the tyranny of being too busy—its symptoms, causes, and effects—and presents ideas for mitigating the problem offered by wildlife professionals and the organizational behavior literature.",

In such situations, pessimism and lack of motivation may give a fitness advantage by inhibiting certain actions, especially futile or dangerous challenges to dominant figures, actions in the absence of a crucial resource or a viable plan, efforts that would damage the body, and actions that would disrupt a currently unsatisfactory major life enterprise when it might recover or the alternative is likely to be even worse.

      "abstract": "Anyone who undertakes to bring about learning of a particular sort finds himself arranging a set of stimulus conditions that act upon the learner. In the simplest of cases, these stimuli may need to be made to occur only during a single brief period of time in order for the desired learning to take place. Far more frequently, however, the expected learning requires a stimulus situation that extends over a period ranging from seconds to minutes, even when one is dealing with a single learning objective. Since such durations are involved, the question of sequence naturally arises with respect to the arrangement of conditions for learning. What conditions need to occur first, what next, and what last in order for effective learning to be assured? The problem of arranging sequences of learning conditions, or, in other words, sequences of instruction, continues to be a topic of considerable importance for those who design and carry out instruction. In empirical research, the topic of this review has been capably addressed by several previous writers, sometimes in part and sometimes comprehensively. Interest in research related to instructional sequence continues to be reasonably high, and a substantial number of reports of empirical investigations has appeared from 1967 to the present.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Assessment is a thorny issue. In recent years, many of us have witnessed – or been participants in – moves towards more widespread and frequent formalised assessment of not only our professional lives, but our personal lives too. This has taken the form of, for example, increased formal academic testing of schoolchildren, expanding initial and ongoing accreditation across many professions and vocations, and widespread monitoring as part of routine public healthcare. Some argue that increased use of formalised assessment is necessary to ensure accountability, efficiency, cost-effectiveness, maintenance or improvement of standards, or perhaps to identify ‘talent’. This argument currently looms large in public discourse and political rhetoric. Others counter that excessive formal assessment distracts from the core processes of learning and development, encourages an outcome focus (leading to a ‘teach to the test’ ethos), creates unnecessary and unhealthy pressure and stress, and ultimately results in an acquisitive rather than inquisitive learning culture where education comes to be more about satisfying external ‘benchmarks’ than achieving personal development or transformation. This counter argument is often marginalised – whispered in conversations between concerned practitioners or cautiously broached by social scientists in academic publications.",

      "title": "Deliberate Practice and the Acquisition and Maintenance of Expert Performance in Medicine and Related Domains",
      "abstract": "The factors that cause large individual differences in professional achievement are only partially understood. Nobody becomes an outstanding professional without experience, but extensive experience does not invariably lead people to become experts. When individuals are first introduced to a professional domain after completing their education, they are often overwhelmed and rely on help from others to accomplish their responsibilities. After months or years of experience, they attain an acceptable level of proficiency and are able to work independently. Although everyone in a given domain tends to improve with experience initially, some develop faster than others and continue to improve during ensuing years. These individuals are eventually recognized as experts and masters. In contrast, most professionals reach a stable, average level of performance within a relatively short time frame and maintain this mediocre status for the rest of their careers. The nature of the individual differences that cause the large variability in attained performance is still debated. The most common explanation is that achievement in a given domain is limited by innate factors that cannot be changed through experience and training; hence, limits of attainable performance are determined by one's basic endowments, such as abilities, mental capacities, and innate talents. Educators with this widely held view of professional development have focused on identifying and selecting students who possess the necessary innate talents that would allow them to reach expert levels with adequate experience. Therefore, the best schools and professional organizations nearly always rely on extensive testing and interviews to find the most talented applicants. This general view also explains age-related declines in professional achievement in terms of the inevitable reductions in general abilities and capacities believed to result from aging. In this article, I propose an alternative framework to account for individual differences in attained professional development, as well as many aspects of age-related decline. This framework is based on the assumption that acquisition of expert performance requires engagement in deliberate practice and that continued deliberate practice is necessary for maintenance of many types of professional performance. In order to contrast this alternative framework with the traditional view, I first describe the account based on innate talent. I then provide a brief review of the evidence on deliberate practice in the acquisition of expert performance in several performance domains, including music, chess, and sports. Finally, I review evidence from the acquisition and maintenance of expert performance in medicine and examine the role of deliberate practice in this domain. The Traditional View of Skill Acquisition and Professional Development: History and Some Recent Criticisms The traditional view of skill acquisition is based on the assumption that innate biological capacities limit the level of achievement that a person can attain. Sir Francis Galton is generally recognized for developing the scientific basis for this view in the 19th century. In his pioneering book, Hereditary Genius,1 he presented evidence that height and body size was determined genetically, and most importantly, he argued that similar innate mechanisms must determine mental capacities, stating: Now, if this be the case with stature, then it will be true too as regards every other physical feature—as circumference of head, size of brain, weight of grey matter, number of brain fibres, &c.; and thence, a step on which no physiologist will hesitate, as regards mental capacity [italics added].1, pp. 31–2 At the same time, Galton clearly acknowledged the effects of practice and the need for training to reach high levels of performance in any domain. However, he argued that improvements are rapid only in the beginning of training and that subsequent increases become increasingly smaller, until \"Maximal performance becomes a rigidly determinate quantity.\"1, p. 15 According to Galton, the relevant heritable capacities set the upper bound for an individual's physical and mental achievements, and once all of the training benefits have been attained through sufficient practice, then the immutable limit for performance is reached that \"Nature has rendered him capable of performing.\"1, p. 16 According to Galton, the immutable characteristics that limit maximal performance cannot be altered through training. By extension, they must have been innately endowed. Galton's arguments for the importance of innate factors in elite performance were quite compelling and, thus, have had a lasting impact on our culture's view of ability and expertise. Contemporary theories of skill acquisition2,3 are consistent with Galton's general assumptions and with the observations on the course of professional development. When individuals are first introduced to an activity such as driving a car or playing golf, their primary goal is to reach a level of mastery that will allow them to perform everyday tasks at an acceptable level or to engage proficiently in recreational activities with their friends. During the first phase of learning,2 novices try to understand the activity and concentrate on avoiding mistakes. With more experience in the middle phase of learning, gross mistakes become increasingly rare, performance appears smoother, and learners no longer need to concentrate as hard to perform at an acceptable level. After a limited period of training and experience—frequently less than 50 hours for most recreational activities such as typing, playing tennis, and driving a car—an acceptable standard of performance is typically attained. As individuals adapt to a domain and their performance skills become automated, they are able to execute these skills smoothly and without apparent effort. As a consequence of automation, performers lose conscious control over execution of those skills, making intentional modifications difficult. Once the automated phase of learning has been attained, performance reaches a stable plateau with no further improvements, which is consistent with Galton's assumption of a performance limit. The principal difference between acquisition of everyday skills and professional development appears to be primarily a difference in time scale. Whereas proficiency in everyday skills is attained rapidly, professional development (including the prerequisite education) is completed only after years or even decades of experience. In their seminal work, Simon and Chase4 argued that in order to attain an international level of performance in chess, an individual must maintain full-time involvement in the activity for at least ten years. Their research on chess masters' memories for regular game positions suggested that the masters had acquired some 50,000 chunks or patterns, and they highlighted the parallels between reaching this highly skilled performance level and acquiring a language with its large vocabulary. Simon and Chase4 proposed a theory of expertise where future experts gradually acquired patterns and knowledge about how to react in situations as a direct consequence of their continued experience in the domain. Based on the observation that most people are able to master their first language after many years of experience even without formal instruction, scientists started considering the possibility that sufficient experience (over ten years of full-time engagement) might automatically lead to expertise in a performance domain. Eventually, some scientists viewed sufficient length of experience in a domain (over ten years) as a reliable indicator of expertise. Several reviews over the past decade5–7 have shown that empirical evidence for the traditional views regarding the development of expertise through extended experience alone is surprisingly limited. First and most surprisingly, the performance of experts, who are nominated by their peers based on their extensive experience and reputation, is occasionally unexceptional for representative tasks from their domain of expertise. For example, highly experienced computer programmers' performance on programming tasks is not always superior to that of computer science students,8 and physics professors from UC Berkeley were not always consistently superior to students on introductory physics problems.9 More generally, the level of training and experience has frequently been only weakly linked to objective measures of performance in a domain. For example, the length of training and professional experience of clinical psychologists is not related to their efficiency and success in treating patients,10 and extensive experience with software design is not associated with consistently superior proficiency on presented tasks.11,12 Similarly, when \"wine experts\" are required to detect, describe, and discriminate characteristics of a wine without knowledge of its identity (seeing the label on the bottle), their performance is only slightly better than those generated by regular wine drinkers.13,14 More generally, reviews of decision making15,16 show that experts' decisions and financial advice on investing in stocks have surprisingly low accuracy that does not improve with additional experience. Similar phenomena have been documented in several other areas of expertise.6 In the second half of this article, I will review evidence on whether highly experienced doctors, with reputations as experts, display consistently superior performance to their less experienced colleagues and, if so, I will identify the characteristics of those medical activities that reveal such superiority. Second, the traditional views of professional development and skill acquisition assume that people will reach a stable asymptotic level of performance after sufficient experience. This assumption is inconsistent with the documented ability of highly experienced individuals to continue to improve their performance through training. Research has shown that when even highly experienced workers and professionals are appropriately motivated, they are able to improve their objective performance, sometimes dramatically.5 Finally, many efforts have been made to measure children's, adolescents', and young adults' basic capacities, such as short-term memory and attention, as well as visual, auditory, spatial, and motor skills, to assess the possible innate limits of their attainable performance. Efforts to use these estimated capacities to predict adult professional achievement have been disappointing and largely unsuccessful.6 Efforts to identify innate individual characteristics that are critical to attaining expert performance yet are resistant to modification by extensive training have not proved fruitful.17,18 The only such innate characteristics for which the genetic difference between people and the associated mechanisms are well understood are body size and height,19,20 wherein above-average height provides an advantage in basketball, while below-average height facilitates elite performance in gymnastics. These findings raise doubts about the common-sense view of genetically determined limits that severely constrain people's attainable performance. They suggest that highly motivated individuals should be able to influence their attained performance levels to a much greater degree than is traditionally assumed. The remainder of this article addresses two broad objectives. First, emerging findings are presented on how performers attain expert levels of achievement in diverse domains, including music, sports, and chess. A particular focus here is on the role of deliberate practice and training quality in mediating improvements in current levels of performance. Second, the expert-performance approach, with its emphasis on deliberate practice, is applied to research on expertise in medicine. Here, insights gained from the study of expertise in other areas provide interesting ideas for enhancing and maintaining attained levels of performance in the medical domain. The Scientific Study of Expert Performance and Its Acquisition In the introduction to this article, several examples were given where respected experts, such as wine connoisseurs and famous stockbrokers, failed to demonstrate consistently superior performances on representative tasks, such as investing money in stocks and describing wines. Scientists can no longer assume that individuals reputed to be experts based on their extended experience will display the superior achievement indicative of expertise in a domain. Ericsson and Smith21 criticized studies of expertise that merely looked for differences between \"experts\" (defined by social criteria) and less experienced individuals. They proposed instead that researchers focus on superior performance in a domain and identify any individual who consistently exhibits superior performance—whether they are socially recognized as expert or not. The first step is to construct representative tasks that capture the essence of expertise in the domain where the superior performer can exhibit their superior performance in a consistent and reproducible manner. The focus on reproducible scientific evidence on superior performance provides a framework for evaluating anecdotes about the achievements of athletes, musicians, and scientists. When the \"hard\" scientific evidence for the most amazing achievements is scrutinized, most of these incidents cannot be substantiated by independent and unbiased sources.20 Often, the only sources of these anecdotes are the exceptional persons telling stories about their own childhood achievements when interviewed as adults. In other cases, the individuals observing the event may have misinterpreted what actually happened. For example, when a golfer sinks a 40-foot putt to win a golf tournament, it is often assumed that they did so because of their amazing ability.22 However, scientists have analyzed elite golfers' putting accuracy at different distances during tournament conditions and conducted experiments wherein golfers are asked to make the same shot ten to 20 times in row. The results of these analyses show that the consistency of their shots is never perfect, though much higher than that of less skilled golfers.22 Even the paths of the experts' properly played shots are influenced by random factors beyond the golfers' control and, thus, sinking long putts is due in large part to chance factors, even for the best golfers. To build a science of exceptional performance, we need to restrict the scientific evidence to those aspects of phenomena that can be repeatedly and reliably observed, such as the expert golfers' reduced variability in outcomes of shots. Ideally, from an empirical viewpoint, one would reproduce the everyday phenomenon of superior achievement in the laboratory, so it can be examined under standardized and experimental conditions. In many domains, it is possible to measure expert performance by observing elite performers as they reproduce their superior achievement under controlled laboratory conditions.21 Many types of superior performance by experts are reproduced repeatedly in everyday life. For example, elite runners who finish the mile in less than four minutes can reproduce their exceptional running times repeatedly at different competitions. In sports there is a long tradition of creating fair competition by designing standardized comparable conditions for all participating athletes. The same is true for competitions in music, dance, and chess. In all of these domains, elite individuals consistently outperform their less accomplished counterparts. Expert performers have trained to be able to reproduce their superior performance under representative conditions in everyday life whenever it is required during competition and training. Ericsson and Smith21 described how it is possible to identify naturally occurring activities that capture the essence of expertise in a given domain. For example, in his pioneering work on chess expertise, de Groot23 argued that the essential task for expert chess playing consists of selecting the best moves for critical positions during chess games. To study performance, de Groot extracted chess positions from games between chess masters and set up a controlled laboratory situation where he could present these positions one at a time to an individual chess player (see Figure 1). The chess players were instructed to think aloud while they selected the best move for the presented position. Ability to select the best chess moves under these conditions is closely correlated with ratings for tournament competitors.24Figure 1.: Three examples of laboratory tasks that capture the consistently superior performance of domain experts in chess, typing, and music. (From \"Expertise,\" by K. A. Ericsson and Andreas C. Lehmann, 1999, Encyclopedia of Creativity. Copyright by Academic Press.)Another example is found in the study of expert performance in typing. Given that expertise in typing should generalize to any kind of textual content, we can simply give all typists the same text material and ask them to type it accurately as fast as possible. The final example given in Figure 1 illustrates a common obstacle to the study of expertise, namely that experts can excel at a task that less skilled individuals are unable to complete. In the study of music expertise, for example, we are confronted with the problem that the expert musicians typically perform pieces of music that are too difficult for less accomplished musicians to master. It is, however, possible to instruct all musicians to play familiar or unfamiliar pieces of lower difficulty and then ask them to repeat their own performances in as much detail as possible. When asked to do so, experts can repeat their performances with much less deviation from their original renditions than can less skilled musicians, thus exhibiting greater control over their performance. In related approaches, snooker players can be asked to make several shots for each of a series of fixed configurations of billiard balls, and golfers can be asked to make several putts for each of many ball locations on a green.22 In sum, it is possible to identify a collection of representative tasks that capture the essence of expertise in most domains, and those tasks can be administered to all participants under controlled and standardized conditions. In the latter portion of this article, I will identify tasks that simulate the conditions for the essential activities in a few different domains in medicine, such as diagnosis and surgical treatments. The Acquisition of Superior Reproducible (Expert) Performance Having confined our attention to superior, reproducible performance that can be measured, it is possible to identify several claims about the acquisition of expertise that generalize across different domains.6,20 First, longitudinal assessments of performance reveal that performance increases gradually and that there is no evidence for abrupt increases from one trial to the next. Even when the performance of child prodigies in music and chess are measured by adult standards, the increases in achievement are found to be gradual and extended over many years. Second, the age at which experts typically reach their peak career performance is the middle to late 20s for many vigorous sports, and one or two decades later (i.e., in the 30s and 40s) for less physically intense games, as well as the arts and sciences. This continued, often extended, development beyond age 18 implies that the best individuals are able to engage in practice activities that lead to further improvements in performance even after physical maturation is reached. Finally, all performers, including the most \"gifted\" or \"talented,\" need a minimum of approximately ten years of intense involvement before they reach an international level in sports, sciences, and the arts.4,5 Most elite performers, in fact, take considerably longer to reach that level. This ten-year rule of required engagement in domain-related activities is the most compelling evidence for the necessity of experience to attain high levels of performance. From interviews with international-level performers in several domains, Bloom and his colleagues found that elite performers are nearly always introduced to their future domains of expertise as young children in a playful manner. As soon as they reveal enjoyment for the activity and show promise compared to their local peers, they receive help both in seeking out a teacher or coach and to begin regular training. Based on these interviews, Bloom25 argued that access to superior training resources during development is necessary to reach the highest levels. The best evidence for the value of current training methods and intensive schedules of practice comes from historical comparisons.22,26 The most dramatic improvements in the level of performance over historical periods are found in sports and are associated with improved quality and quantity of practice. Contemporary elite athletes' performance is much superior to the gold medal winners of the early Olympic Games.5 In some events where performance can be measured objectively (i.e., with times or distances), current winning performances are as much as 30–50% better.27 Such a drastic improvement indicates the superiority of contemporary training methods, beyond what could be obtained through technological advances and better equipment, such as lighter running shoes, alone. To further explore the role of practice in attaining expert levels of performance, Ralf Krampe, Clemens Tesch-Römer, and I5 tried to identify those training activities that were most closely associated with consistent improvements in performance and referred to them as deliberate practice. From a review of studies of learning and skill acquisition, we found evidence for consistent gradual improvement of performance when the following conditions were met. First, the participants were instructed to improve some aspect of performance for a well-defined task. Second, they were able to get detailed immediate feedback on their performance. Finally, they had ample opportunities to improve their performance gradually by performing the same or similar tasks repeatedly. The participants were able to keep improving their performance during extended training as long as the training sessions were limited to around an hour—a time that typical college students are able to maintain sufficient concentration to sustain active efforts to improve. These deliberate efforts to increase one's performance beyond its current level involve problem solving and finding better methods to perform the tasks. Engaging in practice activities with the primary goal of improving some aspect of performance is an integral part of deliberate practice. The importance of deliberate practice in attaining expert performance was first demonstrated in a study of expert musicians studying at a famous music academy in Berlin. Three groups of the expert musicians who differed from each other in level of attained music performance were selected. All of the expert musicians were interviewed about how they spent their daily lives and were asked to keep detailed diaries of their activities for a week. Although all expert musicians were found to spend a similar amount of time when all types of music-related activities were combined, the two best groups of expert musicians were found to spend more time in solitary practice. When the experts practiced by themselves, they concentrated on improving specific aspects of the music performance as directed by their music teachers, thus meeting the criteria for deliberate practice. The best groups of expert musicians spent around four hours every day, including weekends, in this type of solitary practice. From retrospective estimates of practice, Ericsson et al.5 calculated the number of hours of deliberate practice that the three groups of musicians, along with two reference groups, had accumulated by a given age (see Figure 2). By the age of 20, the group of the best expert musicians (along with a reference group of musicians belonging to international orchestras) had spent over 10,000 hours of practice, which is 2,500 and 5,000 hours more than the two less accomplished groups of expert musicians and 8,000 hours more than a reference group of amateur pianists of the same age.28Figure 2.: Estimated amount of time for solitary practice as a function of age for the middle-aged professional violinists (triangles), the best expert violinists (squares), the good expert violinists (empty circles), the least accomplished expert violinists (filled circles) and amateur pianists (diamonds). (From \"The role of deliberate practice in the acquisition of expert performance,\" by K. A. Ericsson, R. Th. Krampe, and C. Tesch-Römer, 1993, Psychological Review, 100(3), p. 379 and p. 384. Copyright 1993 by American Psychological Association. Adapted with permission.)Several studies and reviews have found a consistent association between the amount and quality of solitary activities meeting the criteria of deliberate practice and performance in chess,29 in music,28,30,31 and in different types of sports.32–34 The concept of deliberate practice also accounts for many earlier findings in other domains,6 as well as for the results of the rare longitudinal study of elite athletic performers.35 Deliberate practice has even been found to be a key factor in maintaining expert levels as performers reach older ages. Although the performance of most professionals decreases, there are a few intriguing exceptions. A sufficient amount of weekly deliberate practice has been shown to allow expert pianists in their 50s and 60s to maintain their piano performances at a comparable level to that of young experts, although the older musicians displayed normal age-related declines on standardized tests.28 Similarly, older masters in the game GO are able to maintain their performance and related skills,36 and master athletes show the key importance of continued intense physical training.19,37 The age-related decreases in performance appear to result primarily from reductions of regular deliberate practice, rather than as a direct consequence of aging per se.38 Complex Mechanisms That Mediate Expert Performance and Continued Learning The fundamental theoretical challenge is to explain how most people and professionals reach a stable performance asymptote within a limited time period, whereas the expert performers are able to keep improving their performance for years and decades. When people and professionals are first introduced to an activity, their primary goal is to reach a sufficient level of mastery that is acceptable to other people in the domain. According to the traditional theory of skill acquisition,2 people need initially to concentrate on what they are going to do in order to reduce gross mistakes, as illustrated in the lower arm of Figure 3. With more experience, their salient mistakes become increasingly rare, their performance appears smoother, and they no longer need to concentrate as hard to perform at an acceptable level. After some limited training and experience—frequently less than 50 hours for most recreational activities such as skiing, tennis, and driving a car—an acceptable standard of performance is attained without much need for effortful attention. As individuals' behaviors are adapted to the performance demands and become increasingly automated, they lose conscious control and are no longer able to make specific intentional adjustments.Figure 3.: An illustration of the qualitative difference between the course of improvement of expert performance and of everyday activities. The goal for everyday activities is to reach as rapidly as possible a satisfactory level that is stable and \"autonomous.\" After individuals pass through the \"cognitive\" and \"associative\" phases, they can generated their performance virtually automatically with a minimal amount of effort (see the gray/white plateau at the bottom of the graph). In contrast, expert performers counteract automaticity by developing increasingly complex mental representations to attain higher levels of control of their performance and will therefore remain within the \"cognitive\" and \"associative\" phases. Some experts will, at some point in their career, give up their commitment to seeking excellence and thus terminate regular engagement in deliberate practice to further improve performance, which results in premature automation of their performance. (Adapted from \"The scientific study of expert levels of performance: general implications for optimal learning and creativity\" by K. A. Ericsson in High Ability Studies, 9, p. 90. Copyright 1998 by European Council for High Ability.)In direct contrast, expert performance continues to improve as a function of more experience, coupled with deliberate practice. The key challenge for aspiring expert performers is to avoid the arrested development associated with automaticity and to acquire cognitive skills to support their continued learning and improvement. The expert performer counteracts the tendencies toward automaticity by actively acquiring and refining cognitive mechanisms to support continued learning and improvement, as shown in the upper arm of Figure 3. The experts deliberately construct and seek out training situations in which the desired goal exceeds their current level of performance. They acquire mechanisms that are designed to increase their control and ability to monitor performance in representative situations from the domain of expertise.7,22,39 For example, a chess player acquires improved memory skills",

      "title": "Building planning action models using activity recognition",
      "abstract": "Activity recognition is receiving a special attention because it can be used in many areas. This field of artificial intelligence has been widely investigated lately for tasks such as following the behavior of people with some kind of cognitive impairment. For instance, elderly people with dementia. The recognition of the activities that these people carry on permits to offer assistance in case they need it while they are performing the activities. Currently, there are many systems capable of recognizing the activities that a user performs in a specific environment. Most of these systems have two problems. First, they recognize states of the activities instead of the entire activity. For instance, instead of recognizing an activity that starts at the moment ????? and ends at ?????, these systems split the time line in fixed-length temporal windows that are classified as belonging to an activity or another. These windows sometimes overlap two activities which makes classifying the activities more difficult. Also this prevents the system from detecting the states of the system before and after each activity. These states are needed to build behavioral models. Second, most of these systems recognize complete high-level activities such as cooking or making tea but they can not recognize the low-level activities that compose the high-level activities. For example, pick-up the fork or switch on the oven. For this reason, most of the systems in the literature can not be used to assist people during the activities since they recognize the activity itself and they can not provide the low-level activities that the user has to execute to complete the high-level activity. For these reasons, in this thesis we have three objectives. The first objective is the development of a new activity recognition algorithm capable of overcoming the problems that the fixed-length temporal windows cause and, also, capable of extracting the states that the system can traverse. The second objective is to automatically generate an automated planning domain able to represent the user behavior using the activity recognition system. In order to do that, we will use the activity recognition system developed in the previous step to recognize the activities and the states of the environment before and after the activities. Once the system is capable of performing this task, the planning domain is generated using that information. Then, the automated planning domain will be used by an automated planner to generate sequences of actions to reach the goal of the user. That way, those sequences will be used to assist users by telling them the next action or actions to accomplish their goals. The third objective is to use automatically generated planning domains for guiding users to accomplish the task they pursue. In addition, we want to check whether the generated plans can be used to recognize the activities alone or to help a sensors system to improve its results. Also, the generated plans will be used to predict the next activities that the user may perform. This way, we will test the planning domains and the plans generated by the planner to check if they are capable of offering information to recognize the activity that the user performs or, at least, offering information for the activity recognition system to improve its results. --------------------------",

When a helping act focuses attention away from the conditions producing the initial mood, the initial mood is weakened. Alternatively, when a helping act focuses attention on the conditions producing the initial mood, the initial mood is either maintained or strengthened. To test this hypothesis, positive and negative moods in connection with either self or other focus were created: Participants focused their attention on positive or negative statements about themselves or about friends. Participants then performed a task that either helped themselves (focused attention on themselves) or helped others (focused attention on others). The predicted three-way interaction was obtained. Helping another decreased the strength of self-focused moods and increased the strength of other-focused moods. Alternatively, helping oneself increased the strength of self-focused moods and decreased the strength of other-focused moods.",

      "abstract": "Mindfulness is the psychological state of staying attuned to the present moment, without ruminating on past or future events, and allowing thoughts, feelings, or sensations to arise without judgment or attachment. Previous work has shown that heightened dispositional mindfulness is associated with the awareness of the importance of exercise, exercise self-efficacy, exercise motivation, and self-reported exercise level. However, more methodologically rigorous studies are needed to understand the relationship between mindfulness and the psychological mechanisms related to exercise motivation, including the identification of why individuals are motivated to engage in exercise, the subjective experience of exercise, and the propensity for exercise dependence and addiction. In this cross-sectional investigation, we utilized the framework of the Self-Determination Theory to examine the hypothesis that heightened dispositional mindfulness (as measured by the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale) would be associated with increased levels of exercise motivation that were derived by higher levels of autonomous self-regulation. Individuals were recruited from urban areas who self-reported either low (exercising 2 or fewer times per week for 20 min or less;",

      "title": "Clocking self-regulation: why time of day matters for health psychology",
      "abstract": "Various lines of research have identified a number of factors that can impair a person's ability and motivation to exercise self-control, here self-regulation, in the face of a tempting object (e.g., food, sex, alcohol/drugs, smoking). Each of these in situ factors - the availability of the tempting object, one's desire for it, and impaired affective and cognitive functioning (most notably from sleep-related fatigue, daily 'wear and tear', and intoxication) - makes self-regulation more difficult, and even more so when they co-occur. This integrative paper highlights how time of day modulates the salience of these impairing factors and argues that they are likely to be especially influential on self-regulation at night, or later in one's waking day. As each factor is likely to vary considerably across the 24 hours of a day, so too will one's self-regulatory ability and motivation - although person-level characteristics such as chronotype may shift these time-based considerations. The paper thus emphasises the importance of clocking self-regulation within health psychology research and intervention design. Consideration of when a self-regulation attempt is being made and of how time of day (or night) may be altering both the person and the situation towards risk, will facilitate a more temporally contextualised account of self-regulation.",

      "abstract": "Дослідження присвячено феномену “прокрастинація”. Відкладання справ на потім стало буденністю досить великого відсотку студентів. У статті акцентується увага саме на студентах, оскільки в цей період життя людина характеризується набуттям почуття дорослості та самоідентичності, розпочинається планування майбутнього, що, зазвичай, потребує багато часу для роздумів. Навчальні і професійні досягнення стають визначальними для процесу становлення особистості в соціумі та її продуктивного існування в ньому. Основною перепоною цьому може стати прокрастинація, феномен якої полягає у схильності людини відкладати неприємні завдання на потім, тяжіння до справ, що приносять більше задоволення або швидший результат. Варто зауважити, попри свою поширеність у будь-якому віці, прокрастинація найбільше характерна саме для студентства, оскільки вона стає формою прихованого протесту юнака при виконанні діяльності, за яку особистість не готова нести відповідальність. У межах нашого дослідження ми розглядаємо прокрастинацію як вираження емоційної реакції на заплановані чи необхідні справи. Аналізуючи теоретичний базис феномену, ми спостерігали велику різноманітність його класифікацій за різними характеристиками. Виокремлено п’ять типів прокрастинації залежно від сфери її вияву: щоденна, або побутова – відкладання справи стає життєвою стратегією особистості, оскільки в неї відсутні навички виконання рутинної діяльності; прокрастинація прийняття рішень; невротична прокрастинація – відкладання прийняття важливих рішень, які однозначно вплинуть на подальше майбутнє особистості; компульсивна прокрастинація – поєднання поведінки з прокрастинацією прийняття рішен є хронічним виявом феномену; академічна – відкладання виконання навчальних завдань.",

      "abstract": "It is often said that hard skills or technical knowledge will get you an interview but soft skills will tremendously increase your chances to get and keep the job. Hard skills are the skills or technical knowledge we need to do our job adequately, whereas human skills are the skills we need to be better human beings with a better character. Hard skills answer the question of how well you can do at work. Soft skills or human skills, however, answer the questions like what kind of person you are. How well you can get on with people around you. Are you someone people can trust and feel comfortable working with or someone people distrust because you are annoying as a team member, you constantly get people into unnecessary arguments or you make them uncomfortable because of your negative mind set and/or suspicious attitude?. It seems, therefore, that teaching human skills is no longer a luxury but an obligation. The problem, however, is that oftentimes our attempt to teach essential life skills consists simply of teaching about them; we mistakenly treat life skills like hard skills both at the level of instruction and evaluation. We assume that teaching a set of vocabulary items or concepts related to soft skills would suffice to help student acquire those skills. This paper suggests that soft Skills cannot be taught; they are caught. For this reason, it is contended that there is a desperate need to see soft skills with a different lens. It puts forwards a paradigm shift in soft skill instruction in practice, pedagogy, and evaluation. It is high time we discontinued teaching life skills as a set of concepts and vocabulary items. Instead, we need to adopt a teaching though coaching and evaluation through experiential and oral schemes. We need to reconsider our role as soft skill teachers and students, our teaching methodology and finally the learning environment within which life skills are being developed and evaluated.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Loss of self-control in addiction is often hard to understand. addictive behaviour has both voluntary and involuntary aspects. A better understanding of how people with addiction lose control over their lives gives more options for recovery. AIM: To gain insight in the different factors that undermine self-control in addiction, and to develop a model to better identify these factors. METHOD: Longitudinal, qualitative research (n = 69) among people with (mostly) opioid and alcohol dependency. Respondents were interviewed four times over 3,5 years to gain a better understanding of their goals and what frustrated the achievement of those goals. RESULTS: Different theories have a different understanding of what self-control is, or when behaviour counts as self-controlled. Self-control can be exercised on three different levels: to carry out our intentions (short term), to achieve goals (long term), or to live life according to our values and self-understanding. These three layers of self-control influence each other, as well in loss of self-control as in recovery. CONCLUSIONS Loss of self-control or agency in addiction almost never has a single cause, but is caused by a set of complex, interacting factors. The three-layered model of self-control makes these different levels of self-control (intentional, instrumental, normative) explicit and offers important leads for recovery.",

      "title": "Planning a teacher staff competence structure robust to unexpected personnel absence",
      "abstract": "Teachers' absences are a common disruption to the provision of academic courses. They make it necessary to modify teacher assignment, which amounts to finding suitable substitutions. Sometimes it happens that the competences of the available teachers, with given constraints, e.g. teaching hour limits, are not sufficient to find an admissible assignment modification. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a so-called robust teaching staff competence structure. In the case of teachers' absences, a robust competence structure is a structure that allows one to find a modification of the assignment under every possible scenario of disruption. In other words, the following question is considered: does there exist, and if so, what is the competence structure robust to the disruption caused by an unexpected personnel absence? The number of potential solution variants is related to the number of competences that can be improved. For each variant, there could exist many cases of teacher absence (absence of one teacher, two teachers, etc.). Moreover, for these, there could also exist many assignment modification variants. This an NP-hard problem. In the context of the scale of problems encountered in practice, searching for solutions using well-known algorithms (based on an exhaustive search) is a time-consuming process which does not guarantee that an admissible solution will be found. In the present study, a sufficient condition is proposed, the fulfilment of which guarantees the existence of a non-empty set of admissible solutions. Declarative modelling and computer implementation in the form of constraint logic programming (CLP) have been applied. The potential of the proposed solution is illustrated with examples.",

Regular exercise and vigorous physical activity aid in maintaining a healthy life and preventing chronic diseases. Rather than looking for a specific exercise type to help fall asleep, it is better to encourage patients to find exercises that they can practice regularly in their daily lives. However, exercise guidelines for sleep disturbances based on clear evidence are still insufficient. Therefore, it is necessary to gain information on the correct physical activity methods for prevention/management of mild sleep disturbances. It is expected that many people can maintain physical, mental, and social health as well as prevent/manage mild sleep disturbances through regular exercise and vigorous physical activity.

Metodo: se realizo una investigacion cualitativa basada en una encuesta de elaboracion propia para todos los usuarios del taller de encuadernacion. Resultados: desde las respuestas se evidencia que la participacion de forma regular en el taller, es decir, tener una ocupacion, implica el desarrollo de una rutina diaria, de unos habitos, asi como la formacion de roles (amigos, companeros) y favorece las relaciones tanto en el propio taller como fuera de el en algunos casos. Por otro lado, tambien se ponen de manifiesto las dificultades propias de la patologia mental que hacen mas complicado desarrollar todo lo anteriormente nombrado. Conclusiones: se puede definir el taller de encuadernacion como un teatro o puesta en escena de la vida de la persona. Las dificultades y modos de actuar se repiten en ambos espacios ya sean propios de su personalidad o de la enfermedad. Es funcion del terapeuta analizarlos para facilitar al usuario su propia comprension y, si este considera, el cambio de los mismos.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\nObjective: The aim is to know how a binding workshop, conducted by occupational therapists, influences the behaviour of patients with severe mental disorder, from the perspective of the Model of Human Occupation by Gary Kielhofner and group therapy. Method: A qualitative investigation was carried out based on a self-developed survey for all users of the bookbinding workshop. Results: The answers are shown an evidence that the regular participation in the workshop, is to say, to have an activity, imply the development of a daily routine, habits and the creation of roles (friends, mates) and, in many cases, it supports the relationships not only inside the workshops but also outside. On another hand, the own difficulties of a mental pathology brings to light making more complicated to develop all the goals named before. Conclusions: The binding workshop can be defined as a theatre or a staging of a person's life. The difficulties and the ways to act are repeated in both places either in they own personalities or diseases. The role of the therapist is to analyse in order to facilitate their own understanding to the user and if they consider it, the change of it.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\nDeCS Terapia Ocupacional; Trastornos Mentales; Ocupaciones; Estructura de Grupo; Narracion.\r\nMeSH Occupational Therapy; Mental Disorders; Occupations; Group Structure; Narration.",

      "abstract": "Discrete trial training (DTT) is a well-established intervention for teaching skills to children with autism; however, few published guidelines are available for determining whether a child’s rate of learning a particular skill is satisfactory and, if not, what to do. We assert that progress within 8-10 teaching sessions usually is evidence of satisfactory skill acquisition, whereas absence of progress within this time frame indicates a need to consider modifying or stopping instruction of that skill. Absence of progress may involve (a) consistently low rates of correct responding, (b) variable performance across sessions, (c) increases in problem behavior (often in conjunction with low or variable rates of correct responding), or (d) limited generalization of the skill outside intervention. Likely reasons for each of these patterns are described, and decision flowcharts for identifying possible solutions are outlined. When implemented with supervision from a qualified professional, these flowcharts may facilitate systematic problem solving.",

We argue that while people engage in such thinking, they make progress not only when they consciously think but also sometimes when they are consciously thinking about something else—that is, while they think unconsciously. We review the literature on unconscious thought (UT) processes and conclude that there is indeed quite some evidence for UT. Conceptualized as a form of unconscious goal pursuit, UT is likely to be especially fruitful for thought processes that are complex, important, or interesting to the thinker. In addition, we discuss other characteristics of the UT process. We end with proposing Type 3 processes, in addition to Type 1 and Type 2 (or Systems 1 and 2) processes, to accommodate prolonged thought processes in models on thought.",

      "abstract": "Moments of inattention are commonly experienced by most people in everyday life. While some of these inattentive episodes occur inadvertently, others are the result of an individual's choices. Here we characterize the aspects of inattention over which individuals have agency, with a specific consideration of the inattentive state of mind wandering (i.e., off-task thought). Our research on this topic has revealed several general principles that underpin people's agency over their inattention to a task at hand. First, people have nuanced awareness of their inattentive episodes, reporting various degrees of both spontaneous and deliberate moments of inattention, even during tasks in which they agree to be attentive. Second, spontaneous and deliberate bouts of attentional disengagement have distinct correlates and underlying mechanisms. Third, people have considerable control over the degree of their inattention and are able to regulate it skillfully on command and strategically in response to situational demands. Fourth, people have reliable memories of prior moment-to-moment changes in their inattention. And finally, individuals are able to accurately forecast how their inattention might change in an upcoming task. These principles suggest an agentic view of inattention, according to which people are imperfect but intelligent managers of their attentional engagement and disengagement. We discuss the wide-ranging implications of this view on prior and future studies of attentional disengagement, the interpretability of performance in cognitive tasks, and strategies that can be implemented to reduce inattention.

      "abstract": "Ambiguity and confusion can frequently occur in practice when documenting a system and assessing internal controls. However, these complexities are sometimes difficult to convey to students when using passive learning methods. This paper introduces a distinct variation of the active learning methodology of role-playing to increase student understanding of documentation and internal control topics. In this variation, the instructor plays multiple roles of different employees involved in an accounting system, and the students, en masse, play the role of auditor. This role-playing can expose students to situations where employees lie, obfuscate, lack understanding, or perform incorrect procedures. Compared with traditional role-playing exercises, preparation time is minimal. It requires only a completed flowchart, list of internal control threats, and list of employee characteristics and motivations (e.g., the controller is distrustful of the auditors). Other problems that commonly arise with traditional role-playing techniques (e.g., the need for special environments) can be mitigated.",

By his behavior, the project manager can influence others to act and determine others to respond to a variety of issues related to the project.

Personal projects are personally relevant goal-directed activities that take place over an extended period of time, and are a way to study the intentional pursuit of happiness. This exploratory study identifies the types of projects that people engage in and which project dimensions predict hedonic well-being (enjoyment). Students (N = 327) and community participants completed the Personal Project Analysis in a cross-sectional survey. Two coders thematically coded projects into seven types. We used linear mixed models to identify which project types and dimensions uniquely predict enjoyment. People engaged in various types of activities (7 project types) which were enjoyed to different extents (relationship projects were most enjoyable while household maintenance were least enjoyable) and tend to experience greater enjoyment when projects encourage autonomy, control, likelihood of success, progress, absorption, low difficulty, and low challenge. Knowledge on which activity characteristics are linked to well-being can inform tailored positive psychology programming. Overall, people tend to find activities which are relatively easy and where they make a lot of progress more enjoyable, indicating simple daily activities are one way to intentionally prioritize daily well-being.",

Al estar sobrecargados con el trabajo, la monotonia y la percepcion de falta de reconocimiento pueden ser catalizadores de burnout. Jesus Montero-Marin, autor de este trabajo, ha analizado los factores que influyen en el desarrollo de los tres perfiles de esta condicion: frenetico, sin motivacion y desgastado, en funcion de las caracteristicas del sindrome mostrado. El empleado frenetico suele estar muy involucrado en su papel, es muy ambicioso y tiene una sobrecarga de trabajo de gran tamano. El falto de motivacion (Sub-challanged) es un trabajador que realiza tareas monotonas, con tendencia al aburrimiento y la falta de oportunidades de desarrollo personal. El perfil desgastado tiende a aparecer entre la gente que termina haciendo caso omiso de sus responsabilidades debido a la falta de control y la falta de reconocimiento que perciben en su entorno. El Cuestionario Subtipo Clinico Burnout (BCSQ-36 o BCSQ-12) se ha visto muy util para evaluar las causas subyacentes del sindrome de burnout, que son de vital importancia para conocer el diseno de intervenciones especificas y estrategias de tratamiento.",

Dans une poursuite particulière, puisque la cible est mise en mouvement par le sujet lui-même, nous essaierons de montrer que l'extrême complexité des coordinations sensori-motrices présentes dans l'habileté étudiée (courir avec un ballon dans les pieds) conduit le sujet à utiliser les processus cognitifs, pour aider de façon économique les processus sensori-moteurs à la régulation de l'action. Dix-huit sujets (six débutants, six moyens, six confirmés) effectuent une course avec la balle dans les pieds. Le but de l'expérience est d'étudier les éléments de contrôle de la trajectoire que les sujets utilisent pour rejoindre la balle après lui avoir impulsé une force. En variant les indices visuels dans le sens d'une diminution progressive, on a constaté que les trois groupes présentent des moyens de contrôle différents. Si les processus cognitifs jouent un rôle important, les indices visuels de sensation de mouvement offrent plus de renseignements aux sujets que les indices visuels de vision du but. Cette expérience montre également la place prépondérante que joue la proprioception dans le contrôle de l'habileté sensori-motrice.",

This suggested that the entrepreneur had not learnt from them. The previous failures did not trigger the subsequent ventures. Instead, they played a role in causing the failures. Learning from failure does not happen immediately but requires deliberate reflection. Deliberate reflection is a prerequisite for learning from failure as the entrepreneur repeated similar mistakes time after time until he reflected on each failure. \nPractical/managerial implications: It confirms that failure is a part of entrepreneurial endeavours. However, learning from it requires deliberate reflection. Failure does not 'trigger' the next venture and educators should note this.\nContribution/value-add: Knowing the effect of failure on consecutive ventures may help us to understand the development of prototypes (mental frameworks) and expand the theory about entrepreneurial prototype categories.",

      "title": "Critical Thinking: Nine Strategies for Everyday Life, Part I.",
      "abstract": "Strategy Five: Reshape Your Character Choose one intellectual trait (intellectual perseverance, autonomy, empathy, courage, humility, etc.) to strive for each month, focusing on how you can develop that trait in yourself. example, concentrating on intellectual humility, begin to notice when you admit you are wrong. Notice when you refuse to admit you are wrong, even in the face of glaring evidence that you are in fact wrong. Notice when you become defensive when another tries to point out a deficiency in your work or your thinking. Notice when your intellectual arrogance keeps you from learning, for example, when you say to yourself, already know everything I need to know about this subject, or, know as much as he does. Who does he think he is forcing opinions on me? By owning your ignorance, you can begin to deal with Strategy Six: Deal with Your Egocentrism Egocentric thinking is found in the disposition in human nature to think with an automatic, subconscious bias in favor of onesself. On a daily basis, you can begin to observe your egocentric thinking in action by contemplating questions like these: Under what circumstances do I think with an automatic, subconscious bias in favor of myself? Do I ever become irritable over small things? Do I do or say anything irrational to get my way? Do I try to impose my will upon others? Do I ever fail to speak my mind when I feel strongly about something and then later feel resentment? Once you identify egocentric thinking in operation, you can work to replace it with more rational thought through systematic self-reflection. example, think along the lines of: would a rational feel in this or that situation? What would a rational How does that compare with what I want to do? (Hint: If you find that you continually conclude that a rational would behave just as you behaved you are probably engaging in self-deception.) Strategy Seven: Redefine the Way You See Things We live in a world, both personal and social, in which every situation is defined, that is, given a meaning. How a situation is defined determines not only how we feel about it but also how we act in it and what implications it has for us. However, virtually every situation can be defined in more than one way. This fact carries with it tremendous opportunities. In principle, it lies within your power and mine to make our lives more happy and fulfilling. Many of the negative definitions which we give to situations in our lives could, in principle, be transformed into positive ones. We can be happy when otherwise we would have been sad. We can be fulfilled when otherwise we would have been frustrated. In this strategy we practice redefining the way we see things, turning negatives into positives, dead-ends into new beginnings, and mistakes into opportunities to learn. To make this strategy practical, we should create some specific guidelines for ourselves. example, we might make ourselves a list of 5 to 10 recurrent negative contexts in which we feel frustrated, angry, unhappy, or worried. We could then identify the definition in each case that is at the root of the negative emotion. We would then choose a plausible alternative definition for each and then plan for our new responses as well as new emotions. example, if you tend to worry about all problems, both the ones you can do something about and those that you can't, you can review the thinking in this nursery rhyme: For every problem under the sun, there is a solution or there is none. If there be one, think `til you find If there be none, then never mind it. Let's look at another example. You redefine your initial approach to a member of the opposite sex not in terms of the definition his or her response will determine whether or not I am an attractive person but in terms of the definition let me test to see if this is initially drawn to me, given the way they perceive me. …",

      "title": "Taking a tiny step back: The impact of planning on a bumpy goal pursuit",
      "abstract": "Abstract Across varied domains, prior research has examined the impact of setbacks and goal‐inconsistent behaviors on goal pursuit. A large setback, whether a result of an external hurdle or an internally‐driven goal‐inconsistent behavior, may suggest that the goal is not really feasible and goal disengagement is ideal. Yet, a minor setback or a goal‐deviation may just be a bump in the road that can, and often should, be overcome, especially for important, long‐term goals. So, not all setbacks signal that failure is inevitable and goal pursuit should be put on hold. Forming a goal‐directed plan shifts individuals from a deliberative to an implemental mindset and is commonly recommended by both academics and practitioners to help individuals pursue important goals and disengage from unachievable goals. But are plans beneficial when small, goal‐related setbacks occur? Specifically, this article examines the impact of minor bumps in the road (experiencing small setbacks, engaging in minor goal‐inconsistent behaviors) on continued goal pursuit. In three studies, field and lab, and across two different domains (eating healthy and saving money), we (1) show that small, seemingly acceptable setbacks can negatively influence goal pursuit when one has formed a plan, and (2) empirically demonstrate that when small setbacks occur, having a plan may increase feeling of action crisis and ultimately decrease interest in continued goal pursuit.",

      "abstract": "RESUMEN. En esta contribucion intentamos profundizar el analisis sobre el proceso de formacion de los tesistas durante el desarrollo del doctorado. Planteamos algunas reflexiones considerando los estereotipos de director caracterizados por Farji-Brener (i.e. indiferente, sobreprotector y con comportamientos alternativos) y tambien algunos estereotipos de tesista (i.e. indiferente, sobreprotegido y con comportamientos alternativos), discutiendo los fundamentos pedagogicos subyacentes en este proceso. Como se trata de una relacion entre dos personas, los posibles resultados del proceso no solo variaran de acuerdo a las caracteristicas dominantes del director, sino tambien de acuerdo a las caracteristicas del tesista y de la interaccion entre ambos. Es decir, como pueden darse diversas combinaciones, en algunos casos el proceso sera optimo o muy bueno, mientras que en muchos casos lo que se produce es una relacion “desorientador-desorientado”. Una primera conclusion es que cuando el director propone comportamientos alternativos a la indiferencia o la sobreproteccion, el resultado no sera necesariamente una buena experiencia de aprendizaje para ambas partes. Por otro lado, si el objetivo principal es formar investigadores academica- y psicologicamente independientes, capaces de realizar trabajos originales y creativos, el proceso de ensenanza-aprendizaje deberia apoyarse en metodologias alternativas a la ensenanza tradicional. Es decir, deberia centrarse en como ensenar (aprender) a pensar, mas que en la cantidad de informacion y entrenamiento que se transmite (adquiere) durante el desarrollo de una tesis doctoral.

      "title": "What Is the Role of Emotions in Educational Leaders’ Decision Making? Proposing an Organizing Framework",
      "abstract": "Purpose: Emotions have a pervasive, predictable, sometimes deleterious but other times instrumental effect on decision making. Yet the influence of emotions on educational leaders’ decision making has been largely underexplored. To optimize educational leaders’ decision making, this article builds on the prevailing data-driven decision-making approach, and proposes an organizing framework of educational leaders’ emotions in decision making by drawing on converging empirical evidence from multiple disciplines (e.g., administrative science, psychology, behavioral economics, cognitive neuroscience, and neuroeconomics) intersecting emotions, decision making, and organizational behavior. Proposed Framework: The proposed organizing framework of educational leaders’ emotions in decision making includes four core propositions: (1) decisions are the outcomes of the interactions between emotions and cognition; (2) at the moment of decision making, emotions have a pervasive, predictable impact on decision making; (3) before making decisions, leaders’ individual differences (e.g., trait affect and power) and organizational contexts (e.g., organizational justice and emotional contagion) have a bearing on leaders’ emotions and decision making; and (4) postdecision behavioral responses trigger more emotions (e.g., regret, guilt, and shame) which, in turn, influence the next cycle of decision-making process. Implications: The proposed framework calls for not only an intensified scholarly inquiry into educational leaders’ emotions and decision making but also an adequate training on emotions in school leadership preparation programs and professional development.",

      "title": "Motivational interviewing: Reduce student reluctance and increase engagement in learning multicultural concepts.",
      "abstract": "Many professionals in clinical disciplines are struggling with how to effectively train students in multiculturalism and recognize the need for new teaching methodologies. One hindrance some instructors may face in adhering to the American Psychological Association’s (APA) multicultural guidelines (2003) to infuse diversity concepts throughout psychology training curricula is that they may not feel expert enough to do so. Perhaps even more daunting are mandated multicultural courses, which can be the most challenging of graduate training courses, as they require a balance of intellectual and emotional processing (Daly, 2005). From a student perspective, there is often significant apprehension and reluctance to train multiculturally, as well as student minimization of course material and instructor expertise. One approach in addressing such reluctance is motivational interviewing (MI), an empirically supported intervention that works best when a person is reluctant to or ambivalent about attitudinal and behavior change. Certain MI processes and strategies help students explore reluctance and mixed feelings about diversity topics while inviting them to talk themselves into changing to be more consistent with APA multicultural guidelines (2003). We introduce MI, consistent with a Socratic teaching method, to assist student clinicians in their self-awareness and changing perspectives necessary for striving toward cultural competence. In contrast to persuasive teaching methods or simply providing multicultural materials and experiences, MI focuses on students’ internal motivations to be receptive to and actively engage with the material. We present a graduate level diversity course as a basis to illustrate how the MI approach might be applied to other courses, as instructors work to infuse diversity throughout the curriculum.",

Educational Objectives Overview We tend to be delighted, surprised, or puzzled by coincidences that happen to us (but not so much to others, which we tend to explain as merely a coincidence). The series of articles on the experience of reacting to coincidences provides a different window into how our brains and minds work. Perhaps when explanatory models about weird coincidence experiences become dysregulated, psychopathology (eg, paranoia) can result. Note that in the Beitman article, the story about John Snow finding that the Broad Street pump was the cause of a cholera outbreak, although quite interesting, may not be as true as most might think. By mapping the outbreak, Dr. Snow identified the pump as the cause of cholera. He removed the pump, and the cholera epidemic diminished. But as detailed by Tufte, the rate of cholera was decreasing before the water pump was removed, which is a good example of finding a relationship where one did not necessarily exist.

In this condition member participation not only decreases, but also evades and challenges as a sign of lacking or ineffective leadership.

The grievers may cite challenges connecting with others but not be so isolated that they cannot identify a significant other who could join them in exercise. The technique may be less effective for relationships that are high in conflict or circumstances where significant others are critical, provide negative social support or exhibit personality traits that hinder adaptive communication. Low social support has been associated with prolonged grief in numerous studies. Disconnection from others can leave a griever feeling as if the author's life does not matter. Therefore, identifying ways to enhance support and to foster meaningful relationships is crucial to adaptation. Supportive relationships offer opportunities to process emotions and make meaning of the loss; they are often a source of meaning in and of themselves.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents four case studies that demonstrate the use of different management strategies to decrease or eliminate the undesirable behaviors of clients in a prevocational training program. The presentations and discussions focus upon the simultaneous pursuit of skill training and behavior management rather than working towards these two objectives sequentially, e.g., first behavior management and then skill training. The rationale for this approach is that discouraging inappropriate behaviors should be accompanied by procedures that encourage appropriate ones. In the prevocational program, appropriate behavior was defined as correct responses to specific training tasks. The four cases include such problem behaviors as excessive out-of-seat and running behaviors, incessant and irrelevant verbal behavior, screaming and shrieking, excessive hysterial laughing, refusal to work, self-biting, self-pinching, violent tantruming, and noncompliance. The tactics that were employed to control, decrease, and/or eliminate these behaviors include shaping, differential reinforcement of other behaviors, ignoring, timeout, and negative reinforcement. In all cases, the management strategies were in effect while new skills were trained. The clients received positive reinforcers for appropriate task responses while being discouraged from responding inappropriately.",

      "title": "How Social Psychological Factors May Modulate Auditory and Cognitive Functioning During Listening",
      "abstract": "The framework for understanding effortful listening (FUEL) draws on psychological theories of cognition and motivation. In the present article, theories of social-cognitive psychology are related to the FUEL. Listening effort is defined in our consensus as the deliberate allocation of mental resources to overcome obstacles in goal pursuit when carrying out a task that involves listening. Listening effort depends not only on hearing difficulties and task demands but also on the listener’s motivation to expend mental effort in challenging situations. Listeners’ cost/benefit evaluations involve appraisals of listening demands, their own capacity, and the importance of listening goals. Social psychological factors can affect a listener’s actual and self-perceived auditory and cognitive abilities, especially when those abilities may be insufficient to readily meet listening demands. Whether or not listeners experience stress depends not only on how demanding a situation is relative to their actual abilities but also on how they appraise their capacity to meet those demands. The self-perception or appraisal of one’s abilities can be lowered by poor self-efficacy or negative stereotypes. Stress may affect performance in a given situation and chronic stress can have deleterious effects on many aspects of health, including auditory and cognitive functioning. Social support can offset demands and mitigate stress; however, the burden of providing support may stress the significant other. Some listeners cope by avoiding challenging situations and withdrawing from social participation. Extending the FUEL using social-cognitive psychological theories may provide valuable insights into how effortful listening could be reduced by adopting health-promoting approaches to rehabilitation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The author, a longtime executive in Fortune 500 companies and nonprofits, and now a C‐suite coach and business ethics attorney, examines how to deliver bad news within organizations. She presents six steps, each illustrated with a real‐life example. The steps are, in her words, 1. Psychologically Prepare Your Audience 2. Rehearse Confident Delivery. 3. Be fully present and fully focused. 4. Convey benevolent, proactive intent. 5. Explain without justifying. 6. Add a sense of urgency. She poses three questions in Step 1: “What is the impact? How can the damage be contained? What needs to change?” Within Step 2, “practicing has been shown to 1) bolster your credibility with influential people and 2) alleviate the substantial emotional distress often associated with leadership roles.” Within Step 3, “When delivering bad news, pay attention to the method of delivery. Face‐to‐face in‐person is best, followed by videoconference, and third, by telephone.” In Step 4, “Counter negative assumptions by outlining next steps and proactive measures, while genuine empathy underscores your role as a trusted advisor.” In Step 5, “Present the facts to ensure they have a comprehensive understanding of the situation.” And in Step 6, “Sustaining urgency involves diligent follow‐up, reinforcing the successful measures taken earlier.”",

      "abstract": "In 6 studies, the authors tested whether the effect of mood on self-control success depends on a person's accessible goal. We propose that positive mood signals a person to adopt an accessible goal, whereas negative mood signals a person to reject an accessible goal; therefore, if a self-improvement goal is accessible, happy (vs. neutral or unhappy) people perform better on self-control tasks that further that goal. Conversely, if a mood management goal is accessible, happy people abstain from self-control tasks because the tasks are incompatible with this goal. This pattern receives consistent support across several self-control tasks, including donating to charity, demonstrating physical endurance, seeking negative feedback, and completing tests.",

      "title": "An Investigation of Basic Psychological Needs Satisfaction and Its Basic Components: A Literature Review",
      "abstract": "Basic psychological needs satisfaction is closely related to self-determination theory, which is associated with desires that influence motivation and individuals’ actions. According to self-determination theory, when individuals have both extrinsically motivated and intrinsically motivated motivation while pursuing a task, positive outcomes such as task continuation and subjective well-being occur. Within the framework of self-determination theory, individuals’ motivating needs may be thought of as their psychological nourishment, and the perception of being able to do things and meet their needs in their personal space may be highlighted. Among the basic elements of basic psychological needs satisfaction, autonomy, competence, relatedness, and the potential for life satisfaction related to these three components may be counted. Competence is associated with individuals’ effectiveness in interacting with the environment and their sense of control in being able to accomplish tasks (such as completing a project assignment). Autonomy, on the other hand, is related to the individuals’ ability to regulate their actions voluntarily. Relatedness with others, which is another component of basic psychological needs satisfaction, may arise from individuals’ desire to be in relationships characterized by mutual respect, trust, and emotional connections with others. When looking at the elements associated with basic psychological needs satisfaction in the literature, “Maslow's hierarchy of needs,” “Psychological well-being,” “Disasters,” and “Various motivational sources” may be seen. Considering the elements associated with basic psychological needs satisfaction, it is suggested that activities may be organized on how to benefit from that. For example, an activity may be organized to develop awareness of the components of autonomy, competence, and interpersonal relationships involved in satisfying basic psychological needs.",

      "abstract": "The article raises the issue of developing a psychologist in the sphere of education. Emphasis is made on social and psychological conditions promoting the professional sensitivity of a psychologist, which determine the efficiency of their performance. This property is the level of sensitivity which allows detecting the subtlest indicators of a mental phenomenon. The structure of professional sensitivity is assumed to comprise four components: sensory properties (all types of sensitivity – from visual and auditory to olfactory); mnemic properties (memory capacity, speed of memorizing, durability of memorizing, accuracy and speed of reproducing, ability for immediate reproduction at a certain moment); imaginative properties depending on the individual characteristics of imagination; and attention properties (selectivity, volume, steadiness, abilities to distribute and switch attention). Professional sensitivity is not static; it develops and its structure improves with professional advancement. The research showed that a training of sensitivity for psychologists in educational sphere sets conditions for forming higher levels of selectivity, concentration and switching of attention; for development of empathy, communicability, emotional stability, sensitivity, independence, and self-control. The research topicality is due to developing professional sensitivity necessary to fulfill the professional requirements to a psychologist in the sphere of education.",

To meet these problems, the teacher make use of certain strategies, e.g., adding his/her own comments that often seize upon the gratifying content of the assessment, or involving the pupil to engage in a \"sidetrack\" of an everyday character.

      "title": "Careful or Reckless? A Configural Approach to Understanding Proactivity Process and Its Mechanism",
      "abstract": "Despite considerable evidence of the bright side of employee proactivity, a growing body of evidence highlights that proactivity can be counterproductive. Previous research on the effectiveness of proactivity focused only on the influence of overt behavioural element of proactivity but neglected the influence of covert behavioural elements and the synergistic effect of all elements in a proactive process. In fact, proactivity is a process including not only overt element (i.e., enacting), but also covert elements (i.e., envisioning, planning, reflecting). Different combinations of these four elements could form different types of proactivity process, which could lead to positive or negative outcomes. So, we adopt a person-centered approach to identity what types of proactivity process can produce effective or detrimental outcomes, and further explore how these types of proactivity process influence employees’ job performance and co-worker interpersonal conflict. By using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), we identify three important types of proactivity process: (1) deliberate proactivity process (high envisioning, high planning, high enacting and high reflecting) is sufficient for high job performance and low co-worker interpersonal conflict; (2) careless proactivity process (low envisioning, low planning and low reflecting) is sufficient for low job performance and high co-worker interpersonal conflict; (3) idealistic proactivity process (high envisioning, high envisioning, low enacting, and high reflecting) is sufficient for low co-worker interpersonal conflict. Further, by combining fsQCA and mediation analysis, we further find two mediation mechanisms between deliberate/careless proactivity process and outcomes: employees’ ambiguity and employees’ impression management motive perceived by co-workers. We contribute to proactivity literature by providing a configural perspective to explain the inconsistent effects of employees’ proactivity on their performance and interpersonal outcome, and advance our understanding about such proactivity configurations by further exploring different mechanisms by which they affect actors and their environments.",

      "title": "Managing Client Relations: The Case of Peter Vosek",
      "abstract": "CASE DESCRIPTION The primary subject matter of this role play case is the interpersonal skills needed to handle a difficult client situation involving power and trust. Since difficult situations often stem from people having different goals, different approaches, and/or different personal styles, diagnosing and attending to these differences are fundamental to resolving both the interpersonal and task-related issues. Resolving difficult situations and retaining the relationship often requires planful dialogue - communications that: (1) are open to and respectful of the others' point of view,(2) treat others' as equals in the situation, and (3) seek to understand the others' views and the assumptions underlying those views. The role play case has a difficulty of five (graduate). It is designed to be used within 50-80 minutes. No outside preparation is necessary. ROLE PLAY CASE SYNOPSIS The Vosek Case and roles for a role play (totaling 4 pages) present the same management consulting engagement from different perspectives. Peter, the officer in charge (OIC) of the engagement, and Joan, the job manager for one of the five teams on the project, relate their perceptions of the different stakeholders involved in this project and the challenges of managing these stakeholders. CRC (a top tier international management consulting firm) is hired by a chemical manufacturer to lead a large service implementation project. Early in the project, Peter's counterpart on the project, the Corporate Manager of Service, is replaced. Peter finds it difficult to maintain a good working relationship with his new counterpart, Senal Dhola. His project is falling behind schedule, and he finds himself in a situation in which he has little access to the top management team of the company. We see Peter pondering how to turn the engagement around and prepare an effective, mid-engagement presentation for the top management group. Joan Charoen is the job manager (senior associate) for the information technology (IT) team on the project. Joan has created a collaborative environment for her team, which is composed of both CRC consulting staff and managers from the chemical company. Joan believes the senior members of the consulting team need to actively strategize ways to gain buy-in for the project from the company's top management. INSTRUCTORS' NOTES The context for these cases is a large consulting engagement with a major multinational client. This engagement lasted more than a year and involved 25-30 consultants. The case reflects actual events, although disguised. The project billed over $6 million dollars in its first year. Resources that might be of use to both the instructor and students include David Maister' s books on running aprofessional services firm (1993), on being a consultant (1997), and on becoming a trusted advisor (Maister, Green, & Galford, 2000). His web site is very rich and user-friendly. O'Shea and Madigan (1997) share their observations on the dark side of consulting something of which the CEO, Shawn Walsh, seems aware. Fombrun and Nevins (2004) have edited a useful resource book on consulting, involving many of this industries best writers and researchers. Williams (2001, 2004) explores the issues of trust in professional service relationships. Stumpf (1999) addresses the career progression for consultants - something on the mind of Joan Charoen. Stumpf and Longman (2000) discuss the key skills and approaches to management consulting. Stumpf, Doh, & Clark (2002) explore the structure and work processes of management consulting. Teaching Objectives The combined case and role play activities have four objectives. The first is to have all students learn how to look at an engagement from multiple perspectives - their 'personal' perspective, that of their officer in charge (OIC), that of their consulting company (CRC), and that of the client leadership. …",

Individuals can focus on developing social competence (social development goals), or demonstrating it (demonstrating superior ability in case of demonstration-approach goals and concealing inferior ability in case of demonstration-avoid goals). By serving as an overarching interpretive framework, social achievement goals have important implications for individuals' social, psychological, and academic adjustment. Social development goals relate to healthy social relationships, psychological adjustment, and adaptive patterns of classroom behaviors. In contrast, social demonstration-avoid goals relate to maladaptive psychological outcomes and avoidant behaviors. Social demonstration-approach goals are associated with social competence and popularity but also with aggression. Several mechanisms of the goal effects are identified. Further research should examine the personal and contextual antecedents of goal adoption and the moderators of goal effect to better inform intervention.",

In all these modalities, the focusing phenomena occur at many levels of discourse.

In conversation, comments such as “Stick to the subject …”, “Going back to what you were saying before ‥”, or “Let's change the subject …” all indicate that people are aware that the conversation centers on specific ideas and that there are conventions for changing the focus of attention.",

Experiment 2 focuses on unless and suggests that errors arise mainly from recoding operations, whereas speed of response is determined by the clause order used for the instruction. Experiment 3 introduces prohibitions (‘Do not do X’). These impair performance with if and if not but facilitate performance with unless. This is consistent with readers representing unless in action plans as ‘Do not if, the reader‐generated representation of the negative action being cancelled by the explicit prohibition in the instruction. The practical implications of these findings are pointed out.",

      "title": "Ten Common Blocks to Clear Thinking with General Semantics Correctives",
      "abstract": "To find out how important clear thinking was general public, noted self-help author and GS expert Kenneth Keyes, Jr. conducted a nationwide survey in America. (1) The survey consisted of two questions: 1. Which of following would you most hate have people say about you? a. You do not win friends easily. b. You cannot think clearly. c. You have trouble influencing people. d. One day your pants fell down when your arms were loaded with packages. 2. Why did you make that choice? A vast majority of survey's respondents (72.5%) thought was most important be known as a clear thinker. Here are some of reasons they gave: * Men prefer women who are reasonable in meeting problems of everyday life. * Women prefer men who demonstrate excellent thinking ability. * Men and women who think clearly can achieve greater popularity. They are looked up their ideas are considered worth listening to; they are invited analyze ideas and plans of other people. * The ability think clearly and maturely is an important step in avoidance of worry and unhappiness ... and achievement of peace of mind. Clear thinking (the ability ascertain and respond what is actually going on in situations) is clearly a useful attribute. To become better at it, this article offers a number of practical GS strategies and techniques. They are presented in context of overcoming ten common blocks clear thinking. Allness Attitudes. (2) --I know all about that. --If you've known one Arab, Jew, Black, Hispanic, etc., you've known them --Let me tell you all about what is going on in Middle East. No one can know all about anything. That statement may seem obvious, but everyday people say or imply that they do know all. Individuals who speak in this manner are demonstrating allness attitudes. They think they know what is impossible know--everything about a particular topic. It is hard talk with people who claim know everything. They resist any new information you bring a discussion, so why bother trying have one. Individuals with allness attitudes do not want exchange ideas and opinions. They want pontificate. Allness attitudes are quite common and relatively easy spot in others, but detecting them in ourselves is a tougher proposition. More difficult still is coming up with ideas keep us flexible and away from allness attitudes. Fortunately, such ideas can be had through GS. Alfred Korzybski (the founder of GS) famously said map is not With respect language that can be expressed this way: what we say or think about things, verbal maps, does not cover all there is know about them, the territory. Science supports this idea and notion we can't know all about world or anything in it. The fact is our mental maps are always incomplete. Indexing, a GS concept that involves examining individual cases within a larger category is another useful tactic in overcoming allness attitudes. For example, John says, I hate sports. But sports, in way John is using it, is a very broad term. If we examine more closely we see, spor[t.sub.1] (tennis) is not spor[t.sub.2] (bowling), is not spor[t.sub.3] (chess), etc. Has John tried all sports? Highly unlikely! Indexing items can assist us find differences that might make a difference. Locating differences is particularly beneficial combat allness attitude known as stereotyping.We stereotype adolescents when we say, Teenagers are rude. But teenager1 is not teenager, is not teenage[r.sub.3], etc. Every teenager is a unique individual with his or her own behavior pattern. Indexing teenagers can help show that case. Employing qualifying terms like to me, I think, and it seems, when making statements, is one more GS approach for defeating allness attitudes. …",

      "abstract": "Education is a human right, but some youngsters still drop out of school. One reason for that might be student's teacher-perceived inappropriate or even \"wrong\" temperament (i.e., individual's innate way to approach and react to the environment) for school environment. There is a lot of evidence that the school grades are mostly based on teacher-perceived ratings rather than standardized tests. Temperament can be seen as a non-academic aspect of educational process, but it strongly influences academic outcomes. Final marks will direct (through universities or lack of education) one's place in the labour market, and people's general well-being with the subjective perceptions of happiness and self-esteem. The aim of this research has been to develop the field: temperament can't be the reason of (good or bad) grades. Humanistic teachers of 21st century should have better knowledge's in psychology, especially in the context of temperament. To integrate temperament-conscious pedagogy (i.e., the acceptance of temperamental background of the behaviour as a part of teachers' didactical, pedagogical and practical knowledge) in regular teacher training it might be possible to identify potential difficulties in educational pathways and prevent social exclusion. The aim of this article is to analyze conceptual similarities between humanistic education, social pedagogy and temperament-conscious teaching—to show their significant joint part.

Es una situación que representa un reto parala persona que lo enfrenta porque no ve una solución inmediata. Retomando las palabrasde George Pólya, problema significa “buscar concretamente una acción para lograr unameta claramente concebida pero no inmediata de alcanzar.” La capacidad intelectual delser humano le permite ser analítico. Esto quiere decir que toda situación que se vive, pormás trivial que parezca, es un pequeño problema que se analiza para hallar una solución,tomar una decisión. Estos problemas se resuelven sin pasar por toda la angustia queacompaña la resolución de problemas en la matemática. ¿Por qué la diferencia?Una situación problemática deja de ser problema si la persona no está interesada enresolverlo. La falta de interés puede estar motivada por alguno de los siguientes aspectos:el tema no es llamativo, no se entiende el problema, no se tienen las herramientas paraescoger la estrategia adecuada para resolverlo, no se tienen los conocimientos necesariospara determinar la solución. Nosotros, los profesores de matemáticas, tenemos laoportunidad de retar la curiosidad de nuestros alumnos, proporcionándoles problemas asu nivel, además de las ayudas y métodos para que puedan resolverlossatisfactoriamente.El Profesor George Pólya, un estudioso de la heurística, el estudio de los métodos yreglas del descubrimiento y la invención, proporciona un método que puede ser usadopara la resolución, no sólo de problemas de índole matemático, sino de cualquier tipo deproblema.

      "title": "Exploring Incubation Effects on Insight Problem-Solving with Computer]based Tasks",
      "abstract": "IntroductionWhen students are confronted with an initial failure while trying to solve a problem, they may repeat their ineffective problem-solving approach again and again in vain. In this situation, a student may feel frustrated and see no alternative way to approach the solution. At this point, the student may continue to work on the problem or may decide to stop for a while and return to it later. The present study examines how students who are trying to solve problems in a computer-supported problem-solving environment may benefit from temporarily turning away from the problem at hand by focusing on another task before returning to the problem. Moreover, engaging in the intervening activity may contribute to the student's final resolution of the problem; this phenomenon is known as 'incubation'. Wallas (1926) introduced incubation as a crucial stage for a creative resolution to a problem. He suggested that the insightful moment of finding a solution comes about unexpectedly when a problem solver turns away from the problem and engages in other tasks or activities. He also suggested that incubation is an unconscious process. In accordance with Wallas' definition of incubation, Finke, Ward, and Smith (1992) described the incubated situation as follows: 'a problem is set aside temporarily after an initial impasse is reached', and 'the problem can then be solved more easily when attention is returned to it, or a solution may suddenly burst into the problem solver's awareness even without intentionally returning to the problem' (p. 149).Psychologists have attempted to demystify the incubation phenomenon by explaining it in relation to memory processes (e.g., Sio & Ormerod, 2009; Smith & Blankenship, 1989, 1991; Smith, Ward, & Finke, 1995; Weisberg & Alba, 1981; Yaniv & Meyer, 1987). It has been argued that focusing on a new task rather than continuously and consciously working on the problem at hand helps the problem solver retrieve the crucial target information for the problem's solution. While taking a break or becoming involved in another irrelevant task, the problem solver may continue to search consciously or subconsciously through his or her mental knowledge network for the relevant information needed to solve the problem.Thus, this period of alternative mental activity helps the problem solver gain insight into the solution. However, until recently, it was not easy to gather information on incubation activities during students' problemsolving processes. Computer-supported problem-solving environments have the potential to promote creative problem-solving skills through automated strategies and management functionalities related to the incubation moment when assessing a student's performance.Experimental research on incubationExisting empirical findings on incubation effects appear to contradict one another, making it difficult to draw general conclusions about the role of an incubation period in problem solving. Some studies have reported no effect or limited effects resulting from incubation sessions (e.g., Goldman, Wolters, & Winograd, 1992; Sio & Ormerod, 2009; Olton & Johnson, 1976; Vul & Pashler, 2007). Others have provided empirical evidence of incubation effects (e.g., Kaplan, 1989; Smith & Blankenship, 1989, 1991; Kohn, 2005; Sio & Ormerod, 2015). However, those studies have limits in identifying the effect of incubation on problem solving by including only a single type of problem to be solved (such as anagrams, rebuses, or dot problems). Sio and Ormerod identified in their meta-analytic the problem type and the incubation task as the modifiers of incubation effects. Also they argued that incubation effects are specific to particular tasks and performance conditions. Gilhooly and Murphy (2005) showed solving visual problems requires different types of cognitive processes from solving linguistic problems. Obviously, different types of problems may require different cognitive processes for their solution. …",

In this way, coaching can easily be conceptualized as unproblematic and made up of a sequence of fixed and supposedly known steps as opposed to being what it truly is: a dynamic, fluid and social process.

Many groups of consultants differentiate roles and responsibilities and the advice that \"it takes a group to consult to a group\" is well known. Innovation is essential for the development of professional practice. Indeed, consultants may make the assumption that because they share similar or \"mature\" work practices, many of these influences will not affect them. Given the propensity for consultants to work with others, it is surprising that so little has been written that gets to grips with the complexities of collaborative consulting. \"Making do\" with the consultant resources at hand in heroic or narcissistic efforts to meet client needs is an indicator of a poorly developed sense of competence and/or integrity.

      "title": "Stress - Impacts on Health and Human Performance",
      "abstract": "Abstract Objectives/Scope: Psychological health and well-being are recognized as essential features of global wellness programs. Psychological health includes emotional and cognitive factors which impact critical thinking and decision making skills Outside of the US, stress ranks #1 or 2 as the top health risk driving wellness strategies. Excessive stress increases risk for cardiovascular disease and other health conditions. Beyond its impact on health, acute or chronic stress can impair cognitive functioning and human performance with consequences for safety, especially in operations characterized as having potentially high risks. Further, excessive stress is often accompanied by lack of sleep and rest, with resulting fatigue and on-the job distractibility. Physical and psychological well-being has been identified as a focus area for understanding human performance. Human performance efforts focus on proactively reducing human failure and its outcomes by improving the interaction between the individuals and critical systems, individual recognition of error-likely situations and applying tools to reduce error. Individual factors like fatigue, stress and distraction - factors that every worker is vulnerable to, given personal circumstances, worries and life events - are known error traps, influencing interactions within work groups and critical systems. Methods, Procedures, Process: This retrospective study examines cases that demonstrate how work-related and personal stress can impact both health and human performance. We also describe steps that business unit leaders have taken to begin to create an environment where workers feel empowered to admit they need time to address personal health factors. Results, Observations, Conclusions: Data on well-being and engagement provide aggregate information about enablers of productivity across the enterprise. Aggregate data from employee surveys, employee assistance programs, and health risk appraisals indicate that perceived stress varies across the organization, with opportunities for targeted focus on stress in some groups. Despite the intuitive recognition of the importance of physical and psychological well-being to health and safety, factors like stress are seldom directly accounted for in preparing JSA's and are difficult to identify as contributing factors to a health or safety incident. We recognize in this paper that off-the-job crises are happening to the safety-sensitive and non-safety- sensitive workforce every day, likely resulting in preoccupations and distractibility. On occasion, catastrophic accidents draw attention to specific health areas,(i.e., BP Texas City and fatigue) after which strong measures to identify similar risks to safety are activated, however these measures are reactive and are focused on the specific health behavior and not the more common but harder to perceive stressors that threaten safety and productivity. Novel/Additive Information: Tools for supporting the workforce around stress are highlighted, including information about confidential resources for resolution of issues. This paper highlights the role of physical and psychological well-being in influencing workforce health and safety, and provides insights into proactive measures that can influence human performance.",

Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk menganalisis kondisi motivasi kerja pada prajurit yang berusia menjelang pensiun di Kodim 0807/Tulungungung, dengan metode kualitatif. Dari hasil wawancara dan observasi diperoleh gambaran bahwa ketiga permasalahan diatas benar-benar terjadi pada sebagian kecil prajurit yang dilatar belakangi oleh kondisi motivasi kerja yang beragam. Bagi mereka yang tidak mampu menekan rasa cemasnya, cenderung motivasi kerjanya rendah. Dengan demikian, dapat disimpulkan bahwa kemampuan menyikapi rasa cemas dalam menghadapi masa pensiun turut andil memengaruhi tingkat motivasi sehingga unsur pimpinan perlu melakukan berbagai terobosan untuk membantu menyiapkan masa pensiun prajurit agar supaya motivasi kerjanya dapat tetap tinggi dan terjaga.

This raises several motivation problems, first, trying to move to a unit that close to his hometown; second, tends to rule out official duties to be free to seek additional work outside the office; and third, on retirement are refuse to move out from official resident because not owning their own home yet. The purpose of this research was to analyze the condition of work motivation in retirement age soldiers in Kodim 0807Tulungungung, by using qualitative method. Based on interviews and observations obtained a description that the three problems above really happens in a minority of soldiers are motivated by diverse conditions of work motivation. For those who are not able to suppress a sense of anxiety, tend to lower his motivation. Thus, it can be concluded that the ability to address anxiety in the face of retirement contributed affect motivation levels, therefore their leader need to undertake various initiatives to help they to prepare the retirement in order to make their work motivation keep in high level.

      "abstract": "Background The cognitive pathways that lead to an accurate diagnosis and efficient management plan can touch on various clinical reasoning tasks (1). These tasks can be employed at any point during the clinical reasoning process and though the four distinct categories of framing, diagnosis, management, and reflection provide some insight into how these tasks map onto clinical reasoning, much is still unknown about the task-based clinical reasoning process. For example, when and how are these tasks typically used? And more importantly, do these clinical reasoning task processes evolve when patient encounters become complex and/or challenging (i.e. with contextual factors)? Methods We examine these questions through the lens of situated cognition, context specificity, and cognitive load theory. Sixty think-aloud transcripts from 30 physicians who participated in two separate cases - one with a contextual factor and one without - were coded for 26 clinical reasoning tasks (1). These tasks were organized temporally, i.e. when they emerged in their think-aloud process. Frequencies of each of the 26 tasks were aggregated, categorized, and visualized in order to analyze task category sequences. Results We found that (a) as expected, clinical tasks follow a general sequence, (b) contextual factors can distort this emerging sequence, and (c) the presence of contextual factors prompts more experienced physicians to clinically reason similar to that of less experienced physicians. Conclusions These findings add to the existing literature on context specificity in clinical reasoning and can be used to strengthen teaching and assessment of clinical reasoning.",

Through literature retrieval and analysis, the phenomenon and effects of Fear of Missing Out (FoMO) on social media will be explained in this study. The effects are separated into direct effects and indirect effects. The results show that mental health (anxiety, depression) and emotions (boredom, loneliness, and feelings of pressure/fear of exclusion) are affected directly, whereas perception (self-esteem, rumination, and mindful attention) and lifestyle (daily life, working, and learning) are affected indirectly. The results show that there is a higher likelihood that someone's mental health, emotions, and way of life may suffer as a result of having a higher level of FoMO. However, a special case of emotion, boredom, can be both positively and negatively influenced. After that, the possible courses of action will be listed, in terms of helping people who suffer from FoMO.",

All serious sport participants must engage in goal-directed behaviors in the relative absence of immediate external constraints (i.e., self-regulation). Psychologists have developed theoretical models of self-regulation and produced principles of self-regulation that are summarized by the models. These concepts apply directly to sport performance. The purpose of this paper is to review the most relevant concepts in self-regulation and show how they impact on sport psychology. Several studies are reviewed which have used self-regulatory concepts to help both elite and ordinary athletes improve their performance. For example, the research indicates that when performance is difficult (e.g., at low and moderate skill levels), performance can be improved by keeping track of successes while performing or while viewing videotapes of one's own performance. Keeping track of instances of inadequate performance may prove detrimental except if the tasks being monitored are extremely easy or routine. How to apply this principle and others to sport performance is discussed.",

      "title": "A Perceived Zone of Certainty and Uncertainty: Propositions for Research Development",
      "abstract": "Possessing expert schemas is a positive feat that may yield different types of adaptive outcomes (e.g., informing procedural understanding that may result in a student skipping a few of the solution steps involved). Limited schemas, in contrast, may deter progress of a novice learner, limiting his/her capability to flourish. Taken as a whole, it may be concluded that expert schemas are more advantageous than novice schemas, differentiating learners in terms of expert and novice. Having said this, however, more recently, researchers have argued that possessing expert schemas could serve as deterrence. Recently, researchers have acknowledged a theoretical concept known as cognitive entrenchment , which is defined as a high level of stability in domain schemas. This description interestingly suggests that “entrenchment” or “situated fixation” of a course of action (e.g., a subject matter) could hinder the progress and learning experience of a person, namely—his/her inability and/or unwillingness to adapt to a new context, and/or his/her inflexibility and insistence to stay on course without any intent to change. One example of cognitive entrenchment is observed in professional football, wherein it has been argued that some football coaches are cognitively entrenched within their expert schemas, resulting in their demised game plans and strategic acumen. We advance the study of cognitive entrenchment by proposing an alternative viewpoint, which we term as the “perceived zone of certainty and uncertainty.” This proposition counters the perspective of cognitive entrenchment by arguing that it is cognitive appraisal, judgment, mental resolute, and determination of a person in cognitive certainty of his/her success or failure, or the cognitive uncertainty of success or failure, that would explain the notion of inflexibility and/or unwillingness to adapt, and/or insistence to stay on course without any attempt to deviate. Moreover, we rationalize that certainty of success or failure would closely associate with a feeling of comfort, whereas uncertainty would associate with his/her feeling discomfort. In this analysis, we strongly believe that willingness to change and adapt, reluctance and insistence to remain on course, and/or inclination to embrace flexibility may not necessarily relate to the concept of cognitive entrenchment; rather, inflexibility and/or reluctance to change for the purpose of adaptation has more to do with the desire of a person to seek a state of comfort. Finally, our conceptual analysis of cognitive entrenchment also considers an interesting theoretical concept, which we termed as “perceived optimal efficiency.” Perceived optimal efficiency, similar to cognitive relevance theory , is concerned with the relationship between minimum investment of time, effort, cognitive resources, etc., and an optimal best outcome. The issue for discussion, from our point of view, is related to the extent to which the certainty of success or failure would associate with perceived optimal efficiency.",

      "title": "CONGITIVE MOTIVATION IN LEARNING",
      "abstract": "The problem of motivation has often been ignored in laboratory studies on human learning. This might be because i) a set of instructions works as a procedure producing quasi-motivation, ii) the effect of motivation can be neglected when E controls Ss' learning activities, and iii) knowledge of results is sufficient to reinforce Ss' responses. But as in classroom learning, where a learner can seek information outside of E's control or has to deal selectively with relevant information, motivation should be considered. On the other hand, traditional motivating procedures used in the classroom have extrinsic in nature, i. e., publicizing performance or letting pupils compete with each other. The concept of intrinsic motivation instigating and rewarding learning without depending on factors other than learning processes themselves has been promoted recently. This symposium was conducted in order to clarify the present state of and future research on cognitive motivation or curiosity, which is “almost a prototype of the intrinsic motive” (Bruner).Inagaki hypothesized two mechanisms of cognitive motivation: diversive curiosity maintaining an optimal level of information processing and speciE curiosity reducing cognitive incongruity or dissonance. She has been concerned with the learning aroused by specific curiosity. She asserted that the following three characteristic behavioral events were observed: i) cognitive curiosity was aroused by incongruity-producing information and this made pupils interested in getting further information, ii) actual information gathering behavior, such as writing a postcard asking questions, was elicited, and iii) one and the same unit or block of information was more effectively acquired, and generalized when it functioned to reduce incongruity than when it didnot.Itakura postulated that scientific knowledge i) can be acquired only by experiments, and ii) is a kind of social knowledge. These basic principles imply that science education can be effective only when each pupil has an intention to explore a certain phenomenon and to share knowledge. He and his co-workers have developed a method of science education called kasetsujikken- jigyo (hypothesis-experiment-instruction). Instead of textbooks and notebooks, pupils and teachers are given “instruction papers” containing problems of appropriate intellectual interest and difficulty, whose correct answers may be demonstrated clearly. Usually a problem has 3 or 4 alternative solutions, each representing a discrete hypothesis. Each pupil must choose an alternative. The teacher surveys the distribution of answers, summarizing it into a table. Some pupils are asked to explain their ground of anticipations. Then the teacher encourages discussion among pupils differing in their anticipations, but no one is forced to speak. Ideally, during the discussion, the child becomes concerned with the underlying process, while retaining his interest in the outcome -that is, he wants to know “why” as well as “what”. Finally, the teacher-conducts the experiment, conclusively demonstratingt he correct solution. Itakura asserted that difficult problems, not amenable to solution by mere common sense, should be presented in the first part, and easy ones requiring application of knowledge later.",

      "title": "Combating Speech Anxiety",
      "abstract": "Combating anxiety If you experience stage fright before speaking in public, you are not alone. Studies that many people fear public speaking. Whether you call it stage fright or speech anxiety, as many professional speakers do, it is a common concern and can be dealt with. The first step is realizing that the reaction has physiological and psychological origins. Once you put it in perspective, you can take steps to reduce your anxiety (or that of a client) about speaking in public. Why we fear There are several factors that can contribute to developing a fear of public speaking. Childhood experience is one. Many people can remember a particular moment that contributed to their fear. Perhaps other students laughed during show and period in elementary school. The tendency is to forget why they laughed, and perceive this seemingly negative audience reaction as rejection or dislike. The next time an individual gets to talk, he or she feels uneasy about speaking in fron of peers. This uneasy feeling can be compounded when a person is put the spot in a class, or in a social or professional situation. On a professional level when people speak, they often put stress on themselves to perform well and not goof up in front of a client or a supervisor. What started out as a minor episode when someone was an impressionable child mushrooms into a situation that produces tension and anxiety attacks. In addition, many people feel embarrassed because they think other business professionals don't share their fears. This is not the case. study by R.H. Bruskin Associates, a New Jersey-based research firm, reported that among adults surveyed in 1973, 40.6% picked public speaking as their number one fear. No other fear received that many first-place votes. The 1977 Book of Lists surveyed 3,000 people about fears, and 41% named speaking before a group as their greatest fear. This topped other fears like heights (32%), insects and bugs (22%) and death (19%). Few people communicate well when they are afraid or under stress. Once you understand the anxiety reaction, the next step is to take a more relaxed approach to public speaking. Fight or When people open and discuss their feelings, they are usually clear about why they are so upset. Statements such as: All eyes are on me and their staring makes me feel funny, or feel completely vulnerable before the audience and I begin to feel light-headed or My body begins to tense up are common. These physical responses are instinctive reactions that have been labeled the or flight response. In a stressful situation, extra adrenaline is released: increases in blood pressure, heart rate, rate of breathing, blood flow to the muscles and metabolism take place. The body is getting ready to or take flight. hardly warrants a fight or flight, but it is hard to tell our bodies not to respond that way. It's true that when you're speaking in public, all eyes are on you, but it is wrong to think of and react to the audience as the problem or the enemy. You can do several things before and during a to interrupt the fight or response. Exercise is one antidote to stress and depression. It reduces extra adrenaline the body builds which often comes into play in a panic. Consider a brisk walk before you begin a presentation as a means of reducing extra adrenaline. Overcoming fright Many public figures, including Sir Winston Churchill and Presidents Kennedy, Carter and Reagan, have experienced anxiety. certain amount of nervous energy that is properly focused is a good thing. Carroll O'Connor of the TV series All in the Family said this about nervous reactions: A professional actor has a kind of tension. The amateur is thrown by it but the professional needs it. …",

      "title": "Balance Control and Aging: Examining Increased Attentional Requirements",
      "abstract": "As people age, maintaining balance requires greater attentional resources due to sensorimotor changes, making stability increasingly difficult. This often leads older adults to prioritize balance over other tasks, especially when sensory input is reduced or inconsistent, increasing attentional demands. Additional tasks, such as cognitive or motor activities, can strain attentional resources and raise the risk of falls—especially critical as falls are a major cause of injury in older adults. The attentional load required for balance depends on secondary task characteristics, including complexity and sensory demands. For example, a simple motor task like holding an object while walking demands less attention than solving a puzzle while standing. High-demand visual or cognitive tasks can significantly compromise stability by diverting focus from balance. Recognizing these factors aids clinicians in tailoring rehabilitation strategies that support safe postural control. By adjusting attentional demands to each individual's needs, interventions can reduce fall risks, promote recovery, and enhance the quality of life for the elderly.",

      "title": "Having some fun with it: A theoretical review and typology of activity‐based play‐at‐work",
      "abstract": "Summary In recent decades, practitioner interest in the notion of “play” at work has generated a surge of research on the topic of play‐at‐work activities. Findings suggest that activity‐based play‐at‐work can produce an array of positive outcomes for individuals and the organization. However, there remains uncertainty about which forms of play are effective for meeting which particular objectives as past reviews have either focused on a narrow activity or treated all activities as uniform. In this paper, we draw on knowledge from the play and management literatures to review 122 studies of activity‐based play‐at‐work and its outcomes. By identifying several activity‐based play‐at‐work concepts from the literature, we apply both theoretical and data‐driven approaches to generate a two‐dimensional typology comprising four categories. These categories are manager‐initiated work‐embedded play (e.g., serious play), self‐/peer‐initiated work‐embedded play (e.g., experiencing one's work as a “game,” “puzzle,” or “sport”), manager‐initiated diversionary play (e.g., celebrations), and self‐/peer‐initiated diversionary play (e.g., joking practices). In our discussion, we unify play‐at‐work activities under an energy‐management framework and consider implications for understanding each of the four categories in our typology using both theories applied in past research and energy‐related theories from neighboring literatures.",

Differences in the characteristics of students in inclusive classes not only lie on their intellectual abilities, but also it is very possible for these students to have a special condition on communication, social skills, autonomy (living skills), and emotional control. Therefore, in teaching and learning activities, educators’ focus is not solely on academics, but special educators have to share their attention on the non academic behavior of students. Not surprisingly, the feelings or emotions felt by these special educators become varied and tend to be negative, such as annoyance, pity, confusion, sadness and etc. The method implemented was psychoeducation which focus is on lecturing and discussing. Psychoeducation exists to help educators regulate the emotions they feel. The psychoeducation that was carried out gave 52.9% of special educators an increase in emotional regulation, 17.6% decreased, and the rest had no change.",

      "abstract": "There are as least three powerful insights from recent studies of the brain that support cognitive science research findings: First, our brains learn and process two very different types of knowledge; non conscious, automated knowledge and conscious, controllable, declarative knowledge. Evidence also suggests that we believe we control our own learning by conscious choice when in fact nearly all mental operations are highly automated, including learning and problem solving; Second, human beings have a very limited capacity to think during learning and problem solving and when that capacity is exceeded, thinking and learning stop without us being aware. Thus instruction and self managed learning must strive to avoid cognitive overload; and Third, nearly all of our instructional design and cyber learning theories and models fail to account for the influence of non-conscious cognitive processes and therefore are inadequate to deal with complex learning and performance. Evidence for these points will be described and their implications for instruction and the learning of problem solving and higher order thinking skills will be discussed. Models of learning and instruction that appear to help overcome some of these biological and cognitive barriers will be described. In addition, suggestions for new research questions on interactive learning environments that take account of the three insights will also be described.",

      "title": "How Should Attentive Speaker Agents Adapt to Listener Feedback",
      "abstract": "IntroductionIn dialogue, a speaker’s communicative actions are not only shaped by her communicative intentions and her ability to express them linguistically, but importantly also by the actions and reactions of her interlocutor, which she ‐ being cooperative ‐ cannot ignore. Both dialogue partners contribute to dialogue success and collaborate on the interaction to make it as efficient as possible by responding to each other’s needs. One important mechanism for dialogue coordination iscommunicative feedbackin the form of short verbal-vocal expressions (such as ‘uh-huh’, ‘yeah’, ‘huh?’), head movements (nods, shakes, etc.), facial expressions (e.g., smiling, frowning, raising an eyebrow) and gaze. The use of feedback is prevalent in spoken interaction. Listeners often produce it concurrently to the speaker’s communicative actions and convey that they are in contact with the speaker, whether they perceive and understand what the speaker says, whether they accept, adopt or agree with the speaker’s utterance and also further attitudes towards it [1]. By providing feedback, a listener thus reveals parts of his mental state and indicates in a timely manner how the interaction is going or which attitude he has towards an utterance. On the basis of feedback, a speaker can then reason about the listener’s mental state and use this information to adapt her subsequent utterances to the listener’s needs. If, for example, the listener frowns right after the speaker mentions an object which the speaker thinks she unambiguously referred to, she can use this evidence of difficulties of understanding and clarify the reference by providing additional information. Attentive speaker agentsCurrently, artificial conversational agents (such as dialogue systems or embodied virtual agents) lack capabilities to deal with user feedback. This is one aspect why interacting with them is often cumbersome. Users are forced to communicate meta-information on the state of the conversation explicitly and adhere to strict turn-taking behaviour while doing it. And if agents can react to this information at all, they do so no sooner than in their next utterance. In previous work [2], we proposed that conversational agents should beattentive speakers, which we define as being able to (i) elicit feedback from users; (ii) detect and interpret concurrent user feedback; and (iii) respond to feedback by adapting their conversational actions to accommodate the user’s needs. Such an attentive speaker agent can determine problems as soon as they become evident and is thus able to respond immediately by adapting the still unspoken part of its current utterance. In the above mentioned work, we also presented a first approach towards conversational agents that can attend to and adapt to communicative listener feedback. The agent, which assists users in organising their weekly calendar, attributes a simple numerical model oflistener state(C,P,U,A,dU,dP2[0,1]) to the user. These values are updated when feedback signals (head gestures, simple feedback expressions, gaze) are encountered. Based on thisattributed listener state, the agent’s incremental natural language generation component then changes parameters and constraints that shape the form of the unspoken increments of the utterance. When users show difficulties understanding what the agent means, for example, redundancy is introduced by making implicit communicative effects explicit. Corpus analysisHere, we present first results from a dialogue study of human‐human interactions in the calendar domain. We analyse the semantic and pragmatic properties of listeners’ feedback signals as well as speakers’ utterances in their vicinity. Listeners’ feedback signals are annotated on multiple dimensions. We classify them according to their basic communicative function and also look for signs of uncertainty, progressiveness and attitude that are often conveyed. We use this information to reason about a listener’s mental state with respect to the utterance a feedback signal refers to. Speakers’ utterances, on the other hand, are analysed for their illocutionary force as well as for grounding status and information state of their content (e.g., is it new and possibly unexpected or already known to both interlocutors). The utterance parts succeeding listers’ feedback signals are further analysed with respect to the parts preceding them. We do this in order to find out whether new information is introduced and what role it plays; whether old information is clarified or used redundantly; whether implicit content is made explicit; etc. The insights gained from this corpus analysis will be used to inform the design of a Bayesian model of the listener that takes the speaker’s utterances, contextual factors as well as the listener’s feedback signals into account when reasoning about the attributed listeners state [3]. The analysis of feedback-succeeding utterance parts will help us identify and implement additional adaptation mechanisms and strategies for the natural language generation component of the attentive speaker agent.",

This important conversation has largely been focused on social psychology, with some active participation from cognitive psychology. Nevertheless, several other major domains of psychological science—including clinical science—have remained insulated from this discussion. The goals of this article are to (a) examine why clinical psychology and allied fields, such as counseling and school psychology, have not been central participants in the replicability conversation; (b) review concerns and recommendations that are less (or more) applicable to or appropriate for research in clinical psychology and allied fields; and (c) generate take-home messages for scholars and consumers of the literature in clinical psychology and allied fields, as well as reviewers, editors, and colleagues from other areas of psychological science.",

The degree of adherence was influenced by a large number of factors; these were connected with the guideline itself, the efforts made by the professional organisations, the organisation of care and institutional management, the individual professional, and the patient. The implementation of a guideline actually begins before and during the formulation of the guideline. Mistakes made in the preparatory phase can have a negative effect on adherence and often it may no longer be possible to correct these mistakes at a later stage.If the implementation is to be successful, numerous strategies have to be adopted along the way; for instance, the target-group has to be made aware of the guideline and be encouraged to accept it. Guideline development is not an aim in itself, but should be seen as part of a quality circle in which implementation and evaluation also play an important role.",

This review differentiates among several aspects of teacher leadership behavior that could be included in the concept of teacher control: (1) specific response to deviant behavior. (2) characteristics of the teacher's emotional relationship to the class, and (3) the teacher's structuring of the classroom (i.e., limits imposed on freedom of choice). A precise conceptualization of teacher control is offered based on the concept of boundary control from social systems theory. Research studies on teacher leadership in the classroom are examined for findings relevant to the concept of teacher control as precisely defined. A major distinction is emphasized between the concepts of teacher warmth or emotional responsiveness and teacher control.",

But a problem arises if we neglect comments or proposals of this observer. In this case you must take into account proprioception. It could also say “self-perception of thought”, “self-awareness of thought” or “thought is aware of itself in action”. Whatever terms could be used, thought should be able to perceive its own movement, be aware of its own movement and if so, at the process of problem solving (problem and research based learning) we are developing the system of thinking in an intuitive, heuristic and slow, systematical thinking.

      "title": "Intelligent Agents for Individual and Team Training Applications",
      "abstract": "Intelligent agent technology has advanced to the point where it can potentially provide a cost-effective replacement for teammates, coaches, and opponents in simulation-based training (SBT). However, the introduction of intelligent agents into training applications is not without its share of challenges given the many roles that intelligent agents can potentially play and the unique requirements of each role. For example, intelligent agents can play the role of teammates, opponents, supervisors, subordinates, coach, and mentor. The required level of intelligence depends on the functions that the agent is required to perform in these various roles. For example, agents performing as “extras” in a scene require little or no intelligence (i.e., they don’t have to be intelligent), whereas an After-Action Review (AAR) agent requires the ability to diagnose deficiencies relative to, for example, the school solution. To perform some functions, agents require an understanding of the problem domain; for others they merely need to understand their own tasks. In some cases, agents need the ability to plan. In other cases they merely need the ability to react. A pedagogical agent might need a human persona to enhance learner motivation and learner-system interaction. It is important to realize that when intelligent agents are used to replace a human, it is not necessarily the case that the functions performed by the human are mapped to a single agent; rather, for ease of authoring and maintenance, it might be entirely advantageous to employ multiple, cooperating agents to perform the functions. The implementation of these various kinds of agents for simulation-based training (SBT) can take a variety of forms that vary in their level of sophistication. For example, a pedagogical agent typically requires some reasoning facilities to diagnose student deficiencies and create a remediation plan. Such an agent can be implemented using agent modeling languages or expert system shells. At the other end of the spectrum, agents that fulfill the role of “extras” can be conveniently modeled as time-driven, message-passing entities. Similarly, superior and subordinate agents that are not key actors in a scenario can be represented as eventdriven, message-passing entities to reduce implementation costs. Depending on the training context, teammate implementations can vary from simple condition-action, messaging entities to sophisticated cognitive agents based on cognitive architectures such as ACT-R or Soar. In this paper, we provide specific examples of the use of intelligent agents for individual and team training. In particular, we present a detailed discussion of an intelligent",

The speaker takes advantage of the intersubjective process to construct a « model of his/her addressee » by producing hypotheses about his/her experience, current preoccupations, etc., i.e., about his/her affective-cognitive environment. Accordingly, mothers produce ostensive stimuli which can be identified by both partners, that is potentially likely to create a shared affective-cognitive environment. Henceforth, the mother's ostensive marks orient the infant's attention, guide the infant in processing the information presented. Ostensive marks may be expressive or impressive. The following hypotheses try to show that : the use of one or other modality of ostensive processes not only varies according to the child's stage of development but also to fluctuations in his/her state of comprehension. The results clearly demonstrate that the use o/expressive marking under difficult conditions of emission/reception, at all periods of infant development, is clear evidence of how mothers continuously adjust to the infant's processing capacity and to times of lesser availability for communication.",

      "title": "The Search for the Truth about \"Good\" Teaching",
      "abstract": "Most of us have been fortunate enough to witness a great teacher and the outstanding performance of a person who had a lasting impression on our lives. There are two questions which I believe identifies the quality of teaching and the level of performance of a teacher. The responses to these questions reveals rather clearly the belief systems of teachers and instruction: 1) How would you describe how children learn? 2) What theories of teaching would you hold in high priority? There are many different theories or interpretations of how children learn. Educational researchers will quickly admit that there is no single, one way, of explaining how learning takes place which we can teach with such confidence that all other theories are unacceptable, or wrong. Therefore, we should recognize that we should respond in probabilities about theories of learning. Some explanations are much more probable than others, but we must admit that learning is still a researchable question. When several learning theories and explanations are examined for evidence to support a theory or two, it is highly probable that the best explanation of how children learn emerges from a theory called social learning. The three basic components of this theory explain how children (and adults) learn: 1) Observing a behavioral (can be seen, heard, or read about) model, 2) The consequences, or results of the model's behavior, and 3) The internal thinking (cognitive) and feeling (affective) processes of the observer (the learner). There are three kinds of models that are observed by the learner: The real live model, e.g., parent, or teacher, or peer; the symbolic model, e.g., character in a film or on videotape; and the verbally described model, e.g., oral or written descriptions of heroes or heroines. When we examine what happens to the model's behavior, we are certain to discuss how the behavior is rewarded or punished. There appears to be more interpretive kinds of reinforcement in human behavior than direct reinforcement, e.g., giving praise, money, or trophies immediately after a successful performance. Social learning theory, supported by a large amount of research, refers to three kinds of reinforcement: Direct reinforcement. The model's behavior is followed immediately by an external reward, i.e., money, or praise. Vicarious or emotional reinforcement. The observer (learner) sits, looks, and listens, and learns. He does not have to be active doing something to learn. Since every one of us has an emotional system called the autonomic nervous system, we can have feelings of emotions of hope and fear which determine us. I am speaking of internal emotional feelings we have when we observe a model being rewarded and punished. Self reinforcement. Direct and vicarious reinforcement result from consequences delivered by the external environment. Self reinforcement, on the other hand, is centered within the individual. Individuals become capable and learn self-criticism and self-rewarding behaviors, these self-rewarding behaviors make the individual free and responsible. Animals can't self-reinforce; only humans do. The psychology of self reinforcement focuses on the internal thinking and feeling processes of the learner. This basic principle is at the heart of teaching around and bringing about higher achievement and learning in the student. Understanding human learning in the classroom is to believe that learning is both thinking, intellectual, and school achievement oriented, but also feeling, emotions, and attitude oriented. A revolutionary principle for the decade of the nineties is simply that learning is the responsibility of the student. The learner must want to learn and parents must want the learner to learn. The teacher cannot and should not cram facts and information into students' heads. Students must learn how to incorporate the thinking, feeling, and behavior of models into their own learning. …",

      "abstract": "When leaders perform solitary tasks, do they self-regulate to maximize their effort, or do they reduce effort and conserve their resources? Our model suggests that power motivates self-regulation toward effective performance-unless the task is perceived as unworthy of leaders. Our 1st studies showed that power improves self-regulation and performance, even when resources for self-regulation are low (ego depletion). Additional studies showed that leaders sometimes disdain tasks they deem unworthy, by withholding effort (and therefore performing poorly). Ironically, during ego depletion, leaders skip the appraisal and, therefore, work hard regardless of task suitability, so that depleted leaders sometimes outperform nondepleted ones. Our final studies replicated these patterns with different tasks and even with simple manipulation of framing and perception of the same task (Experiment 5). Experiment 4 also showed that the continued high exertion of leaders when depleted takes a heavy toll, resulting in larger impairments later. The judicious expenditure of self-control resources among powerful people may help them prioritize their efforts to pursue their goals effectively.",

      "abstract": "Learning depends on many internal and external conditions and it is not only a function of memory. Learning requires, above all, motivational, in other words, success in learning depends on factors that excitability and response to stimulus (involvement), the intensity of learning, availability for learning, learning awareness. Adults will be motivated in learning tasks when they perceive that the result will bring satisfaction to one or more of their basic human needs: security, acceptance, respect, power, health, status, training, discovery,achievement, self-esteem, etc. Some people are motivated by monetary reward, providing benefits and titles, recognition. These rewards are called extrinsic motivators; although they are important, but they do not meet all human needs. In fact, often they only lead to short-term results and behavioral changes. To ensure a long-term motivation, teachers need to create a learning climate so that all needs are met. Such a work atmosphere will lead to intrinsic motivation, so they will be motivated by their own internal mechanisms. At the end of the paper it is presented a research on a group of 24 subjects. This is a checklist on motivational factors involved in adult learning. Why teach adults? What is their motivation to learn? There are differences in the motivation of male and female subjects? A conclusion of this study is presented here: While women are motivated more by security, house, money, comfort, balance, men are motivated primarily by career development goals, social life.

      "abstract": "Instructional simulation and games are usually used as substitutes for actual equipment, processes, real-life problems, and social situations. They allow observing outcomes of different learner actions and steps without involving actual hardware and people. They also provide environments for practicing important skills in an efficient (in terms of cost and time) way. From a cognitive load perspective, using actual equipment or human actors may not necessarily lead to the acquisition of expected knowledge and skills. High cognitive load involved in operating the equipment itself, performing required procedures, interacting with other people, especially when allowed time is constrained, may inhibit learning.

      "abstract": "Instructional simulation and games are usually used as substitutes for actual equipment, processes, real-life problems, and social situations. They allow observing outcomes of different learner actions and steps without involving actual hardware and people. They also provide environments for practicing important skills in an efficient (in terms of cost and time) way. From a cognitive load perspective, using actual equipment or human actors may not necessarily lead to the acquisition of expected knowledge and skills. High cognitive load involved in operating the equipment itself, performing required procedures, interacting with other people, especially when allowed time is constrained, may inhibit learning.

      "title": "On complexity and variability of individuals’ day-to-day discretionary activities",
      "abstract": "Considering an individual’s day-to-day variability of activity-travel patterns will provide a more complete description of how an individual behaves to adapt the changing constraints and resources on different days. Without this day-to-day variability understanding, the individual’s behaviour would not be fully grasped and any suggested policy, planning and development would not completely achieve their desired objectives. The day-to-day behaviour is a subject to an interaction between individual’s needs and time-space constraints. The availability of ‘external’ resources (e.g., disposable income, built environment accessibility, and access to different travel mode/s) gives more opportunities for some individuals to participate in certain activities and/or trips than others. The constraints do not only consider budget and time constraints, but also include how an individual associates with other individuals and materials, and complies with any given authorities’ rules and regulations. The needs-constraints interaction also unveils some endogeneities which may not be captured by microeconomic and attitude theories. Failing to understand these interactions will underestimate the individual’s complex decision making process for performing certain behaviour.The constraints are not solely about physical constraints and instrumental factors, such as travel mode availability, time and cost. It is also influenced by individual’s non-instrumental variables, such as motivation, volition and habits. Currently there is a lack of knowledge how these non-instrumental variables are interacting and influencing the constraints to shape the individual’s travel behaviour. The implementation of certain activity-travel policy which only focuses in giving more opportunities to an individual within time and space resources without considering an individual’s attitude and/or habit may not be well accepted and followed by member of public. Moreover, the integration also reveals how an individual puts different priority on different potential activities based on the how an individual allocates/does not allocate time in engaging certain activities when having strong commitment and intention. In addition, including an individual’s health condition in the analysis may help in coordinating certain public health related policy with activity-travel policy.This thesis includes six papers which investigated the factors described above. The first three papers investigated how activity participation and built environment variables which can represent individuals’ constraints explain the day-to-day variability of individuals’ behaviours. Furthermore, the fourth and fifth paper explored the interaction between individuals’ time-use and activity participation, subjective characteristics and health factors. Lastly, the sixth paper examined how the time-space constraints and health condition explain the degree of variability in individuals’ multi-facet and multi-dimensional activity-travel patterns using sequential alignment method.",

      "abstract": "Job satisfaction is an emotional or affective response toward all job aspects. This definition shows that job satisfaction is not a concept which only has one dimension. Someone may be satisfied with a particular job aspect but may not be satisfied with another or other job aspects. There are five general models of job satisfaction which have something to do with the following reasons: (1) needs fulfillment, job satisfaction is determined by the character of the jobs which enables individuals to fulfill their needs, (2) inexpediency, satisfaction is how far someone can accept something they expect from the jobs, (3) values achievement, jobs enable the fulfillment of important job values, (4) justice, satisfaction is defined as how fare individuals are treated in the working place, and (5) genetic or character component which is based on the belief that job satisfaction is a partial function of someone's character and genetic factors. In the global era, a trend has appeared in the working place which may become an obstacle to develop human resources. Those trends are: (1) the emergence of new job fields, (2) the movement of the loyal definition toward the profession, (3) the decrease of the baby boomers generation due to retirement which opens a big opportunity to young generation, and (4) the borderless world view of the talented people.",

      "title": "To Study the Effect of Academic Achievement on the Level of Self Confidence",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONSelf-confidence is an attitude which allows individuals to have positive yet realistic views of themselves and their situations. Self-confident people trust their own abilities, have a general sense of control in their lives, and believe that, within reason, they will be able to do what they wish, plan, and expect. Having self-confidence does not mean that individuals will be able to do everything. Self-confident people have expectations that are realistic. Even when some of their expectations are not met, they continue to be positive and to accept themselves.Self-confidence is not necessarily a general characteristic which pervades all aspects of a person's life. Typically, individuals will have some areas of their lives where they feel quite confident, e.g., academics, athletics, while at the same time they do not feel at all confident in other areas, e.g., personal appearance, social relationships.Self confidence is a belief in yourself and your abilities, a mental attitude of trusting or relying on yourself. Confidence is sometimes equated with freedom from doubt; however when confidence is needed is usually when the outcome is uncertain, so that true confidence is actually about feeling comfortable with uncertainty and not knowing what the outcome will be.So it can conclude that Self-confidence is the expected probability that a person will achieve a goal in a certain situation. For example if mark estimates that his probability of achieving an on a calculus exam is 90%, we would conclude that mark had high self-confidence in his ability to do well on a calculus exam. If Mark had estimated 10%, then it would say that the person had low self-confidence about his ability to do well on the exam.REVIEW OF LITERATUREDuring the past decades various studies, researches works have been done on the academic achievement. Following is an epitome of these research works:Augustsson and Engstand (2001) examined of whether there are any long-term differences in academic achievements between children with and without observed or treated middle ear disease in a population with a stable long-standing treatment policy. A birth cohort of 2156 children was previously studied through a questionnaire to the parents at 4 years of age, follow-up after audiometric screening at 4, 7,11 and 14 years of age, and study of records from all Ear, Nose and Throats departments in the area; 2095 of these still lived in the area and received academic grades on leaving the ninth year of the state school system. We have compared these grades, and the choice of high school course for children with different experiences of otitis media. A history of treatment for bilateral secretory otitis media was correlated to minor group difference in the mean of grades, but not to any significant difference in the individual grades or in the choice of further studies. Having many episodes of acute otitis before the age of four was uncorrelated to lower grades and to less tendency to continue with theoretical studies. No harmful effect of middle ear disease could be shown in a large sample, suggesting that Swedish children do not suffer long-term effects on learning from otitis media.Hampton and Mason (2003) examined the impact of gender, learning disability (LD) status, and sources of efficacy on self-efficacy beliefs and academic achievement in the concept of Bandura's self-efficacy theory. Two hundred and seventy-eight high school students participated in the study. Structural equation modeling was used. The results revealed that LD status had indirect influence on self-efficacy via the source variable; gender did not have direct or indirect influences on self-efficacy; sources of efficacy had direct impact on self-efficacy, which in turn affected academic performance. The structural model fit the data well and explained 55% of the variance in academic achievement.Rafferty, Shinn and Weitzman (2004) examined the school experiences and academic achievement of 46 adolescents in families who experienced homelessness and 87 permanently housed adolescents whose families received public assistance. …",

      "abstract": "Achieving goals often requires the completion of sequential actions, such as finishing a series of assignments to pass a class. In the course of pursuing such goals, people can decide how closely to follow their personal standards for each action. We propose that actions at the beginning and end of a sequence appear more diagnostic of the pursuer's personal standards than do actions in the middle. Therefore, people are more likely to adhere to their standards at the beginning and end of goal pursuit-and slack in the middle. We demonstrate this pattern of judgment and behavior in adherence to ethical standards (e.g., cheating), religious traditions (e.g., skipping religious rituals), and performance standards (e.g., \"cutting corners\" on a task). We also show that the motivation to adhere to standards by using proper means is independent and follows a different pattern from the motivation to reach the end state of goal pursuit.",

      "title": "Gradations in task engagement emerge from metacognitive priority control",
      "abstract": "Engagement is a critical motivational factor that has broad effects on learning, productivity, performance, and even satisfaction and happiness. However, engagement can be impacted by a myriad of factors including the features of the task, the broader environment and the person’s needs and biological states. Engagement has been difficult to characterize and measure, resulting in domain-specific conceptualizations and models that vary widely, creating a disconnected view of the overall phenomena of task engagement. Here we address this problem by developing an integrated metacognitive framework for understanding task engagement. We identify the key phenomenal characteristics of task engagement as integrating a graded effort for ongoing tasks with the temporal dynamics of task switching. We treat engagement as resulting from a unified meta-cognitive decision process that handles the gradient of engagement as resulting from a common priority calculation, the equivalent of an overall utility rate for ongoing tasks. Priority signals are computed relative to a set of available tasks and updated across time and changes in the environment. We propose a metacognitive controller makes decisions about both task switching (when to quit, next task) and cognitive resourcing (working memory, attention, etc) using the graded priority signals. By simultaneously choosing the task and allocating resources using the same graded signals, we capture the complex dependencies of engagement with task errors, performance, and time allocation.",

Using data from informal medical encounters, it is argued that and -prefacing is used to link a question to a preceding question/answer pair or pairs. In such contexts, and -prefacing indicates that the questions it prefaces have a routine or agenda-based character. This in turn can be a resource which invokes and sustains an orientation to an activity or course of action that is implemented through a series of question/answer pairs, but transcends any individual pair. The general characteristics of and -prefaced questions are contrasted with “contingent” or “follow-up” questions, which are not normally and -prefaced. Some strategic uses of and -prefaced questions are described, and the role of the device within the more general sociolinguistic context of the data is discussed.

Here, I systematically searched for articles that used visual attentional paradigms, manipulated emotional arousal by auditory or visual, task-relevant or task-irrelevant stimuli, measured behavioral responses, ocular behavior, or neural correlates. I found that task-relevant arousing stimuli draw and hold attention regardless of the modality. In contrast, task-irrelevant arousing stimuli impaired task performance. However, when the emotional content precedes the task or it is presented for a longer duration, arousal increased performance. Future directions on how research could address the remaining questions are discussed.",

This research found that people who successfully make the transition to non-traditional types of work tend to act in a pro-active manner and deliberately choose to be optimistic, even on their down days. They also tend to be self directed. A number of factors were found that enabled people to successfully make the transition from a full-time job to non-traditional types of work. The most important skills the participants identified as being essential for success in alternative work choices are: self-knowledge, be self-directed, have a willingness to take responsibility for yourself, passion, willingness to take risks, integrity, effective communication skills, life-long learning, a positive attitude and behaviour, ability to be flexible and adaptable, able to make decisions, open to change and able to clarify your own values and goals.",

Educational Objectives Overview We tend to be delighted, surprised, or puzzled by coincidences that happen to us (but not so much to others, which we tend to explain as merely a coincidence). The series of articles on the experience of reacting to coincidences provides a different window into how our brains and minds work. Perhaps when explanatory models about weird coincidence experiences become dysregulated, psychopathology (eg, paranoia) can result. Note that in the Beitman article, the story about John Snow finding that the Broad Street pump was the cause of a cholera outbreak, although quite interesting, may not be as true as most might think. By mapping the outbreak, Dr. Snow identified the pump as the cause of cholera. He removed the pump, and the cholera epidemic diminished. But as detailed by Tufte, the rate of cholera was decreasing before the water pump was removed, which is a good example of finding a relationship where one did not necessarily exist.

The mentor or supervisor needs to take responsibility for limiting barriers to communication including physical (e.g. disruptive environment, language), psychosocial (e.g. anxiety, fear or authority) and professional (e.g. lack of knowledge, power imbalance). A number of models support mentors and mentees and are also useful in coaching, supervision and personal tutoring. Clutterbuck (2004) suggests two main models: sponsorship model, and developmental model. The GROW model provides a simple framework to help an individual work towards their goal. Heron's (1986) model looks at six interventions, some mentor led and others mentee led. The mentor needs to choose their approach and tactics carefully in response to the situation or individual's needs. The more authoritative interventions include: prescribing, informing, and confronting.",

Exemplification of education are educational institutions, and educational programmes on each its level. Among many of its aims the most crucial is leading the individual to full independence. Independence is a complex process, demanding not only the example but also own and very often verified experiences. Experiences, which allow the individual to recognize own possibilities, needs and roles, which are going to be fulfilled. Independence allows then for asking questions concerning oneself, own place among others, and these always stay in a close bond to own identity. In special education the subject of identity gain greater significance. Pedagogues concentrate mainly on language expression and on actions, by which disabled are expressing themselves. More important become examining if undertaken educational actions allow disabled to perceive themselves as independent individuals. Are they equipped with emancipated, inner strategies of controlling? Or, another way round, is their independence controlled from outside and depends on retrieving inner patterns of behaviours?",

      "title": "Updating the Model for Psychotherapy of Psychosomatic Problems",
      "abstract": "There is a pressing need to broaden the base of the therapeutic efforts used to treat psychosomatic and stress induced disorders. Before this can be accomplished, it is necessary to accept the heterogeneity of the disorders which carry the same label. Psychosomatic phenomena must be clearly defined so that specific treatment goals can be formulated for the various treatment modalities which are available, e.g., modifying patterns of communication and of human relationships; altering expressive and instrumental behavior patterns; broadening of an individual’s perception of the external world and internal experiences; changing the internal state through feedback, drugs, relaxation; modifying mal-adaptive behavioral or psychopshysiological response patterns with conditioning techniques. The range of symptoms which can be defined as psychosomatic include: (1) Symptoms referable to the body which are the expression of ideas, thoughts, or feelings and are not related to altered physiology (conversion, depressive, hypochondriac or body delusional symptoms). (2) Specific physiological changes which accompany psychological states (anxiety, anger, vigilance). (3) Symptoms of organic disease which lead to secondary psychological reactions (somato psychic). (4) Symptoms of diseases whose onset is related to the loss of significant objects and the feeling of hopelessness and helplessness. In order to integrate relevant developmental, psychodynamic, social stress and biological data in relation to illness, a new biopsychosocial model is needed. <i>Engel</i> (11), <i>Weiner</i> (40), <i>Nemiah</i> and <i>Sifenos</i> (29), <i>Sandler</i> (34), <i>Mason</i> (25), <i>Bahnson</i> (6), <i>Luria</i> (22) and <i>Miller</i> (26) have all suggested comprehensive psychobiological etiologic models. These models should be useful in establishing the methods and goals of a more scientific psychobiologically based therapy for psychosomatic disorders.",

      "title": "What are routines good for",
      "abstract": "Routines are patterns of interaction between an agent and its world. Getting in or out of a car, changing lane, and flipping pages of a book can be routines for an agent if the agent consistently engages in these activities in a similar way. I.e., a task for an agent is a routine if the agent that has choices about how to accomplish that task, nevertheless does it in the same way. Consistently putting on the left leg of pants before putting on the right leg would be a routine for an agent. A routine is either imposed upon the agent (a plan at the conscious level to be followed), in which case it need not be discovered, or performed by the agent automatically, i.e., unconsciously. The latter may or may not ever be discovered, i.e., noticed and made conscious. However, the existence of such a routine may guide the agents actions. If it remains unconscious, it aids in choosing among competing actions unconsciously as an unexplained tendency or a preference. If it is noticed and made conscious, it can also be used as a concept and used in reasoning about actions and planning. We show how agents with routines a) use them to guide their everyday activity, b) use them to enrich their abstract concepts about acts.",

      "title": "Evaluating evidence of reflection and reflective practice",
      "abstract": "Gathering accurate, valid and reliable evidence of reflective practice is not a simple matter. Neither is gathering evidence that resources and learning strategies to develop reflective skills and capacities are efficacious, effective or successful. The project raised significant questions in relation to both of these issues. Evidence for reflective practice, whether in- or on-action can be behavioural, verbal or written. A combination of some or all of these would constitute the strongest evidence. Arguably, the best evidence for reflective practice is to observe it happening in professional or field placement settings, particularly if it is possible to have some discussion of what was observed with the practitioner. If the observer is an experienced practitioner it may even be possible to intuit when reflection-in-action is taking place/has taken place from observing the practitioner's verbal/non-verbal behaviour. However, often it is not possible to gather such strong observable behavioural evidence. The chapter identifies strategies, other than observation, that can be used to gather evidence for professional reflective practice in programs of preservice and in-service professional education and in research. Some strategies, such as written vignettes may not be the most efficacious or effective and some recent research in neuroscience and neuropsychiatry may explain why this is the case. The chapter provides a number of recommendations regarding future research into professional reflective practice.",

      "abstract": "Dual-task paradigms (or dual performance tasks) are involved in a wide variety of multiple activities in our daily lives, as they are considered an evolutionary advantage of the phylogeny that makes it possible to perform several tasks at the same time with an optimisation of the 'neural resources' compared to tasks that would otherwise be carried out as a single task.The literature related to three dual-task performance paradigms is reviewed: a) the cognitive/motor paradigm, referring to models that involve a task with a cognitive component and a task with a motor component; b) the motor/motor paradigm, referring to a motor task and a simultaneous motor task, and c) the cognitive/cognitive paradigm, in which a task with a cognitive component and a cognitive task are involved.Dual tasks are an efficient tool for detecting mild cognitive impairment, as well as an ideal paradigm for rehabilitation intervention, given the increased attentional resources and executive functions involved in performing them. Neuroimaging can be a valuable tool that makes it possible to: a) locate the cognitive, motor and/or perceptual processes involved in the different dual performance paradigms; b) characterise the responses and function of specific brain signals in each of the tasks, and c) relate changes in neural activity to the efficacy of different intervention programmes.Paradigmas de ejecución dual: aspectos conceptuales.Introducción. Los paradigmas de doble tarea (o tareas de ejecución dual) se hallan implicados en múltiples y variadas actividades de nuestra vida cotidiana, ya que se consideran una ventaja evolutiva de la filogenia que posibilita llevar a cabo varias tareas al mismo tiempo con una optimización ‘de los recursos neuronales’ en comparación con las tareas que, por el contrario, se realizarían como una tarea única o simple. Desarrollo. Se revisa la bibliografía relacionada con tres paradigmas de ejecución de doble tarea: a) paradigma cognitivo/motor que hace referencia a modelos, en los que se hallan implicadas una tarea con un componente cognitivo y una tarea con un componente motor; b) paradigma motor/motor que hace referencia a una tarea motora y una tarea simultánea también motora, y c) paradigma cognitivo/cognitivo, en el que se implican una tarea con un componente cognitivo y otra también cognitiva. Conclusiones. Las tareas duales son una eficiente herramienta para detectar el deterioro cognitivo leve, así como un paradigma idóneo para la intervención en rehabilitación, dado el incremento de recursos atencionales y funciones ejecutivas implicados en su ejecución. En cuanto a la neuroimagen, ésta puede aportar: a) localizar los procesos cognitivos, motores y/o perceptivos implicados en los diferentes paradigmas de ejecución dual; b) caracterizar las respuestas y función de determinadas señales cerebrales en cada una de las tareas, y c) relacionar modificaciones en la actividad neural con la eficacia de diferentes programas de intervención.",

MENTORING IN CONTEXTMentoring, thus, never takes place in a vacuum.The context mentors work in strongly influences the relationship with their mentees (Kelchtermans, 1993).Context can entail many things, for example, the physical environment where mentor-mentee meetings take place (in a quiet private office versus in the busy corridor in between two patient consultations), the personal characteristics of mentees (a very talkative mentee or one who is reluctant to share personal experiences), or program specific requirements mentors may need to adhere to (do meetings need to have a predefined structure or agenda, do mentors need to meet mentees a specific number of times, do they need to assess them, is documentation in a portfolio required, etc.).Mentors interact with the working conditions in their professional context, actively making sense of them and interpreting what they mean.Therefore, mentoring knowledge and beliefs are not stable but dynamic, varying over time and across settings (Kelchtermans, 1993).An example of a context mentors can nowadays find themselves in is that of programmatic assessment, where low-stakes assessments are aggregated to serve as input for decision making at a higher stakes level, such as receiving credits or a go/ no-go decision for progression to clinical rotations (Schuwirth & Van der Vleuten, 2011; van der Vleuten & Schuwirth, 2005).Mentors who are engaged in both the support and the assessment of their mentees will most likely need to adapt their mentoring to specific organisational requirements.These requirements could be hard to reconcile or even be incompatible with mentors' personal system of knowledge and beliefs, potentially causing tension for both mentors and their mentees.Mentoring in such a context could, thus, lead to a different representation of what meaningful mentoring entails, also creating a potential mismatch between mentors' preferred approach to mentoring and how they are currently actually mentoring (Loosveld et al.,",

In working with a client, coaches might have a conversation with her about the resistance and ask her to sit quietly breathing, noticing where the emotion is located in her body. Coaches can ask her to breathe into that specific place in the body and ask her if the feeling has a physical expression and, if so, what it would look like. The more coaches engage with the exercise and move, the more they will be able to feel when the energy has been released and they can return to their creative work in a new state of mind.

Emotion often enhances memory for stimulus features, but the relationship between emotion and the binding of features in memory is unclear. Younger and older adults attempted to remember events in which a person performed a negative, positive or neutral action. Memory for the action was enhanced by emotion, but emotion did not enhance the ability of participants to remember which person performed which action. Older adults were more likely than younger adults to make binding errors in which they incorrectly remembered a familiar actor performing a familiar action that had actually been performed by someone else, and this age-related associative deficit was found for both neutral and emotional actions. Emotion not only increased correct recognition of old events for older and younger adults but also increased false recognition of events in which a familiar actor performed a familiar action that had been performed by someone else. Thus, although emotion may enhance memory for the features of an event, it does not increase the accuracy of remembering who performed which action.",

Sometimes, even if we notice that we are distracted, it can be hard to turn our attention back to whatever we were doing. Distraction and difficulty controlling attention can cause various problems. For example, some students find it difficult to learn because of frequent distractions and not paying attention in class. For other people, repeatedly thinking about bad memories or worries can affect their moods. Luckily, research suggests that we can learn to control our attention and manage distractions by practicing meditation.

AC figures in a number of kinds of interaction. One is the topic/comment conditional, as in call it up and there’s something that actually says your number. It is a possibility for enhancing certain illocutionary acts such as threats and warnings: I’m gonna take that and I’m gonna dig it into you . It is a basis for syntactic mirativity, the coding of surprise and unexpectedness ( DeLancey 1997 ): you turn your back and there’s somebody moving in . AC raises questions about the nature of constructions and of Construction Grammar.",

      "abstract": "Organizations, occupations and professions usually invest a great deal of effort in training and other forms of purposive hands-on processes, so that their members learn the practices that belong to their job. However, this investment does not always pay off or, at least, not in proportion to the effort. It is also true that not all learning occurs through these mechanisms: members of a firm or an occupation continue to learn - or may forget what they learned - during their practice. For these reasons, practitioners and scholars in different fields have naturally paid, and continue to pay, great attention to learning processes, especially those that occur in work practice. This paper is intended to provide an overview of the contributions that the management and organizational literature has made in the field of professional and occupational development by focusing on how this literature understands learning in practice.",

Sometimes, they have \nlearned in their teacher education programs to shape a question and follow \nthrough with a systematic study; sometimes, they just ask a question that \nleads them into inquiry around practice. However they get there, when teachers engage in questioning, collecting data, and following through by taking \naction, they are engaging in the signature activities of teacher research. When \nthis process incorporates what Schon (1983) describes as “reflective practice”—a stepping back and weighing of possible actions, following through \non those deliberations with purposeful action, and assessing the outcome of \nthe actions taken-teacher research becomes a very powerful catalyst for the \nimprovement of practice as well as for professional development.",

Stress on a long run is dangerous and can contribute to illness through its physiological effects or maladaptive health behaviors. Many students admit, or are self-aware, that they become stressed under different circumstances and have some clues about their potential stressor. Still, even for such students, the monitoring and awareness of stress are not systematic and based on subjective data, i.e. someone's feelings. In our work we aim at providing means to students to become aware of the past, current and expected (objectively measured) stress and its correlation with their performance, to understand their stressors, to cope with and prevent stress - thus, to live healthier and happier lives and better organize their studies.",

We examined whether a more divided (frequent, shorter sessions) or a cumulated (less frequent, longer sessions) goal pursuit schedule increases people’s motivation to work towards personal goals. Across two studies (N = 448), the underlying reasons for pursuing the goal mattered. A divided schedule was more motivating than a cumulated schedule if participants reported highly autonomous reasons (pursuing a goal due to personal interest or values), but the difference was eliminated for those reporting low autonomous reasons. We discuss how perceiving time spent on goal activities as loss, reward, or investment may explain scheduling preferences and how these may map on to preferences for scheduling financial losses and rewards outlined by prospect theory.",

If you are living with high level of stress, you are putting your entire well-being at risk. It narrows your ability to think clearly, function effectively, and enjoy life. It may seem that there is nothing you can do about stress. Effective stress management help you break the hold stress has on your life, so you can be happier, healthier, and more productive. The ultimate goal is a balanced life, with time for work, relationships, rileksation and fun, and the resilience to hold up under pressure and meet challenges head on. Stress management starts with identifying the sources of stress in your life, this isn’t as straightforward as it sounds. While it’s easy to identify major stressors such as changing jobs, moving, or going through a divorce, pinpointing the sources of chronic stress can be more complicated. It’s all too easy to overlook how your own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors contribute to your everyday stress levels.A stress journal can help you identify the regular stressors in your life and the way you deal with them. Each time you feel stressed, keep track of it in your journal or use a stress tracker on your phone. The following stress management tips in this article can help you to overcome the stress in your life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Emphasis on striving for excellence, rigor of thinking, thoroughness, and on acceptance of the idea that man cannot attain perfection through environment is needed. Extra‐curricular activities provide a way of testing some of the principles and ideas gained in the classroom. Positive institutional policy defining, emphasizing and reflecting such attitudes in all phases of extra‐curricular activities would give meaning and direction to these critical activities.",

      "title": "COACHING AT THE BUILDING SITE: A FEASIBILITY STUDY",
      "abstract": "Coaching has become widely used in business and is well described; however, it is rarely used in construction. This is in contrast to the poor performance of interaction at the site that leads to a vast amount of reported cooperation and coordination problems. This paper investigates the feasibility of a coaching approach to site management. The coach is a person who helps and guides another person or group to maximize his/its own capacity. Coaching is arguably useful in many different work situations, for example, problem solving, group work and planning. These assumptions are evaluated through observations at a building site operating with Lean Construction where the managers did not use coaching consciously in their interaction with employees. Twenty-nine participant observations of five of the managers at the building site were carried out at individual and group meetings. Coaching can be used successfully at a building site in certain specific situations. A feeling of security is important for the focus persons at the building site, and this is best achieved in the open air. The way the leader acts towards the employee/focus person is decisive. The manager can develop consciousness and responsibility by asking relevant questions rather than just answering the employee's questions. It would be appropriate to inform about the use of coaching at the beginning of a building project. Situations not suitable for coaching are, for example, those where an order has to be given or where dialogue would work better.",

      "title": "On the so‐called ‘superior conformity of the self’ behavior: Twenty experimental investigations",
      "abstract": "Abstract In comparison processes between the self and others within a given social set, a marked tendency has been frequently observed for each person to present himself as more in conformity with the social norms prevailing in the set under consideration than others participating in this set generally are. This type of behavior has been designated here as ‘superior conformity of the self behavior’ (also called ‘PIP effect’). This article sets out to synthesize twenty experimental investigations in which it was attempted to delimit and explain this behavior. A first set of experiments deals with the observed scope of the superior conformity of the self behavior. For this purpose, variations are systematically introduced in the characteristics of comparative situations: Types of sets of individuals (for instance, real groups or abstract sets — social categories); types of norms under consideration (for instance, norms dealing with the concrete execution of a task, norms relating to forms of behavior — personality characteristics, etc.); manners of comparing oneself with others (for instance, a specifically defined other or generalized others; comparisons on past, present or future behavior, etc.). Having tested the scope of the superior conformity of the self behavior in various ways, we proceed to explain it theoretically and experimentally. Our explanation here is based on the existence of a fundamental conflict between two simultaneous processes that are both complementary and contradictory: The individual's need, on the one hand, for social conformity, which tends toward standardization and de‐individualization; on the other hand, his simultaneous search for social differentiation and individualization. This explanation is tested in a second set of experiments. Our final purpose is to show the practical and theoretical importance of the study of the superior conformity of the self behavior in social psychology. In this connection we have shown, in a third set of experiments, how such a behavior can play a role in many phenomena studied by social psychology.",

Across three studies, this article shows that the effects of significant other primes (i.e., mother, roommate) on behavior depend on individual differences in both personal goals and responsiveness to social cues (i.e., self-monitoring, need to belong). Specifically, individuals who are motivated to respond to social cues assimilate to a goal that their primed significant other has for them, regardless of whether they personally hold the goal. Individuals not so motivated, on the other hand, assimilate to the goal only when it is one that they also personally hold. Implications of these findings for research on the prime-to-behavior relationship and interpersonal goal pursuit are discussed.",

The requirements regarding the recognition, the realization and the appreciation in the classroom or at school shall be met. Students have the tendancy to experience unwanted behaviour as avengement, nervosity, aggressivity, power search-power assertion if these requirements of the students aren’t met. Every behaviour that blocks pedagogical efforts is perceived as “an unwanted behaviour ”. Unwanted behaviours affect the lesson and the whole class negatively and stop us from achieving our goals. The effort, time and money spent for the educational purpose will go for nothing ultimately.These unwanted behaviours may arise from the class structure, the teacher or from the students. One of the reasons arising from the student is that of a biological reason. These are mentioned as brain damage, disease, malnutrition due to biochemicals and they have affect on unwanted behaivours. One of the unwanted behaviours is the hyperactive attitudes of the hyperactive children. Disease, nutrition, nerval, neurological condition, temper, genetic disorders, physical diabilities, variables like medication inclines to hyperactivity with some kids. The teachers who don’t know how to react to hyperactive behaviours will not be able to estimate the incidents that may happen in the future Thus unwanted incidents may be experienced. In this study Reşat Nuri Güntekin’s novel Ò‚alõkuşu” has been reviewed on recognition of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) by applying the bibliotherapy method. The heroine of the novel Feride was detected to have The Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Hyperactive-Impulsive Type according to DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) diagnostic criteria. The educational administrators and the candidate teachers can be informed about the disease of the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) by reviewing the ‚alõkuşu novel, applying the bibliotherapy method. Thus most of the unwanted behaviours, that may arise, can be prevented.",

They can involve the entire face, head, or gaze, not just a specific set of facial muscles. Facial gestures are precisely timed with the words they refer to, not to an underlying emotion. Also, the variety of meanings of facial gestures is much broader than emotions; for example, smiling to mark ironic humor, making a facial shrug or a thinking face, emphasizing a word with a quick eyebrow movement, or portraying another person’s appearance or expression. Coordination of gaze and mutual gaze are particularly important in facilitating turn exchanges and eliciting back channels. Speakers may also point with their gaze (e.g., drawing attention to their hand gestures). In contrast to emotional expressions, facial gestures serve predominantly track 2 interactive functions rather than conveying topical content.",

      "abstract": "Le travail de recherche ici presente part du constat que les pratiques, tout comme la formation et les recherches en psychologie (basees pour la plupart sur des observations correlationnelles et des variables individuelles), renvoient trop souvent l'origine des evenements et des comportements a des determinations psychologiques. Dans bien des cas, cela revient a prendre les consequences psychologiques des insertions sociales pour leurs causes. Pratiques et recherches amenent parfois a surestimer le role de l'individu dans la determination de ce qu'il fait ou de ce qui lui arrive. Cette tendance est ici rapprochee de la norme generale d'internalite, amenant a valoriser les explications accentuant le poids des facteurs individuels dans la determination des evenements (explications renvoyant a des determinations causales internes a l'individu : traits de personnalite, aptitudes ou motivations), au detriment de la prise en compte de facteurs plus situationnels (determinations causales externes a l'individu : chance, intervention d'autrui, determinants contextuels). Il est possible que les explications internes aient valeur d'evidence dans notre univers culturel, du fait de la valeur positive qui y est associee (une valeur positive pouvant ainsi donner lieu a impression de familiarite ; Baudouin, Gilibert, Sansone & Tiberghien, 2000).",

      "abstract": "Une nouvelle habilete motrice passe par diverses phases d'apprentissage avant d'etre bien acquise. La pratique permet une amelioration rapide du geste moteur. Cette progression de l'apprentissage est aussi marquee par des gains de performance qui sont observes en l'absence d'un entrainement supplementaire. Ce phenomene dit de consolidation hors-ligne peut etre reduit ou elimine si un second apprentissage est realise apres le premier. Les effets d'interference sont observes dans le cas ou les deux tâches engagent le meme effecteur, manuel dans la plupart des cas. On ignore toutefois si l'interference persiste lorsque les apprentissages sont de nature differente. Deux experiences ont ete proposees dans lesquelles les participants ont ete evalues a deux reprises, a 24 heures d'intervalle, sur une tâche d'opposition sequentielle des doigts. La premiere experience visait a preciser dans quelle mesure le mode de production des sequences peut moduler la susceptibilite a l'interference lors de la consolidation motrice. Il s'est avere que l'administration d'une seconde sequence, qu'elle soit manuelle ou orale, a perturbe les gains hors-ligne consecutifs a la premiere sequence manuelle. Le caractere sequentiel du materiel a apprendre semble constituer un element important dans les effets d'interference constates. L'objectif de la deuxieme experience visait a preciser dans quelle mesure les effets d'interference peuvent survenir entre deux tâches sous-tendues par un systeme de memoire different. Les resultats ont montre qu'une tâche declarative visuospatiale a elimine les gains hors-ligne lors du rappel ulterieur de la sequence motrice. Ceci laisse croire qu'un apprentissage moteur peut etre affecte par un apprentissage declaratif, ce qui illustre la capacite d'interactions entre la memoire procedurale et declarative. Dans l'ensemble, ces resultats ont montre que l'execution d'une tâche secondaire, qu'elle soit de nature procedurale ou declarative, peut nuire a l'apprentissage d'une tâche sequentielle motrice. Les aspects sequentiels et spatiaux inherents a ces tâches secondaires contribueraient a ce phenomene d'interference.\r\n______________________________________________________________________________ \r\nMOTS-CLES DE L’AUTEUR : memoire procedurale, apprentissage moteur, habiletes motrices, consolidation, gains hors-ligne, interference, sequences motrices",

      "abstract": "Het werkgeheugen stelt ons in staat om waargenomen informatie vast te houden en te verwerken. Dit is essentieel voor verschillende taken in het dagelijkse leven. De hoeveelheid informatie die in het werkgeheugen kan worden vastgehouden is beperkt, en zodoende is het van belang dat we alleen relevante informatie vasthouden en dat irrelevante informatie onderdrukt wordt. In dit onderzoek is gekeken naar hoe de activatie van informatie in het werkgeheugen beinvloedt wordt door verschillende taken. Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat de verwerking van de betekenis van een woord tot activatie in het werkgeheugen leidt. Deze activatie leidt ertoe dat onze aandacht automatisch getrokken wordt door nieuwe informatie die overeenkomt met de betekenis van het woord. Wanneer we dit woord niet hoeven te onthouden wordt de activatie uitgewist wanneer we onze aandacht nodig hebben voor een nieuwe taak, bijvoorbeeld het oplossen van een som. Als we het woord echter moeten onthouden, blijkt de activatie in stand te blijven na het uitvoeren van een dergelijke taak. Het onderzoek laat tevens zien dat mensen in staat zijn om werkgeheugen activatie snel te onderdrukken wanneer zij daartoe een instructie krijgen. Daarnaast toont het onderzoek aan dat we niet in staat zijn om de activatie van de verschillende eigenschappen van een object selectief te onderdrukken, bijvoorbeeld wanneer we alleen de kleur van het object proberen te onthouden. Tezamen laten deze bevindingen zien dat de activatie van informatie in het werkgeheugen flexibel en snel kan worden aangepast op basis van de vereisten van een taak.",

      "title": "COMBINING SELF-MOTIVATION WITH LOGICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE IN A REWARD-SEEKING AGENT",
      "abstract": "Our interest is ultimately in intelligent, linguistically competent agents. Such agents must be capable of planning in an incompletely known world, inference over a substantial knowledge base (including a selfmodel), dialogue, and unceasing pursuit of their own rewards. Many AI systems have demonstrated some of these abilities, but none to our knowledge have integrated them all. We present a simple framework for defining such self-motivated cognitive agents in simulated worlds and exemplify this with an agent dubbed ME (for Motivated Explorer). Future work will move the domain to the real world (rather than more elaborate simulated worlds) and emphasize dialogue. ME can plan and think ahead (where actions produce gradual change over time), deal with unforeseen events, make inferences about states (including its own and other agents’ knowledge and wants), engage in question-answering with the user and other agents, and do so indefinitely and autonomously, driven by the expected cumulative rewards or costs of its contemplated sequences of actions and anticipated future states. Unlike the type of self-motivated agent described here, traditional planners have been constrained to act and react in accord with user-specified goals, constraints and preferences. Self-motivation would seem to lead to single-minded, self-indulgent behavior, but this is not at all so. If the agent “enjoys” acquiring knowledge, exploring its environment, conversing, and satisfying perceived user goals, then it can appear curious, interactive, and helpful. It may also seem that such an agent could do no more than typical reinforcement learning (RL) agents. In fact, the kind of agent envisaged and illustrated here conceives of its world and its actions in logical descriptive terms – it is a cognitive agent and thus able to plan ahead, entertain beliefs about itself and other agents, and engage in question-answering dialogue. In Section 2, we describe what we mean by a self-motivated cognitive agent, and our development framework for implementing such agents. In Section 3 we detail how actions are defined for an agent, the planning process, and the somewhat altered syntax and meaning of action definitions when we are specifying “actual” actions (as carried out when “running” the simulated world). In Section 4 we focus on the reasoning (including introspection) performed by the agent. In Section 5, we instantiate the agent ME in a particular simulated world in order to demonstrate and experiment with our framework. The simple sample world suffices for illustrating and supporting the points",

      "abstract": "Compared to equipment designed to perform the same function over and over, humans are just not as reliable. Computers and machines perform the same action in the same way repeatedly getting the same result, unless equipment fails or a human interferes. Humans who are supposed to perform the same actions repeatedly often perform them incorrectly due to a variety of issues including: stress, fatigue, illness, lack of training, distraction, acting at the wrong time, not acting when they should, not following procedures, misinterpreting information or inattention to detail. Why not use robots and automatic controls exclusively if human error is so common? In an emergency or off normal situation that the computer, robotic element, or automatic control system is not designed to respond to, the result is failure unless a human can intervene. The human in the loop may be more likely to cause an error, but is also more likely to catch the error and correct it. When it comes to unexpected situations, or performing multiple tasks outside the defined mission parameters, humans are the only viable alternative. Human Reliability Assessments (HRA) identifies ways to improve human performance and reliability and can lead to improvements in systems designed to interact with humans. Understanding the context of the situation that can lead to human errors, which include taking the wrong action, no action or making bad decisions provides additional information to mitigate risks. With improved human reliability comes reduced risk for the overall operation or project.",

      "title": "Putting the mind in the brain: Promoting an appreciation of the biological basis to understanding human behavior",
      "abstract": "A surprising number of students in psychology, behavioral science, and related social science classes fail to appreciate the importance of biological mechanisms to understanding behavior. To help teachers promote this understanding, this paper outlines six sources of evidence. These are (a) phylogenetic, (b) genetic/developmental, (c) clinical, (d) experimental, (e) brain recordings, and (f) experiential. The evidence can be easily understood from common knowledge or personal experience and can be incorporated into an introductory level lecture. It is concluded that the successful study of human behavior requires the student to appreciate the biological basis of the discipline. ********** In my experience in teaching about human behavior to psychology, behavioral science, and related social science college students, a surprising number of them are puzzled, uncertain, or unaware of why understanding the biological basis to behavior is so important. These feelings can have a knock on effect in reducing their motivation to learn about topics like brain anatomy, neurophysiology, hormones, and genetics. There is also the danger that students will not fully appreciate the significance of neuroscience the modern day blending of the biological and psychological sciences. To motivate students and implant in them the first seeds of knowledge, I have had success in using six sources of evidence for the biological basis of behavior. The link between each source of evidence and its relevance to behavior is so obvious that it can be appreciated even in an introductory level class. These six sources of evidence are described here to provide a reference from which teachers can apply in their behavioral science class. A quote It is useful to preface the six sources of evidence with some words from Bertrand Russell, the brilliant mathematician, scientist, and philosopher. He said: The important point is, that the difference between mind and brain is not a difference in quality, but a difference in arrangement. It is like the difference between arranging people in geographical order or in alphabetical order, both of which are done in the Post Office directory.... The ancient question of the dependence of mind on brain, or brain on mind, is thus reduced to linguistic convenience. In cases where we know more about the brain it will be convenient to regard the mind as dependent, but in cases where we know more about the mind it will be convenient to regard the brain as dependent. In either case, the substantial facts are the same, and the difference is only as to the degree of our knowledge, pg. 289. is Bertrand Russell's point here? He is arguing that there may in fact be no distinction between the mind and brain. By implication, any scientific explanation for the mind will ultimately be based on the physical characteristics of our brain. That is, thinking, perceiving, remembering, desiring, and feelings are all brain functions. The claim that they are all part of the mind is merely one of linguistic convenience. Psychological science is a field in which students apply the scientific method and the tools of induction and deduction to examine behavior. The question that we must encourage our enquiring student to ask is What is the basis of behavior? The Evidence The basis of behavior is the biological processes of the brain. Some evidence in support of this claim can be detailed and complex. For instance, there is more dendrite branching of the precentral brain area in the left hemisphere than there is in the right hemisphere in right handed individuals (Toga & Thompson, 2003). This fact is not commonly thought of by teachers (or students) as supporting the dominance of the left hemisphere for language and, by implication, supporting the link between biological processes and behavior. …",

Execution is also inherent in keeping things going and staying on course, so it is only natural that this tool is paired with the passion of determination. Determination is the underlying passion that keeps team executing when things get tough. The point of execution is to reach the goals set for one's team. Execution seldom goes smoothly. Invariably crises, unplanned and unpredictable events arise to divert from execution. Determination is a vital component of ability to execute well. Execution often begins by breaking a project down into separate parts that can be placed on a timeline. The timeline is important for setting up the sequence of events that have to happen to reach one's ultimate goal.",

      "abstract": "Learning from multiple representations (MRs) is not an easy task for most people, despite how easy it is for experts. Different combinations of representations (e.g., text + photograph, graph + formula, map + diagram) pose different challenges for learners, but across the literature researchers find these to be challenging learning tasks. Each representation typically includes some unique information, as well as some information shared with the other representation(s). Finding one piece of information is only somewhat challenging, but linking information across representations and especially making inferences are very challenging and important parts of using multiple representations for learning. Coordination of multiple representations skills are rarely taught in classrooms, despite the fact that learners are frequently tested on them. Learning from MRs depends on the specific learning tasks posed, learner characteristics, the specifics of which representation(s) are used, and the design of each representation. These various factors act separately and in combination (which can be compensatory, additive, or interactive). Learning tasks can be differentially effective depending on learner characteristics, especially prior knowledge, self-regulation, and age/grade. Learning tasks should be designed keeping this differential effectiveness in mind, and researchers should test for such interactions.",

The potential for them to encounter ethical dilemmas is thus higher. Add in the fact that many organisations provide limited access to supervision and the challenges can be significant. This case study is an amalgam of real cases but with significant changes and removal of identifying features so that total confidentiality is maintained.

      "abstract": "Abstract Ineffective goal striving may be overcome using a simple self‐regulation strategy: preparing goal striving in advance by forming implementation intentions (i.e., making if‐then plans). This strategy helps to cope with the classic challenges to goal striving: getting started, staying on track, not overextending oneself, and disengaging from faulty means. Interestingly, these beneficial effects are observed no matter whether hindrances from within (e.g., ego depletion) or outside (e.g., social influence) the person are to be dealt with. In this essay, the processes on which the beneficial effects of implementation intentions are based will be discussed by pointing to relevant research using cognitive task paradigms and assessing brain data. Moreover, recent findings are reported demonstrating that implementation intentions can be used to curb reflexive cognitive, affective, and behavioral responses that interfere with a person's focal goal pursuit. In closing this essay, a behavior change intervention (i.e., mental contrasting with implementation intentions) is introduced that establishes the prerequisites for implementation intention effects to occur, and research areas in psychology are pointed to that could benefit from conducting implementation intention research.",

Ces erreurs revelent que nous ne controlons pas totalement notre comportement quotidien et que des defaillances cognitives passageres peuvent se produire. Le lien entre ces erreurs et les defaillances qui en sont la cause constitue un objet d’etude insuffisamment explore a ce jour. Dans la presente these nous nous attachons a explorer ce lien en mettant l’accent sur l’attention et le controle cognitif, un construit tres souvent invoque lorsqu’il s’agit d’aborder la cognition « descendante » mais qui reste aujourd’hui essentiellement terra incognita. Pour ce faire nous avons constitue des observables comportementaux relatifs a ces defaillances en nous inspirant de la demarche de conception d’items de questionnaires autoevaluatifs, en categorisant les items sur une base conceptuelle renvoyant plus precisement a differentes formes attentionnelles comportementales auxquelles la litterature specialisee a donne une credibilite certaine. Parallelement, nous avons investigue le controle cognitif en recourant a un paradigme experimental, l’AX-cpt, qui nous semblait particulierement prometteur en ce qu’il met a l’œuvre des habiletes/processus telles que la focalisation de l’attention, le maintien des informations du contexte en memoire de travail et enfin le controle descendant des reponses. S’agissant des items de Defaillances Attentionnelles Quotidiennes, nous avons tout d’abord fait emerger, par le truchement d’Analyses Factorielles, leur structure latente en deux facettes : l’orientation selective et le controle de l’attention. Ensuite, une approche differentialiste, via des Modeles de Reponse a l’Item, a permis d’extraire des items particulierement discriminants. S’agissant du paradigme AX-cpt, nous avons d’abord explore ses proprietes processuelles en confrontant differentes conditions experimentales, puis nous avons procede plus systematiquement en recourant a une analyse de la tâche au moyen de modeles lineaires generaux a effets mixtes, avec l’objectif de faire ressortir des indicateurs rendant compte de la variabilite de la performance de controle attentionnel. Disposant d’items de DAQ dument selectionnes, d’une part, et d’un sous-ensemble cible d’indicateurs experimentaux de controle cognitif, d’autre part, nous avons pu mettre evidence en examinant les correlations multiples le lien significatif existant entre ces deux categories de variables, notamment dans une condition tres contraignante ou il faut repondre de maniere appropriee en presence de distracteurs incongruents. En cela, l’hypothese generale de la these est confirmee. Toutefois l’examen de la contribution specifique de chaque indicateur a la variabilite des DAQ invite a de nouvelles investigations du paradigme AX-cpt.",

Mindfulness skills are inherently related to top-down processes, such as awareness and reflection as well as bottom-up processes, such as emotional reappraisal, thus they can improve one’s cognitive and emotional regulation. Practitioners become more responsive, calm, and focused while experiencing less stress and distractions. Furthermore, mindfulness has been proven to foster stress resilience and create a great sense of interconnectedness so that it diminishes one’s possible involvement in impulsive behaviors. In addition, these techniques have multiple applications in modern medicine, working environments and school psychology, supported by ICTs to enhance practioners’ health status.

      "abstract": "Many groups make their decisions through some process of deliberation, usually with the belief that deliberation will improve judgments and predictions. But deliberating groups often fail, in the sense that they make judgments that are false or that fail to take advantage of the information that their members have. There are four such failures. (1) Sometimes the predeliberation errors of group members are amplified, not merely propagated, as a result of deliberation. (2) Groups may fall victim to cascade effects, as the judgments of initial speakers or actors are followed by their successors, who do not disclose what they know. Nondisclosure, on the part of those successors, may be a product of either informational or reputational cascades. (3) As a result of group polarization, groups often end up in a more extreme position in line with their predeliberation tendencies. Sometimes group polarization leads in desirable directions, but there is no assurance to this effect. (4) In deliberating groups, shared information often dominates or crowds out unshared information, ensuring that groups do not learn what their members know. All four errors can be explained by reference to informational signals, reputational pressure, or both. A disturbing result is that many deliberating groups do not improve on, and sometimes do worse than, the predeliberation judgments of their average or median member.",

      "title": "Age-related changes in everyday prospective memory",
      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter reviews and discusses theories and practical issues relating to prospective memory (PM) and how it changes during normal adult ageing. PM is the ability to perform a planned action at a future time and consists of four phases: the formation of an intention, its retention over time, the initiation, and then the completion of the intended action. Successful retrieval is boosted by the provision of cues, but if such cues are not present the person must ‘remember to remember’ by engaging self-initiated activities mediated by the frontal lobes. Laboratory studies reveal that PM declines with age, but often less in tasks that are cued by an event (event-based PM) than in tasks in which the person performs the action at a specific time or after a specified interval (time-based PM). PM tasks that are particularly reliant on self-initiated activities may be less effective in older people owing to a decline in frontally based control processes. Older adults are also more likely to make commission errors—to perform the planned action a second time. This chapter discusses the paradoxical finding that, although older adults perform less well than younger adults on laboratory PM tasks, the same older adults may outperform their younger counterparts on real-life PM tasks, possibly due to their stronger motivation. Evidence is also reviewed that shows how PM plays an important role in many real-life activities of daily living that are crucial for the older person’s well-being and independence. The chapter concludes with a discussion of possible interventions that may benefit PM function in late adulthood, and how current theories may be applied to improve the efficacy of such interventions.",

      "abstract": "Power represents a driving force of execution of one’s influence over others. This advantage is being utilized for securing certain gains from the end-results and implementation of the desired outcomes. The Power as a complex psychological personality condition is realized through two basic psychological principles: (1) the belief of possessing “lesser power” compared to the other party, searching for ways to match and overpower them; and (2) the belief of possessing “superior power” compared to the other party, probing through various ways to sustain the advantage and increase the control over the others.The awareness/ being informed as a sublimate of knowledge, information and competencies, represents an important source of power in the field of business communications. It could be forecasted/estimated through the intensity of data accumulation and presentation intended at changing the viewpoint of the other person in regards a certain issue. The competency entails a recognized accumulation of information and the ability to manage/govern them when handling a certain problem and/or condition. The power of being informed implies utilization of facts and numbers as a support to one’s arguments, achieving a certain level of management over a significant quantity of information, respect and credibility.The power of being informed would be more effective should the three basic psychological strategies of persuasion are being employed: (1) message content (2) message structure (3) style of message distribution and presentation. Being informed as a driving force of accomplishing influence over others includes the psychological functions of persuasion through the processes of motivation and processes of discrimination. Those who worry about their power and are in a constant search of power that would be appropriate or greater than that of the other, tend to look for a defensive solution: to sustain the favorable position they hold currently. Those who strive to achieve higher and greater position from the one they hold momentarily seek for and implement an offensive solution.",

Describe the beneficial effect of mindfulness training on resilience. Resilience, the ability to recover psychologically from stressful or traumatic events, is often discussed in the psychiatric literature in terms of an individual’s ability to recover from significant trauma. Much of the information about what builds or inhibits an individual’s resilience is based on research on people who have survived severe traumas or on animal models of severe trauma. However, in the world of college counseling, the emphasis is slightly different. Although there are certainly a number of college students presenting to student counseling centers who have survived horrific challenges, a much more common presentation is the student who is having trouble adapting to more-routine life events, such as failing in academic endeavors or being rejected by a love interest. Helping emerging adults (EAs) build the resilience they need to manage their day-to-day stresses is one of the core challenges for clinicians working with college students.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive styles and strategies differ from person to person. Identifying student styles helps educators understand how people perceive and process information in different ways. The stable and pervasive characteristics of an individual, expressed through the interaction of one's behavior and personality as one approaches a task, is described as a learning style. Cognitive styles and strategies affect people differently, depending on whether the person has left hemisphere strengths or right hemisphere strengths. For example, a person who performs best on analytical language might lack understanding and the use of correct syntactical structures, as well as semantically ordered comprehension of words and phonetic articulation. Another person may perform best on tasks calling for intuitive feel for language, which would also include expression, richness of lexical connotation, discourse, rhythm and intonation. Another person may have an affinity for methods that are focused, systematic, sequential and cumulative. Yet another person may have an affinity for methods in which various features are managed simultaneously, realistically and in a significant context.hat same person would be less likely to direct his own and may function well in quasi-autonomy (guided discovery), but may well express preference for a formal, teacher-dominated arrangement as a compensation for own perceived deficiency in ability to structure. All cognitive strategies differ from one another, just like person differ from one another. We can find many different cognitive or strategies, but still it does not mean that everyone would accept and adopt all of them. Someone can performe better with one strategy, but someone else can perform better with another strategy.Learning strategies are “operations employed by the learner to aid the acquisition,storage, retrieval, and use of information...(they are) specific actions taken by thelearner to makeearning easier, faster, more enjoyable, more self-directed, more effective, and moretransferableto new situations” (Oxford, 1990, p. 8).Strategy use varies according to the task, stageof the learner, age of thelearner, the context of learning, individual styles, and cultural differences.Currentresearch is now showing that the difference between successful and unsuccessfullearners is morethe quality of strategies used, not quantity. Successful language students do notnecessarily usemore strategies, but instead use different combinations of strategies.",

      "abstract": "Teaching a new behavior or skill often involves a multiple-step sequence of telling the student the skill to be performed, showing them examples and non-examples of the skill, allowing the student to practice, providing them with feedback, and then reviewing the skill. In addition, positive practice of the skill after a student makes a mistake in situ can be utilized so that students become more fluent with that behavior. An example combining these approaches is presented for a student exhibiting problems with off-task and disruptive behaviors in an elementary school classroom.",

      "abstract": "The article reveals the causes and features of burnout syndrome in specialists of inclusive resource centers. The main groups of factors that contribute to the formation of burnout are identified, which include: individual personality traits (characterological, self-esteem, education, etc.); organizational (content of work, work overload, working conditions); features of professional activity. There are also recommendations for prevention and assistance to specialists of inclusive resource centers in overcoming the burnout syndrome. The issue of psychoprophylactic measures to prevent and overcome this phenomenon due to the high probability of developing burnout is summarized, the main areas of preventive and rehabilitation care for specialists of inclusive resource centers to overcome, prevent and prevent burnout are summarized. It is proved that with a high probability of developing the syndrome of their professional burnout, the issue of psychoprophylactic measures of prevention and overcoming this phenomenon acquires relevance. There are two main areas of preventive and rehabilitation work. It is proved that the activity of specialists of inclusive-resource centers is characterized by high intensity, saturation of actions, frequent intervention of external factors, a wide network of contacts of different levels, the predominance of direct speech (oral) communication with other people. It is determined that the activity is saturated with many organizational and socio-psychological stresses. And the specifics of the activity causes the presence of various stress-genic situations that create preconditions for the occurrence of professional burnout syndrome. Consequently, professional burnout syndrome is an extremely harmful condition that negatively affects all areas of human activity. Therefore, this phenomenon requires timely diagnosis, individual and group work. It is important to prevent the occurrence of the main symptoms of professional burnout, as well as the formation of skills to effectively overcome professional stress.",

      "abstract": "Learners’ success in remembering reflects their strategic approach to the demands that their memory places on them. Differences in success on memory tasks are usually taken to reveal memory ability; but things are more complicated. Memory performance is determined by the interplay of learners’ goals and motivations and the sophistication of the approaches they bring to a particular learning context. Thus, rememberers are burdened with choosing strategies that most efficiently meet their goals, given conditions at encoding or retrieval. Learners must navigate the costs and benefits of engaging select strategies, beginning with simple decisions such as how to distribute study time and ending with complex scenarios where they must infer superior learning strategies following exposure to an alternative strategy. Learners may modulate their use of beneficial strategies in accord with their goals but are much less successful at bringing completely new strategies to bear when the situation calls for them.",

      "abstract": "In scenarios where a robot generates and executes a plan, there may be instances where this generated plan is less costly for the robot to execute but incomprehensible to the human. When the human acts as a supervisor and is held accountable for the robot's plan, the human may be at a higher risk if the incomprehensible behavior is deemed to be infeasible or unsafe. In such cases, the robot, who may be unaware of the human's exact expectations, may choose to execute (1) the most constrained plan (i.e. one preferred by all possible supervisors) incurring the added cost of executing highly sub-optimal behavior when the human is monitoring it and (2) deviate to a more optimal plan when the human looks away. While robots do not have human-like ulterior motives (such as being lazy), such behavior may occur because the robot has to cater to the needs of different human supervisors. In such settings, the robot, being a rational agent, should take any chance it gets to deviate to a lower cost plan. On the other hand, continuous monitoring of the robot's behavior is often difficult for humans because it costs them valuable resources (e.g., time, cognitive overload, etc.). Thus, to optimize the cost for monitoring while ensuring the robots follow the safe behavior, we model this problem in the game-theoretic framework of trust. In settings where the human does not initially trust the robot, pure-strategy Nash Equilibrium provides a useful policy for the human.",

      "title": "How College life Affects One's Self-esteem Using SPSS Statistics",
      "abstract": "College life can have a significant impact on an individual's self-esteem. Transitioning from high school to college is often accompanied by a number of new experiences and challenges, which may have an impact on how a person views themselves in both positive and negative ways. This stage of life is marked by growing independence, academic pressure, social contacts, and self-discovery, all of which may have an impact on one's self-esteem. The academic demands of college may be challenging, and students may feel immense pressure to excel academically. Struggling to meet these expectations or experiencing setbacks such as poor grades or difficulties comprehending course content may have a negative impact on one's self-esteem. Constant comparison with others, along with the fear of failure, can lead to feelings of inadequacy and poor self-worth. Furthermore, college life involves navigating new social dynamics and forming new connections. Making new acquaintances and integrating into social circles can be challenging for certain individuals, resulting in feelings of isolation, loneliness, and a sense of not belonging. These experiences can have a negative influence on self-esteem as individuals begin to doubt their likability and social abilities. However, there are also beneficial outcomes associated with attending college, such as the chance to improve oneself. In this article, it is explored how the software SPSS is utilized as an analytical tool to investigate the impact of college life on an individual's self-esteem. The impact of college life on an individual's self-esteem is a topic of significant research interest. Understanding this relationship is critical because college is a formative period in a person's life during which they go through many changes and transitions. Developmental stage, academic performance, social relationships, and body image and appearance are some of the key points highlighting the significance of the research. College is a crucial developmental stage during which personal identity exploration, increased autonomy, and the development of social connections all take place. As an individual navigates new experiences and challenges, this period can have a profound impact on their self-esteem. Within the academic performance part, exams, assignments and grading systems are common academic demands in college. Success or failure in these areas can have an impact on a person's self-perception and confidence. Academic achievement, feedback, and educational environments can all be studied to see how they affect self-esteem. Under the heading Social Relationships, college allows students to make new friends, participate in social activities, and build support networks. Positive social interactions can boost self-esteem, whereas social isolation or negative relationships can be harmful. In college, studying social dynamics can shed light on their impact on self-esteem. Under the category of body image and appearance, college can expose students to new societal pressures and expectations, including body image ideals. The study aims to examine the effects of these above mentioned pressures, in conjunction with prospective changes in one's way of life, on the individual's self-esteem and impression of body image. In this study, the software SPSS was utilized as an analytical tool to investigate the impact of college life on an individual's self-esteem. The research will be conducted using the capabilities of the SPSS software. Input Parameters taken as age, Gender, Occupation, Educational Qualification, Where do you reside, and Stream. Process Parameters taken as Rate how your social media affects your self-esteem, Rate how your college life affected your self-esteem, Rate how your self-esteem affects your college life, Rate how your college helps in your development of self-esteem, and Rate how your self-awareness helps in developing your self-esteem. The impact of college on an individual's self-esteem varies greatly depending on the individual and their experiences. However, based on common patterns and observations, some broad conclusions can be drawn. College life can have an impact on self-esteem in both positive and negative ways. On the one hand, the college setting frequently provides opportunities for personal development, academic achievement, and the acquisition of new skills and abilities. Participating in these activities and achieving success can boost self-confidence and improve self-perception. Furthermore, college allows students to meet new people, form friendships, and develop social connections. Positive social interactions and a sense of belonging can help boost self-esteem. One's self-esteem can rise significantly as a result of belonging to a community and experiencing peer acceptance and value",

      "abstract": "CASE DESCRIPTIONThis case study demonstrates workplace bullying and its direct impact on the work of an employee. The case revolves around Karen and her relationship with her supervisor, Dianne. Karen feels intimidated by the hostile, rude and untoward behavior of Dianne which negatively impacts her work and personal life. Karen is unable to concentrate on her work, her performance suffers, and she is left wondering on how to resolve this problem. This case could be used by students when learning about the topic of workplace bullying and stress in Organizational Behavior. This case study would be useful for undergraduates in an Organizational Behavior class. This case has been designed for a 90 minute session slot. The instructor can distribute the case study along with the discussion questions to the students during class time. Students would require approximately 30 minutes of class time to read and prepare answers to the discussion questions.CASE SYNOPSISThis case examines the concept of workplace bullying within a healthcare organization. Workplace bullying can be defined as repeated unwelcome negative act or acts (physical, verbal or psychological intimidation) that can involve criticism and humiliation, intended to cause fear, distress or harm to the target from one or more individuals (Bartlett and Bartlett, 2011: 71). The case revolves around Karen and her supervisor, Dianne. Karen, a pleasant office assistant is confronted with hostile, rude and insulting behavior and comments from her supervisor. The case study traces these various incidents which Karen undergoes at her office. The incidents range from incivility, verbal abuse, unfair criticism and inappropriate performance evaluations. Karen loses her confidence, self-esteem, becomes depressed and stressed out. She starts hating work, is unable to concentrate and wonders about her options.THE VICTIMKaren, 30 years old, African American was an attractive, office assistant at an in-school interactive program (NET), which was affiliated with a large hospital in a rural town in Southwest Georgia. NET was an in-school, interactive program delivered by a staff of nurse educators and support personnel. NET had around 33 full time employees consisting of Registered Nurses (RN), Licensed Practitioner Nurses (LPN), Certified Nurse Assistants (CAN) and an office assistant. NET was part of a large hospital entrusted with the responsibility of providing qualified nurses to all schools located in the nearby counties. It was responsible for educating the school children and the surrounding communities on a variety of healthcare related issues like obesity, hand washing, teenage pregnancies and teen parenting.Karen had joined NET, after graduating from a local Technical College with a Business Administration Certification. She was highly ambitious and wanted to eventually return back to school and obtain a Bachelor Degree in Business Administration from a four year university. She had so far, enjoyed her office work, mentoring new employees and collaborating with coworkers. Her helpful and easy going professional demeanor made Karen highly popular at the office. At personal level, Karen was happily married with a baby girl. Karen, seemed to have things going for her, both personally and professionally.But that was three months back. Now, Karen shuddered and swept the hair back from her face and burst into tears. She felt tired, stressed out and very unhappy. She felt like a failure- no good as mom, wife and working woman. How did this happen? Karen reflected back on the events during the past few months at her workplace.THE PROJECTIt all began, when Karen's supervisor, Dianne asked her to work on a project with her. …",

      "title": "Network More Effectively with This Checklist",
      "abstract": "Networking is frequently thought of as an impromptu activity that is highly dependent on serendipity. I don't buy that. I think that networking can be greatly enhanced by a person's attitude, by planning, and by following some rules of the road. Here are some ideas that have helped me to be a more effective networker. I believe they can help you, as well. Attitude * Make networking an attitude, a way of life. * Remember that reciprocity is at the heart of all networking activities. * Assume that everyone you meet has some information that would be useful to you or your colleagues. Each meeting is an opportunity to seek out that information. * Go out of your way to be helpful to others, even though there may appear to be immediate or direct return. * Don't be reluctant to express admiration for an individual or the company he or she represents. This will go a long way toward explaining your interest in their work. * Try to understand others' perspectives instead of filtering through your own paradigms. * Don't be afraid to admit that you don't know the answer to a question you've been asked. It can be dangerous to guess. However, you may be able to suggest where the answer can be found. * Be clear about your expertise and the resource you can be for others--think about your capability, experience, training, etc. * Allow yourself (and other people) to be recognized as a powerful, effective networker. The balance between seeming arrogant and being humble isn't easy to find, and almost any position will offend someone. Try not to take the inevitable criticism too personally. * Networking involves repeated interactions with another person. You have to live with the consequences of each interaction, both positive and negative. The quality of networking increases as trust is stimulated by repeated, satisfactory exchanges. Similarly, unsatisfactory exchanges can be the death of networking. So, think of the long term. * Don't take on tasks that you have enthusiasm for, because you won't do a good job. There is an art to saying no without causing offense. Planning * Don't wait until you need a network to build one. Building a network takes time and you need to be proactive about doing it. * Develop a network diagram-- encircle yourself with balloons that describe sources of your network (e.g., professional associations, committees, friends, clubs, alumni, etc.). From each balloon, draw lines to the key individuals. Work to develop those key contacts. * Be organized! It can be very frustrating to you and to others to know that you have a paper or report somewhere. Information isn't of value if it's not retrievable. * When attending professional society meetings, examine the attendee list as early as possible for individuals or company representatives whom you should make an effort to meet. * Prepare prior to networking events. Make notes of any specific information that you or your colleagues may need. * Identify target companies as well as people. * Think of things that you can share and also those things that are proprietary and are not to be shared. * When you telephone someone for information, make notes of the topics or issues you wish to cover. It is easy to get involved in a conversation and only remember after you have put the phone down that you forgot a key question. Developing Networks * One way to build a network is to join a professional society. But it doesn't stop there. You need to be an active member. That means running for office, joining a working team, etc. Then you have to do a decent job. * Go out of your way to obtain member address lists from organizations with which you are associated. * Become comfortable hosting or leading a networking meeting. * It is easier to join an existing network when you have something to bring to the party. …",

      "title": "Costs and benefits linked to developments in cognitive control",
      "abstract": "Abstract Developing cognitive control over one's thoughts, emotions, and actions is a fundamental process that predicts important life outcomes. Such control begins in infancy, and shifts during development from a predominantly reactive form (e.g. retrieving task‐relevant information when needed) to an increasingly proactive form (e.g. maintaining task‐relevant information in anticipation of needing it). While such developments are generally viewed as adaptive, cognitive abilities can also involve trade‐offs, such that the benefits of developing increasingly proactive control may come with associated costs. In two experiments, we test for such cognitive trade‐offs in children who are transitioning to proactive control. We find that proactive control predicts expected benefits in children's working memory, but is also associated with predicted costs in disproportionately slowing children under conditions of distraction. These findings highlight unique advantages and disadvantages of proactive and reactive control, and suggest caution in attempting to alter their balance during development.",

      "abstract": "Noise acts by means of the ear on the central and autonomous nervous systems. When this stimulus passes determined limits, it provokes deafness and has pathological effects, both instantaneous and differed, on both nervous systems. At much lower levels, noise produces discomfort, diminishes attention, or impedes communication, concentration and sleep; noise reduces school or professional performance; noise increases the possibility for antisocial behavior; noise can lead to a loss in the value of a building or can cause accidents in the work place. The author describes the importance of this topic, reviews the anatomical-physiological features of the ear, and describes noise and its properties. The author also describes how noise affects our organism, habits, life styles, society, working environment and health. The author finishes by providing some current preventive measures and some recommendations to avoid this pollutant.",

      "abstract": "Having decided on the type of group and broad aims, the next step is to devote time to planning and the formation of the group. The future effectiveness of any group depends on thorough preparation and planning, which are complex tasks. To illustrate this complexity, how should groupworkers respond to contacts from group members between sessions? How should they divide their tasks or negotiate their authority with the group in a way which will not confuse the members or result in conflicts and tensions being played out in the group? How should members be selected and what should groupworkers do if too many or too few referrals are received? What is the inter-relationship between the group's task and size? If this inter-relationship is misconstrued, some members may be left uninvolved or underinvolved in the group's tasks which may prevent the group attaining its goals. Through planning the group practitioners can reflect on and decide their approach to questions concerning the group's structure and operation. If insufficient time or thought is given to planning, leaders may find that their plans are too ambitious or too confusing and threatening for the members. Alternatively, they may experience their leadership as muddled and uncertain, with a consequent loss of confidence in their skills and abilities.",

It is preferable to use types of tasks similar to those worked out in the system of the correctional-developing approach for objectification of dynamic changes results. The performance indicators of the correctional course are qualitative and quantitative changes identified in the proposed control tasks. Tasks, selected as control, reflect the level of development or deficiency of mechanisms, ensuring functioning of individual higher mental functions. The priority is given to the qualitative indicators of completed tasks in relation to specific indicators, whereas the quantitative – pace indicators provide information on the degree of stability, the automation of the requisite types of activities with age taking into account.

      "title": "Support from conversational agent on daily stress for user satisfaction improvement",
      "abstract": "Daily stress is a universally experienced phenomenon in our modern lives [1]. Studies have shown that cumulative stress in daily life can result in cardiovascular disease [2] and psychological or behavioral disorders, such as depression and anxiety [3]. To regulate stress, social sharing is often used as a method. By talking to others, sharers can gain support that help them cope with their stress events [4]. However, people are not always comfortable sharing their stress events with others, such as the stigmatised issues [5]. In addition, people are not always able to find the right person to talk to. Their friends may be tired of hearing about the same issues [6]. Besides, professional help may be too expensive and require long waits [7].With the widespread use of conversational agent (CA), the CA should provide support for the users who encounter with daily stress to help them get socio-emotional benefits and therefore improve the user satisfaction [8]. At the same time, the gender of the CA should be considered as a factor which influence the user satisfaction of daily stress support.MethodsIn this study, we developed a 2 (CA genders)×3 (types of support) between-subject experiment on user satisfaction of CA with daily stress support function. The CA had two types of gender, including male and female. Three support types included control (without stress support function), stress (with stress detection and support function), and stressor (with stress and stressor detection, and provide support targeted at stressor) groups. So, there were six types of CA in this experiment.Participants (N = 76) were asked to share one personal daily stress experience with a CA, which was assigned from the six CAs randomly and provided support via the Wizard-of-Oz method (a human-operated CA).Results &amp; DiscussionResults showed that participants felt better after sharing with the CA in stress group and stressor group, as evidenced by reduced stress intensity. The interaction experience of participants showed that the likeability, enjoyment, and user satisfaction of stress group were significantly higher than that of control group. While, the user satisfaction of stressor group had no significant difference with that of stress group. For the gender the CA, the female CA achieved higher likeability in control group and stress group. Meanwhile, the female CA achieved higher enjoyment, engagement, and user satisfaction in stressor group.According to the interview after the experiment, the participants in the stressor group proposed more requirements for the targeted advice from CA. They explained that they felt the high intelligent level of the CA. So, they were looking forward for the help from the CA for the solution of their daily stress events.ConclusionAccording to the above results, the support for daily stress from CA can improve the user satisfaction. Between different genders of CA, the female CA is more preferred in this study. What’s more, the CA should provide targeted advice for users with different stressors.Reference[1] Piazza, J.

Exploring infants' understanding of failed intentional actions—when the goal of the action is unfulfilled and thus not apparent in the actor's movements—is a critical step in answering this question. Using a visual habituation paradigm, we assessed when infants understand that a failed intentional action is goal directed and whether an understanding of successful intentional actions (actions that do overtly attain their goals) precedes an understanding of failed intentional actions. Results demonstrated that 10- and 12-month-olds recognized the goal directedness of both successful and failed reaching actions. Eight-month-olds also recognized the goal directedness of successful actions, but not of unsuccessful attempts. Thus, by the end of the 1st year of life, infants possess an impressive understanding of intentional action, and an understanding of failed intentional actions follows an earlier understanding of successful ones.",

      "title": "Emotions and Entrepreneurship: The Road Traveled, Boundary Conditions, and New Approaches",
      "abstract": "Interest among entrepreneurship researchers in emotional issues is growing in recognition of the role emotions play in the entrepreneurial process (Shepherd, 2016). A large number of studies on emotions in entrepreneurship examine categories of emotions such as positive or negative affect, moods, or feelings as antecedents to, boundary conditions of, and/or a consequences of, the entrepreneurial process at individual or multiple levels of analysis (Foo, Uy, & Baron , 2009). Yet the study of affect and emotions in entrepreneurship is still an emerging domain. There has been limited work challenging the quality of affect- based scholarship in entrepreneurship with regard to utilization of methodologies or conceptualization of emotions, both of which deserve attention. Further, entrepreneurs experience significant and persistent dilemmas when it comes to experiencing and displaying their emotions, as well as managing and reacting to employees’ or other stakeholders’ emotions. There is, therefore, a need to understand the role of affect, emotions, moods, or feelings at different stages of entrepreneurship and/or at different levels of analysis. It is also useful to pause and take stock of the progress being made in the field to identify what is silent or misrepresented in the growing ‘emotions and entrepreneurship’ literature. There is also a need to provide greater insight into the ways in which entrepreneurs resolve various emotional dilemmas.

      "title": "The Satisficing Principle in Capability Learning",
      "abstract": "Whether an organization has a certain capability is often a matter of degree. Thus, in the context of initial learning of a capability, there is generally no clear-cut or automatic answer to the question of when an organization should be expected to cut back its learning efforts and affirm that the desired capability has been achieved. This paper offers a simple conceptual model for this question, based on the satisficing principle. More specifically, the question addressed is: 'When does overt learning stop?'—where 'overt' learning is understood as being marked by observable allocation of attention and resources to the task of acquiring the capability. The model provides the framework for a discussion of various influences on the aspiration level in the satisficing model, and hence on the nature of the capability that has been achieved when learning stops. Overt learning efforts may be resumed at some time later if external factors operate to lift aspiration levels relevant to the capability. The paper discusses how such 're-ignition' of learning may occur as a result of an organizational crisis, or of the institution of a quality management program.

Although some tests are explicitly designed to assess aspects of EF, all components of the assessment process provide new information to build, test, support, and/or reject a hypothesis regarding EF and EdF. The recommendations provided in this chapter for record review, observation, interview, questionnaires, and rating scales are good practice for any assessment; however, they are particularly critical when evaluating EF, as subtle aspects of EdF can be difficult to capture with standardized testing. It is important to remember that the presence or absence of EdF is not uniformly diagnostic, although EdF may suggest certain diagnostic considerations (see Section II).",

      "abstract": "The article deals with study of responsive communicative actions of recipients in English ideation speeches that are expressed as laughter. English ideation speech is a structured and time-limited oral speech by an ideator using multi-modal actions relevant for communication , that is happening in front of the audience (recipients), directly or indirectly included into communication, that is the same time and space coordinates with the ideator (directly in a studio where the ideator performs live) or at different time and space coordinates (watching recorded performance of the ideator). Ideation speeches are to convey certain ideas to the audience so that they are implemented into social practice. Responsive actions of recipients are implicit-evaluative (number of views of ideation speech video) or explicit-evaluative (comprehensive written evaluation in comments and unexpanded evaluation through choosing evaluating adjectives form a given list). Immediate responsive actions can be spontaneous, initiated by recipients themselves, and non-spontaneous, initiated by the ideator. Spontaneous immediate responsive actions are expressed as laughter, exclamations, applause, that prove communicative success of speech, acceptance of the ideator and the ideator`s idea. Study of responsive actions of recipients gives an opportunity to determine success or failure of a certain initial communicative strategy of ideator. Audience's laughter is the sign of success of the ideator's ommunicative act to change the mode from serious to humorous. Laughter shows that recipients comprehend and understand the point of a joke. In some cases laughter expresses different emotional reactions of recipients, like, for instance, surprise, disgust, excitement, etc.",

      "title": "Intelligence and special talents",
      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter continues our summary of psychological abnormalities in autism from the last chapter, but focuses specifically on intelligence and special talents. This merits its own chapter because of the finding that intelligence is often unusual in autism, and that special abilities are more commonly associated with children with autism than with other conditions. Intelligence is a difficult thing to define. However, we need not get bogged down in definitions here. Instead, for the present purposes, we can define intelligence as those abilities that are measured by IQ (or ‘Intelligence Quotient’) tests. When IQ is measured at different times over a person’s life, it is found to be approximately the same, give or take about 15 points. For example, if a child is in the average IQ range (70-130) at the age of 8 years old, then he or she is also likely to be in this range of scores at any stage in the future. If a person’s IQ is below the average range (i.e.: less than 70) he or she may have difficulties in learning, and require special education. In such cases, people are said to have a mental handicap.",

      "title": "The Influence of Personal Factors on the Process of Facilitative Interaction",
      "abstract": "The purpose of the article is to reveal the personal factors of facilitative interaction that most effectively influence on the successful realization of the subjects' activity in general and cognitive activity in particular. Methods of the research. The following theoretical methods of the research were used to solve the tasks formulated in the article: a categorical method, structural and functional methods, the methods of the analysis, systematization, modeling, generalization. The results of the research. It has been proved that some misunderstandings in the perception of a task or a problem were a major factor affecting facilitative interaction. Another factor that may indirectly cause the effect of the presence of observers is the state of arousal in which a person is performing this task or problem at the time. It was noted that a sufficiently strong level of excitation decreases substantially at the presence of observers, and a weak level – in a case of absence of observers. Consequently, the presence of observers generally facilitates a simple task and impairs the resolution of a complex, incomprehensible or intangible subject. Another factor that needs to be taken into account is the relationship between the disturbance caused by the presence of observers or participants in a joint activity and the performance of that activity, which requires a clear coordination of personal movements or efforts. The skills of «emotional teaching» are defined, which can be called the techniques of pedagogical facilitation (based on empathy, respect, sincerity): teachers ignore the emotional manifestations of their students, thereby causing their aggression; teachers' statements, as a rule, do not correspond to feelings, they are not sincere, except in some cases when they condemn and blame the students; the teacher responds not to the true feelings of each student, but to those that he / she himself / herself imparts to him / her, in his / her own statements he / she only sometimes is sincere, but tries not to express positive emotions; the teacher responds only to the superficial feelings of the student, but does it quite accurately and often he / she is not afraid to express both positive and negative feelings, but does not confirm it aloud, expresses his / her feelings in a non-verbal way; the teacher responds to the hidden, deep feelings of each student, helps students to understand why they feel in such a way, gives a sincere reaction at both verbal and non-verbal levels, both positive and negative, while negative assessment does not diminish the student's self-esteem in any way. Conclusions. The author of the article proposed the personal factors which in a great degree determined the effectiveness of facilitative interaction: a moderate level of anxiety of the person; incomplete (partial) understanding of the teacher's task or problem; the average level of nervous excitement that facilitates the acceptance of facilitative interaction in the process of performing the activity; the emotional presentation of the context of a task or a problem or the emotional teaching of educational material in a case of pedagogical facilitation; compression of the sphere of authoritative influence on pupils; mutual understanding of participants of the facilitative interaction; mutual acceptance of individual psychological qualities of each other; abilities to put oneself on the place of others, to identify himself / herself with them; to actualize trust of participants of facilitative interaction; updating the subjectivity of the person (in this case, the most important are subjective parameters of the teacher's person, which are necessarily taken into account by pupils or students, and they play the important role); the formation of significant psychological status of the personality.",

      "title": "Choosing When to Advise, Coach, or Mentor",
      "abstract": "Faculty members are expected to guide learners across a broad spectrum of topics, ranging from performance milestones and scholarship to career development and well-being. While a learner may be looking for a quick piece of advice, faculty may see a need for ongoing performance improvement. Alternatively, the learner may want mentoring, while the faculty member plans to offer a single bit of advice. Misaligned expectations can be frustrating for faculty (when a trainee does not appear to listen or act on the guidance offered) and for a trainee, who fails to obtain the desired input. For successful guidance to occur, learner and faculty expectations must be made explicit, and the approaches and time commitments must match the aims of the session.Faculty and trainees lack common, clear terminology surrounding various forms of guidance. Many learners are assigned, or select, advisors and mentors. The recent introduction of “coaching” to the mix has often been done without clarifying similarities, differences, and potential overlap of these roles.Advising, coaching, and mentoring are 3 distinct approaches to providing guidance. Coaching with wisdom combines elements of coaching and mentoring.Each approach has a specific purpose, requires different (but overlapping) expertise, and uses different strategies. Explicit consideration of the 3 approaches and their features can facilitate tailoring these sessions and aligning expectations and plans to goals.An advisor offers strategies about a specific event, which the learner may or may not follow. Mentoring implies a long-term relationship in which experiential wisdom is offered to help build the many aspects of a learner's career. Explicitly stating that your role is to “coach” means that you will help the learner identify a goal and develop solutions through nondirective questions. This process results in the learner identifying strategies that he or she can comfortably employ, increasing the likelihood of follow-through.Understand the continuum of guidance and differentiate advising from coaching from mentoring.The table is a synopsis of the literature based on work that sought to clarify these definitions. Learning about each strategy will help you clarify nuances and allow you to use relevant skills.Explicitly ask the learner what guidance he or she is seeking, align your approach, and explain what you will be providing. Learners do not always know what they want (or need). Clarifying short- and long-term goals can help you select the right strategy and better meet expectations. Once a strategy is selected, discuss with the learner what will and what will not be covered in your interactions.Enjoy the interaction. Watching the “light bulb go on,” seeing progress being made and careers developing, is why many are involved in medical education.Be cautious about switching roles during an interaction. In coaching, the learner develops an individualized plan through questioning. When you have expertise in the area, it is easy to switch into the mentor role. Some call that “coaching with wisdom.” Be very clear that you have switched roles by saying, for example, “I am mentoring you now.” Then switch back to coaching when appropriate.Close each interaction by soliciting feedback to help you improve your use of all strategies. Reflect on how well you stayed in the role, and ask the learner directly. Feedback on the usefulness of your technique allows for deliberate practice of the various guidance strategies and helps you improve in carrying out this role.Review your program's use of the terms advising, coaching, and mentoring. Share the definitions with colleagues. Make sure that all advisors, mentors, and coaches clarify terms, especially when talking with learners.Seek out opportunities to deliberately practice different skills with different levels of learners in different settings and with different topics/focus. When asked for your input, think about what strategy to use. Select words that differentiate advising versus coaching versus mentoring (eg, advising, “You should . . .”; coaching, “What could you do?”; mentoring, “In my experience, this has worked.”).Provide training to faculty and learners on the differences across the spectrum of guidance. Define key features of each method and practice explicitly defining roles during role-plays. Encourage those who are frequently sought out by learners to share techniques that work and those that do not. Take advantage of opportunities to practice with feedback in a low-stakes environment.",

People find meaning in diverse places, so the questions (needs for meaning) may be more constant than the answers. Self-rated meaningfulness often emphasizes family, love, work, and religion, some of which seem little more than basic animal drives embellished with meaningfulness. Self-rated meaningfulness rises and falls in response to mundane events, increasing after seeing simple orderly patterns and while performing routines, and decreasing after interpersonal rejection. Searching for meaning is largely uncorrelated with finding or having it. Applying meaning to life may increase its incompleteness. Self-rated happiness correlates with meaningfulness, but important differences exist, including differential relevance of goal satisfaction, time span, interpersonal relations, stressful involvements, and self-expression.",

      "abstract": "The influence of experience on performance is present in any policy of scheduling of work, but usually the experience obtained during the scheduling horizon is not taken into account. In effect, a necessary element for task scheduling is a relation of the tasks that a worker is able to do, and this is, at least in part, a consequence of experience. Moreover, the training plans can include forced assignment of tasks to obtain future capacities. A static point of view neglects the effect of the experience obtained during the planned horizon on the performance of the same horizon period. This effect is sometimes really negligible – when we are planning a period too short to generate signifying experience on the tasks involved – but often it is not. Thus, when scheduling a set of tasks the experience acquired in the first stages can influence the capacity of the worker to do other tasks of the same set later. In spite of this, the consideration of the influence on the performance in a task of the experience on other tasks has not been treated in the literature, probably due to the hard computational problem that this generates.",

      "title": "Transform Role Modeling Into SUPERmodeling",
      "abstract": "* Abbreviation:\n SUPER — : increasing self-awareness, helping the unconscious become conscious, plan debriefing, and encourage reflection\n\nRole modeling is the process by which a learner observes a clinical teacher to develop and refine his or her practice. Compared to other learning methods, role modeling is inherently student driven and may occur with or without the clinical teacher’s awareness.1,2 Perhaps this is why learners often experience poor role modeling behaviors,2 and clinician teachers struggle to identify role modeling opportunities.3 Although role modeling is traditionally considered a passive or implicit learning method, newer evidence suggests clinical teachers can transform the role modeling process into a more explicit teaching method to enhance the development of their leaners.2,4\n\nClinical teachers serve a critical role in shaping attitudes and behaviors of future generations of physicians. Role modeling can be effectively used to teach challenging clinical skills such as verbal and nonverbal communication, humanism, professionalism, and teamwork.1 Role modeling may also be the most effective and efficient learning method in busy clinical environments or when a patient care task is beyond the learner’s current clinical abilities.5 A learner’s observations of the clinician teacher’s behaviors may influence his or her professional development and career decisions.5,6 Unfortunately, not all experiences are positive. Learners commonly witness unprofessional behavior and report difficulty identifying positive role models.7 Furthermore, learners may perceive observation experiences as … \n\nAddress correspondence to Nicholas M.

      "abstract": "In learned helplessness experiments, subjects first expe- rience a lack of control in one situation, and then show learning deficits when performing or learning another task in another situation. Generalization, thus, is at the core of the learned helplessness phenomenon. Substantial experimental and theoretical effort has been invested into establishing that a state- and task-independent belief about controllability is necessary. However, to what extent generalization is also sufficient to explain the transfer has not been examined. Here, we show qualitatively and quantitatively that Bayesian learning of action-outcome contingencies at three levels of abstraction is sufficient to account for the key features of learned helplessness, including escape deficits and impairment of appetitive learning after inescapable shocks.",

      "abstract": "In this chapter, the discussion will focus on another type of interpretable behavior, namely legibility. The notion of legibility allows the robot to implicitly communicate information about its goals, plans (or model, in general) to a human observer. For instance, consider a human robot cohabitation scenario consisting of a multi-tasking robot with varied capabilities that is capable of performing a multitude of tasks in an environment. In such a scenario, it is crucial for the robot to aid the human's goal or plan recognition process, as the human observer may not always know the robot's intentions or objectives beforehand. Hence, in such cases, it may be useful for the robot to communicate information that the human is unaware of. As the better off the human is at identifying the robot's goals or plans accurately, the better off is the overall team performance. However, explicit communication of objectives might not always be suitable. For instance, the what, when, and how of explicit communication may require additional thought. Further, several other aspects like cost of communication (in terms of resources or time), delay in communication (communications signals may take time to reach the human), feasibility of communication (broken or unavailable sensors), etc., may also need to be considered. On the other hand, the robot can simply synthesize a behavior that implicitly communicates the necessary information to the human observer.",

So, too, do developmental psychologists. This chapter addresses the fit between what parents believe and what psychologists have concluded, concentrating especially on two issues. The nature–nurture issue concerns the interplay of biological and environmental factors in the determination of development, including beliefs about the relative importance of the two forces and about particular environmental contributors, including parents. The continuity–discontinuity issue concerns the extent to which psychological functioning is characterized by consistency or change. As applied to development, the question is whether developmental change is a matter of incremental, quantitative change or whether qualitative change also occurs. As applied to children’s competencies and characteristics, the question is whether children’s behavior and the rules that govern it are consistent or variable across different tasks and different contexts.",

People who have a fixed mindset about intelligence are motivated to appear capable, which leads them to avoid challenge, respond negatively to setbacks, and engage in other maladaptive behaviors known as a helpless learning style. People who have a growth mindset, or believe intelligence can increase through effort, are motivated to learn, which leads to a mastery-oriented learning style where they seek challenge and work through difficulty with greater effort and persistence. People also have mindsets about other human characteristics, such as personality. Those who believe that basic traits cannot change tend to attribute others' behavior to dispositional causes, expect more behavioral, consistency across situations, endorse stronger punishment for transgressions, and engage in more stereotypical thinking about others.",

      "abstract": "Mindsets are implicit beliefs about whether human qualities are fixed or malleable that influence people's goals, behavior, and thought in important ways. People who have a fixed mindset about intelligence are motivated to appear capable, which leads them to avoid challenge, respond negatively to setbacks, and engage in other maladaptive behaviors known as a helpless learning style. People who have a growth mindset, or believe intelligence can increase through effort, are motivated to learn, which leads to a mastery-oriented learning style where they seek challenge and work through difficulty with greater effort and persistence. People also have mindsets about other human characteristics, such as personality. Those who believe that basic traits cannot change tend to attribute others' behavior to dispositional causes, expect more behavioral, consistency across situations, endorse stronger punishment for transgressions, and engage in more stereotypical thinking about others.",

      "abstract": "Abstract When parents have tried everything and their child is still struggling with compliance, routines, and other serious behaviors, you can suggest a more intensive point/token system. The rationale for this type of system is that children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) respond better to frequent, immediate rewards over delayed rewards. The overall goal of the home point/token system is to make the expected behaviors very explicit and to provide more frequent rewards or consequences contingent on an explicit set of behaviors, using a more structured system of reinforcement. For a system like this to work effectively, it must be implemented consistently across caregivers, which is challenging for many parents. Keeping the system simple and straightforward tends to work best, especially as parents are first learning the principles. It may also be helpful to begin by focusing on one time of day to acclimate parents to the system, later expanding to other times of the day.",

      "title": "Using Construal level Theory to Deter the Social Desirability Bias",
      "abstract": "The social desirability bias is the tendency of\nrespondents to adjust their responses or behavior in such a way as\nto present themselves in socially acceptable terms. The systematic\nbias introduced by the social desirability bias threatens the\nlegitimacy of empirical research by confounding a phenomenon of\ninterest with impression management behavior, thus obscuring\nresearch results and potentially triggering false conclusions. When\nthe social desirability bias is a concern (e.g., when asking\nsocially sensitive, embarrassing, or private questions),\nresearchers commonly use techniques such as indirect questioning to\navoid this bias. By asking respondents how most or the typical\nperson would respond (i.e, referring to a third party target) the\nrespondent transcends from an egocentric focus on his or her own\nunflattering attitudes or behavior onto that of an ambiguous\ntarget. Given the target’s indistinctness respondents project their\nown feelings, attitudes, behaviors, or beliefs when responding\nwhile remaining psychologically distanced from the true, yet\nsocially undesirable response. According to construal level theory\nthis process of “transcendence” is possible because individuals are\nable to form abstract mental construals (Trope and Liberman 2010).\nThis mental construal process is essential to recalling the past,\nempathizing with others, and visualizing future events. We propose\nthat when presented with an indirect question, respondents increase\ntheir mental construal to project a response onto the third party\ntarget. As mental construals increase, individuals refocus from\ndetailed, incidental features to central, fundamental\ncharacteristics (Trope and Liberman 2010). Consequently, we propose\nthat indirect questioning prompts respondents to deemphasize the\ncontextual demand to engage in impression management behavior by\nincreasing construal levels. This research serves three primary\npurposes. First, we propose construal level theory as a theoretical\nexplanation for indirection questioning. Second, we explore how\npsychological distances and construal level effectively reduce\nsocial desirability bias. Lastly, we test our theoretical model\nwithin a consumer choice context including sustainable products. We\nintegrate construal level theory with projective measurement\ntheory, thus extending knowledge in both domains. In Study 1, we\ninvestigate the association of seven commonly used marketing scales\nwith measures of socially desirable responding. As a preliminary\ndemonstration that increasing construal levels decreases the social\ndesirability bias, we manipulate the psychological distance of\nthese scales to reduce their association with socially desirable\nresponding measures. Results indicate that whereas indirect\nquestioning increasing social or spatial distance reduces the\nassociation with desirable responding measures, indirect\nquestioning increasing temporal distance magnifies this\nassociation. Study 2 further investigates the relationship between\nconstrual level and the social desirability bias through a product…",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is increasingly becoming a problem in modern working life. A large proportion of the work force is confronted with long working hours and overtime. In some areas such as police work, surgery rooms and shipping it is common that people work at night. When people have to work continuously for long hours, especially at night, performance can seriously be affected by fatigue. Studies carried out at our laboratory show that fatigue effects can be compensated by the manipulation of psycho-social factors in the work environment. A satisfactory performance level can be better maintained when people work in the presence of others, as opposed to working alone. Furthermore, group performance can be kept up to the mark by addressing the group members individually, either by giving them an incentive for individual performance, or by providing them with feedback on their individual results, instead of on the group result only.",

      "title": "THE INNER GAME CONCEPT AS A METHOD OF MUSIC COACHING",
      "abstract": "Maximizing musician’s potential and creating effective performing skills in the process of their musical education and during the further professional development, as well as overcoming their own fears, doubts and limiting beliefs, particularly during performing in public, are still actual tasks both for musicians and their teachers.One effective approach to developing musician's creative potential is coaching. Coaching is based on a dialogue between the coach and the student (coachee); the coach proposes a series of questions aimed on assisting the student in finding their own solution of the problem. It has been known for a long time that the inner state of a person significantly impacts effectiveness of their actions. The Inner Game concept proposed by Timothy Gallwey is a coaching methodology designed to overcome inner obstacles in reaching person’s goals. Those obstacles are of mental nature and include loss of concentration, nervousness and self-doubt. What distinguishes the Inner Game from other coaching methods is that it utilizes statements and tasks that often do not require the student’s verbal answer (moreover, such verbal answer often cannot be given at all), but rather stimulate them to pay attention to their senses and to experiment (for example, in finding optimal position during playing an instrument or choosing proper dynamics for a certain music piece).The first principle of the Inner Game points out the fact that the quality of person’s performance depends not only on their potential (talent, skills, knowledge, etc.), but also on the level of self-interference (mental digression, untimely self-criticism, lack of confidence, fear, etc.).Traditional approach to improving performance suggests working on increasing the potential; the idea of the Inner Game is to decrease self-interference in order to bring the quality of the performance as close to the potential as possible.To describe the inner dialogue taking place inside person’s mind, notions of Self 1 and Self 2 are used. Self 1 is the source of self-interference, it contains person’s ideas about how the thins should be, their judgements and associations. Self 2 is our inner potential, it includes our natural talents, abilities and skills. The methods of the Inner Game are used to decrease self-interference (impact of the Self 1) and help the performer to enter the ideal state during performance, the state of relaxed concentration.",

      "abstract": "If motivation is the desire to act or move toward a particular activity, task or goal, just what influences one’s desire to do so remains complex. The impact of social context, or even just the perception of social context, can greatly influence what one attributes to their sense of self, as conveyed in attribution theory (AT), their perception of self-worth, as conveyed in self-worth theories (SWT) and subsequently their mindset and their behaviour to act, as conveyed in self-determination theory (SDT). Even more unclear is exactly what role the education system plays in fostering/hindering one’s motivation to learn. It is clear however, that the structure of the education system, the influence of educator’s actions and attitudes (whether deliberate or inadvertent), and the nature of peer competition can act as detrimental forces on the impact of one’s sense of ability and self. Educational policy that is created based on generalizations about universally innate human abilities, needs and drives, makes the question of how to foster intrinsically motivated students in schools even more challenging. Outside school programs such as Motivate Canada, which aim to foster motivation in youth by strengthening their self-confidence, and in-school programs, such as Inter-A, which aims to generate intrinsic, mastery orientated motivation, may not address all the complex factors underlying student motivation, but are a good start. Subsequently, motivational theories, despite their inconclusiveness provide hope that for students to grow into emotionally well-adjusted adults prepared to constructively contribute to our societies.",

      "abstract": "Learning organizations constantly question and make appropriate changes in their models. Mental models include the images, assumptions, and stories that everyone carries around in his/her mind---personal mindsets of what an individual considers to be reality. For example, high work performance or service quality are to an individual worker what he or she considers them to be. Mental models are important to organizations for two reasons: (1) they can often account for why two or more workers can observe the same phenomena and arrive at very different conclusions as to what has occurred; and (2) there can be few fundamental or lasting changes in an organization without first changing the mental mindsets of managers and employees. Several activities can be used to familiarize employees with terms such as mental models, paradigms, and paradigm shifts. The game Leaping to Conclusions introduces learners to the concepts of inferencing and mindsets, illustrating how previous experiences and personal mindsets influence the way people interpret everyday events. Made in the USA focuses on the coiccp: of paradigm shift. Side Effects brings participants' attention to the many compromises and adjustmaats that accompany almost all paradigm shifts.

Executive functions, which include working memory, inhibitory control, and attentional shifting are fundamental to cognitive strategies supporting effective self-regulation of emotions and behaviors. Executive functions include cognitive processes associated with working memory, inhibitory control, and attentional shifting. Deficits in these cognitive processes are found along with the dysregulated emotionality characteristic of anxiety disorders and depression. Effective emotion regulation is associated with prosocial behavior, social connections, strong working memory, and better physical and mental health. Executive functions – attentional shifting, working memory, and inhibitory control – are the underlying cognitive processes supporting effective self-regulation of emotions and behaviors. Anxiety disorders are associated with deficits in each of the traditional constructs of executive functions as well as cognitive reappraisal.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive behavior in interpersonal relations is always connected with time characteristics such as sequence, rhythm, and succession of actions. In our research we attempted to determine the role of time parameters in the development of the following social communications: (a) interpersonal relations, (b) communicative acts, and (c) the process of structuring social behavior. We intended to show the role of time in acquiring and mastering social contacts. In our research we outlined a number of methods for developing time competence and various conscious and unconscious ways to organize time and to create an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, and trust in interpersonal nonverbal communication. The time characteristics of social behavior and its nonverbal manifestation can exert a positive influence on communicative activity and can determine time competence in communication. Ignoring time parameters in the self-realization and self-actualization of personality introduces a certain destructive element into the process of interpersonal relations; hence the necessity of teaching competence in communication arises. Teaching is carried out in the process of training and includes several stages: the introductory stage and the stages of intensification, integration, avoidance, and others. Thus, time management and the process of teaching time management allow one to discover time resources for the self-organization of one’s personality over a lifetime.",

Every school, institution and organization has their own disciplinary rules to act as a guidance or material for controlling behavior of the people within that organization. Thus discipline is very important in order for an organization to run efficiently and smoothly. However, in every organization, there were several employees that have disciplinary problem such as sexual harassment, absenteeism, punctuality issues, and fighting with colleagues. Such problems can jeopardize organizations whereby it may give negative impact to the organization such as fall in productivity. Consequently, disciplinary action needs to be done in order to set a good example to other person that wrongful act will eventually faced consequences. However, when talk about disciplinary action, there are several question arise, such as, how effective the disciplinary action in resolving the problem? What are the obstacles that administrator faced in conducting it? It is commonly known that administrator who involve in disciplinary action procedure may face problems and challenges while conducting it. Therefore, in this study, there are four independent variables that been identified which become the main challenges for the administrator in conducting disciplinary procedures and which among the factors that affect the implementation of disciplinary action procedure.",

      "abstract": "The work deals with two issues. The first one refers to ways and processes in which the mark affects some important aspects of personality, i.e., the educational effect of the mark. The other is related to some specific features of age at the beginning of schooling: difficulties in understanding a generalised and abstract mark, incapability of making out the difference between the concrete (the mark for an individual activity) and the general mark (the mark of the child's personality in general), and finally in the inclination of the younger children to look for the reasons of failure in their surroundings, rather than in personal factors. The work brings the author's opinion that evaluating may have a broader educational effect and importance in developing certain aspects of personality. This could be achieved not only by evaluating final results of child's activity, but by evaluating the course of the activity, that is process evaluating, i.e., by constant drawing attention to actions that lead to the final result. Therefore, it is not the question whether to evaluate pupils at the beginning of their schooling, but what and how to evaluate.",

Stress can slow down a person’s well-being activities. Often, you might not know whether you are stressed, if you are under too much stress, or when it is time to seek help. This paper presents a mathematical model with time delay subject to a person’s stress for early stress detection to assess whether a person is stress-free, has stress but is undetected, or has stress in any specific state such as minor, moderate, or severe stress. Being more alert to the effects of stress and reducing the uncertainty of undetected stress, or better, preventing it, may help people, especially teens, manage it more effectively and cope better, even a person happens to be stressed. The model can be extended to study the effects of multiple stress factors in light of the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic on people’s mental stress.",

      "abstract": "The literature overwhelmingly demonstrates that feelings of ease are good and that objects that are easy to process are much liked. We propose, and demonstrate across three experiments, that this is not the case when people are pursuing a goal. This is because people pursuing a goal (e.g., “become kinder”) usually invest efforts in whichever means (e.g., donate to a particular charity) they perceive as most instrumental for attaining their goal. Consequently, in their minds there is a correspondence between instrumentality of a means and feelings of effort. This correspondence becomes reversed in people's minds during goal pursuit, and they also come to view an object that is associated with feelings of effort rather than ease as more instrumental for goal attainment and consequently more desirable. When an object is not a means to fulfill an accessible goal, or when goals relating to the means are not accessible, subjective feelings of ease improve evaluation, as found in previous research on ease of processing.",

      "abstract": "Obtener recompensas de cualquier conducta o secuencia de estas en diferentes esferas de nuestra vida depende en gran medida de la capacidad que tengamos de comprender la s caracteristicas de los estimulos antecedentes y consecuentes de las mismas. En el ambito deportivo, poder anticipar que firmeza va a tener el cesped al llegar a un nuevo estadio, que peso tendra el balon con el que jugaremos o que acciones va a emprender nuestro rival durante el encuentro en los diferentes momentos del mismo es esencial para el exito deportivo. Para realizar estas predicciones y que resulten certeras y utiles es necesario percibir de forma simple, rapida y ajustada el contexto que nos rodea. ?Es esto posible? No parece que lo sea si no se cuenta con la habilidad para reconocer los objetos de estimulo partiendo de caracteristicas invariantes comunes a todos los de su categoria; es decir, para que la percepcion sea simple, rapida y ajustada es necesario contar con algo mas que el proceso puro, contar con elementos que seleccionen a que atender y a que no, que buscar y que obviar, categorias al fin y al cabo (Bruner, 1957a; Hoffman, 1996).\n\nAsi, el proceso perceptivo es selectivo, activo y directivo:\n\na) Selectivo, en cuanto que se atiende a unos elementos estimulares ignorando otros, con lo que se reduce el monto de informacion que recolectar y se procesa solo la que tiene mayor importancia (Garrido, 2004). Se atiende a la longitud, densidad y humedad del cesped del campo en el que jugaremos, sin tener en cuenta la informacion relativa al firme del tunel de vestuarios o al estado del cesped colindante al banquillo.\n\nb) Activo ya que lo que se percibe se suma a la idea o esquema perceptual previo del perceptor, lo que permite guiar procesos perceptivos posteriores y facilitar la asimilacion y manejo de la nueva informacion (Garrido, 2004). Se buscaran las zonas despobladas de cesped en un campo que en temporadas anteriores presentaba una superficie degradada y esa nueva informacion completara la idea del terreno con la que se cuenta.\n\nc) Directivo ya que lo percibido guiara las acciones al permitir anticipar sus consecuencias (Dijksterhuis y Bargh, 2001).\n\nLos objetivos genericos de este trabajo de investigacion consisten en actualizar y desarrollar de los estudios acerca de Percepcion Social en deporte, abriendo campos aun no abordados como la percepcion de objetos y tratando de ampliar y puntualizar hallazgos en los estudios de formacion de primeras impresiones.\n\nAsi, se presentaran dos investigaciones, la primera centrada en la Percepcion Social de objetos relevantes en el ambito deportivo y la segunda orientada al estudio de las primeras impresiones en deporte y su correlato conductual.\n\nEl estudio de la Percepcion Social de objetos, centrado en el impacto del valor subjetivo otorgado a los balones, persigue dos objetivos generales:\n\na) Iniciar el ambito de estudio acerca de la percepcion de objetos en deporte.\n\nb) Aportar nuevas metodologias de evaluacion a la investigacion general sobre percepcion de objetos, entendiendo que las limitaciones tecnicas del pasado pudieron tener una influencia definitiva en los resultados contradictorios encontrados.\n\nEl estudio acerca de las primeras impresiones en deporte pretende completar el conocimiento que ya se tiene acerca de la importancia de factores propios del conocimiento previo de la situacion y provenientes de la observacion directa, ahondando en temas que no habian sido aun abordados aunque si insinuados en la literatura.\n\nAl inicio de cada investigacion se explicitaran los objetivos concretos de la misma asi como las hipotesis de investigacion.",

      "abstract": "The capacities for formulating goals, planning, and carrying out plans effectively - the executive functions - are essential for independent, creative, and socially constructive behavior. Although they tend to be vulnerable to brain impairment, they are often overlooked in neuropsychological and neurological examinations. Reasons why there are few formalized examination procedures for evaluating executive functions are suggested. Prefrontal contributions and the importance of other brain areas (e.g., subcortical, right hemisphere) to executive functions are discussed. Assessment techniques are presented for evaluating four categories of executive capacities: (1) goal formulation, (2) planning, (3) carrying out goal-directed plans, and (4) effective performance. The Tinkertoy Test®, which can provide information about these capacities, is described in some detail. Need for further exploration in this area is emphasized. Etre capable de formuler des buts, élaborer des plans et les exécuter effectivement sont “les fonctions exécutives” essentielles à l'existence de conduites autonomes, créatives et socialement constructives. Bien que ces fonctions soient vulnérables en cas d'atteintes cérébrales, elles sont souvent négligées dans les examens neurologiques et neuropsychologiques. Les raisons de cette carence au niveau de l'évaluation formelle sont évoquées. La contribution des aires préfrontales et d'autres aires cérébrales (par ex. les structures souscorticales, hémisphériques droites) aux “fonctions exécutives” est également discutée. On présente des procédés d'évaluation pour quatre catégories de capacités executives: (1) la formulation d'un but; (2) la planification de l'action; (3) l'exécution orientée du plan; et (4) la performance effectivement réalisée. On décrit en outre et en détail le Tinkertoy test®, qui semble capable de fournir des informations en relation avec ces capacités.

Research approach -- A serious game was made to train players in performing the primary triage procedure in a large scale crisis situation. With this game, a number of game design decisions are systematically varied and the subsequent corresponding effects on learning gains, mental model construction and perceived engagement empirically tested. Findings -- While the game has been successful in training the triage procedure, the use of auditory guidance cues has led to worse mental model construction. Research limitations/Implications -- A triage consists of mostly procedural information, and the empirically tested guidelines are only tested in one game, making the possibility of generalization to other games and game types unclear. In addition, only the effects with relatively short play times are measured. Originality/Value -- Many serious games struggle to effectively convey their instructional material to the player. Conventional game design practice may even harm serious games; we seek to measure what works and what doesn't. Take away message -- When designing a serious game, pay careful attention to how much you task the player, subtle changes can make a big difference.",

Existing research focuses on four stages of a project: Forming, Storming, Norming and Adjourning. This research adds a fifth stage, Post-Project Collaboration, as this stage is implicitly or explicitly a part of most research projects. For example, a post-doctoral researcher expects to be credited for their work even if it is published after the end of the project. The specific challenges for each of the five stages are identified. This enables the leader to focus on a manageable number of challenges at each stage. Trust should be built during the first stage to cover four specific topics: Trust in the leader, process, evaluation method and trust in being credited in published work. Conflict does not emerge as a challenge at the initial stages but later.",

      "abstract": "The study provides some philosophical reflections on the creativity of artificial in-telligence. The study supposes that artificial intelligence can be considered creative only if it creates something new with help of imagination (or its equivalent) and ap-pealing to the so-called “background” (background and general knowledge, biases, competencies, experience, habits, intuition, prejudices, political preferences, skills, stereotypes, values, and others), and its creative activity must be either necessary or arbitrary. Necessary creative activity is related to the solution of specific tasks, for example, within the framework of technical invention or scientific discovery. Arbitrary creative activity is associated with spontaneous, aimless and inexpedient human activity. This type of creative activity takes place when a creative doer has free time, leisure, enthusiasm (hobby), plays a game or is bored. Based on the two types of creative activity, two types of creative artificial intelligence can be distinguished: a weak creative artificial intelligence that makes necessary creative activities related to the tool nature of artificial intelligence, specifically to effectively solving specific problems and tasks, and a strong creative artificial intelligence that makes arbitrary creative activities, that is, creates for the sake of creating alone. The strong creative artificial intelligence can be possible only if the artificial intelligence is given autono-my, the freedom to manage that autonomy, and learns to manage its freedom.",

      "title": "The secret to saying no: A decision framework for physicians",
      "abstract": "Physicians are often inundated with opportunities in the bustling world of academic medicine. The plethora of options, ranging from research projects to committee roles, can both excite and overwhelm. Those eager to seize every opportunity risk overcommitment and burnout, while those more deliberate and cautious risk missing out on meaningful and formative experiences. The key to navigating this landscape lies in being strategic about which opportunities to pursue. Before jumping into any new commitment, it is crucial to develop a personal framework for decision-making (Figure 1). This framework should not revolve around roles, titles, or projects but rather around a singular question: \"What is the problem I am trying to solve?\" Focusing on this simple yet admittedly daunting question can help align your short-term decisions about how to spend your time with your long-term vision and goals. Start developing your framework by articulating your career vision, thinking at the problem level, not the project level. This approach orients you towards a longer-term vision even when making near-term decisions about projects and activities. Think of the problem as an umbrella shielding you from the raindrops of distractions and irrelevant tasks. The most important things you are working on, those projects and activities that directly contribute to solving the problem in question, go near the umbrella's center, where they are most protected. Those less relevant are positioned near the umbrella's periphery, while those without relevance are not covered by the umbrella at all. Your goal should be to do more things that fit close to the center of that umbrella, fewer things that fall toward the periphery, and little to none of the things that fall outside the umbrella. Every opportunity should prompt you to reassess what is under your umbrella; the umbrella is the framework through which you view each opportunity. When an opportunity seems to fit somewhere under your umbrella, it is tempting to say, \"Heck yeah.\" However, we often commit to new opportunities quickly without fully understanding what we are getting into, why we were asked, or whether it makes sense to take them now. The answers to a few key questions can help provide perspective. Understanding why you were chosen can help you assess whether the opportunity aligns with your skills and goals. Others may see skills in you or connections to your goals that you may have yet to appreciate or envision you in roles you might not otherwise have considered. Additionally, the benefits of some opportunities may only be evident once you have more information. Clarifying its urgency helps you understand whether you need to prioritize the opportunity in the short term and, if so, how saying yes might affect your other commitments. This question can help you negotiate your involvement and ensure you only take on what you can realistically manage. At this stage, you would also want to inquire about time commitment, both effort and duration. Sometimes, a short-term commitment is manageable, while a long-term one is not, or a small amount of effort is feasible while a large amount is not. Assess how the opportunity aligns with the problem you are trying to solve and your overall career vision. It may be wise to postpone if it is on the periphery and decline if it is not under the umbrella. Every new commitment requires time and energy. If the opportunity is close to the center of your umbrella, consider what you might give up if you accept this new task or role. Once you have identified your central problem, map out your current and potential commitments under your umbrella. This exercise helps you visualize where each activity fits relative to your central goal. Activities near the umbrella's center are high priority, while those towards the edges or outside the umbrella's protection may need to be reconsidered or declined. Let us consider a practical example. Suppose you are an early career physician passionate about improving transitions of care. Your problem could be stated as \"I work to ensure that patients discharged from the hospital remain in the best health possible.\" You receive an invitation to join a new committee tasked with deciding whether the hospital should switch to a different electronic health record vendor. While this committee is addressing an important issue, you must evaluate whether and how it aligns with your personal problem statement. Using the umbrella framework, you might realize that while a different electronic health record could have features that improve some aspects of care transitions, such as clarity of discharge instructions or algorithms to identify drug interactions, it may not align as closely with your goal as other potential opportunities, such as joining a readmission prevention task force or participating in a project testing whether a predischarge telehealth huddle with outpatient providers reduces 30-day readmissions compared with standard of care. This realization might lead you to decline the committee invitation or suggest a more focused role that directly ties into your primary objective (Table 1). Saying no is not easy. When you pass on or decline opportunities, it is human nature to feel some regret–whether it is from letting someone down or feeling that you have missed out on a life-changing opportunity—even when you know that you have made the right decision for yourself. It is okay to take some time to process that regret. One of the most challenging aspects of managing commitments is freeing up bandwidth for high-priority tasks. Saying yes to an opportunity that fits in the center of your umbrella may require stepping back from a current commitment. For instance, if you are involved in multiple committees, consider whether and how each one directly contributes to your central goal. It may be time to step down from some roles to make space for more relevant activities. This can be a difficult decision, especially if you have invested significant time and effort into these roles. However, prioritizing your central problem will lead to more meaningful and impactful work. It is also important to remember that stepping away or saying \"not anymore\" gives someone else an opportunity that may be closer to the center of their umbrella. There are times when you know you should decline an opportunity, but it feels nearly impossible to do so. For example, you may have some immutable commitments or life circumstances that limit your availability or capacity, or you know deep down that the opportunity does not align with either your actual or aspirational skillset. In these moments, remember that saying no to some opportunities is also a trait of good leaders. If you are not confident that you can fully commit, it can be better for the group, division, or institution to have someone else step in while you wait for a more opportune moment or for an opportunity that aligns better with your goals and circumstances.1 Physicians must navigate a complex landscape of opportunities. By developing a clear framework for decision-making and asking the right questions, you can make informed choices that align with your long-term vision. While saying \"no\" to some opportunities that come your way is not easy, sometimes it is necessary and worthwhile. The authors have no funding to report. The author declares no conflict of interest.",

      "title": "The Dark side of helping: Escalation of commitment",
      "abstract": "In the real world, employees may be presented with difficult tasks that could be tackled in multiple ways and with available resources. On top of this, with deadlines, few external resources, and other tasks that employees typically face, thinking tends to be narrowed and so do the actions that follow. This could lead to a persistent course of action that leads to failure. We call this situation escalation of commitment. When our coworkers offer help and we are stuck and have invested time and effort into near-impossible tasks, is it worth accepting this offer of help? Or, would we rather risk more time and resources and instead persist in solving this near impossible problem? In the latter option, the individual may experience burnout and stress. For the organization, deadlines would not be met, and objectives could not be accomplished. My research looks at these helping behaviours and whether they lead others astray in an escalation of commitment. Specifically, I predict that individuals who have invested in a failing course of action are less likely to abandon this path when they receive help from others. This intersection of escalation and helping behaviours are important because when employees attempt to help a coworker who is invested in an extremely difficult task, they may be doing more harm than good.",

      "abstract": "Abstract From playing basketball to ordering at a food counter, we frequently and effortlessly coordinate our attention with others towards a common focus: we look at the ball, or point at a piece of cake. This non-verbal coordination of attention plays a fundamental role in our social lives: it ensures that we refer to the same object, develop a shared language, understand each other’s mental states, and coordinate our actions. Models of joint attention generally attribute this accomplishment to gaze coordination. But are visual attentional mechanisms sufficient to achieve joint attention, in all cases? Besides cases where visual information is missing, we show how combining it with other senses can be helpful, and even necessary to certain uses of joint attention. We explain the two ways in which non-visual cues contribute to joint attention: either as enhancers, when they complement gaze and pointing gestures in order to coordinate joint attention on visible objects, or as modality pointers, when joint attention needs to be shifted away from the whole object to one of its properties, say weight or texture. This multisensory approach to joint attention has important implications for social robotics, clinical diagnostics, pedagogy and theoretical debates on the construction of a shared world.",

At the heart of progress in academia lies the principle of building upon other people’s ideas, linguistic expressions and/or scientific endeavours by taking note of invariably crediting the original author (Mori 2018). One way of doing this is by the usage of paraphrasing. Though paraphrasing is regarded as the prerogative of successful academic thinking and writing, what it means exactly is still ambiguous to some extent. After undertaking to formulate some working definitions, we discuss paraphrasing techniques and activities in the context of teaching English for Specific Academic Purposes to students majoring in Biology. The activities considered are grouped into three main categories with respect to the procedure involved: teacher-guided (with a focus on certain parts of a sentence/text as selected by the teacher), AI-assisted (linked to the usage of automated paraphrasing tools) and communicative (tasks having a connection to real-world communicative needs). Some examples are discussed with the purpose of determining their appropriateness in a teaching context. The article sketches an initial paraphrasing teaching toolkit, developing mainly the first category, and ends with considerations regarding future research, such as the development and implementation of AI-assisted tasks and the analysis of inferential and rhetorical processes.

      "abstract": "This paper outlines a model of social change. In what follows I shall first briefly list the shortcomings of existing models, second, note the premises behind my model, and third, formally present the change model itself. In all of this my intention is to work both rigorously (I'll offer definitions) and systematically (I'll utilize a propositional format, which follows, and natural progression of the phenomena as I understand it). The shortcomings discussed in the literature appear to be several: (a) little attention on directing or implementing change, rather they most often offer the means for observing it; (b) Attention to tactics or the technology of change, not to strategic interventions: (c) there is an individualistic-rationalistic bias; commitment, risk, and fear are largely ignored; (d) the politics of change is strangely avoided, hence power underutilized in change thinking and acting; (e) usually only one level of analysis is focused upon. That is, the range of targets, e.g., individual, group, organization, community, is equally applicable by change theories: (f) change is typically viewed as a linear sequence, not a natural cycling; (g) targets of change theories are usually entities of one kind or another, this detracting from attention to relationships; (h) change is typically seen as the result of a major, new or critical input from the environment, this view obscures both the many internal sources of change as well as the significance of relatively small initial changes in every day affairs; and (i) contemporary change theories are highly value infused. While most explicitly acknowledge this, a valid model should comprehend positive as well as negative events or outcomes. The model presented below consciously attempts to overcome most of these shortcomings. This proposition allows for the social system to",

Listed below are some general concepts that may be applied to help the transition. 1. Volunteer to serve on committees. Don't isolate yourself. Consider being cochair of the United Way or of a fund drive. 2. Keep promises. If you commit to something, do it! No matter how trivial or minor the request, it is important to your credibility that you follow through. If asked when you can accomplish a certain task, evaluate the request and add in a safety margin. Report back to the employee and tell them of your timetable, then deliver it earlier than you promised. Exceed their expectations. 3. Set goals and share them with your staff. Stay focused on these goals, keeping the employees' concentration on the objectives. Peter Druker was on target when he wrote: \"Concentration is the key to results, no other principle of effectiveness is violated as constantly today as the basic principle of concentration.\" 4. Distribute \"justice to all.\" It is critical to your success that you always apply fairness, consistency, or whatever term you associate with equality. Don't establish double standards; making exceptions only leads you down a dark path with no end in sight. 5. \"Don't fix it unless it's broken.\" It is like pulling that tiny thread on your new sweater: once pulled, you immediately realize that you have caused an even bigger problem--one that you can't repair.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The Big Five personality traits of agreeableness and extraversion consistently predict volunteerism.

System 1 thinking (fast thinking) is instinctive and automatic, while System 2 thinking (slow thinking) is deliberate and reasoned. System 1 thinking dominates (and should dominate) your daily life, linked to survival instincts and heuristics (rules of thumb). System 2, on the other hand, responds when System 1 does not or cannot because you face an unexpected or unfamiliar situation; to monitor System 1 thoughts and responses and intervene to modify them if necessary; and when you intentionally put yourself in unfamiliar situations in order to improve it—like undertaking a university degree. University is a key opportunity to improve thinking which requires appropriate motivation, faith, and ongoing practice. The PURR acronym can guide you in structured thinking sessions: prepare, undertake, record, return, and distract-to-focus activities can be useful during these sessions. Time and distraction are the most common obstacles to dedicated thinking. Cognitive bias, in particular subconscious bias, can also influence your thinking and understanding, and uncovering this is essential to reveal its impact.",

      "abstract": "Conventional electronic documents present their content visually on screen but the information could be spoken, or the two modalities might be combined — e.g. when mixing text and graphics. If the relative benefits of aural and visual language depend on characteristics of the target audience (e.g. age and sensory impairments, language fluency, etc), parallel versions of documents may sometimes be desirable. The advantages of different modalities will also vary with a document’s communication goals — such as informing, persuading, answering questions or giving directions. Conceptual explanations may be better if read because readers can pause and re-read but procedural explanations may be better when listened to, especially if the document provides animated demonstrations accompanied by a spoken commentary. This paper overviews empirical studies suggesting that information modality can influence the document user’s three main clusters of activities, namely finding, understanding and applying the author’s message. This raises questions such as: Would it help if electronic documents let users customise the synthetic speech, perhaps selecting the sex of the speaker? When might a modality change imply changes to other linguistic features? If we do not write as we speak, will enhanced text-to-speech technology be sufficient for creating appropriate talking documents?",

      "abstract": "With the increasing adaptability and complexity of advisory artificial intelligence (AI)-based agents, the topics of explainable AI and human-centered AI are moving close together. Variations in the explanation itself have been widely studied, with some contradictory results. These could be due to users’ individual differences, which have rarely been systematically studied regarding their inhibiting or enabling effect on the fulfillment of explanation objectives (such as trust, understanding, or workload). This paper aims to shed light on the significance of human dimensions (gender, age, trust disposition, need for cognition, affinity for technology, self-efficacy, attitudes, and mind attribution) as well as their interplay with different explanation modes (no, simple, or complex explanation). Participants played the game Deal or No Deal while interacting with an AI-based agent. The agent gave advice to the participants on whether they should accept or reject the deals offered to them. As expected, giving an explanation had a positive influence on the explanation objectives. However, the users’ individual characteristics particularly reinforced the fulfillment of the objectives. The strongest predictor of objective fulfillment was the degree of attribution of human characteristics. The more human characteristics were attributed, the more trust was placed in the agent, advice was more likely to be accepted and understood, and important needs were satisfied during the interaction. Thus, the current work contributes to a better understanding of the design of explanations of an AI-based agent system that takes into account individual characteristics and meets the demand for both explainable and human-centered agent systems.",

The outcome of an action, for which immediate feedback is given, depends on the context (i.e. one of thirty-two sequences of three features) which is know and visible to the subjects. Subjects develop some theories of the experimental world, which result in the stable repetition of some actions in response to certain conditions. These theories are modified after feedback, however mistaken answers are repeated and correct answers abandoned. During the game, theories become more effective (i.e. they afford more correct answers and a higher score), yet the improvements slow down. The theories follow from only a portion of the available information and when they become successful (i.e. towards the end of the experiment) the subjects start refining them to include a larger subset of the information, this causes more stable mistakes.",

A third form of orientation characterises many highly successful people. This is the ability to combine several tasks into one: to ‘kill two (or more) birds with one stone’. This skill characterises people with initiative, who exercise judgment, deliberation and creative imagination in their personal organisation. The motivation to work in this way indicates personal commitment rather than mere compliance. Focusing on its development educationally implies a shift from either/or, linear, methodical, mechanical and technicist thinking to encouraging individual and collective responsibility, initiative and risk-taking, resulting in unpredictable outcomes. The emphasis on judgment renders the issues as ethical rather than narrowly instrumental. Dominant ethical approaches are, therefore, considered in relation to this in terms of its application for teaching.",

As such, there are some certain hypotheses and objectives regarding the needs of communication skills in the maritime domain. Why are communication skills needed? One of the main objectives is to know the interlocutor: people need to relate in order to know their interlocutor within the first 5 minutes of relating. Eric Berne in “What do say after we say Good Afternoon (Hello), considers that the process of finding out requires an analysis: a) Of the first 20 words (through the dynamic elements of expression: volume, tonality, rhythms); b) The first 20 steps (walking is an expressive non-verbal element - people walk in certain manner when they are enthusiastic and in a different manner when they are under the pressure of the negative emotional stimuli of stress, anxiety, and pain); c) The first 20 breaths (the control of breathing is a fundamental non-verbal communication element in managing stress and anxiety; the success of a person's tasks, which involve crisis or unforeseen situations, is determined by this control); d) The first 20 looks: glances and looking are fundamental communication vectors. Up to the interpersonal communication skills improving, the main objective of the paper is to establish correct labor and employee relations, within the shipping domain. The relations between managers and their employees must be handled legally and effectively. Employer and employee rights must be addressed. It is important to develop, communicate and update human resources policies and procedures so that managers and employees know what is expected of them.",

In order to carry these out in a well-organized manner, one needs to lead to up-gradation of motivation levels. As a consequence, their mind-sets will be stimulated and they will put in their best efforts in carrying out job duties in a well-organized manner. As a consequence, one will possess the abilities to work under stress. Furthermore, they will be able to cope with different types of dilemmas and challenging situations in a satisfactory manner. In addition, these are prevented from giving rise to impediments within the course of doing well in one’s job duties and generating desired outcomes. The individuals, belonging to all professions and fields need to lead to up-gradation of skills and abilities. These need to be put into operation in a well-organized and disciplined manner. The individuals are required to make sure, they are putting into operation the competencies, abilities and aptitude in an appropriate manner. Furthermore, the individuals need to ensure, they are promoting well-being of others, including family and community members. Therefore, leading to up-gradation of motivation levels is essential in implementing job duties in a satisfactory manner. The main concepts that are taken into account in this research paper are, understanding the meaning and significance of motivation levels, measures to be put into practice in leading to up-gradation of motivation levels and advantages of leading to up-gradation of motivation levels.",

      "title": "Attention and Working Memory in Insight Problem-Solving",
      "abstract": "Attention and Working Memory in Insight Problem-Solving M. Aisling Murray (murray.aisling@gmail.com) Department of Psychology, Trinity College, University of Dublin, Ireland Ruth M. J. Byrne (rmbyrne@tcd.ie) Department of Psychology, Trinity College, University of Dublin, Ireland Abstract Individuals differ in their ability to solve insight problems. We suggest that differences in attention switching and working memory skills underlie differences in insight problem solving ability. We consider the results of an experiment that shows that correct performance on a range of insight problems is related to correct performance on measures of attention-switching and working memory storage and processing, but not to measures of selective attention and sustained attention. We discuss the implications of the results for understanding the component processes in insight problem solving. Keywords: Insight; problem-solving; individual differences; attention; working memory. Introduction Suppose you are asked to describe how to throw a ping-pong ball so that it will travel a short distance, come to a dead stop and then reverse itself (Ansburg and Dominowski, 2000). You are not allowed to bounce it off any surface or tie anything to it. Some individuals solve the problem readily. Others never do. Some people suggest putting a back-spin on the ball (which will not work), or throwing it to another person (which violates the requirement for the ball to stop and return by itself). Although the problem initially seems impossible, there is a simple answer. Throw the ball straight up in the air and gravity will cause it to stop for an instant before falling back to earth. Many people assume that the ball must travel forward and back but once they realise it can also go up and down, the solution follows readily (Murray and Byrne, 2005a). Why do individuals differ in their ability to solve insight problems? Our aim in this paper is to consider some of the component skills upon which insight problem solving depends (see also Murray and Byrne, 2005b). Insight problems usually require some kind of change to the initial interpretation of the problem and its anticipated solution (Weisberg, 1995). For example, in the ping-pong ball problem, a successful solution requires a change from a horizontal trajectory to a vertical one. People must possess some knowledge to solve insight problems, for example, knowledge about the effects of gravity. Insight problems tend to be ‘ill-defined’, that is there is some ambiguity about what the problem requires, or what form the solution will take. They are often more difficult to solve than they at first appear and sometimes the solution occurs suddenly to the solver in an ‘aha’ moment (e.g. Duncker, 1945). One view is that solving insight problems may not require different processes from solving non-insight problems such as mathematics problems (Weisberg & Alba, 1981; review in Mayer, 1995). Another view is that there are key differences between the two sorts of problems (e.g., Metcalfe and Wiebe, 1987). For example, participants can more accurately predict their future success given a second chance at an unsolved non-insight problem compared to an unsolved insight problem. Their ratings of how close they feel to a solution when they work on a non-insight problem exhibit an incremental pattern as they neared a correct solution, but for insight problems it remained uniformly low until a sudden increase just before the solution (Metcalfe and Wiebe, 1987). Many studies have identified empirical differences between insight and non-insight problems (Schooler, Ohlsson and Brooks, 1993; Lavric, Forstmeier and Rippon, 2000; Gilhooly and Murphy, 2004; Jung-Beeman, Bowden, Haberman, Frymiare, Arambel-Liu, Greenblatt, Reber and Kounios, Our aim is to consider the component skills required in insight problem-solving. We have suggested that people need to keep in mind several alternative possibilities to solve insight problems (Murray and Byrne, 2005a). Individuals may have difficulty in keeping in mind alternatives because multiple possibilities can exceed their working memory capacity (Byrne, 2005; Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 1991; 2002). They also need to be able to switch their attention between the alternative possibilities to reach a solution. On this account, key component skills required in insight problem solving include attention switching and working memory skills. To test this view, we examined a range of insight and non-insight problems. We measured attention switching, sustained attention, and selective attention, and several aspects of working memory, including working memory storage and working memory storage plus capacity. Attention and working memory may be crucial for different aspects of successful insight problem solving. Planning a number of moves in advance may be important to solve insight problems such as the well-known nine-dot problem (Chronicle, Ormerod and MacGregor, 2001). Attention may play a role in helping people to decide what elements of a problem to focus on or in helping them to direct the search for relevant information internally and externally. Successful insight problem-solvers are more likely to switch strategies when they realize their current strategy is not working (Davidson, 1995). Some studies have suggested that directing people’s attention to a particular element of a",

      "abstract": "Labelling-effect on a deviant has been discussed in terms of negative reaction, an exclusion or avoidance which causes social deprivations to imputed labellee. My process approach focusing on Identity Problem would seem to possess a merit for finding out labellee's adaptive process to labelling. When labellee dose not yet reach the deviant career in which he defines himself as a deviant, he suffers from some embarrassment because of discrepancy between self-identity and social-identity. I call it Identity Problem. There are some strategies for him to adapt to it-avowal, acquiescence, modification, flight, declaration of non-conformist, exchange for another deviant identity. If he wants to modify social identity as a deviant, he must keep his hands clean in his every activities not to be unjustly and make every endeavor to call back to his credibility through a certain line of action-say, achievement of work or social services. At the same time, it is important that there is a certain group which supports his efforts and gives him normal identity, because it is difficult for labellee to maintain his motivation for a long time under the condition in which others continue to identify his real trait as a deviant.Without, such a support, he gives up his endeavors and try to use another adaptation. He might fall into a deviant avowal. Paradoxically, the stronger he wants to modify his deviant identity, the more often he becomes a deviant avowal, since he is forced to do something to liquidate his unattainable desire. The technique he often uses is to do self-degradation by committing some deviant behavior again. The trigger of this self-degradation would be easily pulled when he defines other's attitude unchangeable ; lacks of his tolerance of embarrassment ; and happens to be caught-in precipitating factors-say, an insult by significant others or a temptation by deviant group.",

      "abstract": "Eating disorders (Eds) are one of the problems with higher social repercussion in the last years. Sometimes, these clinical syndromes, which are characterized by an altered eating behavior, can have dramatic consequences. In eating disorders, one of the more critical situations, in addition to other of equal or more importance, is the patient's confrontation with food: the visual confrontation, the eating process and the repercussion on his weight. Virtual Reality (VR) technology has been used in psychology, as a therapeutic help tool for the treatment of different psychological problems, for several years now. Their helpfulness is increasingly being recognized. Some developed virtual environments (VE) and their corresponding published studies endorse the efficiency of this tool. Nevertheless, in order to increase the possibilities of success, it is very important to obtain a complete patient immersion in the VE: visual, auditory and interactive. Sometimes there are processes or actions of reality, which are difficult to simulate virtually, and simulating them coarsely would result in the patient lack of immersion in the VE, thus seriously decreasing the possibilities of success. The eating process is an example, since it consists of several steps, some of which (biting, chewing, etc.) don't have an evident virtual solution. This article shows how food and eating process have been simulated virtually in the development of a virtual environment for the treatment of eating disorders.",

      "abstract": "Problem statement. The article presents the results of a theoretical study of the problem of emotional competence. It is shown that emotional competence is an important aspect of professional success. The formation and development of emotional competence of specialists allows them to achieve success in the professional sphere, and also allows to avoid psycho-emotional disorders and preserve mental ealth. Concepts of competence mainly focus on the mental processes that underlie the activity, on the knowledge that arises as a result of these processes and its organization, on conscious practice, or on talent or innate abilities. The processes that distinguish an expert from a novice include the following processes: planning, tracking, evaluation of problem solving, decision making. Experts and novices provide information differently; the former develop more complex strategies and activity monitoring than the latter. The success of professional activity also depends on personal qualities: a stable and positive system of relations with one's own inner and surrounding world, as well as the level of formation and development of emotional intelligence; specialists who better understand and manage their own emotions, adapt more easily to stressful and crisis conditions, are more proactive and responsible. The purpose of the article is to study the problem of emotional competence as the basis of professional success. Results of the research. Based on the above, we conclude that emotional competence can be considered as a psychological phenomenon that reflects the emotional maturity of an individual and summarizes the emotional, intellectual and regulatory components of the psyche involved in the process of achieving professional and personal goals. Emotional competence has such a significant impact on many aspects of a person's professional life and professional activities. The study of this problem helps to reveal the key mechanisms underlying professional success. The results of such studies can be used to develop education and training programs aimed at improving the emotional competence of employees, as well as to form a better understanding of how important it is to combine professional knowledge with the skills of effective interpersonal communication and interaction to achieve professional success.",

      "abstract": "Human actions, emotions, and decision making are products of complex interactions between explicit and implicit processes at various levels of spatial and temporal scales. Although it may not be possible to obtain to experimental data for all the complexity of human behavioral and emotional processes in our everyday life, recent studies have investigated the effects of social contexts on actions, emotions, and decision making; these studies include those in the fields of experimental psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience. In this paper, we review several empirical studies that exemplify how our actions, social emotions, and decision making are influenced by the presence of implicit external, rather than internal factors, particularly by presence of other individuals. The following are the main principles identified. (1) Unconscious behavioral contagion: Individuals tend to mimic others' actions. This tendency occurs unconsciously even when the observed and the to-be-executed movements are unrelated at various levels and aspects of behaviors (e. g., behavioral tempo and speed). (2) Neural substrates of social emotions: Various social emotions, including admiration, compassion, envy, and schadenfreude, are represented in neuronal networks that are similar to those of basic emotional processes. (3) Evasive nature of human decision making: Individuals tend to overrate their own subjective impression of and emotional reaction in forecasting affective reaction to events in the future, even though the predictive power of information from peer group is much larger in this regard. Individuals are seldom aware of the dissociation between their intended choice and excuted actions and are willing to give elaborate explanations for the choices they, in fact, did not make. Using these empirical examples, I will illustrate the considerable influences of implicit, unconscious processes on human actions, emotions, and decision making.",

Framework to improve brain self-regulation and support the rehabilitation of disorders such as depression, anxiety, stress and attention control.",
      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event Does priming subjects, with not only resting state but also with mindfulness or/and guided imagery, affect self-regulation of SMR neurofeedback? Framework to improve brain self-regulation and support the rehabilitation of disorders such as depression, anxiety, stress and attention control. Nuno Miguel C. Da Costa1, 2, 3, 4*, Estela Bicho2 and Nuno Dias4 1 Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Portugal), Portugal 2 ALGORITMI Center, University of Minho, School of Engineering, University of Minho, Portugal 3 Life and Health Sciences Research Institute, School of Health Sciences, University of Minho, Portugal 4 2AI, Polytechnic Institute of Cávado and Ave, Portugal Introduction: Self-regulation (SR) is the capacity to voluntary regulate, alter or inhibit certain behaviors. In fact, SR deficits are associated with diverse behavioral problems and mental disorders such as depression, rumination, distraction, anxiety, stress, and attention control. Therefore, understanding how to influence individual self-regulation learning ability through training methods could be the key to unlock predictors and optimize the success of Neurofeedback, and vice-versa (Heatherton 2011). Neurofeedback Training (NFT) is one of the techniques to train brain self-regulation (BSR). In the current protocols, the benefits from NFT greatly differ between subjects, with high percentage of inefficacy, leading to frustration of potential users, economic costs, and discredit in NFT and its professionals (Sitaram et al. 2016; Enriquez-Geppert and Huster 2017). BSR practice is closely related to mindfulness meditation and they both seem to depend upon 3 core components: attention control, self-awareness and emotional regulation, (Wood et al. 2014; Tang et al. 2015; S. Kober et al. 2017). In literature, it has been hypothesized that an “optimal” self-regulation state is necessary to achieve greater performance in voluntary modulating Neurofeedback. In this state the learner should be more: engaged, focused, undistracted and mindful of the experiment. Contrarily, learner should avoid: self-related thinking (self-monitoring), ruminating and distractive and task-unrelated thoughts(Witte et al. 2013; Ninaus et al. 2013; Wood et al. 2014). Suggesting again, a close relation to focused attention forms of mindfulness meditation (MM), that involve training an individual to better sustain their attention toward an intended object (e.g., the sensation of respiration) and away from external (e.g., sounds) or internal sources of distraction (e.g., thoughts, mind wandering) (Chow et al. 2017). Regarding electroencephalography (EEG) correlations with the “optimal” state, current literature potentially relates this state with electrophysiological sensory motor rhythm (SMR) or/and upper alpha rhythm (UA). Interventions on Mindful (Ros et al. 2014; S. E. Kober et al. 2015; S. Kober et al. 2017; Chow et al. 2017). Methods: The intervention consisted in a single session within-group design to investigate the effects on the self-regulation of SMR neurofeedback after priming vs no priming. Therefore, the protocol was set up including an active control group receiving NFT without priming. EEG signals were acquired from 33 healthy young adult participants (20-31 years old). 16 Participants of the control group (CG) were pseudo-randomly matched to 17 participants of the experimental group (EG). The experimental group received sequentially the pre-training priming protocol (PRET) then the SMR NFT. PRET consists in a Brain State Dependent Stimulation (BSDS) training design to investigate the functional role of specific target oscillations (mental states). Control condition, within-subject ABA design, to simplify the analysis of stimulus dependent oscillations. A, target condition: mindfulness and guided imagery audio stimulus, promote less self-related thinking. B, inverse condition: evaluation emotion questionnaire, promote more self-related thinking. MM guidelines and guided imagery were adapted from (Chow et al. 2017). SMR NFT protocol was based on (S. Kober et al. 2017; Chow et al. 2017). Consists in a Pre-post training design to investigate single-session self-regulation performance of SMR upregulation (12-15Hz), and simultaneous downregulation of Theta (4-7Hz) and Beta (21-35Hz). EEG spectral densities estimated using a discrete Fourier transform with Hanning windows of 1s segment of 1024 samples. From 32 Active channel electrodes with a sampling rate of 1kHz. Reward band (SMR): mean power of Cz channel during resting state. Inhibit bands (Theta and Beta): mean power + 1 standard deviation of Cz channel – objective, implicit cue to reduce involuntary artifacts, like eye blinks and muscle movements. No individual alpha frequency personalization of bands, because we want to compare stimulus-response of same band frequencies in all the subjects. In a single session, first the subject fills the sociodemographic and the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire. Then, the training starts, like the representation in the diagram in Figure 1. There are 3 block runs in total, each begins with the rest state with eyes open for 2 min and ends SMR NFT for 3 mins. For the experimental group, in block 2 and 3 the subject is submitted to PRET, after the rest and before the NFT. The control group does not receive PRET. PRET follows ABA design, where stimuli A are randomized (double blind) between mindfulness or imagery guided practice, while B are Likert scale questions in random order. The session goes at the user own pace, before each task a window appears providing the instructions and asking the subject if she/he is ready to start. Feedback presentation consists in three vertically moving bars, depicting the changes of power in the 3 bands, as one can see in the graphic user interface presented in Figure 2. The SMR bar in the center, and the small bars, from left to right being Theta and Beta, respectively. NFT bars represent the neurofeedback presented to the subject, and the blue line represents the threshold. Reward function: positive feedback (green and sound cues) when reward frequency above threshold (Power/threshold >1) while simultaneously inhibit frequencies below threshold (Power/threshold <1). Points, visual (color change between green and red) and sound cues are presented as reward cues. Regarding this intervention, ethical approval was obtained from the ethics committee of the University of Minho, Portugal. Results: The analysis presented in this abstract makes use of the online NFT processing algorithm. As explained before, a sliding window of 1024 samples, updated every 1024 samples (~1s), is used to extract the mean power spectrum density of SMR band. Using the same strategy to segment the data into 1.024 s epochs, we extract the SMR mean power for each epoch in the rest and NFT tasks in each of the 3 blocks, represented in Figure 3 as the dots in the graph. The red line in the figure represents the absolute mean PSD of rest state. Also, it corresponds to the threshold used in the NFT. Blue is the absolute mean PSD during the NFT task. Green and Grey dots correspond to 1s epochs of SMR. Green epochs are above rest state absolute power, to indicate that the subject surpass the threshold. After having the relative NFT mean and the rest absolute mean we calculate the percentage of time above target (%tBAT), one of the features to inform learning performance during training (Dempster and Vernon 2009). It’s described as the percent of time spent with positive feedback, which, in this case, equals the ratio between the number of epochs above rest threshold and the total number of epochs. In Figure 3 is illustrated an example of a subject from each group where is possible to follow the within-session dynamics of the SMR. To understand the effects of priming vs no priming in this preliminary study, an absolute group mean of the %tBAT in each block was calculated. The graphic in Figure 4 illustrates the results. Red represents the control group. Blue, the experimental group. Blue bold line, represents the absolute mean of the EG. Blue dashed lines represent the NFT block 2 after mindfulness and NFT block 3 after guided imagery. Blue points graph represents the NFT block 2 after guided imagery and NFT block 3 after mindfulness. The error bars are presented as vertical standard deviations (std). Stronger increases in the PRET intervention are visible compared to the no priming neurofeedback intervention in block 2 and 3. Additionally, the group with imagery in block 2 and mindfulness in the block 3 show the stronger increase. Nonetheless, this preliminary data is not conclusive nor significant due to standard deviation overlapping (see Table 1 with %tBAT in the supplementary material). Conclusion: In conclusion, the preliminary analysis presented in this abstract follows the online data analysis, showing the perspective of the user. This analysis seems to point against the null hypothesis: priming seems to have effects in the NFT SMR protocol developed. Nonetheless, working with EEG online has its limitations because of noise in the signal. Any small movements, like eye blinks or muscle contraction can add artifacts to the signal. Attempts were made to prevent and detect such artifacts in real time and to not include those samples when calculating the Neurofeedback. This process is not perfect and can sometimes lead to a number of false positives leading to variations in the number of epochs included. Therefore, the error range presented in this analysis is still big, deeper offline analysis is being done to validate these preliminary behavioral results. Figure 1 – Experimental design diagram.

      "title": "Taking the New Year's Resolution Test seriously: eliciting individuals’ judgements about self-control and spontaneity",
      "abstract": "Abstract Self-control failure occurs when an individual experiences a conflict between immediate desires and longer-term goals, recognises psychological forces that hinder goal-directed action, tries to resist them but fails in the attempt. Behavioural economists often invoke assumptions about self-control failure to justify proposals for policy interventions. These arguments require workable methods for eliciting individuals’ goals and for verifying occurrences of self-control failure, but developing such methods confronts two problems. First, it is not clear that individuals’ goals are context-independent. Second, facing an actual conflict between a desire and a self-acknowledged goal, a person may consciously choose not to resist the desire, thinking that spontaneity is more important than self-control. We address these issues through an online survey that elicited individuals’ self-reported judgements about the relative importance of self-control and spontaneity in conflicts between enjoyment and health-related goals. To test for context-sensitivity, the judgement-elicitation questions were preceded by a memory recall task which directed participants’ attention either to the enjoyment of acting on desires or to the satisfaction of achieving goals. We found little evidence of context-sensitivity. In both treatments, however, judgements that favoured spontaneity were expressed with roughly the same frequency and strength as judgments that favoured self-control.",

More specifically, the contributors focus on the potential mediating effects of attention and of executive processes of working memory. The evidence discussed suggests that anxiety and depression both impair the executive functions of shifting and inhibition, in part due to task-irrelevant processing (e.g., rumination; worry). In contrast, positive affect seems to enhance the shifting function and does not impair the inhibition function. The complicating role of motivational intensity is also discussed, as are implications for future research.",

The effectiveness is an important foundation for how organizations perform with their management, development, and stimulation to their employees. People management has a noteworthy influence on performance and employees' comportment in relation to the organizational presentation can explicit itself in three different ways; task execution, organizational citizenship accomplishment (Soft performance) and workplace divergent behavior. [1]Recently, most of the companies or institutions are fully conscious about employee’s performance or about to discover the customs through which high level of employee’s act can be accomplished is becoming one of the intent aspects to any organization progress. [2]Employee Performance Management is about to bring into a line of the administrative goals with the employees' approved procedures, assistance, proficiency necessities, development strategies and the distribution of consequences. [3]Manpower performance can be amplified by putting efforts to factors that boost the employees’ motivational level, creativity, job gratification, and coziness workstation atmosphere, etc. [2] There are lots of factors that influence on employee performance and the main topic of the study revolves around those variables. This study will focus on the impact of leadership, training, motivation, organizational culture and working environment on the employees’ performance in different types of sectors like government, private or semi-government sector in Bangladesh. It will also highlight how these variables affect the performance either positively or negatively.",

Then, three types of bad dependence (interpersonal dependence, process dependence, substance dependence) are outlined. Among them, process dependence is as follows. Some people find temporary relief when they become involved in the process of doing something, such as gambling, shopping, and stealing. However, they soon start to regret their actions and attempt to refrain from repeating the process, but this exacerbates their feeling of internal tension. They then repeat the process to relieve the tension, resulting in a vicious cycle of tension and relief.",

You may have previously had good self-esteem, or you may perhaps have always had problems with this. Whichever is the case, a long-term illness can undermine your sense of self-worth in a variety of ways. It can change your whole idea of who you are and what makes you a valuable and valued person. You may have lost your good looks or physical prowess, the beautiful, active, healthy body you once had, and feel a loss of value because of that. Your illness may have caused a disfigurement. You may feel less effective as a parent, partner or carer. If you have had to give up your job, you may feel that you have lost your position as an achieving person. You may have lost some of your independence and now have to accept help from other people (and perhaps feel that you ought to be grateful, even though you hate having to ask for help).",

      "abstract": "The core of the AI is a model. Now, based on the needs of teachers (as well as students and their families/caregivers), we add another layer to our criteria. Some AI models can recognize patterns in the world and do the right action, but they cannot explain why (e.g., how they arrived at the connection between the pattern and the action). This lack of explain ability will not suffice for teaching; teachers will need to know how an AI model analyzed the work of one of their students and why the AI model recommended a particular tutorial, resource, or next step to the student. This paper discusses examples of AI supporting teachers and teaching including these concepts: AI assistants to reduce routine teaching burdens; AI that provides teachers with recommendations for their students' needs and extends their work with students; and AI that helps teachers to reflect, plan, and improve their practice. On the other hand, AI is being able to reduce the amount of teacher attention which have to give to administrative things and increase the amount of his attention can give to his students with their learning needs in the classroom.",

      "title": "Undesired behaviour in horses: A review of their development, prevention, management and association with welfare",
      "abstract": "Summary Undesired behaviours are a common problem amongst leisure and sporting horses in the UK and have a significant impact on the work of equine practitioners. In most cases, behaviours considered aberrant by owners are normal responses for their horses. Behaviours perceived as ‘naughtiness’ may in fact signify direct actions to avoid pain‐ or fear‐inducing stimuli. Examples that practitioners might deal with include trailer loading problems, avoidance of having saddlery equipment applied or reluctance to leave the yard. Even where no evidence of physical problems or pain can be detected, avoidance behaviours may reflect learnt responses that previously led to success in evading unpleasant consequences. Because owners often misunderstand the reason for such behaviours to develop in their horses, attempts at resolution often involve suppression or punishment based approaches. Although repeated subjugation of undesirable responses may ultimately appear to resolve the overt behavioural problem in some cases, in many others it can lead to a worsening of the problem, the development of alternative avoidance strategies or the horse learning that escaping the source of its pain or anxiety is impossible and ceasing to respond. Some horses develop abnormal or repetitive behaviours, which are not in the ‘normal’ behavioural repertoire. These stereotypic behaviours, sometimes termed ‘vices’, can indicate strategies to cope with a suboptimal environment. Indeed, their performance may serve to improve the situation for the animal. Attempts to suppress or prevent horses showing stereotypies, therefore, will generally exacerbate the underlying welfare problem. When dealing with either stereotypies or avoidance behaviours, it is important to recognise the role of learning in their development and maintenance. Resolution involves both understanding the underlying motivation for showing the behaviour and how it has become reinforced and established over time, for each individual case. The use of environmental change and/or behavioural modification techniques that are both successful and welfare compatible, are important in dealing with undesired behaviour in horses and selection of suitable professionals for referral an important responsibility for the equine practitioner.",

      "abstract": "The article describes the applied problems of preserving the psychological health of an individual. The structure of emotional well-being is revealed as one of the important criteria of psychological health. The parameters that determine the emotional well-being of a healthy individual and are risk factors for his psychological health are highlighted: internality in the field of family relations, which means responsibility for events in family life; contact, which means the ability to establish deep relationships with others; subjective well-being, which means a reluctance to complain of discomfort; creativity, which means high creative orientation in professional activity; self-acceptance, which means the ability to accept oneself with flaws and weaknesses; behavioral flexibility as the ability to quickly respond to a changing situation; the morality index as the state of the moral sphere; personality maturity as responsibility and self-respect. It is emphasized that these factors can contribute to a decrease in the level of psychological health, which is manifested in the form of the inability to establish deep relationships with others, the tendency to complain of discomfort, a decrease in the ability to quickly respond to a changing situation, indifference to significant events in professional life and many other social psychological phenomena. Key words: personality, psychological health, emotional well-being, rehabilitation, extreme stress factors.",

If not fully committed to the task at hand, it can mean disaster and the eventual downfall of the organization. As such, strategy courses must be taught in a serious way, or does it? Grounding our work in the literatures of play and Serious Play, we designed a 13-week quasi-longitudinal experimental design (with control and intervention groups) (using physical reflective/reflexive dice cubes) to see the impact of play and playfulness in helping our students open up the alternatives to complex unsolved problems, issues and challenges. Using clinical psychology interviews (from Personal Construct Theory) at time T1 (beginning of the term) and T2 (at end of the term), our results show that students studying strategy using play, as opposed to the control group with no play element (using traditional teaching methods), increased their capacity to be more cognitive complexity through better differentiation and integration to generate deeper insights. Implications to both theory, practice and management education are discussed in better preparing the next generation of future-leaders for a complicated world.",

We walk, we pick up objects, we write or type, we chew and swallow, and, unlike other animals, we speak. Speech is probably the most complex motor behaviour humans can perform. This complexity alone is a formidable challenge to any theoretical approach to motor control, but in addition, speech lends itself less to the specific type of manipulations that are commonly used to study underlying control mechanisms in other motor tasks. Other complicating issues for speech research are potential influences of cognitive/linguistic processes on motor control in using real words or longer utterances (e.g. van Lieshout et al. 1995; Maner et al. 2000).",

      "abstract": "Perasaan cemas dalam kadar kecil dibutuhkan dalam kehidupan sehari-hari. Tanpa sedikit rasa cemas kita merasa kurang memiliki motivasi. Perasaan cemas ini pula yang membuat kita waspada dalam melakukan tindakan sehingga senantiasa fokus. Akan tetapi jika kecemasan meningkat sehingga menyebabkan rasa takut atau kekuatiran yang berlebihan, maka hal ini akan membebani seseorang. Karena pada saat itu, kecemasan mulai di luar kendali.\r\n \r\nSeseorang dengan gangguan kecemasan akan mencemaskan hal-hal yang sebetulnya tidak perlu, bahkan dalam porsi berlebihan. Intensitas perasaan cemas yang tinggi ini, lalu menghalangi seseorang untuk bisa melakukan aktivitas sehari-hari misalnya sekolah, bekerja, mengunjungi kegiatan-kegiatan tertentu, pusat perbelanjaan, dan lain-lain. Akibatnya orang tersebut menjadi tidak produktif, bahkan lebih jauh lagi tidak berdaya sehingga membutuhkan pertolongan.\r\n \r\nBuku ini kami tulis untuk membuka wawasan anda terhadap gangguan kecemasan. Bagi penderita gangguan kecemasan (anxiety disorder) tulisan ini mudah-mudahan membimbing Anda agar segera dapat beraktivitas normal, bahkan lebih baik dari sebelumnya. Anda bisa mengkombinasikan metode-metode dalam buku ini dengan terapi profesional dan pengobatan medis. Untuk Anda yang tertarik dengan pengetahuan gangguan kecemasan, mudah-mudahan hal ini menginspirasi Anda untuk hidup lebih sehat sejahtera, atau bahkan Anda dapat menolong orang-orang yang anda kasihi yang menderita gangguan ini.\r\n \r\nTrina Tallei adalah seorang ilmuwan yang memiliki latar belakang kuat dalam bidang genetika modern, dan sangat memahami epigenetik dan neuroplastisitas. Karena suatu sebab dalam perjalanan hidup, Trina pernah mengalami gangguan kecemasan ini beberapa tahun dan akhirnya dapat mengatasinya. Selain tekad yang kuat untuk memberikan bantuan pada penderita gangguan kecemasan, Trina juga mulai menemukan benang merah dari gangguan ini.\r\n \r\nEndah Kurniadarmi, adalah penulis, pemberdaya perkembangan anak, dan trainer. Selain menulis (ini adalah buku ke-23), dengan pendidikannya sebagai Master di bidang Perkembangan Anak (FPsi UI) serta Master Practitioner NLP approved by Richard Bandler dari SLB, Endah banyak membantu penderita gangguan kecemasan baik melalui konsultasi, hipnoterapi atau melalui workshop-workshop pengembangan diri dan prestasi.\r\n \r\nKami sangat memahami, bagaimana beratnya gangguan kecemasan, penderita seakan mengalami mimpi-mimpi buruk yang penuh emosi yang seringkali sangat sulit untuk dijelaskan kepada orang lain. Dalam kondisi ini, penderita sering merasa tidak berdaya dan bahkan merasa tidak memiliki harapan, tidak ada cahaya di ujung jalan yang gelap yang memandu Anda keluar dari gangguan kecemasan ini. Tapi percayalah bahwa Anda bisa mengubah kecemasan Anda menjadi potensi luar biasa. Yang Anda butuhkan hanyalah menolak memfokuskan diri pada gangguan kecemasan ini dan mulai membuka diri terhadap potensi-potensi yang Anda miliki. Semakin kuat Anda mengabaikan kecemasan, semakin jauh Anda dari gangguan tersebut. Anda harus keluar dari jalur permainan yang Anda buat sendiri di dalam pikiran Anda. Inilah waktu Anda, moment of truth Anda untuk menjadi lebih baik, untuk fokus pada kesehatan, kekuatan, dan kedamaian diri Anda. Berhentilah memanjakan diri Anda dalam fokus yang memperdayakan. Singkirkan kecemasan, mulailah Anda fokus pada hal-hal yang memberdayakan. Banyak sekali bakat unik dalam diri anda yang belum dieksplorasi, sebagaimana Tuhan menginginkan setiap orang menjadi pemimpin, menjadi sejati dirinya, menjadi seseorang dengan tujuan untuk apa ia dilahirkan ke dunia ini. Anda tidak ada duanya, tidak ada satu penelitianpun yang bisa membuktikan ada dua orang persis sama di muka bumi ini. Jadi, tunggu apa lagi, mari keluar dari lingkaran gangguan kecemasan. Tidak ada yang bisa menghalangi Anda untuk bebas dari gangguan kecemasan, selain diri Anda sendiri. O, ya, Anda Bisa Melakukannya, karena Anda Memang Mampu.",

Rather than giving a feeble reply, a leader should \"circle back\" to provide time to investigate the issue and give an accurate response. Attempting to answer questions when you don't have the experience or the right knowledge will make you appear to have a highly inflated ego and will disenfranchise your constituents. No one knows everything and you don't have to either! One of the first lessons I learned as a manager is that those whom you lead will be watching and listening to your responses and making a determination of whether they'll allow themselves to be led by you. Your ability to articulate clearly and accurately will be a key determining factor in building relationships and increasing the likelihood that you'll be successful in achieving your goals and objectives. Relaying incorrect information or appearing to have knowledge and experience in something that you know little or nothing about will severely threaten your credibility and thwart your chances for success. Mastering the ability to politely acknowledge that you aren't familiar with the issue and need more time to investigate a response will illustrate your integrity and show that you, too, have vulnerabilities. Respect from your subordinates and colleagues will be garnished if you answer honestly and try not to respond inappropriately. Leaders often receive complaints about the actions of their team members. The grievant often wants you to side with them and take immediate action against your team member. It's vital to understand that the old cliché that there's more than one side to a story is often true. When hearing a concern, an effective leader should be engaged in the conversation but offer minimal dialogue until a complete and thorough investigation has been completed. By acting prematurely in situations such as this, you may be criticized for not advocating for your staff and be characterized as a leader who isn't a champion for the team. Gather all of the information, think about the actions you're going to take, and then act accordingly. Responding to your supervisor in a straightforward and conscientious manner will facilitate trust and perpetuate open and beneficial conversation. Often, your supervisor might be asking questions to spark your critical thinking ability and isn't expecting answers. The dialogue shouldn't be construed as criticism, but rather a developmental opportunity to begin to visualize situations in a different manner. It's important not to fall into a verbal trap by responding to questions without the time to carefully think about a response. Most situations to which a leader needs to respond are complex and multifaceted. Carefully digesting the various components of your position will be appreciated by your constituents and earn you respect. However, if the situation needs an immediate and actionable response, you shouldn't hesitate to act accordingly and be confident that you're making the right decision based on your experience. Circling back doesn't mean that you've retreated or failed. When in doubt, it's far better to make thought-out decisions based on sound intelligence rather than emotional reactions. Keeping your mood focused on a clear objective will benefit both you and those you lead.FigureRichard Hader [email protected]",

      "abstract": "Abstract Research and theory on problem finding are scarce. This can be ascribed to difficulties in the operationalisation of the concept and to neglect of the importance of this essential link in the problem solving cycle. A similar lacuna, however, is not found in early research in the field of problem solving. In problem solving four components can be distinguished: cognitive (sensitivity to problems and formulating the problem), motivational (effectance motivation and curiosity), emotional (wonder and surprise) and, finally, personality components (tolerance for ambiguity, stimulus reduction and self‐confidence). Selective encoding, combining and comparing can be regarded as essential elements of the cognitive component. With respect to the developmental aspects of problem finding, emphasis is laid on the importance of competence motivation and the quality of attachment as determinants. The educational implications are unequivocal: problem solving and problem finding must have equal positions in curricula. For the time being this means that education will have to pay more attention to problem finding.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Under certain circumstances, contextualization cues become powerful means of achieving social order. The social organization of a daily group meeting in an American primary grade classroom is closely examined. Participants recurrently generate certain contexts within the meeting in varying sequence from day to day. Transitions from one to another regularly occur smoothly and unremarkably as interaction unfolds. On some occasions, however, this does not happen. Order breaks down, and the teacher and students implicitly negotiate what the context will be. On the surface, these contrasting patterns seem to arise unpredictably as students choose either to “behave” or “misbehave.” That is how the teacher accounts for them. Nevertheless, a closer analysis shows that they are explainable with reference to some subtle contextualization cues that the teacher, without being consciously aware of it, routinely provides but occasionally omits at context boundaries. Students routinely act on the presence and absence of these cues, which thus become a tacit, jointly constructed means of discourse regulation and social control. Their inadvertant “omission” becomes a recurrent source of interactional trouble. (Context, contextualization cues, classroom discourse, ethnography of speaking)",

      "abstract": "Working in palliative care can be both rewarding and difficult. The multilayered demand of caring for palliative clients and their families requires that professionals make self-care a priority. A good starting point involves having a self-care plan that addresses individual strengths and challenges, including physical, emotional, cognitive, relational and spiritual. Self-care strategies, such as identifying professional and personal strengths, or applying mindfulness and stress reducing techniques, can improve self-awareness. This promotes personal growth, which reduces the risk of compassion fatigue and burn-out. By increasing personal self-understanding and gaining a clear perception of one's own personality (including thoughts, beliefs, motivations and emotions), healthcare professionals can enhance their ability to be attuned to their own feelings. When a professional's personal well-being is carefully tended, positive outcomes such as job engagement, greater compassion for others, and personal satisfaction and resilience often result.",

      "title": "Self-Esteem and Collective Self-Esteem as Predictors of Depression",
      "abstract": "Self-esteem is a term that reflects a person's overall evaluation or appraisal of her or his own worth. Self-esteem encompasses beliefs (for example, I am competent, I am worthy) and emotions such as triumph, despair, pride and shame. Self-esteem is a confidence in onself, a satisfaction of what one is and the self-respect that confidence brings. It is the appraisal or assessment of a person on one's self worth. It encompasses belief about one's capacity and worthiness. Self-esteem is a complex phenomena consisting of three components- competence,worthiness, self-evaluation. Competence means self-esteem is tied to and reflected in a particular class of behavior, namely behavior that is effective or successful. It has been found that there is negative relationship between self-esteem and anxiety (Pyszczynski et al., 2004). Moreover, individuals with high self-esteem and low anxiety are more inclined to engage in mastery behaviors. Low level of self-esteem has been linked to behavioral problems and poor school performance (Agarwala & Raj, 2003). It is related with serious issues such as teenage pregnancy (Crockenberg & Soby, 1994), suicides (Choquet, Koves & Poutignat, 2000; Bhattacharjee & Deb, 2007; NCRB, 2007) and maladjustment.Luhtanen & Crocker (1992) emphasized the importance of collective self-esteem. Collective self-esteem refers to the feelings and evaluations of the worthiness of a social group-such as racial, ethinic, or work group of which one is a member (Coming, 2002; Jetten, Branscombe & Spears, 2002; Rahimi & Fisher, 2002). DeCremer and Oosterwegel (1999) found that subjects with collective self-esteem tended to view in-group members more positively than those with personal self-esteem. The high collective self-esteem individuals also seemed to expect more in-group cooperation. The impact of collective self-esteem on psychological functioning such as intergroup evaluation (Andreopoulou & Houston, 2002), in-group bias (Aberson & Howanski, 2002), coping styles (Constantine, Donnelly & Myers, 2002) has been studied. Some evidence shows that collective self-esteem is a potentially strong predictor of mental health such that collective self-esteem is a potentially strong predictor of mental health such as life satisfaction (Crocker et al., 1994; Mokgathe & Schoeman, 1998) and distress (Bizman, Yinon, & Krotman, 2001; Katz, Joiner, & Kwon, 2002).Self-esteem and collective self-esteem are viewed as vicious cycle. Low self-esteem and collective self-esteem result among many behavioral problems and depression is among one of them. Depression among adolescents has become a very common problems and rate of depression is increasing day by day (SAMSHA, 2012). The literature survey depicts that self-esteem and collective self-esteem play a very important role in every individual's personality. Low level of self-esteem and depression create hindrance in balanced and positive development of personality. There is dearth of researches which examine the relationship between depression and collective self-esteem but low self-esteem and depression are negatively correlated, it has been found in many researches.The Current study aimed to examine relationship between self-esteem, collective self esteem and depression in adolescents and also to examine role of self esteem and collective self esteem in predicting depression.Hypotheses1. There is a negative relationship between self-esteem, collective self esteem and depression.2. There is a positive relationship between self-esteem and collective self-esteem.3. Self-esteem and collective self-esteem are significant predictors of depressionMethodSampleInitially Beck's Depression Inventory (1996) was administered on 800 undergraduate students in the age range of 17-23 years, selected from Agra and Firozabad, India. Among 800 participants 334 had low level of depression and 179 had high level of depression. …",

      "abstract": "There is ample evidence from repeat food surveys that people are actually and passively changing their food habits. Understanding the reasons for this are vital to any efforts by clinicians to enable individuals to move in an increasing healthful direction with their food intake, and to dispel the pessimism that often prevails about the ability to make a useful contribution to nutritional status by changing food intake. Current success and failure rates are predicated on inadequate methods and inappropriate outcome measures, rather than an inability to achieve outcomes. Factors that allow for or encourage change are food availability, exposure to new food experiences, food memory, pleasure, eating with peers or companions, health interest and changing constructs and beliefs about food. It is possible to change the health impact of food by non‐food means like physical activity, stress management, recreational activities, improved relationships, changing the work environment and through adequate sleep (including siesta). Yet another consideration is that the full consequences of food choice are not appreciated with more and more food–health relationships being defined (e.g. with cataract, macular degeneration, in depression and cognitive function). These various approaches require a management strategy that underpins the field of behavioural therapy. In this approach it is possible to make progress through small but consequential changes, like climbing the stairs, or increasing intake of particular foods like fish or drinking more water; and exploring and contracting ways to do these things.",

      "abstract": "Patients often ask, \"why me?\" but questions arise regarding what this statement means, how, when and why patients ask, how they answer and why. Interviews were conducted as part of several qualitative research studies exploring how patients view and cope with various conditions, including HIV, cancer, Huntington's disease and infertility. A secondary qualitative analysis was performed. Many patients ask, \"why me?\" but this statement emerges as having varying meanings, and entailing complex psychosocial processes. Patients commonly recognize that this question may lack a clear answer and that asking it is irrational, but they ask nonetheless, given the roles of unknown factors and chance in disease causation, psychological stresses of illness and lack of definitive answers. Patients may focus on different aspects of the question - e.g., on possible causes of illness (Why me? - whether God or randomness is involved) and/or on whether they are being singled out and/or punished (Why me vs. someone else?). Patients frequently undergo dynamic processes, confronting this question at various points, and arriving at different answers, looking for explanations that have narrative coherence for them, and make sense to them emotionally. Social contexts can affect these processes, with friends, family, providers or others rejecting or accepting patients' responses to this question (e.g., beliefs about whether the patient is being punished and/or these questions are worth asking). Anger, depression, despair and/or resistance to notions about the roles of randomness or chaos can also shape these processes. While prior studies have each operationalized \"why me?\" in differing ways, focusing on varying aspects of it, the concept emerges here as highly multidimensional, involving complex processes and often affected by social contexts. These data, the first to examine key aspects and meanings of the phrase, \"why me?\" have critical implications for future practice, research and education.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies clearly show that Machiavellians' thinking and behavior are characterized by some kind of cold attitude, a tendency to be detached from the emotional features of a particular situation. However, very little is known what this cold-minded attitude means, and the presence or the absence of what abilities can lead to emotional detachment. Surprisingly, our study has shown that Machiavellians - contrary to what others believe - happen to exhibit more emotional instability than others. They experience more negative emotions, lose their peace of mind faster, and have a hard time tolerating psychological distress. However, they try to conceal their emotional worries in two different ways. On the one hand, they cannot express their emotions as subtly and precisely as others, and on the other, they are much worse at identifying and differentiating their own emotional states. Maybe it is just the deficit in evaluating and expressing emotions that enables them to implement the strategy to enforce their self-interest successfully. The weak ability to identify and comprehend their own emotions may help them stay detached from the emotional temperature of a situation, while the difficulties in expressing their emotions enable them to disguise their true intentions from their partners.",

      "title": "The impact of brief exposure and acceptance interventions on implicit verbal relations in spider-fear",
      "abstract": "Theories of implicit cognition suggest that behaviour is partly influenced by automatic processes of perception and memory (implicit cognition). An important implication of these theories is that patient self−report may not\r\ncapture influential processes in psychological disorders (as some of these processes may not be available to self-report). For example, a patient may report that they are no longer anxious (based on their current awareness or\r\nwillingness to disclose) but may retain implicit/hidden processing biases (e.g., in sensitivity to threat) that leave them vulnerable to relapse in the future. Evidence suggests that, for various psychological disorders, relapse following temporarily successful treatment is not uncommon; the literature around implicit cognition may help to improve understanding of relapse processes.\r\nInvestigation of implicit cognition has further clinical implications: for enhancing our comprehension of how existing treatment may be effective (e.g., through implicit and/or explicit processes) and of how to develop treatment that influences implicit (in addition to explicit) cognition. Researchers have now developed a number of methods for\r\naccessing/measuring implicit processes and these have been shown to predict behaviour in various psychological disorders.\r\nAn important question arising from the literature around implicit cognition and its potential role in psychopathology is: do existing treatment interventions affect implicit processes? More broadly, how malleable are implicit processes? Can implicit processes be changed in a way that supports desired functioning? Research to date is limited and contradictory\r\nin its findings. The present research contributed to knowledge by examining the effects of two treatment−analogue interventions on implicit relational processes. The two interventions (exposure and acceptance/defusion) examined in the present research were based on existing clinical treatments. Spider fear was examined as a test construct in this research.\r\nThe present research applied an implicit assessment procedure, intervention, and interpretive framework deriving from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (and the underlying Relational Frame Theory). In this way, the present research attempted to draw together theoretically coherent aspects of basic and applied psychology to better understand the constructs of interest. Towards the aim of testing the impact of brief exposure and\r\nacceptance interventions on implicit verbal relations in spider-fear (in addition to spider-fear-related self-report and behavioural indices), three specific objectives were identified:\r\n1. To examine effects of exposure and acceptance interventions on implicit (and explicit) measures of spider fear\r\n2. To test the predictive relationship between implicit (and explicit) spider fear and spider-approach behaviour\r\n3. Combining the above, to examine intervention effects on behaviour (directly and/or via fear measures).\r\n48 participants (from a non-clinical sample) were randomly allocated to receive one of the two interventions. Participants completed pre− and post−intervention measures of implicit (and explicit) spider fear and a\r\npost−intervention behavioural approach test.\r\nImplicit fear incrementally predicted behaviour over explicit fear, replicating previous findings. However, neither intervention appeared to affect implicit fear. Interventions did have differential effects on explicit fear\r\nand overt behaviour; notably, defusion facilitated greater approach behaviour than exposure. Discussion centres on clinical and theoretical implications of the research, considering limitations and directions for future\r\nresearch.",

Many parenting practices and/or styles measures have been developed; however, there is little agreement as to how the influence of parenting should be measured. More importantly, our ability to relate parenting practices and/or styles to children's behaviors depends on its accurate assessment. While there is a need to standardize our assessment to further advance knowledge in this area, this article will discuss areas that may stimulate advances in the measurement of parenting constructs. Because self-report measures are important for the assessment of parenting, this article discusses whether solutions to improve self-report measures may lie in: (1) Improving the questions asked; (2) improving the methods used to correct for social desirability or measurement errors; (3) changing our measurement paradigm to assess implicit parenting behaviors; (4) changing how self-report is collected by taking advantage of ecological momentary assessment methods; (5) using better psychometric methods to validate parenting measures or alternatively using advances in psychometric methods, such as item banking and computerized adaptive testing, to solve common administration issues (i.e., response burden and comparability of results across studies); and (6) employing novel technologies to collect data such as portable technologies, gaming, and virtual reality simulation.

      "abstract": "Abstract: There are three mechanisms that may contribute to the health, performance, and safety problems associated with night-shift work: (1) circadian misalignment between the internal circadian clock and activities such as work, sleep, and eating, (2) chronic, partial sleep deprivation, and (3) melatonin suppression by light at night. The typical countermeasures, such as caffeine, naps, and melatonin (for its sleep-promoting effect), along with education about sleep and circadian rhythms, are the components of most fatigue risk-management plans. We contend that these, while better than nothing, are not enough because they do not address the underlying cause of the problems, which is circadian misalignment. We explain how to reset (phase-shift) the circadian clock to partially align with the night-work, day-sleep schedule, and thus reduce circadian misalignment while preserving sleep and functioning on days off. This involves controlling light and dark using outdoor light exposure, sunglasses, sleep in the dark, and a little bright light during night work. We present a diagram of a sleep-and-light schedule to reduce circadian misalignment in permanent night work, or a rotation between evenings and nights, and give practical advice on how to implement this type of plan.

Ample supervisory focus has indeed been given to the working alliance and transference-countertransference configuration (including parallel processes), but after a century of psychotherapy supervision, any mention whatsoever of real relationship phenomena is absent. In this paper, the following hypotheses are proposed: The real relationship (1) is a crucial component of the supervision relationship that has transtheoretical implications; (2) exists from the moment supervision begins until its end; (3) is the forever silent yet forever substantive contributor to supervisory process and outcome; (4) exerts a significant impact on (a) the development and establishment of the supervisory working alliance and (b) the unfolding and eventual utilization of the transference-countertransference experience in the supervisory situation; (5) consists of at least two dimensions in supervision—realism and genuineness—that vary along valence and magnitude continua (building on the works of Greenson and Gelso), and (6) deserves a place of eminence equal to the working alliance and transference-countertransference configuration if supervision theory, practice, and research are to be most fully informed. The possibility of using recent real relationship research in psychotherapy as a prototype to inform future research in supervision is presented, and two case examples are provided to illustrate the seeming power of real relationship phenomena in psychotherapy supervision.",

Often times people are forced to work in a group with predetermined goals. There can be many problems when this happens. One problem may be conflict amongst team members. Mangers must first know the difference between groups and teams. A group is a collection of people who generally have a common objective – which is not one they have had a role in shaping or directing. On the other hand a team is an energetic group of people who are committed to achieving common objectives; who work well together, and enjoy doing so; and produce high quality work. In order for a group to become an effective team, the group needs to go through five stages of group development. As groups go through these stages of development, they become a team rather than a group thus leading to work that is more productive. The groups were surveyed before and after the outdoor experiential learning session. The participants were asked eight questions on how the group was performing. The questions needed to rate group versus team behavior on a scale from one to five.",

      "abstract": "Leadership encircles the capability of an individual, group or organization to guide others (individuals, teams, or whole organizations). True leadership requires a personality that attracts other people, constant development of relationships with team members, possessing professional and practical knowledge and skills, experience, self-confidence, intuition and empathy. Strong leaders continuously empower other people, because they believe in their team members. Leadership skills are continuosly learned and improved not only during professional development, but throughout person’s life. Crises are inevitable events, that occur sooner or later in all the organizations. They can be triggered by different internal or external factors. Each crisis is specific and unique and requires different approaches for finding solutions. When a crisis occurs, ignoring or avoiding it, is one of the biggest mistakes for the organization. It should be accepted, resolved and used to initiate change, which is necessary for organzations’ survival and further development and growth. Having an organized, planned and structured approach to crisis management can help in damage reduction, restraing the company losses and discover inventive mechanisms to maintain the workforce’s productivity. Crisis leadership is a process that resolves the unforseeable events that happen unexpectedly and have the ability to diminish the organizational structure, to cease growth and development and lead to catastrophic outcomes. Whether the crisis will be successfully resolved, depends on how the leadership will deal with the situation. A positive approach to crisis is to accept it as an opportunity, to take responsibility, manifest confidence and implement changes which will streghtehen the organization and empower the employess to perform better and become stonger people in future. If leaders are bold and act, if they are decisive and willing to adapt their decision to the occurring conditions, they are going to have more success in resolving the crisis, compared to leaders that choose to wait and not take any action. Leadership is a vital process at all times, but when a crisis strikes, a strong leader has cardinal importance for the organization.",

      "abstract": "Procrastination at work is a problematic kind of employee behavior that is relevant in contemporary work settings. Earlier studies underlined its potential costs to employers as well as the employees; however, empirical findings on which factors lead to procrastination in the work context are scarce. The two important reasons for ... read more the lack of research on procrastination at work topic are probably the conceptualization and measurement issues. Majority of procrastination literature focuses on general and academic procrastination which provides a limited understanding of potential reasons for this type of problematic behavior. Moreover, the studies that examined procrastination at work mainly adapted instruments that were originally developed for other life domains and this prevents measuring certain dynamics of procrastination at work. Hence, the first aim of this dissertation is to address these limitations and provide a domain-specific conceptualization and measurement of procrastination at work. If today’s jobs represent such a transformational work environment (e.g., doing what we like and want to do with higher levels of meaningfulness, pride, enthusiasm, and expertise), why do employees engage in procrastination at work? A plausible answer to this question can be a lack of fit with one’s job. Authenticity refers to the extent to which an individual stays close to his/her true self. Contemporary organizations pay growing attention to employees’ feelings and well-being, believing that managing their expectations is an important driver of their productivity. As a result, authenticity at work might be a positive state that limits procrastination and its associated costs to employees and the organizations they work for. This accounts for the second purpose of this dissertation as it is aimed to examine the relationship between authenticity and procrastination as well as other positive occupational variables. The findings of 4 studies stemming from 11 datasets from various countries in this dissertation show that procrastination at work can be conceptualized as “ delay of work-related action by engaging (behaviorally or cognitively) in nonwork-related actions, with no intention of harming the employer, employee, workplace or client”. Furthermore, the 12-item and 2-factor structure (soldiering and cyberslacking) of the Procrastination at Work Scale (PAWS) yielded acceptable psychometric characteristics to underline that it is a valid and reliable instrument to measure this type of behavior. Procrastination at work appears to be an outcome of boredom, which is an understimulated state that is commonly experienced in work environments with limited job resources and demands. Such a work environment could offer little meaningfulness and energy to employees and they can start looking for pleasurable short-time activities for replenishing their energy which leads to procrastination and reduced performance. Authenticity at work appears a type of employee state that can be related to reduced procrastination through enhanced fit and work engagement. Employers can consider providing relevant resources and job crafting possibilities to maximize the fit of employees to reduce procrastination at work. show less",

      "abstract": "Effective time management for early career academics – or anyone, really – involves setting goals and allocating time to those goals. Goals shape intended actions, and time management is simply a set of repeated practices that, if not aligned with goals, lead nowhere. It is important to set realistic goals and align daily actions with those goals, while also noting what activities are important but not urgent. This chapter covers a set of tried-and-true time management techniques, and tips for using technology to assist with time management. It is important to manage not only your own time but also the time of others. As a faculty member, you will interact with colleagues, administrators, students, and staff. It is important to be able to manage these interactions in a way that respects your time and the time of others. Additionally, structural considerations such as gender, race, age, and other aspects of our social location can shape an individual's time management calculus. Time management is a skill that can be learned and improved, and developing good habits early in your career will set you up for success.",

      "title": "How leaders self-regulate their task performance",
      "abstract": "When leaders perform solitary tasks, do they self-regulate to maximize their effort, or do they reduce effort and conserve their resources? Our model suggests that power motivates self-regulation toward effective performance—unless the task is perceived as unworthy of leaders. Our first studies showed that power improves self-regulation and performance, even when resources for self-regulation are low (ego depletion). Additional studies showed that leaders sometimes disdain tasks they deem unworthy, by withholding effort (and therefore performing poorly). Ironically, during ego depletion, leaders skip the appraisal and, therefore, work hard regardless of task suitability, so that depleted leaders sometimes outperform nondepleted ones. Our final studies replicated these patterns with different tasks and even with simple manipulation of framing and perception of the same task (Experiment 5). Experiment 4 also showed that the continued high exertion of leaders when depleted takes a heavy toll, resulting in larger impairments later. The judicious expenditure of self-control resources among powerful people may help them prioritize their efforts to pursue their goals effectively.",

If they don't want to do something they figure out how not to do it…Some kids ask lots of questions on purpose… sometimes kids interrupt and ask and ask questions they already know …It keeps kids from having to do the things they don't want to do. (Grade 2 students, St. Paul's Elementary School)IntroductionDo 7-year-olds have a micropolitical understanding of their actions? Consider the following types of familiar student behavior in primary classrooms: tattling, showing affection, arguing, giving compliments, inattention, creating distractions, ignoring, asking repeated questions, interrupting, appealing to do something else, protesting, and stalling for time. We often understand these occurrences as part of what happens when working with young children. Some may see these classroom acts as simply developmentally appropriate behaviors, immature acts to avoid tasks, or egocentric behavior-social psychological explanations of why children of this age act and interact as they do. Yet is there more to it than this? Can we also understand these behaviors through a political frame?",

      "title": "Realizing Full Potential",
      "abstract": "Before you read further, take a moment to try the following exercise: First, write down five weaknesses of someone close to you (e.g., your spouse, partner, significant other, close friend). Complete this task before going on. Second, for the same person, write down five areas of unrealized potential. Which was more difficult? Was it harder to list deficits or latent strengths? Almost everyone finds it more difficult to do the latter. Identifying areas of deficiency seems to come naturally, while identifying areas of potential requires careful thought and reflection. Many would agree that the same holds true for a student, resident, or faculty member. It is easier to note shortcomings than to articulate areas of unrealized strength. Yet, it is critical for those of us who work in medical schools and teaching hospitals to do both, especially if we are to create environments in which individuals can develop to their full potential. We have well-developed systems for detecting deficiencies of knowledge, skill, or accomplishment (e.g., multiple-choice tests, objective structured clinical examinations, one-on-one observations, annual faculty performance reviews) and for determining whether or not an individual rises above a defined “bar” (e.g., standardized examinations, formal tenure reviews). We have good methods for remediating deficiencies and for mentoring and advising those who do not make it over the bar. However, to complement these approaches, we need better ways to design curricula, build programs, and create experiences that fully leverage individual capability. My 2012 Question of the Year gets to the heart of this issue: What are the most effective ways to ensure that those who work and learn in medical schools and teaching hospitals can develop to their full potential? We received a number of excellent responses to this question. The editorial board, professional editorial staff, and I—after careful review and thoughtful deliberation—selected 15 excellent essays that appear in this issue of the journal. The authors of these essays offer valuable ideas and approaches to enable individuals to attain the highest levels of achievement possible. Some suggest theories that can inform new practices. For example, one group of authors discuss the use of self-determination theory to drive a process of providing learners with increasing degrees of independence. Another author commends “flow, deliberate practice, and renewal” to achieve peak performance. And yet other authors describe the importance of intrinsic motivation to high-levels of achievement. The authors of some essays reinforce the important roles of insightful mentorship, guided self-reflection, deliberate practice, high-quality feedback, critical thinking, problem solving, and the culture of inquiry that permeates the academic setting. Other authors discuss the need to change the culture at academic health centers, for example, to support cognitive and emotional approaches that foster flourishing and fulfillment. And still others discuss the need for explicit outcomes for educational programs. Important themes that weave their way through this collection of essays include training faculty in the use of professional coaching to attain peak performance of learners, the essential role of relational communication skills, and the use of the creative and performing arts to explore and develop aspects of the human experience not accessible via science, facts, and principles. In one essay, the authors emphasize the importance of teamwork and of tapping into the excellence that lies at the intersection of professions, disciplines, and other groups. Several authors remind us that creativity, curiosity, and imagination are essential to attain high levels of achievement. I thank the authors of these essays and all authors who submitted responses to the 2012 Question of the Year. The quality of the submissions was high, and so it was difficult to decide which essays to publish. I thank the journal’s editorial board members and the professional editorial staff for devoting significant time and effort to reviewing and judging the responses. As a collection, these 15 essays illuminate effective approaches and provide fresh insights to ensure that those who work and learn in medical schools and teaching hospitals can realize their full potential.

      "title": "Relations Between Student Procrastination and Teaching Styles: Autonomy-Supportive and Controlling",
      "abstract": "Procrastination is a complex problem that can be defined as delaying an intended course of action (despite anticipating adverse consequences). Even when some students have equivalent motivation and skill levels, they tend to procrastinate more frequently than others. Approaches that analyse whether contextual influences may prevent or promote dysregulation processes associated with procrastination are scarce. According to Self-Determination Theory, contextual influences can facilitate self-regulated motivation (e.g. autonomous pursuit of interests or personal goals), if teaching style is autonomy-supportive and guarantees the satisfaction of students' basic psychological needs for perceived competence, autonomy and relatedness. Contrariwise, school context can also impede the development of autonomous motivation if teachers frustrate the satisfaction of their students' psychological needs by recurring to controlling teaching behaviours, such as controlling use of reward , negative conditional regard, excessive personal control, or intimidation. The goal of the present study was to assess the relations between controlling and autonomy-supportive teaching behaviours, psychological needs satisfaction (of the needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness), and four distinct measures of procrastination: general procrastination, decisional procrastination, procrastination linked to task avoidance and pure procrastination. Data based on public university undergraduate students (N = 672) shows that controlling teaching behaviours are associated negatively with psychological needs satisfaction and positively with procrastination. Contrariwise, autonomy-supportive teaching behaviours are positively associated with psychological needs satisfaction and negatively with procrastination.. The data obtained is useful for suggesting new lines of research to study the link between contextual influences and the prevention of academic procrastination in view of Self-Determination Theory. Also, our results suggest new pedagogical approaches where teachers can create contextual conditions that help to prevent or reduce procrastinating tendencies.",

      "abstract": "Sudah sekitar enam bulan virus covid 19 ada di Indonesia yang berakibat pada kebijakan pembatasan fisik. Pemerintah menghimbau untuk bekerja, belajar, dan beribadah dari rumah semasa pandemi virus covid 19. Siswa melaksanakan pembelajaran dari rumah sebagai upaya memutus mata rantai penyebaran virus covid 19 ini. Kurangnya pengawasan dalam melakukan pembelajaran secara daring membuat peserta didik cenderung menunda-nunda waktu belajar. Tujuan yang ingin dicapai dari penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui penurunan perilaku prokrastinasi akademik melalui konseling kelompok behavioristik dengan teknik manajemen waktu. Hasil penelitian ini diharapkan dapat mengembangkan teori tentang penerapan layanan konseling kelompok behavioristik sebagai upaya menurunkan perilaku prokrastinasi akademik. Prokrastinasi akademik adalah suatu kegagalan untuk memulai melakukan maupun menyelesaikan suatu tugas atau aktivitas pada waktu yang ditentukan. Prokrastinator tidak bermaksud untuk menghindari tugas yang dihadapi tetapi hanya menunda untuk mengerjakan sehingga membutuhkan waktu yang lama untuk menyelesaikan tugas. Konseling behavioral dikenal juga dengan modifikasi perilaku yang dapat diartikan sebagai tindakan yang bertujuan untuk mengubah perilaku. Modifikasi perilaku dapat pula diartikan sebagai usaha menerapkan prinsip-prinsip belajar maupun prinsip-prinsip psikologi hasil eksperimen lain pada perilaku manusia. Jadi behaviorisme berfokus pada bagaimana orang-orang belajar dari kondisi-kondisi apa saja yang menentukan tingkah laku mereka. Penelitian ini menggunakan model penelitian tindakan Bimbingan dan Konseling (PTBK). Dalam penelitian ini terdapat dua jenis variabel penelitian. Variabel bebas (independent variable) dan variabel terikat (dependent variable). Subjek dalam penelitian ini adalah siswa kelas XI TKJ SMK Ma’arif 1 Nanggulan. Instrumen yang digunakan adalah angket, pedoman observasi dan pedoman wawancara. Tahapan dalam PTBK ini dimulai dari perencanaan, tindakan, observasi dan refleksi. Berdasarkan hasil observasi dan wawancara telah menunjukan penurunan.",

      "abstract": "Students' emotions are closely tied to their self-esteem, self-concept, and feelings of self-efficacy. Academic self-concept is specific to the educational context, so a student may be engaged in some academic pursuits but not connect to others. Disidentification from an academic pursuit usually causes withdrawal of effort. Anxiety is the emotion that has received the most attention from educational psychologists and librarians, but students also experience surprise, curiosity, enyoyment, confusion, frustration, and boredom. Confusion can be beneficial to learning if it is resolved before one feels overly frustrated.",

Some typical correspondence documents include: letters, memoranda, and e-mails; pre- and post-meeting documents, including announcements, agendas, and minutes; and social media. Discussions of correspondence in the workplace have often relied on a discussion of two key documents—letters and memoranda—the former being a more official document between an organization and another or a person, the latter being an internal document that, while still authoritative, is meant to express something within an organization. Communication strategies when writing correspondence rely on understanding personal relationships, feelings, and the timeliness and tone of the communication. The complexity of a collaborative correspondence (like an e-mail inquiring about project work in progress) may vary dramatically based on the relationship between the writer of the e-mail and the audience.",

      "title": "Editors’ Notes",
      "abstract": "Several assumptions underlie our thinking and approach to leader development and leader developmental readiness that formed a basis for this volume. First, we believe that anyone can develop into a more effective leader—regardless of social class, cultural background, or gender, and whether one is a young adult or a seasoned employee or leading within or from outside of an organization. We also believe that the development of leadership unfolds over one's lifetime and can be accelerated through external supports (e.g., formal programming, mentoring). Finally, we believe that leaders must be committed to their own long-term leader development journey. This last assumption really targets the readiness dimension of leader development. Is the leader motivated to develop? Does the individual have the ability to learn? What support is available to the leader during the development process? These are often-ignored questions when selecting or preparing individuals for leader development programs, and the answers are likely to be strong predictors of the success (or lack thereof) of such programs. Individuals enter leadership development programs with different levels of developmental readiness. This can be a result of different backgrounds, experience, identities, or motivations. The limited success of extant leader development programs may be explained by participants’ insufficient levels of developmental readiness, or one's ability and motivation to develop as a leader. By understanding developmental readiness—what it is, how to assess it, and how to develop it—we can maximize program impact and return on development investment. An increased understanding of developmental readiness and how to effectively use it will help both individual leader self-development efforts and organized, formal programs in attaining the ultimate goal of increasing and accelerating leader development. Specifically, we feel that this volume has a lot to offer leader development practitioners. The authors of the various chapters are experts in their domains and provide an integrative and accessible summary of very complex topics. Each chapter includes suggestions and implications for leader development practitioners, often emphasizing different phases of one's career—pre-college, college years, and early career. We explicitly focus on these early life stages because we believe that they are especially formative in terms of development. This is not to say that seasoned executives cannot develop or that leader developmental readiness (LDR) does not apply to them; however, we feel that the resources (e.g., dollars spent and scholarship) for executive leader development are disproportionate to the amount invested in early-career leaders. This lack of development of our young people is inconsistent with the potential magnitude of their long-term impact. Setting individuals on a positive trajectory of leadership learning early in life maximizes the likelihood and capacity for growth across the life span. Our hope is that providing researchers and practitioners with a long-lens perspective on leader development will help ingrain the understanding that developmental readiness may wax and wane over time and impact one's level of engagement in formal or informal leader development programs. Finally, we would like to thank those special individuals who have supported us in our thinking and development of this volume. In addition to our families, who are our foundation, we want to thank members of LeAD Labs at Claremont Graduate University and the Kravis Leadership Institute at Claremont McKenna College, especially Kyra McAndrews, Rowan Mulligan, and DeeDee Chao. We hope that you find this volume useful in your work as a leader or leader development practitioner, and we would love to hear what you think about the volume!

      "title": "THE SOCIAL-LEGAL COUNSELLING BOARD : AN EXPERIMENT IN THE INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH INVOLVING LAW, PSYCHIATRY, AND SOCIAL WORK",
      "abstract": "Several points should be made with regard to the effectiveness of the agency. 1. It has been our experience that a number of problems which appear initially in the guise of legal problems can be resolved by such an approach. Further, this technique has laid a solid groundwork for the solution of many other situations. 2. It is of great advantage to have members of the different professions available at the same time, each with their specialized knowledge. In this way issues can be discussed, defined, and even settled, which in the normal procedure would necessitate several interviews with the lawyer, the psychiatrist, or the social worker individually. Many superficial problems are quickly placed in focus or even resolved and the underlying psychological difficulties become more apparent to the client. 3. The speed at which complicated marital problems can be investigated and exposed to the persons involved is greatly increased. Maneuvers of the individuals to displace and rationalize responsibility in the marital situation are less successful in the panel setting and the clients become more receptive to guidance from a group of experts than from an individual. 4. Many of the clients referred by social agencies have been sent back to these agencies with better motivation, more understanding and with greater incentive to work out their difficulties. This is particularly true of those clients who have had previous contact with social agencies but who have broken that relationship. It has also been the impression of some social workers that clients referred to them after passing through the Social-Legal Counselling Board process make more rapid movement than comparable cases not referred by the Board. Some of the local agencies, as a result of the work of the Social-Legal Counselling Board, have been seriously discussing the development of a comparable type of interdisciplinary approach within their own agencies. 5. A number of clients who previously were resistive to individual psychotherapy have, as a result of their experience with the panel, placed themselves under psychiatric treatment. 6. Prominent has been the effectiveness of the agency as an interprofessional educational medium–one of the primary aims in its establishment. Those participating have expressed a greater understanding of the areas of activity and effectiveness as well as the limitations of the other professions. The attorneys, for example, become much more aware of the importance of the extra-legal aspects of cases coming to them. They also become aware of how the legal aspects of a problem may arise as the result of unconscious manipulations by a client. With this recognition the number of cases referred by attorneys to the agency is increasing. The agency is now receiving recognition by some of the courts particularly in cases involving the custody of children and in criminal cases involving substantial psychological problems. This is a preliminary report on approximately the first two years of operation. From the beginning a number of questions have arisen such as the collection of pertinent data, the application of the principle on a community level, and problems in group dynamics. A part-time sociologist has now been brought into the picture to help in the evaluation of these points. It is recognized by the authors that adequate follow-up studies are not yet available, though these are being made as part of the continuing program.",

      "title": "Digital Games vs Mindfulness Apps: Which is More Effective for Post-Work Recovery? (Preprint)",
      "abstract": "<sec> <title>BACKGROUND</title> Post-work recovery is essential for the dissipation of work stress, and consequently wellbeing. Evidence suggests that activities that are immersive, active and engaging are especially effective at promoting recovery. Previous research has suggested that playing digital games might be effective in promoting recovery, but little is known about how they compare to other popular mobile activities, such as mindfulness apps, which are specifically designed to support wellbeing. </sec> <sec> <title>OBJECTIVE</title> This research aimed to investigate and compare the effectiveness of a digital game and a mindfulness app in promoting post-work recovery, first in a lab setting and then in a field study. </sec> <sec> <title>METHODS</title> Study 1 was a lab experiment (n=45) in which participants’ need for recovery was induced by a work task, before undertaking one of three break tasks: a digital game (Block! Hexa Puzzle), a mindfulness app (Headspace) or a non-media control with a fidget spinner (a physical toy). Recovery in the form of how energised participants felt (energetic arousal) was compared before and after the break task, and how recovered participants felt (recovery experience) was compared across the conditions. Study 2 was a field study with working professionals (n=20), for which participants either played the digital game or used the mindfulness app once arriving home from work over a period of five working days. Measures of energetic and tense arousal were taken before and after the task, and recovery experience was measured after the task, along with measures of enjoyment and job strain. </sec> <sec> <title>RESULTS</title> A 3x2 mixed ANOVA identified that the digital game condition increased energetic arousal (indicative of improved recovery) whereas the other two conditions decreased energetic arousal (F2,42=3.76, p&lt;.05). However, there were no differences between the conditions in Recovery Experience (F2,42=.01, p=.99). In Study 2, a multi-level model comparison approach identified that neither intervention nor day of the week had a significant impact on how energised participants felt. However, for those in the digital game condition, daily recovery experience increased during the course of the study, whereas for those in the mindfulness condition it decreased (F1,20=2.1489, p&lt;0.01). Follow up interviews with participants identified three core themes: Detachment and Restoration, Fluctuations and Differences, and finally, Routine and Scheduling. These suggested that the activities differed in how much they allowed individuals to detach from work, but there were also differences across days and participants, and in some ways, the benefit of the activities came from simply having an enforced routine. </sec> <sec> <title>CONCLUSIONS</title> This work suggests that digital games may be effective in promoting post-work recovery in lab contexts, even without a high need for recovery (Study 1) and in the real world, although the effect in this case may be accumulative rather than instant (Study 2). </sec>",

The present unit focuses on how to produce a personalised classroom management plan (CMP), taking account of the multilevel nature of behaviour management (see Figure 3.4.1) and emphasising preventative rather than reactive strategies. Although the target of behavour management is to develop pupils' self-control, this will take more time with some classes and/or individual pupils than others. To address this, the focus shifts from initially establishing authority through teacher control to pupils taking greater responsibility for regulating their own behaviour. As with academic development, pupils of the same age differ in their social development – whereas some will arrive highly motivated to engage with learning, others will need more encouragement.",

      "title": "Psychology behind optimal performance",
      "abstract": "Human behaviour is studied across a wide range of people from the emotionally disturbed to the healthy. Study of human behaviour helps to break through the mental barriers, facilitating the performance and enhancing consistency of performance. Psychology has traditionally been identified and studied as a trilogy of the mind: cognition, affect and conation. Cognition refers to concentration, attention, alertness, focus and other mental attributes. Affect includes anxiety, fear and stress proneness. Conation refers to the striving component (the mental processes) which causes an individual to act, react and interact according to an innate pattern of behaviour. It includes the psychomotor abilities which characterise mental processes that have motor consequences. Conation thus includes psychomotor abilities and motivation of the individual, which can be either intrinsic or extrinsic. These three domains viz. cognition, affect and conation affect an individuals performance. For example a small event, even a minor injury, on the match day can make a sportsperson doubt his ability. Thus affecting his concentration (cognition), by causing anxiety (affect) enhancing/degrading his reaction time to perform (conation). Under undue stressful conditions sportspersons tend to have a narrow attention span, often referred to as ‘Tunnel Vision’. Attention may also focus on the athlete's internal thought process which can lead to ‘choking’ under pressure. The present paper is an approach to help understand the effective latent processes active within a sportsperson in terms of his cognitive, affective and conative ability that results in enhancing his confidence, attention span and composure to perform optimally in adverse situations.",

      "abstract": "Social norms of cooperation are studied under several forms of communication. In an experiment, strangers could make public statements before playing a prisoner’s dilemma. The interaction was repeated indefinitely, which generated multiple equilibria. Communication could be used as a tool to either signal intentions to coordinate on Pareto-superior outcomes, to deceive others, or to credibly commit to actions. Some forms of communication did not promote the incidence of efficient Nash play, and sometimes reduced it. Surprisingly, cooperation suffered when subjects could publicly commit to actions.",

      "abstract": "By definition, patience is \"the capacity to accept or tolerate delay, trouble, or suffering without getting angry or upset\". 1 In this chapter, the breadth and value of patience in an investigator will be discussed from the perspective of this career investigator. For an investigator working major case investigations, the quality of patience takes many forms. Here are a few examples. There is the patience involved when taking your time and doing your job to the best of your ability. The patience involved when waiting for search warrants to be drafted and signed by a judge. Being patient when allowing a suspect the chance to speak. (That is, the person seated in the interview chair who is coming up with the most outrageous story you have ever heard, and he expects you to believe it. In this case, just listen, and be patient. Allowing him to speak may allow him one opportunity to slip and reveal something that he otherwise intended to keep inside.) There is patience required to continually reassess the job at hand as new information develops. The need to be patient with supervisors who want answers before the investigator is done evaluating and assessing. The need to be patient with opposing attorneys who will always manage to find fault with something in your case file, and will liberally sling derogatory comments at you and your work. The ability to be patient with family members and understand their frustrations with your long hours at work, when your cases aren't progressing quickly enough. Finally, there is patience required to explain investigative concepts to a layperson, such as the difference between a suggestion of involvement and admissible evidence. It takes evidence to bring a case to trial … not a feeling that \"I just know he did it.\" The virtues of patience in an investigator will be illustrated in this work, which documents some of my most memorable investigative experiences.",

Rapid social changes as a consequence of modernization, industrialization, science advancement and technology have influenced value system and way of life or psychosocial. Not everyone is able to adjust to the changes and he may fall down or has an adjustment disorder. \r\nMany persons don’t know how to manage stress well and General Stress Management from medical doctor and psychology is not suitable for all of human being to manage their stress. Every person ever gets and feels the stress. Stress of work has double effects; a positive effect and negative effect. Positive stress is able to encourage the spirit and person feels it by insensibly. This positive effect is temporary and the beginning of the negative effects of job stress. Initially, a person feel enjoy and over spirit to finish work, after that he do it unexciting, bored, and loss of power body and mental. By negative stress of work, person can have bad performance in work and decreasing in productivity. So, human being needs the stress management to get positive stress in their life.

      "abstract": "This article extends previous discussions of the potential impact of cognitive psychology on school psychology. Specifically, it reviews themes in cognitive psychology on the relationship of children's knowledge and strategies to learning, memory, and the performance of academic tasks. A review of the literature indicates, not surprisingly, (a) the content-related knowledge of children is often related positively to academic performance; (b) situations exist, however, in which children's knowledge can affect performance on some types of tasks more than others, or in which knowledge can have a deleterious effect on performance; (c) the ability to access knowledge can be a problem, especially in certain content areas and for certain types of children; (d) types of knowledge other than content knowledge, such as metacognitive, can have a substantial impact on academic performance. The literature on strategies indicates that strategic competency is related to changes in the structure and efficiency of strategies with development, the context in which the strategies are used, and the ability to apply and regulate the use of strategies. The implications of some of these data for assessment and consultation with teachers about instruction are discussed.",

      "abstract": "This paper is about the role of scenarios in strategic management. Generally, a scenario depicts some feasible future state of an organisation’s environment and mostly includes the dynamic sequence of interacting events, conditions and changes that is necessary to reach that state. The scenario approach changed considerably during the last two decades. This is reflected in the different functions ascribed to scenarios. The more traditional functions (in first generation scenarios) are tool for evaluation and selection of strategies, integration of various kinds of data, and exploration and identification of future possibilities. The more recent ones (in second generation scenarios) are making managers aware of environmental uncertainties, stretching of managers’ mental models, and triggering and accelerating processes of organisational learning. The paper discusses especially the latter cluster of functions which are closely linked to each other. By linking the dynamic scenario-development process to Kolb’s learning cycle and strategic management, the strategic learning cycle can be enhanced. The strategic learning cycle elucidates a number of bottlenecks that may seriously hinder learning within strategic management (e.g. cognitive inertia and feedback lags). Scenarios seem to dissolve these bottlenecks and in doing so support strategic learning.",

      "title": "Actitudes hacia la muerte y su relación con el bienestar en estudiantes de primer curso de grado en enfermería",
      "abstract": "Introduccion La investigacion previa acerca de las actitudes hacia la muerte tiene como objetivo, por un lado, mejorar el entendimiento acerca de la manera en que las actitudes hacia la muerte covarian con el funcionamiento personal de cara a situaciones y/o procesos tanto de la vida cotidiana como a otros menos habituales; y, por otro, como las actitudes hacia la muerte influyen en las actitudes hacia los procesos o situaciones de terceros (por ejemplo, pacientes en situacion terminal, con enfermedades graves, personas en duelo, etc). Pero una cuestion basica y, en gran parte, previa a las anteriores, hace referencia al punto en el que situamos a las actitudes hacia la muerte. En otras palabras ?son buenas o malas?, ?son beneficiosas o perjudiciales?, y… si son una u otra cosa ?que actitudes son buenas o beneficiosas y que actitudes son negativas o perjudiciales? ?es una cuestion de tipo de actitud o del grado en que esta se presenta? En este sentido, Deffner y Bell (2005) encuentran que aquellas enfermeras que obtuvieron puntuaciones altas en ansiedad ante la muerte se mostraban mas reacias a tratar asuntos relacionados con la muerte con sus pacientes. Asi mismo, Martz (2004) encuentra que la ansiedad hacia la muerte es un predictor de reacciones de estres postraumatico en afectados de medula espinal por accidente (mediante la version de McMordie del DAS) y encuentra que la ansiedad ante la muerte (y los factores consciencia de la muerte y negacion de la muerte) explicaban hasta el 12% de la varianza en el Trastorno de Estres postraumatico. Tras analizar una muestra de 144 sujetos procedentes de Iran, Ziapour, Dusti y Abbasi (2014) analizan la relacion entre la Felicidad, medida con el “Oxford Happiness Questionnaire”, y la Ansiedad ante la Muerte, medida con el cuestionario de Ansiedad Introduccion Tesis Doctoral Enrique Jesus Saez Alvarez 53 ante la Muerte de Templer, y encuentran que la Felicidad correlaciona de manera negativa y significativa con la Ansiedad ante la Muerte. So-Kum descubre que aquellos sujetos que puntuan bajo en autoeficacia o alto en Locus de control externo de salud presentaban mas ansiedad hacia la muerte (So-Kum, Wu y Yan, 2002).\nObjetivos principales 1o/ Analizar la relacion entre las Actitudes hacia la Muerte y el Bienestar Psicologico 2o/ Determinar la relacion entre las Actitudes hacia la Muerte y la Resiliencia 4.1. Diseno: Estudio transversal, de tipo observacional, descriptivo e inferencial.\nInstrumentos: Perfil Revisado de Actitudes hacia la Muerte (PAM-R). Consta de cinco dimensiones, las cuales son: Miedo a la Muerte, Evitacion de la Muerte, Aceptacion de Acercamiento, Aceptacion Neutral y Aceptacion de escape El analisis de fiabilidad para los autores de la escala fue de: .86, .88, .97, .65, y .84 (Gesser, Wong y Recker, 1987) y para la adaptacion espanola de .83, .90, .93, .69 y .81 respectivamente para cada una de las cinco dimensiones (Schmith, 2007).\nEscala de Miedo a la Muerte de Collet-lester, Version espanola de Tomas-Sabado, Limonero y Abdel-Khalek (2007). Esta escala, al igual que sus predecesoras, diferencia entre la muerte y el proceso de morir. Consta de cuatro subescalas: Miedo a la Muerte Propia, Miedo al Propio Proceso de Morir, Miedo a la Muerte de los Otros y Miedo al Proceso de Morir de los Otros La fiabilidad de las cuatro subescalas fue para este autor de: .83, .89, .79 y .86 respectivamente. Escala de Bienestar Psicologico de Ryff version de 21 items en castellano (Diaz el al., 2006), consta de 6 dimensiones: Autoaceptacion, Relaciones Positivas, Autonomia, Dominio del Entorno, Crecimiento Personal yProposito en la vida. La fiabilidad de la escala es Autoaceptacion .84; Relaciones positivas .78, Autonomia .70; Dominio del entorno .82; Proposito en la vida .70 y Crecimiento personal .71.\nEscala Breve de Resiliencia de Sinclair y Wallstron, (2004) con una consistencia interna de .79.\nResultados De un total de 332 estudiantes de 1o Curso de Grado en Enfermeria de la Universidad Catolica de Valencia se incluyeron en el estudio 285 estudiantes, lo cual supone una mortalidad experimental del 14,16%. Las causas de mortalidad experimental fueron: 42 sujetos no presentes, 2 rechazan participar y en 3 casos respuestas extremas en dos o mas cuestionarios.\nPara estudiar la validez de constructo del Cuestionario PAM-R, se realizo un analisis factorial confirmatorio en el que se identificaron cinco factores latentes que explicaban los distintos items del cuestionario: Miedo a la Muerte, Evitacion de la Muerte, Aceptacion Neutral, Aceptacion de Acercamiento y Aceptacion de Escape, siguiendo la propuesta de los autores originales (Gesser, Wong y Recker, 1987). Este modelo mostro un ajuste general muy adecuado: χ 2 (454) = 864.888 (p < .001), CFI = .944, RMSEA = .057 (intervalo de confianza al 90%: .051-.062). Tambien el ajuste analitico fue correcto, con todos los items con saturaciones factoriales estadisticamente significativas (p < .010).\nPor lo que respecta a la validez de constructo del Cuestionario CL-FoDS, se realizo un analisis factorial confirmatorio en el que se identificaron los cuatro factores latentes propuestos por los autores originales (Collett y Lester, 1969; Lester y AbdelKhalek, 2003; Tomas-Sabado, 2007) que explicaban los 28 items del cuestionario: Actitudes hacia la Propia Muerte, Actitudes hacia el Propio Proceso de Morir, Actitudes hacia la Muerte de Otros y Actitudes hacia el Proceso de Morir de Otros. Este modelo tambien mostro un ajuste general adecuado: χ 2 (344) = 811.531 (p < .001), CFI = .954, RMSEA = .069 (intervalo de confianza al 90%: .063-.075). El ajuste analitico tambien fue correcto, con todos los items con saturaciones factoriales estadisticamente significativas (p < .010).\nEl modelo de ecuaciones estructurales en el que las actitudes ante la muerte predecian el bienestar y la resiliencia mostro un ajuste general adecuado: χ2 (106) = 164.8450 (p < .001), CFI = .961, RMSEA = .045 (intervalo de confianza al 90%: .031- .058). En cuanto al ajuste analitico, y tal y como se puede observar en la Figura 4, la parte de medida (factores latentes de Bienestar y Resiliencia con sus indicadores) fue adecuada, pues todas las saturaciones factoriales fueron estadisticamente significativas y positivas.\nConclusiones: La Aceptacion de Acercamiento y la Aceptacion Neutral son predictores positivos del Bienestar Psicologico, y la Aceptacion de Escape, el Miedo a la Muerte y las actitudes hacia el Proceso de Morir de los Otros son predictores negativos del Bienestar Psicologico.\nLa Aceptacion Neutral y las actitudes hacia el Propio Proceso de Morir son predictores positivos de la Resiliencia, y las actitudes hacia el Proceso de Morir de Otros es un predictor negativo de la Resiliencia.",

Existing self‐directed speech measures (e.g., thought sampling and questionnaires) either uniquely capture inner speech frequency and neglect its content or classify self‐reported thoughts instances in overly simplistic categories determined by the researchers. In the current study, we describe an open‐format thought listing procedure as well as a refined coding scheme and present detailed inner speech content self‐generated by 76 university students. The most frequently self‐reported inner speech activities were self‐regulation (e.g., planning and problem solving), self‐reflection (e.g., emotions, self‐motivation, appearance, behavior/performance, and autobiography), critical thinking (e.g., evaluating, judging, and criticizing), people in general, education, and current events. Inner speech occurred most commonly while studying and driving. These results are consistent with the self‐regulatory and self‐referential functions of inner speech often emphasized in the literature. Future research avenues using the open‐format inner speech listing procedure and coding scheme are proposed.",

      "abstract": "An organization’s death exhibits many of the same feelings and reactions that humans experience with the loss of a loved one. People are forced to disconnect from established relationships and to reconnect with others. This disconnecting and reconnecting involves stages of anticipation or uncertainty, confirmation or recognition of the need for change, action, and adjustment. Describes an observational study of an organization which exhibits the feelings and reactions during different stages of an organization’s death. Three propositions explain how people cope during these stages: (i) Those who are able to take positive action have a more pronounced sense of their own ability to control their own destinies (internal locus of control) and a realistic feeling of invulnerability. (ii) The beliefs and illusions about an organization’s pending termination may be created and nourished by very little information, rumours and preconceived beliefs. (iii) Some people, who were more receptive to feedback, have some very realistic beliefs about their future and were very capable of adjusting their “paradigms” of how to respond to their future. The painful feelings of disconnecting might be assisted by feedback and support, while reconnecting to new organizations might depend on one’s attitudes and beliefs.",

      "title": "Sleepiness due to sleep-related breathing disorders",
      "abstract": "This chapter discusses the three domains of cognition for which the effects of sleepiness are reasonably well understood: attention and vigilance, executive functioning, and learning and memory. It investigates the effects of sleepiness on distinct cognitive processes involved in the performance of cognitive tasks. Sleepiness due to sleep loss or circadian misalignment causes an increase of average reaction times in vigilance and reaction time tasks. Sleepiness has the potential to alter emotional states and bias the interpretation of the emotional context of a situation, and may thereby influence decision-making. Memory encoding, or the conversion of sensory input into a neural representation, appears to be adversely affected by lack of prior sleep. Sleepiness may affect these cognitive processes differentially, so that the effects of sleepiness depend on the ensemble of cognitive processes required to perform the task at hand.",

      "abstract": "Careless actions or behaviors often lead to undesirable outcomes. For example, consider a scenario where someone inadvertently sends or shares incorrect information; this can cause inconvenience and discomfort to others. Moreover, the individual who made the mistake may become hesitant to send or share information in the future due to the mental burden resulting from self-reflection and self-discipline. In other words, addressing carelessness solely through attention or blame may not be sufficient for individuals to overcome it. This paper proposes an application that encourages individuals to contemplate carelessness with concept of homophones and look-alike words.",

      "abstract": "Anticipation serves as an interesting clue in the field of developmental psychology since it can be assessed at a behavioral level during interaction within both social and physical environments. Assessing anticipatory behaviors leads to a better understanding of child development, providing clues to the development of a child’s cognitive skills. On a theoretical level, several questions arise. Does a child who anticipates necessarily understand the situation he is in, or does he merely make a perceptive association learned through conditioning? Can it be stated with certainty that a child who does not (or cannot) anticipate does not understand? In the case of a child’s typical development, anticipation is also one means for understanding atypical development, such as autism spectrum disorder. On a practical level, whatever the underlying explanation, anticipation deficit could be one interesting screening procedure for detecting developmental disorders as early as possible.",

Stress will become a problem if there is a discrepancy between the demands on a teacher and his or her ability to manage. It therefore follows that the amount of stress which a person can withstand is differentiated according to the individual. Many authorities were addressing the issue of stress management by running one-day courses for headteachers, deputy headteachers and other staff. These courses were of two kinds: courses specifically dealing with identification and management of stress; and general management development courses, using material developed within the authority or elsewhere, which included elements or modules on stress and time management. An organisation that has a large number of highly stressed teachers will not be good for, or effective in, any organisational capacity.",

She summarises knowledge about the key role of emotions and motivations around a small number of principles. Students are more motivated to engage in learning when: they feel competent to do what is expected of them and perceive stable links between actions and achievement; they value the subject and have a clear sense of purpose; they experience positive emotions towards learning activities and, contrariwise, turn away from learning when they experience negative emotions; and when they perceive the environment as favourable for learning. Students free up cognitive resources when they are able to influence the intensity, duration and expression of their emotions, and are more persistent in learning when they can manage their resources and deal with obstacles efficiently.",

      "title": "SELF-EXPERIMENTATION: A CALL FOR CHANGE1",
      "abstract": "Few behavioral psychologists spend much time experimentally analyzing their own behaviors. Perhaps they study animals in op?rant chambers, or people in laboratories, classrooms, or hospitals, but rarely, if ever, do they study them selves in quite the same manner. To the contrary, they generally do what others do, layman and scientist alike, and strive to lead a good and effective life, try to raise their children well, and hope things will change for the better. Some even fight with spouse or colleagues and attempt to solve problems, at least for the moment, in alcohol, orgasm, or acid. Although scientists by profession, behavioral psychologists generally leave their science at work, in the laboratory or the office. Nine-to-five scientists, they neither bring science home nor turn it on the substance of their ongoing lives. The main point of this paper can be phrased as an hypothesis: if experimental psychologists applied the scientific method to their own lives, they would learn more of importance to everyone, and assist more in the solution of problems, than if they continue to relegate science exclusively to the study of others. The area of inquiry would be relevant to the experimenter's ongoing life, the subject would be the experimenter, and the dependent variable some aspect of the experimenter's behavior, overt or covert. Self-experimentation has a long history, especially in the medical sciences, resulting in significant discoveries (Altman, 1972). For 30 years in the late 16th century, Sanctorius of Padua weighed himself before and after meals, weighed all foods he ate, and weighed his excrements, and then attempted to account for the differences in weights. His was an early attempt to study the energy expended by a living organism. Anton Storck, in 1760, drank hemlock to determine its therapeutic effects. To study how digitalis affected his vision, Purkinje ate fox glove. John Hunter, attempting to determine whether syphilis and gonorrhea were separate diseases, inoculated himself with matter obtained from the penis of one of his patients. W. Forssmann placed a catheter through the vein of his arm into his own heart, demonstrating the feasibility of this important medical",

      "title": "The role of ineffective directives in the development of early childhood “noncompliance”.",
      "abstract": "We provide a conceptual model for understanding the role of stimulus control within directives and a rationale for the use of experimental analysis methodology to assess the effects of task directives on the accuracy of task completion and the early development of noncompliance in young children. An overview of the interaction between organism variables (e.g., skill deficits such as language disorders), idiosyncratic histories of reinforcement during demand situations, and the specific type of directive used during demand situations will be discussed along with a brief review of relevant studies. Some directions for future research on early childhood noncompliance and related behaviors are discussed. ********** Catania (1994) defined stimulus control as an antecedent stimulus event that sets the occasion for a specific response. Therefore, when a specific response occurs following the presentation of a specific stimulus (e.g., instructional prompt), but not in the presence of another stimulus, then the response is considered to be under stimulus control. For example, when a room becomes cluttered and disorganized, this stimulus may serve as a discriminative stimulus (SD) for the individual to clean the room. In this case, the cluttered room is a cue to the individual to clean it up, if cleaning up has historically been associated with reinforcement (e.g., parental praise). For some children, however, the natural situation (a cluttered room) does not function as an SD, and additional prompting (e.g., instructions from the parents) is required to set the occasion for the desired behavior to be emitted. The type of additional cue or instructional prompt provided to the child may have a substantial effect on the behavior or chain of behavior that follows the instructional prompt (see Figure 1). If the child is provided with an effective instructional prompt that has historically been associated with reinforcement, this type of instructional prompt will set the occasion for a chain of behavior that begins with the child discriminating the task requirements, completing the task accurately, and then receiving reinforcement through a variety of operant mechanisms such as parental praise and access to preferred activities. In this case, we can say that the child has complied. However, if the child has a history of being provided with ineffective stimulus prompts that do not guide the child in discriminating the task requirements, these types of prompts may produce a different chain of behavior that is perceived by caregivers as noncompliance. If the child is not able to discriminate the task requirements, the parent may assume that the child is displaying noncompliant behavior, and the parent then provides various forms of redirection or punishment (e.g., reprimands, removal of preferred activities, physical punishment). Over time, the presentation of prompts is repeatedly paired with extinction or punishment, leading to avoidance or escape-maintained problem behavior. In this case, the child is repeatedly exposed to ineffective directives and then punished for perceived noncompliance. Thus, care providers may inadvertently shape a chain of problematic behaviors that are maintained by negative reinforcement (e.g., the child may display disruptive behavior to escape completing the demand). [FIGURE 1 OMITTED] In this conceptual model, compliance can be defined as consisting of two distinct behaviors: (a) discriminating the components presented in the instructional prompt and (b) performing the specific acts requested (Richman et al., in review). Two distinctly different sets of outcomes for each chain of behavior are shown in the bottom of Figure 1. For compliant behavior (behavior chain A), ongoing compliance is maintained by positive reinforcement. Of equal importance, the pairing of positive reinforcement with task directives assists the child to discriminate the SDs present in the natural situation, which may reduce the future need for task directives delivered by the care provider. …",

      "title": "THEORETICAL FUNDAMENTALS OF OCCUPATIONAL MOTIVATION",
      "abstract": "Motivation is the moving factor and the reason for carrying out the defined activities, the personal development, the realization of the work process. To make one decision the individual chooses between two or more options, depending on the desire for the final result and the achievement of the set goals. The motivation for labor is conscious and/or unconscious depending on the received satisfaction and willingness to achieve definite and benefits. At the beginning of his career, every employee is confronted with the dilemma of whether the choice of work is appropriate, whether he is prepared to perform the assigned tasks, whether he is ready for the responsibilities that accompany the work process. Effective staff management depends to a large extent on how to steer people in a particular direction and what steps to take to motivate them to reach their horizons, which implies the propulsion of populations of value Landmarks, human energy from positive impulses or building a complete system of business projects to achieve personal goals, a sense of common purpose and strategy. Theoretical-the applied dimensions of motivation most often bring to the fore: The potential of the person (or group) and the strength of their motivation. This dependence means that the lack of quality training and the ability to carry out an activity cannot be replaced by the highest degree of motivation to obtain positive results. Knowing the theories of labour motivation can give confidence to workers and their managers about the implementation of activities and tasks based on thought or physical processes. Motivation for work and fulfillment of the assigned tasks is the driving force for the development of the society, for the development of the economy, for the development of science.",

      "title": "Étude de résolution de problèmes. Quelques problèmes de même structure en physique.",
      "abstract": "Parmi les activites proposees aux eleves dans le cadre d'un enseignement, la resolution d'exercices occupe une place primordiale : elle permet d'une part un entrainement a l'utilisation de notions nouvellement acquises, d'autre part, elle joue un grand role dans l'evaluation des eleves. Cependant cette evaluation ne se fonde bien souvent que sur les resultats et reste approximative dans la mesure ou elle ne tient pas compte des processus sous-jacents de resolution. Toute une partie de ce que fait l'eleve lorsqu'il resout un exercice reste etranger a l'enseignant et nombreux sont les cas ou ce dernier projette ses propres idees sur ce que fait reellement l'eleve.\r\nOn peut envisager differents aspects de ce que fait un sujet en cours de resolution : lecture et interpretation de l'enonce, recherche d'actions ou d'operations permettant de modifier les informations acquises sur la situation, calculatoire, controle des resultats ou d'auto-evaluation. Dans un probleme de physique, les operateurs sont en general implicites et multiples et une des difficultes majeures de la resolution est de degager les operateurs qui sont a la fois corrects et pertinents. Dans ce dernier cas, le rappel des connaissances joue donc un role fondamental et ce qui entre en jeu dans la resolution n'est pas seulement la quantite de connaissances memorisees mais aussi leur disponibilite.\r\nNous avons oriente notre travail vers l'etude du mecanisme de rappel de relations : qu'y a-t-il de sous-jacent aux relations rappelees ? Existe-t-il des regles generales de rappel au sens ou on pourrait definir a quelles conditions telle relation sera rappelee par le sujet plutot que telle autre ? Quel est, dans ce mecanisme de rappel, la part de contraintes liees a la structure de la tache, au contenu physique, aux representations qui en sont faites, a l'existence de modeles naturels ? Nous avons cherche aussi a savoir les liens qui peuvent exister entre ce mecanisme de rappel et les contraintes du formalisme mathematique. Ces preoccupations nous ont amenes a ne considerer qu'une categorie de problemes : des problemes ayant la meme structure, au sens ou d'une solution a l'autre les relations entre les grandeurs physiques intervenant sont les memes, mais dont chaque enonce se situe dans des contextes physiques differents. Nous avons cherche enfin a interpreter un certain nombre d'erreurs dans la resolution comme liees a ce mecanisme de rappel qui peut entrainer une mauvaise utilisation des connaissances en principe disponibles. Nous avons cherche aussi a deduire de l'existence de ce mecanisme et de ses proprietes quelques consequences pedagogiques : en quoi ce mecanisme impose-t-il des contraintes dans la facon d'atteindre tel ou tel objectif d'enseignement ?",

      "abstract": "Las funciones ejecutivas constituyen un conjunto de habilidades que incluye la resolucion de problemas, la planificacion, la iniciacion, el autocontrol, la conciencia ante situaciones nuevas y la capacidad de modificar los planes si es necesario. Se trata de funciones de alto nivel cognitivo, que son cruciales para que una persona mantenga sus actividades diarias y para la promocion de una buena calidad de vida. El deficit en estas funciones se conoce como sindrome disejecutivo (SD). Hay muchos modelos teoricos sobre SD; sin embargo, la literatura no es muy clara en relacion con los componentes involucrados ni con la forma de investigar y resolver este problema. Varios estudios muestran que la edad, el consumo de sustancias y la psicopatologia pueden afectar a algunas de estas funciones a traves de danos en los circuitos frontales asociados a ellos. El efecto de este dano puede poner en peligro las actividades rutinarias del dia a dia, imponer dificultades en la socializacion y afectar su vida laboral. Hay un cuerpo creciente de estudios que tratan de determinar las causas, consecuencias y modelos que son capaces de dar cuenta de estos efectos y promover estrategias de tratamiento mas eficaces. Este articulo pretende hacer una revision de la SD, centrandose en los aspectos relacionados mas importantes, tales como las comorbilidades, la reserva cerebral, la reserva cognitiva y los programas de rehabilitacion.",

In both cases, achieving goals will enable individuals to experience self-fulfillment and success. Self-regulatory systems also maintain our actions within the limits of acceptable as well as restrain from unwanted behaviours. Self-regulatory learning helps learners achieve higher academic goals as it gives students control over their learning. In order to successfully self-regulate one's learning, it is important to recognize the essential components of self-regulatory learning, which help chose learning methods and strategies. We aimed at discovering which learning strategies and styles the students prefer and which elements of self-regulatory learning occur in the learning process. We can conclude that the students lack the knowledge of self-regulatory processes and learning strategies, and are unaware of their preferred learning styles.",

The chapter advances the following arguments: (1) It does matter how is in charge, and the available evidence does not unequivocally support the objections to this view. (2) The personal qualities that matter in leaders include moral integrity. (3) Some of the processes that determine access to positions of leadership are insufficiently sensitive to relevant personal characteristics. (4) In particular, the top-down or bureaucratic processes that exist in many organizations are less likely than bottom-up processes to eliminate leadership candidates with moral flaws. The authors argue that moral integrity in leadership matters because of the opportunities to do immense harm available to those who occupy leadership positions. Lack of moral integrity in a leader is thus of far greater consequence than lack of conscience, self-control, or tolerance in any private citizen acting alone.",

Se buscara discutir especificamente el porque del bajo nivel perceptivo ante una situacion compleja y la rapida velocidad en la que se produce el “reseteo”, el olvido de los conceptos, conocimientos o destrezas.

Rather than explore issues and research information and options, he may quickly jump to posing solutions and view design as a linear, step-by-step process. Instead of testing a variety of ideas, a beginning designer often becomes mesmerized by his initial ideas. An experienced designer, on the other hand, is much more likely conduct research and delay making decisions until the challenge has been fully explored [1]. She uses a variety of techniques to generate ideas, test them, and see how they inter-relate, sees design as an iterative process, has a variety of approaches, integrates feedback and reflects on the design process. She uses rational inquiry to cross-reference and integrate ideas, information, and personal experience. Such behaviour reflects beliefs about knowledge and its creation and such actions are hallmarks of the relativistic thinker [5] who can set goals, reflect on thinking, identify what is needed and understand why it is necessary.

There is no valid reason to ignore the individual officer's mental, emotional, and physical fitness, because these areas of work fitness will determine the outcome of his or her work and life. Comprehensive work fitness must become an emphasis within police training and supervision. If work fitness is not integrated into the ongoing, mainstream training and supervisory emphases, more errors will be made, and this could lead to more officers dying unnecessarily. Training and practice makes police personnel expert and well-conditioned in the management of stress-exposure incidents, and which will bring about a substantial decrease in the frequency and severity of errors in their tactical responses.",

The authors examine the properties of the individual, in particular, temperament and character features to ensure the effectiveness of the special conditions and in difficult situations. Special attention is been paid to the issue of abilities, including adaptive, predictive ones. Of professionals working in specific conditions, sanguine and choleric temperament types are characteristic, and much less phlegmatic and melancholic ones. This is because the first two are more ready to changing conditions, adapt to them more quickly. In occupations where activities are connected with unexpectedly emerging problems’ management, availability is due to firm nervous system, these specialists are not so likely to commit accidents, errors, as they man in these situations. The overall structure of the personality of the person carrying out work in special conditions can be summarized as a set of mental processes (cognitive, emotional, volitional); mental properties (character, temperament, directivity, abilities: adaptive, predictive, communicative ones, etc.); of mental states (satisfaction vs dissatisfaction, activity, enthusiasm, cheerfulness, depression, passivity); of mental formations (knowledge, skills, abilities, habits) which interact with the situation, while the role of the latter varies depending on its type and trained state of a specialist.",

One of the most common factors that hinder personal and professional effectiveness is procrastination. There is a hypothesis that people with high levels of procrastination have correspondingly well-developed creative thinking, which endows them with the ability to solve problems outside the box and quickly adapt to situations.1 We consider procrastination as a psychological pattern of behavior characterized by person's delaying planned actions or decision-making followed by negative emotional experiences. Literature analysis has shown that procrastination influences creative activity, which leads to the assumption that people with higher levels of procrastination have a higher level of creativity. Upon conducting our research, we uncovered the following pattern: students with a high level of procrastination are more inclined to such factors as risk-taking and fantasy; students with a low level are more likely to present curiosity and task complexity; and students with an average level of procrastination are equally likely to present both factors.",

For instance, the developers of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (Gioia, Isquith, Guy, &amp; Kenworthy, 2000 have defined two broad categories of skills, those involved in behavior regulation (e.g., impulse control, emotion control) and those that are more metacognitive in nature (e.g., working memory, task initiation, planning/organization). More recently, Barkley (2011), in developing the Barkley Deficits in Executive Functioning Scale, identified five broad categories of executive functioning (e.g., self-regulation of emotion, time management, organization/problem solving). In our work with parents and teachers, we have identified 11 individual executive skills that we believe figure prominently in understanding why some children tackle activities of daily living, including schoolwork, homework, chores, and daily routines, more successfully than others. Table 24.1 lists these skills, along with brief definitions, and a description of the most common exemplars of problems associated with each executive skill.",

      "title": "Countertransference During Supervision in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy",
      "abstract": "Many experts claim that transference and countertransference analysis has no place in cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and should be used solely in psychodynamic psychotherapy. However, attention paid to emotional and cognitive reactions to the patient or supervisee is the basic component of cognitive behavioural therapy and its supervision, especially if work with difficult patients is supervised. Countertransference reaction may be observed especially in our behaviour, but also in our thoughts, emotional experiences and physical symptoms. The essence of counte rtransference is usually previous experiences of the supervisor which were not adequately processed and thus tend to be projected into current relationships. They may be recognized in work with core schemata and derived rules themselves. They lead to behaviour which may be avoidance (e.g. lack of openness or congruence) or compensatory (e.g. excessive help, competition, showing off). Self-reflection or realizing countertransference during supervision aids in overcoming countertransference reactions and may be crucial for establishing a more real relationship and more objective work in both therapy and supervision. Adequate self-reflection and supervision of one’s own work is one of prerequisites for adequate development of the supervisor’s competences.",

      "abstract": "Transtornos mentais sao altamente prevalentes e incidentes e estao\r\nassociados com grandes impactos na vida pessoal do individuo acometido e na sociedade. O exercicio fisico e uma importante intervencao para pacientes com transtornos mentais. Pessoas com transtornos mentais sao menos ativas por enfrentarem barreiras adicionais relacionadas aos sintomas e ao tratamento dessas condicoes como a falta de vontade, desânimo, cansaco, entre outros. Os profissionais de saude que trabalham nesta area de atuacao sao diretamente responsaveis pela promocao de um estilo de vida mais ativo, recomendando ou prescrevendo exercicio para este publico. No entanto, algumas barreiras do profissional, como a falta de conhecimento especifico sobre o exercicio fisico, ou a falta de entendimento da importância da intervencao para a promocao da saude fisica, podem impactar no quanto o exercicio e recomendado e prescrito. Para realizar este trabalho foi necessario traduzir e adaptar transculturalmente o instrumento “The Exercise in Mental Illness Questionnaire (EMIQ)” pois nao havia nenhum instrumento em portugues que pudesse ser utilizado para atingir o objetivo do estudo. Portanto, os objetivos do presente estudo foram 1) traduzir e adaptar transculturalmente\r\no instrumento “The Exercise in Mental Illness Questionnaire (EMIQ)” para a\r\nlingua portuguesa; 2) entender o conhecimento dos profissionais da area de saude mental sobre a prescricao e recomendacao de exercicio fisico para pessoas com transtornos mentais atraves da aplicacao do questionario. Participaram do estudo 74 profissionais da area da saude mental (68,5% mulheres, idade media = 37,03 anos; todos atuavam nos CAPS das cidades de Porto Alegre e Canoas/RS. As barreiras mais frequentes foram ”prescricao de exercicio fisico para pessoas com transtornos mentais e melhor realizada por um profissional do exercicio fisico ou fisioterapeuta” (26%), ”ha muito estigma associado a ter transtornos mentais” (12,3%). Encontramos atraves do comparativo de somatorio de barreiras e frequencia de prescricao que aqueles que “nunca” prescrevem apresentam mais barreiras do que os que prescrevem\r\n“sempre” (64,31 [9,32] e 52,37 [9,27], p=0,005). Aqueles profissionais que\r\nfazem o minimo de exercicio fisico recomendado prescrevem mais EXF para seus pacientes (p=0,040). Os dados demonstram que os profissionais veem barreiras para prescrever exercicio fisico aos pacientes com transtornos mentais e, portanto, fazem-se necessarias capacitacoes e modificacoes nas estruturas dos cursos de graduacao para melhor atuacao nesta area. Promover a pratica de exercicio fisico entre os profissionais pode reduzir as barreiras existentes para a recomendacao e prescricao de exercicio fisico para pessoas com transtornos mentais.",

      "title": "Challenges to reaching negotiated agreements",
      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter reviews documented social, cognitive, and psychological barriers to human negotiation and communication, including human error in information processing and attributions made about others and self. These include such distortions in our thinking as giving too much attention to what goes first (primacy or anchoring), what is most vivid or recent or available to us. We make choices based on our own preferences for gain or loss (and assume others share our preferences); we reason with statistical fallacies, we devalue what others with whom we disagree say, we have social biases that prevent us from accurately processing information and hearing what others say and want, all of which impede our ability to reach mutually rewarding solutions to negotiated problems. We are often overconfident about our own goals and abilities, and we underestimate and devalue others, all while often seeking to confirm what we already think, rather than attempting to learn new things. This chapter explores ways we can correct for these biases in order to improve our own information processing and ability to see better solutions to negotiation problems, both through better cognition and information processing and more attention to others (e.g. with use of greater empathy and the use of mediation processes).",

      "abstract": "In the literature on autism, there is less written on repetitive and ritualistic behaviours than on the social and communication aspects of autism. What is written on the subject is often rather negatively construed in the sense that such behaviour is viewed as negative and interventions have been designed to reduce or stop such behaviours. In this chapter, the authors take a different view and suggest that often behaviours such as lining up, checking the order of things or playing computer games have a positive effect on a person’s physical and psychological state and give a sense of achievement. They argue that such activities may help to achieve a flow state, as defined by Csikszentmihalyi (1990), where a person is so immersed in an activity that nothing else seems to matter. Against this, they point out that some repetitive activities may cause distress and that staff and parents need to ask how the person seems when engaged in the activity (eg how do they appear when engaged in the activity? Are they calmer after the activity?). This chapter is likely to lead parents and staff to develop a different perspective on repetitive and ritualistic behaviour, and so also to build different responses to these.",

      "abstract": "INDONESIA:\r\n\r\nPenelitian ini didasarkan pada masalah guru dalam menjalankan tugas sehari-hari, seringkali guru harus berhadapan dengan siswa yang prestasi akademisnya tidak sesuai dengan harapan guru. Bila hal ini terjadi dan ternyata kemampuan kognitif siswa cukup baik, guru cenderung mengatakan bahwa siswa tidak termotivasi. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui bagaimana Konsep Diri yang dimiliki, bagaimana Motivasi Belajar dan adakah hubungan antara konsep diri dengan motivasi belajari pada siswa kelas XI IPS MAN 1 Kota Blitar.\r\n\r\nKonsep diri menurut Fitts (dalam Agustiani, 2006:138-139) mengatakan bahwa konsep diri merupakan aspek penting dalam diri seseorang. Konsep diri merupakan kerangka acuan (frame of reference) dalam berinteraksi dengan lingkunganya. Ia menjelaskan dalam fenomenologis dan mengatakan bahwa ketika individu mempersepsikan dirinya, berinterakasi dan bereaksi terhadap dirinya, memberikan arti dan penilaian abstraksi tentang dirinya. Berartia dia menunjukan suatu kesadaran diri (selft awernes) dan kemapuan untuk keluar dari dirinya sendiri untuk melihat dirinya seperti yang ia lakukan terhadap dunia luar dirinya. Sedangkan menurut A.M. Sardiman (2005:75) motivasi belajar dapat diartikan sebagai serangkaian usaha untuk menyediakan kondisi-kondisi tertentu, sehingga seseorang mau dan ingin melakukan sesuatu, dan bila ia tidak suka, maka akan berusaha untuk meniadakan atau mengelak perasaan tidak suka itu.\r\n\r\nDalam penelitian ini menggunakan analisis data Kuantitatif Korelasi untuk mengetahui hubungan satu variabel dengan variabel yang lainya. Pengambilan data menggunakan Skala Konsep Diri dan Skala Motivasi Belajar yang disebarkan langsung kepada subjek penelitian. Skala Konsep Diri terdiri dari 29 aitem valid dengan a = 0,912 dan Skala Motivasi Belajar terdiri dari 20 aitem valid dengan a = 0,877. Hasil analisis tersebut menunjukkan adanya hubungan yang signifikan antara konsep diri dengan motivasi belajar terlihat pada angka korelasi rxy =0,443 dengan sig = 0,002 (0,002 < 0,05), sehingga hipotesis “Adanya Hubungan Positif Konsep Diri dengan Motivasi Belajar” pada siswa MAN 1 Blitar dapat diterima.\r\n\r\nBerdasarkan hasil penelitian yang diperoleh dapat penulis simpulkan bahwa motivasi atau dorongan belajar individu dipengaruhi dari dalam diri seseorang tersebut, semakin memiliki konsep diri yang baik dorongan untuk belajar dapat terpenuhi.\r\n\r\nENGLISH:\r\n\r\nThis research is based on the problem of teachers about academic records of students that do not conform to the teacher expectations. If the student have good cognitive abilities, then teachers tend to say that the students are not motivated. The purpose of this study to determine how the self-concept owned, Learning Motivation and how to know relationship between self-concept and leraning motivation on student of XI IPS MAN 1 Blitar.\r\n\r\nThe self-concept according to Fitts (in Agustiani, 2006: 138-139) states that the self-concept is an important aspect in a person. The self-concept is a reference frame (frame of reference) to interact with their environment. He explains in the phenomenological and said when individuals perceive themselves, interact and react to them self, give meaning and abstraction assessment to them self. It means he showed a self awernes and the ability to get out of them self to see inside them as they do to the world outside himself. Meanwhile, according to A.M. Sardiman (2005: 75) learning motivation can be interpreted as a efforts to provide certain conditions, so persons are willing and wants to do something, and if they does not like, they will eliminate or circumvent the mistake.\r\n\r\nIn this research using Correlation Quantitative data analysis to determine the relationship between variables. Retrieving data using Self-Concept Scale and Learning Motivation Scale distributed directly to the subject of research. Self Scale consists of 29 item valid with a = 0.912 and Motivation Scale consists of 20 item valid with a = 0.877. The results of this analysis showed a significant relationship between self-concept and Learning motivation. It depends on the number of correlation r xy = 0.443, sig = 0,002 (0,002 < 0,05),, so the hypothesis There are Positive Corelations between Learning Motivation and Self Concept on students MAN 1 Blitar acceptable.\r\n\r\nAccording on this Research authors conclude that the individual learning motivation in person affected from inside by them self , more self-concept means urge to learn can be met.",

      "abstract": "Abstract When the mind wanders to unrelated thoughts and feelings while reading, the eyes often continue to scan the words without due attention to their meaning. This mindless reading , similar to states such as daydreaming or absentminded lapses, is a state of decoupled processing in which attention to ongoing perceptual information is reduced often in favor of the active consideration of internally generated thoughts and feelings. Normal reading involves a complex interaction between bottom‐up representations of the text that is being read and top‐down representations of the more general context that help to keep the readers mind on what they are doing. Since states of decoupling involve a reduced processing of sensory information, the coupling between the reader and the text breaks down during mindless reading. This reduced external coupling is one reason why mind‐wandering during reading has significant implications for reading comprehension. Following the presentation of a model of the decoupled state and a specific consideration of mind‐wandering during reading, five key unresolved issues for future research in mindless reading are identified.",

Cricket is particularly demanding, given the globalisation and different formats of the game. To reduce anxiety/depression in professional cricketers, potential risk factors need to be identified. <h3>Objectives</h3> Firstly, to determine the prevalence of anxiety/depression in South African professional cricketers. Secondly, determine whether factors such as education, family life, or career-related factors are associated with anxiety/depression. <h3>Design</h3> A cross-sectional survey design using the General Health Questionnaire – a robust and reliable self-report measure for risk of anxiety/depression. <h3>Participants</h3> All Professional South African Cricketers (n=177). <h3>Assessment of Risk Factors</h3> Players' career (e.g. main role in the team, level of cricket), family (e.g. marital status, whether they had children) and education (e.g. highest level of education, whether they were currently studying) <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> General Health Questionnaire 12 (GHQ) Score (ranging from 0–12). Anxiety/Depression prevalence (based on GHQ). Relative Risk Ratios (RR) for anxiety/depression based playing career, family and education. <h3>Results</h3> The prevalence of anxiety/depression was 58%. The mean GHQ score for the sample was 3.6 (95% CI: 3.2–4.0). The likelihood of developing anxiety/depression increased when players were playing a higher level (RR: 7.3; 95% CI: 2.0–26.3; p &lt; 0.01), contracted for more than 2 years (RR: 5.0; 95% CI: 1.2–21.3; p &lt; 0.05) or if they played their last offseason overseas (RR: 3.5; 95% CI: 1.3–9.6; p &lt; 0.05). The likelihood of developing anxiety/depression decreased when players made productive use of their spare time in the offseason (RR: 0.3; 95% CI: 0.1–0.9; p &lt; 0.05) and were contracted for 2 years (RR: 0.3; 95% CI: 0.1–1.0; p &lt; 0.05). <h3>Conclusions</h3> The prevalence of symptoms of anxiety/depression in this cohort was higher than previously reported for elite athletes. Potential risk factors have been identified that can be used to design and develop strategies to reduce anxiety/depression in professional cricketers.",

      "title": "Academic Motivation and Locus of Control among Engineering Students",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONMotivation is one of the most important components of learning in any educational environment. Questions about why students engage in, pursue, and accomplish certain goals or tasks, or why they avoid others, have been the subject of educational psychologists for a long time. Given the same learning potential in the same environment with the same teacher, why does student motivation vary? Clearly, something external and/or something internal to the student must account for the variance.Intrinsic motivation refers to engaging in an activity for its own sake, for the pleasure and enjoyment it provides. To be more precise, a student who is intrinsically motivated carries out an action for the learning it permits. Extrinsic motivation is defined as the motivation to engage in an activity in order to obtain rewards or to avoid punishments from an external source. Compared to extrinsic motivation, intrinsic motivation is more desirable as it is the motivation to engage in the learning process for the enjoyment of learning without considering its consequences.Locus of control is a relatively stable trait, a belief about the extent to which behaviors influence successes or failures (Rotter, 1966). It affects learning, motivation, and behavior (Pintrich & Schunk, 1996).Internal locus of control means believing that success or failure is attributable to one's own effort or ability. External locus of control is attributing success or failure to factors outside of one's control (e.g. luck, poor teaching, etc). Family style and resources, cultural background, and experiences with effort leading to reward can influence the development of locus of control.Students with an internal locus of control believe that they are in control of their lives. They understand that grades are directly related to the amount of study invested and hence hey are self-motivated. Students with an external locus of control believe that their lives are largely a result of luck, fate, or chance. They think that teachers give grades rather than students earn grades. They relay on external motivation from teachers or others. Several studies have shown that academic motivation was positively related with internal locus of control. Talbot (1981) found that intrinsic motivation and locus of control were positively related. Landine & Stewart (1998) found significant positive relationship between academic motivation and locus of control. Botsari (1999) found that academic intrinsic motivation was negatively related to external locus of control.Gender role stereotypes play an important role in academic motivation and locus of control according to which boys should be more autonomous, more independent, more creative and more aggressive and with a strong tendency to master. Social, cultural and familial support and expectations determine such stereotypes.Several studies have shown that boys show a greater degree of extrinsic motivational orientation (Midgley & Urdan. 1995; Urdan et al., 1998; Anderman & Anderman 1999; Rusillo and Arias, 2004) and Wong et al., (2007) found that boys have higher intrinsic motivation.While some studies show that girls have a greater intrinsic motivation (Nolen, 1988; Meece & Holt, 1993), Boggiano (1991) reported that girls are more likely to be extrinsically motivated. The studies conducted by Hagborg (1995); Ryan & Pintrich (1997); Rusillo and Arias (2004), did not find any gender difference in intrinsic motivation. Wehmeyer (1993), Elias & Rahman (1995) and Sherman et al., (1997) found that boys had more internal locus of control than girls.AimThe present research aimed to study the level of academic motivation and locus of control among engineering students of Salem.Objectives of the study1. To study the level of academic motivation and locus of control among engineering students.2. To see if there is significant relationship between academic motivation and locus of control. …",

      "title": "Self‐Enhancement",
      "abstract": "Self‐enhancement is typically defined as attending to and elaborating on positive information about the self, while ignoring and discounting negative information. This rather broad definition includes “positive illusions” such as holding overly positive views of the self (e.g., thinking one is more intelligent and friendly than others), having an exaggerated sense of personal control over events (e.g., thinking one has the power to heal oneself from cancer), and having unrealistic optimism, which manifests itself both in overly optimistic predictions relative to other people (e.g., predicting that one is more likely to have a lucrative career than most other people), and overly optimistic predictions relative to actual behavior (e.g., predicting that one will give more money to a particular charity than one ends up giving). Other ways people self‐enhance are with self‐serving attributions; that is, attributing success to ability but failure to other people, the situation, or bad luck. When faced with negative feedback, people maintain their positive self‐views by, among other things, discounting the feedback, derogating the person who delivered the feedback, misremembering it to be more positive than it really was, and by self‐affirmation; that is, compensating for the feedback by emphasizing the positivity of the self in a domain unrelated to the one in which the feedback was given.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Motivation energizes people to overcome setbacks. Study motivation helps students to stay focused and psychologically empowered to overcome obstacles and difficulties during study. Motivation drives students to achieve goals. Postgraduate students should be interested in the area of study and full of enthusiasm that should not wane as the study advances and as problems are confronted. One theory of motivation is Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. Maslow identified lower needs that have to be met before higher needs at the top. The starting point of Maslow's hierarchy theory is that people have needs that must be satisfied in the following order: * Physiological: food, sleep, etc. * Safety: Stable environment relatively free from threats * Social: Affectionate relations with others and status within a group. * Esteem: Self-respect, self-esteem, and the esteem of others; desire for confidence, competence, achievement, mastery, recognition, and reputation. * Self-actualization: Self-fulfilment The Nigerian postgraduate student may desire to move up the hierarchy to attain the level of self-actualization but this progress may be hindered by difficulties which could hamper the desire, zeal, and goal. Apart from these areas of needs in Maslow's theory that postgraduate students must overcome, this study will also look at other difficulties and obstacles confronting Nigerian postgraduates students in the areas of * Prolonged semesters or sessions due to strikes and student unrest * Getting research materials * Interaction between lecturers and students. * The need to for understanding and knowledge to satisfy curiosity, explore, and discover and to find solutions, look for relationships, and seek intellectual challenges. * The postgraduate student needs self-fulfilment, development, and use of potentials. The Nigerian Postgraduate Student and Maslow's Theory Motivation is key to overcoming difficulties and setbacks in the postgraduate level. Postgraduate students must take initiative in seeking resources, assistance, managing time, and forming good reading habits. Postgraduate education must motivate students to serious work. University authorities and other stakeholders in Nigerian postgraduate education systems must consider student needs in the hierarchical order. Priorities should be given to these motivational needs so that postgraduate students can reach their potential. Problems include: * Lack of study time * Poor use of study time * Procrastination * Lack of good study space Postgraduate students also influence motivation through factors such as desire, values, and beliefs that make them act. Postgraduate study is a goal-oriented venture and value is attached to it (Wilkinson 2006). In considering issues such as family relationships, grades, career, aspiration, achievement status, money, and social life, the postgraduate student gradually understands motivational needs. Goals and desires grow from values and beliefs. Motivation is related to commitment. Postgraduate students must be committed to good study habits and staying motivated. Activism and some aspects of social life may have to wait, even if these are part of students' values, beliefs, and pleasures. Maintaining Motivation and Goals Postgraduate students must realize their strengths and weaknesses. Informal assessment of ability should be done, along with reflection on lectures and discussion with lecturers and fellow students. Reading and writing skills should be self-assessed and critiqued. This prevents under-estimation or over- estimation of one's skills and helps in attaining goals. The establishment of both short- and long-term personal goals is crucial. Postgraduate students often aim toward a particular project, degree, graduate program, and professional career. …",

      "abstract": "When you practice and compete in sport, there are other people involved who support you in some way: coaches, parents, friends, and opponents. These people can influence how you feel about playing sport, through their actions, reactions, emotional expressions, and language. Our motivation in sport is not as simple as “more-v-less,” but rather we experience a whole range of motivating/demotivating factors at the same time. Some motivators seem to feel natural and come from within us, while others seem to come from outside ourselves—like prizes, punishments, and peer pressure. We can be motivated toward an activity (“I want to do that!”), or away from it (“I do not want to do that!”). We can define success and failure in various ways, too. For example, we can compare ourselves to others (“Did I win?” “How did I rank?”), or we can strive for learning and improvement (“I finally did it, it worked!”). The motivational climate in sport refers to the way people around you influence these aspects of motivation.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive Function Disorder is one of the important areas which cognitive psychology is focusing on.These functions include: language, speech, memory, intelligence, and executive functions.Cognitive process refers to process that includes knowing how individuals think, perceive, memories, and solve problems, and how he directs his attentions towards one stimulus rather than other.Actually, there is a group of factors affecting these cognitive process, subjective and objective factors.In addition, preschool stage, is a stage of fast development in executive functions, related to fast brain development.Neurological Cognitive Disorder, is one kind of psychological disorder which affect mainly individual cognitive abilities, which in turn includes learning memory, perception, and solving problem.Several theorists tried to interpret the causes underpin these disorders (e.g.: Piaget; Vygotsky; and Feuerstein).Drawing on their views we can conclude that cognitive function disorders in children is centered on failure in cognitive abilities and process, which leads to failure in some thinking skills.This paper concluded that in order to healing such disorders, our actions should be based on two approaches, first: child centered approach which includes: (1) developing children's executive functions; (2) adopting perceptual motor strategy; (3) employ Audiblox program; (4) adopting dynamic and cognitive assessment; and (5) developing multiple intelligences in children.Second: through early childhood teacher's preparation, by adopting several strategies including: (1) practice based on psychological process strategy;(2) practice based on analyzing the task; (3) practice based on multiple senses; (4) behavioral analyses strategy; (5) role exchange strategy; and (6) early intervention strategy.‫الأطفال‬",

      "title": "Examining the characteristics associated with the career paths of professional women's handball players",
      "abstract": "Career research and its specificity to athletes present a number of challenges in different topics and scientific fields (such as career development, career transitions, career decisions; (sport) psychology, sociology, anthropology, behavioural sciences). I have identified the following research problems: On the one hand, the athlete's career is finite (short); the difficulties of transition can be facilitated by a supportive environment, which is often lacking (when the bubble bursts, loss of value). On the other hand, active athletes are not sufficiently aware of the management and planning of sport careers and post-sport careers. Thirdly, athletes encounter different life decisions and decision-makers during different career transitions, which can affect career development. Fourthly, the development of sport has led to an intensification of economic processes in the sport industry. The impact of this can also be felt in the players market. Sports organisations may make decisions on many occasions, which may be justified from a management point of view, but which lead to the materialisation of human values (tangible values). Thus, players can be negative actors in the life of a club, which can have an impact on the development of their sporting careers. Finally, there is little literature on handball-related career research. Furthermore, the 2021 sport strategy (2022-2028) of the Hungarian Handball Federation (MKSZ) defines targets that justify the need for studies related to key stakeholders, handball players. My article-based dissertation, consisting of three studies, is an exploratory research with a broad research question: What factors within the culture of the sport of handball can be identified in terms of career management that determine players' career paths and what traits characterise their career paths and key decisions at the end of a successful career? I use the summaries of the articles to present the units of my dissertation: The first study utilises autoethnographic research methodology for introducing, from a handball player’s point of view, the culture in which her career unfolded (from the beginnings to the first few years after her retirement), and the most important characteristics that shaped her professional years in the Hungarian first league. This topic was chosen not only as sports economics considerations are important with regard to the career of a handballer, but also to highlight how an individual athlete experiences the processes occurring in such sports culture. Moreover, this study addresses the gap in scientific literature on career management in handball. Utilising autoethnography in the field of sports is somewhat unique, therefore this study can also pave the way for future research work in this domain. The following five pillars in career management were identified as a result of the research: Significant Others, Local Grassroots, Star Position, Roller Coaster and Rebirth. This study can be valuable for future researchers in the area of career management, and it can also provide practical information for athletes, sports federations and sports businesses. The second paper investigates what variables may influence long-term performance in the transitory phases of a team athlete's career according to the perceptions of the athletes themselves. Narrative research was conducted with sixteen world-class, retired women handball players and the qualitative analysis reveals those factors that influenced their performance in the transitory phases \"from development to mastery\" and \"from mastery to discontinuation\" on the individual, interpersonal, organisational, and sociocultural levels. The variables are organised into a systems map to provide a full overview as well as the perceived relationships between them. The practical implication of the paper is to draw the attention of those organisations that aim to improve long-term performance to the leverage points that athletes themselves find important. The main objective of the third study is to identify the \"key issues\" in the employment of athletes in the sport of handball. The methodological framework of the research is based on primary source and a qualitative approach, including thematic analysis. The findings from the five expert interviews allow us to get a comprehensive, realistic picture of the career - related processes in professional women's handball (i.e. selection) from the athlete's and from the sports company's side. Otherwise, they highlight why professional women's handball players can be considered as a special workforce. Among the results are grouped around four main themes: peculiarities of managing players; handball players; sports professional aspects; other influencing factors. In addition, the research defines the local milieu and the value typification model of the athlete types associated with each theme, which are compared with the roles that can be identified along the behavioural dimensions.",

      "title": "STUDY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF LEARNING STRESS IN STUDENTS",
      "abstract": "The degree of influence of stressors on our body can be different: from mild excitement in anticipation of, say, a trip on vacation, to a severe psychosomatic disorder of post-traumatic stress. In any case of manifestation of stress, it affects all components of our individuality (individuality itself), such as memory, thinking, language, emotional and volitional sphere. However, this does not mean that stress is only evil, trouble, it is also the most important tool for training and hardening a person, since stress helps to increase the resistance of the psyche and the body in general, training its adaptive mechanisms. Stress is our faithful ally in continuous adaptation to any changes in the environment. For some students, student life is associated with student societies, communication with interesting people, various activities and fun. For others, it is a serious test, a life change, a difficult life situation to which it is necessary to adapt. Students are young and face various problems, new learning conditions require more independence, responsibility, self-organization, and not all students are ready to solve numerous problems and tasks. Which gives life. In any case, studying at a higher educational institution is stressful for many students. The student needs to overcome difficulties, master new roles and modify old ones, adapt to new life conditions.&#x0D; There is a lot of evidence that chronic stress is a companion of student life. Researchers note that the causes of stress in students are related to problems of finances, housing, security, etc. The stress experienced by students can affect learning (acquiring, applying, and processing knowledge), which hinders academic performance. Problems with academic performance also create discomfort, as a result of which general stress increases.",

      "abstract": "I present an account of different types of rules in terms of form and function, their dimensions, and their correspondence to rule-following behavior. I identify five dimensions of rules (as verbal stimuli) and relate them the listener’s behavior (rule-following) and the listener’s history of contingencies. This classification is according to rule: (a) explicitness (or implicitness), (b) accuracy (congruence or correspondence), (c) complexity (first order, second order conditional discriminations), (d) source (given by others or self), and (e) time (immediate, delayed, or remote). The main premise is that the probability that the listener will behave according to the contingencies specified on a given rule would depend on these dimensions, the context in which the rule is provided, and the listener’s history with the rule or similar rules. Even though experimental manipulations of different types of rules (e.g., instructions) have been conducted in studies of stimulus equivalence, rule-following, say-do correspondence, relational frames, and derived stimulus relations, I emphasize here the need for updating the concept and for a systematic analysis of the differential effects of the dimensions of rules on rule following.",

      "abstract": "It is often the case that certain critical events can have enormous impacts on the dynamics of collective action. When such events appear to “trigger” or “spark” collective action by convincing potential participants that action is necessary or desirable, or mark a critical turning point in the dynamics of a particular pattern of mobilization, they may be thought of as precipitating events. These events will tend to fall along a varied range of characteristics. Some may be violent and traumatic, such as an assassination or an instance of police brutality, while others may be relatively civil or even celebratory, such as the election of a supported political candidate or the victory of a sports team. Some events may appear to be relatively isolated and singular, while others may occur in a cumulative pattern over time. An event might be planned and executed by movement participants, or be completely unexpected. One event might trigger explosive episodes such as riots, while others might lead to long‐term changes in a cycle of protest, such as shifts in a movement's strategy. Despite such variation, the defining feature of a precipitating event is that it serves as some form of social‐cognitive “trigger” that defines, in part, the forms of collective action that occurs in its wake.",

Praise can be used for prosocial behavior under two sets of conditions: when it is employed as reinforcement or reward for prosocial actions and when it is employed to scaffold learning about the importance of caring for others. Praise takes different forms which differ in their effectiveness. Thus, praising children for having a prosocial disposition is more effective than praising them for a particular prosocial action. In contrast to some forms of behavior such as achievement, praise for effort may not always be effective. Praise for prosocial behavior is infrequently used by parents, particularly as children grow older and engage in more prosocial action. Thus, its role in the development of prosocial behavior appears to be modest.",

      "title": "Why auditors are unable to see their own behavior as others do: Understanding a potential blind spot",
      "abstract": "Auditors are obligated to perform audits that are both effective and efficient. Audit firms train their auditors to avoid behaviors such as taking shortcuts (i.e., ignoring inconsistencies that they observe in the audit workpapers) when taking the shortcut could cause the firm to miss a material error and/or be viewed negatively by others. This study examines why auditors sometimes take shortcuts that put their firms at risk of issuing an incorrect audit opinion, despite their firm’s training and the threat of receiving a negative performance evaluation. Using an experiment, I examine (1) why auditors who face the dilemma of whether to take the shortcut (actors) are likely to view taking the shortcut more favorably than do other auditors and non-auditors who observe their dilemma (observers), (2) why auditors are likely to view a decision to take the shortcut less negatively than do non-auditors, and (3) whether auditors recognize that others are likely to perceive taking the shortcut as more unethical than do auditors. I find that being directly involved in the dilemma (being an actor versus an observer) causes auditors to perceive a lower likelihood that taking a shortcut could cause the audit firm to miss a material error. I also find that having an auditing background (being an auditor versus a non-auditor) causes auditors to perceive a lower likelihood that taking the shortcut will harm investors. These differences in perception cause auditor actors to perceive taking a shortcut as less unethical than do auditor observers, and auditor observers to view it as less unethical than do non-auditor observers. I demonstrate that understanding factors that cause individuals to view the ethicality of taking the shortcut differently is important because individuals’ ethicality judgments influence their intended behavior. Finally, my findings suggest that auditors fail to recognize that non-auditors perceive taking the shortcut more negatively than do auditors. I discuss implications of these findings for audit firm training and for auditors’ ability to objectively assess the costs and benefits of their behavior.",

However, across several studies involving karaoke singing, public speaking, and math performance, we demonstrate that reappraising anxiety as excitement is more effective. Compared to individuals who attempt to calm themselves down, individuals who reappraise their pre-performance anxiety as excitement increase their self- confidence, adopt an opportunity mindset (as opposed to a threat mindset), and improve their subsequent performance.",

      "title": "Guided Imagery as an Effective Therapeutic Technique: A Brief Review of Its History and Efficacy Research.",
      "abstract": "Guided imagery is a flexible intervention whose efficacy has been indicated through a large body of research over many decades in counseling and allied fields. It has earned the right to be considered a research-based approach to helping. This article provides a brief introduction to the history of guided imagery and examples of selected research indicating its efficacy. ********** Prepare to learn in an interesting way ... Some learning will be obvious and some may occur at a different level ... You are about to begin a journey back in time to meet researchers in the helping profession who will help you better understand the scientific validation for the use of guided imagery ... As you read this, you may or may not notice your rate of reading ... or rate of breathing ... As you continue feeling as relaxed and safe as you feel comfortable ... you might be curious about the topic, maybe excited, maybe you have healthy doubts too ... Whatever you are feeling about guided imagery is okay ... You are free at any time to pause to contemplate ... or move on to another article for any reason. Now better prepared, you can begin this brief primer on some history and selected research on therapeutic uses of guided imagery ... Guided imagery was defined by Bresler and Rossman, co-founders of the Academy for Guided Imagery, as a, range of from simple visualization and direct imagery-based suggestion through metaphor and storytelling (2003). It is not a new approach to helping but well established in Native American and other indigenous traditions; Hinduism, Judeo-Christian, and other religious traditions; and traditional Chinese medicine, to name a few historically-based uses. Though guided imagery is currently understood to be mainly an alternative or complementary therapeutic technique, it has been used in psychotherapy for over a century. So, though guided imagery has long been used in many religious and healing traditions, the focus of this review is limited to the past 100 years. When writing on the history of guided imagery, Schoettle (1980) described many early 20th century examples of its use, starting with therapeutically working with daydreams. For example, Schoettle pointed out that Freud's psychoanalysis is based on the, unraveling of the patient's fantasies, daydreams, and dreams and, continues to be a cornerstone in current analytical techniques (p. 220). In the 1920s, Kretschmer and Desoille began using the daydream in therapy. Kretschmer referred to these inner visions as bildstreifendenken, or thinking in the form of a movie. Desoille referred to his therapeutic technique as the guided daydream (Schoettle, 1980). Jacob Morena developed the therapeutic technique of psychodrama in the 1940s, in which trained participants, referred to as auxiliary egos, playing key individuals in a person's life, re-enacted the patient's personal problems on stage. This can be now understood as a way of guiding the externalization of the client's internal imagery. In 1954, Hans Carl Leuner developed a technique he called experimentelles katathymes bilderleben, or experimentally introduced cathathymic imagery, and further developed psychodrama, which he called Symboldrama psychotherapy or guided affective imagery. William Swartley introduced Leuner's technique in the United States in 1965 as a diagnostic tool, calling it initiated symbol projection (Schoettle, 1980). In the late 1960s, Joseph Wolpe introduced several imagery-related in behavior-modification therapy: systematic desensitization, aversive-imagery methods, symbolic-modeling and implosive therapy. Since that time there have been many advocates of guided imagery including the Simontons, Achterberg, Klapish, Lawlis, Oyle, Bresler, and Rossman (Schoettle, 1980). Efficacy Research. Not a lot is written on why guided imagery is often helpful. According to Nightningale (1998), guided imagery helps clients connect with their internal cognitive, affective, and somatic resources. …",

Some important cognitive processes are self-efficacy, values, interests, goals and evaluations of goal progress, and social comparisons with others. Emotions also enter in, both positive and negative. When motivated to pursue a goal people may feel anticipatory excitement or joy, and they may experience satisfaction when they attain a goal. Conversely, people may experience fear or boredom. But not all cognitions or emotions are motivational. To be motivational, cognitions and emotions must energize and direct actions. Thoughts and feelings of happiness that do not lead to actions would not be motivational.",

      "title": "Assessment Decisions",
      "abstract": "Assessment is a crucial element in the power relations between counsellor and client. Whether or not a counsellor makes a formal assessment, he or she makes an important decision — to proceed or not. If the decision is to proceed with counselling, an assessment has been made that the counsellor understands the client well enough to calculate the likelihood of therapeutic success. If not, the counsellor decides either that the client will not benefit from counselling or refers the client to another counsellor or agency — most usually for specialist help. Thus the counsellor controls who has access to counselling, who will undertake it, what form it will take, and how long it is likely to last. Clients have no power over these issues, other than the power to vote with their feet. There is considerable evidence that clients do vote with their feet: drop-out rates from counselling have been estimated at approximately one-third (McLeod, 1998).This gives the client some say over how long counselling will last, but it does not give the client any power over access. As we saw in Chapter 2, clients with longstanding, intractable problems and those with multiple socio-economic difficulties are the least likely to be accepted for counselling; it is therefore possible that assessment as unsuitable for counselling may further oppress the most needy clients.KeywordsEating DisorderChild ProtectionCase FileCase ConferenceTherapeutic EnvironmentThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

      "title": "Perspective neglect: Inadequate perspective taking limits coordination",
      "abstract": "Abstract People need to take others’ perspectives into account in order to successfully coordinate their actions and optimally allocate limited resources like time, attention, or space. And yet, people often face frequent, but avoidable, coordination failures in the form of wait times, crowding, and unavailability of desirable options. Such poor coordination suggests that the necessary perspective taking (i.e., considering the likely motivations and behavior of others) may be either inadequate or incorrect. The current research suggests that coordination in such situations is frequently unsuccessful, not because people try to take others’ perspectives and are mistaken, but because they neglect to consider those perspectives sufficiently in the first place. Six experiments across a range of limited-resource contexts (e.g., choosing when to visit a store, stream on a limited bandwidth service, go to a popular vacation location, etc.) find that encouraging decision makers to consider what others might do and why they might do it can ameliorate such coordination problems. We further demonstrate a boundary condition: in situations where people’s motivations are inherently obvious, decision makers are naturally able to coordinate without an explicit nudge to perspective take. This research sheds light on a unique class of coordination problems in which people must consider others’ motivations without directly communicating with them, and provides theoretical and practical contributions with the potential to ameliorate common coordination failures.",

      "abstract": "Homework refers to an assignment given by the therapist to the patient that is to be fulfilled between sessions. It is a typical intervention in cognitive‐ behavioral therapy, but less common in psychodynamic therapy. This article describes an assimilative, integrative model of psychodynamic therapy that incorporates homework and describes its use in a series of clinical cases. Although the indications for and impact of homework vary from case to case, conclusions are drawn as to the most effective approaches to incorporating homework in a psychodynamic model. “Homework is an intervention that seems to have had its origin in the cognitive– behavioral literature (e.g., Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979).” It can best be described as an assignment given by the therapist to the patient that is to be fulfilled between sessions. The patient then reports back to the therapist about the experience and the results of the assignment, including whether or not it was completed, and that information is used in the process of the therapeutic encounter. Typical assignments can include reading (bibliotherapy), writing (journals), trying out new behaviors, and monitoring thoughts and activities. The key to the rationale behind homework is that the activity within the session can be facilitated by the activity between sessions. The more the patient attempts to extend the insights of the session into the world outside",

At other times, especially in the lives of less thoughtful persons, such learnings may result from heedless trial and error overt responses or from uncritical acquiescence to suggestion which, like as not, is surcharged with emo tional appeal. Behavior patterns that are intelligent, wise, and in the long run most efficacious are those acquired by the reflective route. Intelligent, capable, self-directing persons are those who recognize the significant problems of action that confront them, who spare time when possible to study and reflect upon such lems, and who have become proficient in the techniques and mental processes involved in such study and reflection. To the degree, then, that intelligent, capable, self-directing persons are desired as products of education, guidance should be offered in the recognition and solution of significant types of practical or action problems. Obviously such guidance to be effective must provide the learners with adequate solving techniques. How ever, not a great deal has been done to per fect techniques for solving the action type of To overcome this handicap and to provide his education classes with a pro cedure for solving teaching the writer has developed the solving technique presented in this paper. For three years the assignments in all of his courses have been in the form of uproblacts,y> a term coined by contraction of the phrase problem of action. term problact is significant, for the recognition of the distinctive nature of the action is an important step in the development of a satisfactory solution tech nique. In a of this type a person is disturbed and hesitates to act overtly, be cause he is uncertain what action is best or most appropriate. Thus the problact belongs to that class of problems which require the use of evaluation for their solution, and which may be distinguished from problems of the fact or science type. Abelson1 and Monroe and Engelhart2 have recognized the need for making this distinction in the field of educa tional research. former refers to lems requiring a consideration of values as evaluative problems, the latter as prob lems of purposes. Dewey, too, has stressed such a distinction by devoting a chapter of Quest for Certainty to a discussion of The Construction of Good. chapter contains the following statement: The time will come when it will be found passing strange that we of this age should take such pains to control by every means at command the formation of ideas of physical things, even those most remote from human concern, and yet are content with haphazard beliefs about the qualities of objects that regulate our deepest interests; that we are scrupulous as to methods of forming ideas of natural objects, and either dogmatic or else driven by immediate conditions in fram ing those about values.3 Another distinguishing feature of the lact is its comprehensive nature, which serves to distinguish it from other kinds of evalua tive problems and from problems of the science type as well. Symonds4 has recog nized this in a classification of problems in which conduct problems are used to illustrate the complete problem.

It is the time when the brain develops most rapidly and a large number of children’s development take place and it is estimated that over 200 million children under 5 years of age are unable to attain their full developmental potential. Studies suggest that young children are quite limited in their knowledge about cognitive phenomena—or in their Meta cognition—and do relatively little monitoring of their own memory, comprehension, and other cognitive enterprises.

      "title": "Borderline Academic: Precarious Work, Life, and Self",
      "abstract": "Abstract Casual work is frequently the only option for early career researchers and aspiring academics, but it is steeped in precarity. Such uncertainty in one’s professional sphere inevitably affects stability in other areas, from financial planning to making social commitments, potentially rendering not just one’s career but one’s life precarious. The features of a precarious life are the same features that, when embodied, designate a person as mentally ill: unpredictability, instability, susceptibility to sudden change, existence in a liminal space. Those (professionally or otherwise) diagnosed with a mental illness find themselves perpetually on the border between ill and well, acceptable and unacceptable, subject to and excluded from institutional systems. Nowhere is this paradoxical dynamic more evident than in the nomenclature of the condition borderline personality disorder: the label evokes a state of flux (borderline) that is all-encompassing (affecting the whole personality) and which produces chaos (disorder). Drawing on my experience as both a casually employed academic and a person with borderline personality disorder, this article reflects on the imposition of precarity onto my professional (and, therefore, financial and social) existence. Without promoting the casualization of work, this think-piece also considers the creative possibilities inherent in uncertainty and the generative potential of being ‘on the border’.",

In addition, some would emphasize learning by inquiry while others are concerned that students learn to inquire. While very formidable task of bringing clarity out of this apparent or real confusion is not primary focus of this discussion, I must make a few comments in order to proceed to main matter of text materials for inquiry. If it isn't possible to define inquiry precisely without ignoring way many persons wish to use term, it may be possible to characterize, or at least caricature, it. Perhaps attitudes and dispositions of teacher and student are most fundamental. Knowledge, or the truth, must be construed as tentative, a very pragmatic tool to be used in interest of men and human society.

It is in three parts. The first is a discussion of ( a ) effective listening and rapport and ( b ) a calm‐alert state of consciousness and ways of developing or enhancing it. Second, a mental exercise is described. It has, in theory', several attractive quantities, e.g. speed, low cost, and effects which wear off gradually and without habituation. Third, a pilot experiment on the exercise is evaluated, emphasising the many methodological problems in this area, e.g. selection of subjects, setting of the experiment and expectancy effects.",

      "abstract": "Objective To explore the complex ways that early psychosis affects young people, and the things they do to look after themselves, enjoy life, and be productive, and the influence of the environmental factors. Methods An occupational life history approach, based on phenomenology, guided interviews with five participants. Results Data analysis identified eight common themes, that coalesced into the following: (1) There was no ‘life before psychosis’, (2) Life becomes increasingly narrow with the onset of symptoms after treatment, life expands again through an active learning process, which involves taking action with limited awareness about what one can actually do, (3) Maintaining productive roles limits the impact of psychosis however, few were enjoying life, had a boyfriend or girlfriend, or lived independently, (4) People with early psychosis maintain a feeling of competence, make their own decisions, and use meaningful occupations to rebuild their identities. Conclusions Qualitative research is useful in gaining an understanding into what young people with early psychosis experience in trying to recover in everyday life.",

      "abstract": "Conflict causes decided tension in the workplace and often produces poor professional outcomes. A manager dealing with conflict can experience a crisis of confidence and often ends up second-guessing himself or herself, regardless of how a situation has been handled. In some organizations, conflict is not viewed positively or as an opportunity for improvement. In these organizations, most individuals will see conflict as being unproductive, unpleasant, and a waste of time and energy. Yet, conflict provides employees with critical feedback on how things are going. When viewed in a positive context, even personality conflicts may provide information to the healthcare manager about what is not working in the organization. If conflict is not directed and controlled, it can have damaging effects in the workplace, stifling the growth of departments and deflating employee morale. Our job as healthcare managers is to deal with conflict so that it does not decrease productivity or detract from the provision of patient-centered care. There are 4 general sources for interpersonal conflict: personal differences, informational deficiency, role incompatibility, and environmental stress. There are 5 common responses used in dealing with conflict: forcing, accommodating, avoiding, compromising, and collaborating. Healthcare managers should become comfortable with using all of these approaches.",

      "title": "Attention! An affective approach to anticipated action: Cognitive, affective, and motivational processes underlying proactive behavior",
      "abstract": "Proactivity is popular: on vacancy websites, ‘proactive’ generates more hits than any other competency. Proactive individuals do not wait for instructions. They actively try to anticipate future problems and opportunities and initiate improvement in themselves and their environment. Despite proactivity’s popularity in organizations and science however, we know relatively little about what makes people proactive because experimental research is non-existent. In order to find out which psychological processes are involved in proactive behavior, I conducted a series of experiments. Three chapters each focus on one psychological process: 1) cognition – how much conscious attention do people need to be proactive? 2) affect – how do feelings influence proactivity? 3) motivation – what drives people to become proactive? My research shows that proactive behavior is caused by an interaction of personality and situational circumstances. First, individuals who are proactive by nature, require less conscious attention to execute high quality proactivity than individuals who are naturally less proactive. Second, passive-reactive individuals are more likely to show proactive behavior when they experience negative feelings, whereas people with a proactive personality do not need such affective activation. Third, for some individuals, a need to seek out new experiences intrinsically motivates proactivity, whereas for others, rewards such as status and money can motivate proactivity more extrinsically. These outcomes point out novel perspectives on proactivity’s antecedents as proactivity was previously assumed to require a lot of (as opposed to little) conscious attention, positive (as opposed to negative) affect, and intrinsic (as opposed to extrinsic) motivation.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper presents a fraliework for conceptualizing the different ways in which instructions in experimental tasks may be misunderstood. Five possible types of misunderstandings are identified and discussed: (1) misunderstanding of a particular term in the instructions; (2) misinterpretation of a task because the instructions are difficult to interpret within the context of the task; (3) misunderstanding due to instructions which exceed the child's verbal competence; (4) misunderstanding due to prohlems'with ecological validity of the task (iwe., a task unlike anything the child has experienced); and (5) misunderstanding which occurs when processes necessary to solve the problem are also required to decode the instructions. Methods of testing for each type of misunderstanding'are presented and discussed. Described is a series of experiments which tested these possible forms of misunderstanding in a task (Bruner and Kenney's fullness of a water jar problem) in which misunderstanding of the experimental instructions had been claimed to account for developmental differences in children's reasoning. Results showed little support for a misunderstanding of instructions hypothesis and instead suggested that the difficulty was in the children's inability to integrate component operations. (JMB)",

      "title": "Becoming Ethically Responsive (Again) – Leaving Depression’s Monologicality to Regain Attentiveness to Others",
      "abstract": "This paper seeks to address the changes that therapists aim to achieve in those with depression, in addition to those in physiological and cognitive functioning commonly cited in aetiologies of this affective disorder. This paper will explore how those with depression often lose attentiveness by withdrawing physically and emotionally from friends, family and work colleagues. This lack of attentiveness may be present before the manifestation of clinically evident symptoms, such as would qualify under the DSM IV taxonomy. For Bakhtin and Hicks attentiveness, or ethical responsivity, is centrally involved in dialogue, which Bakhtin terms the “once occurent Being-as-event…that presupposes my answerable participation”. This responsivity is lost in the monologising tendency of depression not to respond to, or answer meaningfully, the utterances of others. Responsivity to others requires an attentiveness to the illocutionary aspect of utterances, the intent lying behind utterances, which those with depression can misunderstand by defaulting to a monologised, or pre-existing, way of viewing the world based on past experiences. This paper will thus examine how therapists and others can be the means by which clients start constructing what Bakhtin called the “uninterrupted performing of acts” and so start to dialogue with others once again.",

      "title": "Moral Experience and Legal Education",
      "abstract": "This paper argues that the contemporary practice of moral philosophy (particularly in the examples it relies on) and the contemporary practice of legal education both tend to ignore, dismiss or exclude that which is here called 'moral experience.' Moral experience is here defined (non-exhaustively) to be: 1) that which helps us face up to, instead of hide away from, our mortality and fallibility; 2) that which helps us experience radical uncertainty about who we are, where we have been, and where we will be, and about what has happened, is happening and will happen; 3) that which helps us experience the insight that we are not in control of all that which influences us; 4) that which helps us experience the infinite (for us) complexity of others and the world; 5) that which helps us to notice hitherto-invisible (to us) forms of suffering and vulnerability; and 6) that which helps us to widen the scope of, or sometimes change, that which we find valuable and care about. Moral experience is not designed to replace traditions of moral inquiry (such as virtue ethics or utilitarianism), and it is not designed to help us meet the demands of moral life. Rather, it is designed to help us avoid underestimating the demands of moral life. Following a discussion of moral experience in the first part of the paper, the second part turns to offer some activities and resources thanks to which law schools can enable moral experience for both their students and their staff. In doing so, the second part of the paper draws on research undertaken as part of the AHRC Beyond Text in Legal Education project at the School of Law, University of Edinburgh. It also draws on the author's own research as part of a pedagogical project entitled Unnatural Exercises.",

Achievement-goal theory has identified two main types of goals: Learning goals and performance goals. Both performance-approach and performance-avoid goals are associated with a fear of failure. There are four key defensive strategies that the author explores in his work: procrastination; intentional withdrawal of effort and a rejection of academic work; avoiding the appearance of working and promoting the appearance of effortless achievement, and; disruptive behaviour. Intentional withdrawal of effort and rejection of academic work are inextricably linked as self-worth protection strategies. Students' personal goals are related to, and influenced by, the goals emphasized or encouraged by the learning context; the latter are referred to as 'goal structures'. A classroom climate is likely to convey a performance-goal structure and may prompt fears of failure and avoidance motives among many students.",

Interestingly, recent studies reported a smaller Stroop effect when standing than when sitting [2-3] or after stepping backward [4], evidencing that the body posture enhances selective attention and cognitive control. Hence a call for a new psychology of movement and, by extension, of exercise emerged [2], with consequences on how to address the role and the effects of movement and exercise on cognitive function.",

      "title": "Temperament and School Performance",
      "abstract": "The concept of temperament has been used to acknowledge a child’s contribution to his or her social environment and provides a foundation for later personality development. Experts have defined temperament as a child’s individual behavior style or the manner in which a child reacts to his or her environment. Temperament styles are believed to be partially genetic and may remain fairly consistent over time and across different situations. However, social experiences and interactions influence behavior and play a significant role in the nature and expression of temperament.Nine attributes of behavior are generally considered when determining a child’s temperament style: activity level, rhythmicity or regularity,distractibility, approach or withdrawal, adaptability, attention span and persistence, intensity of reaction, threshold of responsiveness, and quality of mood. Certain attributes tend to cluster to delineate the three most common temperament styles—easy, slow to warm, or difficult. Children who have “easy” temperaments tend to be cheerful, respond easily to the world around them, have regular eating and sleep patterns, and adapt easily to new situations. Children who have “slow to warm”temperaments have low activity levels and mild responses and tend to withdraw in new situations. Children described as having“difficult” temperaments have predominately negative moods and intense emotional reactions, adapt poorly to new situations, and are unpredictable. Approximately 40% of all children are described as“easy,” 15% as “slow to warm,” and 10%as “difficult.”The nature and expression of a child’s temperament is influenced strongly by the social environment. The term “goodness of fit” has been used to describe the relationship between a child’s temperament and the demands of the environment. A child’s ability to adjust to a situation depends on the degree of harmony that exists between the two. When environmental demands, particularly the expectations and reactions of adults,are incompatible with the temperamental characteristics of the child,behavioral problems are more likely to occur. Many experts believe that behavioral problems are more likely a result of poor interaction between the child and the environment rather than simply characteristics of the child.The concept of “goodness of fit” has important implications for the child’s adaptation to school. Children who are attentive and highly persistent have been shown to become more socially competent, adjust better,and perform better in school. They attend better to tasks and have higher frustration tolerances, making them more apt to learn. Conversely, children who are highly active and distractible and demonstrate low persistence have more difficulty orienting to and completing tasks. They display external behavioral problems in the classroom and have more difficulty achieving social and academic success, despite relatively similar intelligence levels. Children who are quiet, less intense, and less active are also at risk for difficulties in school adjustment and achievement. These children approach teachers and peers less and tend to be overly sensitive to feedback, making them at risk for developing internal psychosocial problems, such as poor self-esteem,withdrawal, or even depression. Behavioral and psychosocial problems may manifest differently, based on the child’s temperament style. Finally,when attempting to understand a child’s behavior in the classroom, it is important to consider the match between the student’s temperament and the demands of the environment, including the teacher’s personality style and attitudes.It is important for clinicians to understand different temperament styles so that they can counsel parents regarding the child’s adaptation to school. Discussions about a child’s temperament may increase awareness and understanding of individual differences, provide a more organized picture of the child’s behavior, and alleviate feelings of inadequacy or distorted perceptions. Once parents or teachers understand a child’s individual temperament, they can learn to anticipate responses to certain conditions and better adapt expectations and reactions to the needs of the child. They are also in a better position to help the child learn to adapt to real-world situations that may not contain the more ideal temperament/ environmental match. Conversations that focus on understanding a child’s temperament, establishing realistic expectations, and suggesting alternative behavioral strategies may influence the parent’s or teacher’s interactions with the child positively and affect the child’s behavior at home and at school.1Green M, ed. Bright Futures: Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents— A Landmark Consensus Statement, Not a Cookbook. Arlington, Va: National Center for Education in Maternal Child Health; 1994Bright Futures1emphasizes developmental surveillance and assessment of a child’s interaction with his or her environment (including parents and others) as important goals for child health supervision.

Arlington, Va: National Center for Education in Maternal Child Health; 1994Bright Futures1emphasizes developmental surveillance and assessment of a child’s interaction with his or her environment (including parents and others) as important goals for child health supervision. Understanding an individual child’s temperament and modifying expectations and approaches to a child in light of this knowledge are critical in enhancing his or her development.",

      "abstract": "What do people care about? Psychological work on well-being has long emphasized (1) happiness, sometimes described as “pleasure,” and (2) eudaimonia, sometimes described as “flourishing” and associated with a sense of purpose or meaning. More recent work has explored (3) “psychological richness,” understood to call for a diversity of experiences and perspectives, including experiences that challenge and alter one’s preferences and values. This work is directly relevant to certain admittedly rare decisions that might alter our “core” – our conception of our identity and what we care most about. As examples, consider a decision to become a monk, to change one’s nationality, to have a child, or to get divorced. “Opting” situations raise serious challenges for decision theory, because one’s preferences and values cannot be held constant. If people’s preferences would be different depending on whether they opt, which choice is best? The right choice, I suggest, requires a shift from preference satisfaction to welfare. To decide whether to opt, people must ask: What would make their lives better? That question immediately leads to another one: What is the right conception of welfare? That might be a hard question, but it is the correct one; pleasure, purpose, and psychological richness are relevant to the answer.",

      "abstract": "Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the leader’s emotional intelligence influences the leader’s preferences for different ways of combining leadership behaviors (i.e. combinative aspects of leadership style). Design/methodology/approach – The authors used a hybrid design to collect the data to avoid common-method biases. The authors described a high-stress workplace in a vignette and asked participants to rank four styles of combining a task-oriented leadership (i.e. Pressure) statement and a socio-emotional leadership (i.e. Support) statement. The authors then asked participants to complete a Likert-scale based questionnaire on emotional intelligence. Findings – The authors found that leaders who prefer to provide Support immediately before Pressure have higher levels of emotional intelligence than do leaders who prefer the three other combinative styles. Leaders who prefer to provide Pressure and Support separately (i.e. provide Pressure 30 minutes after Support) have the lowest levels of emotional intelligence. Research limitations/implications – A key implicit assumption in the work is that leaders do not want to evoke negative emotions in followers. The authors did not take into account factors that influence leadership style which participating managers would be likely to encounter on a daily basis such as the relationship with the follower, the follower’s level of performance and work experience, the gender of the leader and the gender of the follower, the hierarchical levels of the leader and follower, and the followers’ preferred combinative style. The nature of the sample and the use of a hypothetical scenario are other limitations of the study. Practical implications – Providing leadership behaviors that are regarded as effective is necessary but not enough because the emotional impact of leadership behaviors appears to also depend on how the behaviors are configured. Originality/value – This is the first study to show that the emotional intelligence of leaders is related to their preferences for the manner in which they combine task and social leadership statements. Furthermore, two-factor theories of leadership propose that the effects of task and social leadership are additive. However, the findings show that the effects are interactive.",

      "abstract": "On the whole, the existing body of literature regarding founders' experience is fragmented and inconclusive because there is often little conceptual basis for the way it is studied. The role and nature of experience is examined herein in detail, specifically recognizing that experience is the antecedent of present or future states. It is also argued that temporal considerations are necessary in studying the influence of experience. Two views of experience are considered: (1) stock of experience - viewed as a quality of an individual, team or firm at a particular point in time and (2) stream of experience - viewed as things that happen or events that occur during a specific time period which impact the venture. When stock experience is evaluated, it shown that since entrepreneurial activity requires innovation, creativity, or quick responses lengthy experience might be counterproductive - more experienced individuals sometimes need to unlearn old skills before they can learn new skills. Another important issue becomes the aging of the stock and how long it remains valuable. When stream experience is analyzed, it is shown that both higher and lower level organizational learning play important roles in firm performance. Higher level learning changes central assumptions, norms and priorities of the organization, while lower level learning increases firm efficiency of routine tasks. This model aids in identifying research issues and strategies. One issue with stream experience, e.g., is the level of detail and specificity with which experiences should be identified. (SFL)",

The articles reviewed were chosen as representative of those pertaining to achieving academic success and are organized into five major categories: contingency management, including contracting: reading: academic performance; treatment of anxiety, including desensitization: and 4.he use of behavioral procedures to predict success. Based on the literature review, the paper presents six conclusions: (1) learning is a contingent activity: (2) almost anyone can learn if'the task is broken down into small enough steps; (3) anxiety can be a debilitating state for an individual: (4),the control of the environment in the form of contingency management, particularly contracting, can be used to help an individual accomplish his or her learning goals; (5) genuine concern for the individual is necessary if treatment is to be successful: and (6) investigations into the improvement of var:.ous forms of learning should be limited, for the moment, to results rather than processes.

Different factors play a role in development at different time scales and even the same factor may play out differently at different time scales.

Such motivational drives interact, leading to a complex non-linear trajectory over time. There is hardly any research that looks at the same developmental process at different time scales and much of the research on second language development needs to be reconsidered on the basis of these insights.",

Instructions to use specific strategies (distancing, positive reappraisal, rumination, or no strategy) predicted changes in sadness and happiness but did not predict information processing or memory. Effective regulation of sadness (regardless of instructions) predicted better memory through the indirect effect of broadened information processing but only for older children.

      "title": "(How) are decisions made in child and family social work supervisions?",
      "abstract": "Supervision is widely recognised as a core activity for social work. In this paper, we explore the nature of decision-making in supervision, using a collection of twelve audio-recordings from one child protection team in England. We apply Conversation Analysis to see how potential actions are put ‘on the table’, by whom, and the interactional work that occurs before any final decision is made. Within these data we find that supervision may not be an especially key site for decision-making. When actions are proposed, we identify three primary patterns: unilateral decision making, bilateral decision making and polar questions which instigate decision making sequences. In each, it is almost always the supervisor who proposes a possible future action, and the social worker who responds. If the social worker is agreeable, there is often little further discussion. When the social worker resists the proposal or there is further talk around the future action, the subsequent conversation was likely to focus on how it reflects on the worker’s professional competence, rather than the merits of the action and implications for the family. These findings raise the question of how (and where) casework decisions are made in this social work team, if not in supervision. They also suggest we need to pay more attention to issues of professional standing and creating opportunities for shared decision making when thinking about supervision. Our analysis furthers current knowledge of what happens in social work supervision by demonstrating how epistemic and deontic domains, as well professional competency, are interactionally relevant forces shaping the decision-making process.",

En el estudio de naturaleza cualitativa, fueron entrevistados 23 profesores universitarios. Los resultados indican que las emociones asociadas a un IC, generan una situación de desequilibrio que puede obstaculizar la actividad cuando son de naturaleza negativa. Al mismo tiempo, en estas situaciones es posible la revisión y reconstrucción de la propia identidad docente. En cuanto a las estrategias empleadas por los docentes ante los IC, éstas fueron mayoritariamente inmediatas e incidieron en aspectos muy puntuales, lo que derivó en actuaciones reactivas y poco eficaces. Pese a ello, la mayoría de los profesores no modificaron sus posiciones iniciales y fueron excepcionales las situaciones en las que el despliegue de estrategias y la reflexión posterior a un determinado IC permitió cambios estructurales que impactaron en alguna dimensión de la identidad del profesor como sus emociones y prácticas.AbstractThis study identifies the strategies that teachers employ when faced with critical incidents (CI) in highly diverse sociocultural contexts, recognizing the weight of identity and emotions in decision-making and their effectiveness to promote changes in teaching practice. It is a qualitative study with 23 university teachers. The results indicate that the emotions produced by a CI, create a situation of imbalance, accompanied by negative emotions that hinder teachers' activity. The study states that there is a need to review the situation and to open the possibility of teachers' identity reconstruction. With respect to the strategies employed by teachers when faced with CI, these were mostly immediate and affected very specific aspects, resulting in reactive performance and a choice of ineffective strategies. Despite the poor effectiveness of their strategies, in most cases, teachers did not change their initial positions. IC deployment strategies and subsequent reflection that allow an opening to structural changes that impact on teacher identity (emotional and practical) are an exception.Palabras clave: Incidentes críticosidentidad docentecontextos socioculturaleseducación superioremociones en el docenteformación del profesoradoKeywords: Critical incidentsteacher identitysociocultural contexthigher educationteacher's emotionsteacher training",

The focus is on views and uses of “programming” as a means for 1) making things do things (instruct them to follow and execute orders); for 2) “animating” things (endow them with a mind of their own, teach them to “look out for themselves”); and for 3) “modulating” things (influence how things act or interact by tweaking some parameters in their environment). I present settings where youngsters are invited to give and execute orders, to take over or relinquish control, and to compose with things endowed with a “logic” or integrity of their own. I draw lessons for the design of programmable play kits for young makers and creators.",

      "title": "Theoretical Considerations on Job Motivation, Job Satisfaction and Work Performance",
      "abstract": "Job motivation is a very important aspect both for employees - as work represents the central area of human activity, since people spend most of their adult life in a state of employment - and for employers, due to the direct implications of motivation on performance. Viewed in the context of work, motivation can be defined as the degree of availability of the employees to become involved in their work and to make sustained effort in order to meet some professional objectives, which can be defined individually or organizationally. In this context, motivation can be considered a result of the interdependence between the individual and the organizational context where he/she works, rather than a result of the prevailing individual motivations. As concerns performance, it is obvious that there motivation and performance are mutually conditioned. It is believed that, when there is an overlap of individual expectations and organizational requirements, there is also a chance of obtaining professional performance; in the opposite case, performance is more difficult to obtain and/or maintain. It is certain that any manager looks for employees that are involved in their activity, but it is less obvious whether managers also look for properly motivated employees. Another major aspect is the fact that people are not always motivated in their work, although most people look for activities that will stimulate them from the point of view of professional fulfillment. Thus, there are also people who are motivated by many other activities, but not by the work they do as employees in a company. The place given to work may be a secondary one in the hierarchy of their individual motivations, even if work comes first in the order of material needs. This fact is rather generated by the attitude component of human behaviour, which is shaped through education and influenced by culture (the mentality towards work). This is one of the reasons for using some instruments for evaluating motivation in the professional context; these instruments can sense motivational dimensions located rather at the attitude pole of the personality, with a direct influence on individuals' performance. In a company's management, the true meaning of the employees' actions and behaviour can only be discovered based on the knowledge of the reasons and motives that have generated them. Knowing the reasons not only helps increase action efficiency and the possibility of explaining and predicting human behaviour, but it also helps to decode its moral value.",

      "title": "Coping and Coping Styles",
      "abstract": "Abstract Coping refers to cognitive and behavioral efforts to manage specific external and/or internal demands that are appraised as stressful. An individual determines whether the situation is controllable and assesses his or her abilities to make effective responses. In other words, coping is using effort to solve personal, situational, and interpersonal problems, and seeking to master, minimize, or change conflict or stress. Psychological coping mechanisms are commonly termed coping strategies or coping skills. The term coping also means that those strategies were able to reduce stress levels. Furthermore, coping generally refers to reactive coping – that is, the coping response follows the stressor. Coping strategies can be functional or dysfunctional. Functional coping strategies can effectively reduce stress levels, whereas maladaptive (dysfunctional) coping is not helpful to reduce the stress a person perceives. Coping strategies are partly controlled by personality (habitual traits), partly by culture, and partly by the social context – particularly the nature of the stressful environment.",

      "title": "Neuropsychological rehabilitation of higher cortical functions after brain damage",
      "abstract": "Neuropsychological interventions for impairments of higher cognitive functions can be divided into four different approaches: restoration of function, compensation, physiological stimulations, and metacognitive strategies. Training that aims to restore an impaired function or to increase processing speed or capacity is repetitive and often stereotyped. Such training may lead to task-specific learning with little generalization, as may be observed in particular in the domain of attention rehabilitation. However, it remains a matter of debate whether such practice effects really reflect the restoration of function or improved processing due to preserved procedural learning skills. For some cognitive domains (such as memory), restoration of function is mostly impossible; consequently, training mainly relies on compensatory strategies. For example, enhancement of learning may be achieved by improving memory encoding with mental imagery, while everyday memory is supported with systematic training of external aids, such as, memory notebooks. A third approach is applied in neglect rehabilitation and uses physiological stimulations to bias attention and sensory representations (e.g. optokinetic stimulation) or decrease interhemispheric inhibition (transcranial magnetic stimulation). Finally, the fourth approach is to structure behaviour and to enhance metacognitive abilities; this strategy is applied in the rehabilitation of complex problem-solving skills and impaired emotional regulation. Although it is difficult to control experimental biases in intervention studies targeting cognitive and behavioural disturbances, an increasing number of controlled clinical trials provide evidence for the efficacy of each of the four therapeutic approaches.",

      "abstract": "Communication is the process of delivering or receiving messages from one person to another, either directly or indirectly, in writing, verbally or in nonverbal language. Teachers' communication skills in learning activities include 4 main abilities, namely: First, the ability of teachers to develop positive attitudes in learning activities. This ability consists of: (1) Recognizing the strengths and weaknesses of students in learning activities. (2) Helping students to develop self-confidence in learning activities. (3) Help clarify thoughts and feelings so that others can understand and exchange ideas in learning activities. Learning motivation comes from the Latin word \"movere\" which means \"encouraging or moving\". \"Motivation is something that encourages individuals to behave which directly causes the emergence of behavior. A person will do an action no matter how hard it is if he has high motivation. Likewise, in learning motivation plays a large enough role in achieving results. Another opinion suggests that motivation is the basic drive that moves a person to behave. This drive resides in a person who moves him to do something according to his inner urge.",

      "abstract": "Circadian rhythms are powerful timekeepers that drive physiological and intellectual functioning throughout the day. These rhythms vary across individuals, with morning chronotypes rising and peaking early in the day and evening chronotypes showing a later rise in arousal, with peaks in the afternoon or evening. Chronotype also varies with age from childhood to adolescence to old age. As a result of these differences, the time of day at which people are best at attending, learning, solving analytical problems, making complex decisions, and even behaving ethically varies. Across studies of attention and memory and a range of allied areas, including academic achievement, judgment and decision-making, and neuropsychological assessment, optimal outcomes are found when performance times align with peaks in circadian arousal, a finding known as the synchrony effect. The benefits of performing in synchrony with one's chronotype (and the costs of not doing so) are most robust for individuals with strong morning or evening chronotypes and for tasks that require effortful, analytical processing or the suppression of distracting information. Failure to take the synchrony effect into consideration may be a factor in issues ranging from replication difficulties to school timing to assessing intellectual disabilities and apparent cognitive decline in aging.",

Concrete examples from everyday life show that such errors can mean incalculable damage to life and limb and must therefore be avoided. Mutual explanation and mutual understanding of facts, suggestions, ideas, concepts are error-relevant building blocks of knowledge work in teams. The better these special forms of teaching (explaining) and learning (understanding) succeed, the greater the chances of avoiding errors appear. Accordingly, it is suggested to view knowledge work from a learning and teaching perspective and to support it with instruments from didactics. This learning-teaching orientation and its contribution to error reduction are described, explained by one concrete example, and discussed in summary.",

Without adequate recovery, optimal performance is not attainable. It depends, however, on the individual what adequate recovery actually is. An extremely demanding event for someone may not be as demanding for someone else. Every individual perceives his or her environment differently and therefore has to choose his or her response or prevention strategy accordingly. Monitoring one’s recovery-stress states might be a promising starting point to establish individual baselines and further regulate training or work intensities. Relaxation in terms of implementing systematic relaxation techniques seems to be an adequate approach. These techniques can be divided into <italic>muscle-to-mind</italic> and <italic>mind-to-muscle techniques</italic> focusing either on the training of one’s sensitivity to muscle tension or on the cognitive processes involved in relaxation. Whether the recovery process is finally successful depends on if the chosen methods fit the purpose of recovery (i.e., response to cognitive or physical demands), the setting/circumstance (i.e., time and place), and how comfortable one feels with the specific recovery strategy.",

      "title": "Changing education, changing assessment, changing research?",
      "abstract": "In medical education, assessment of medical competence and performance, important changes have taken place in the last 5 decades. These changes have affected the basic concepts in all 3 domains.In education constructivism has provided a completely new view on how students learn best. In assessment the change from trait-orientated to competency- or role-orientated thinking has given rise to a whole range of new approaches. Certain methods of education, such as problem-based learning (PBL), and assessment, however, are often seen as almost synonymous with the underlying concepts, and one tends to forget that it is the concept that is important and that a particular method is but 1 way of using a concept. When doing this, one runs the risk of confusing means and ends, which may hamper or slow down new developments.A similar problem seems to occur often in research of medical education. Here too, methods--or, rather, methodologies--are confused with research questions. This may lead to an overemphasis on research that fits well known methodologies (e.g. the randomised controlled trial) and neglect of what are sometimes even more important research questions because they do not fit well known methodologies.In this paper we advocate a return to the underlying concepts and a careful reflection of their use in various situations.",

      "abstract": "Click to increase image sizeClick to decrease image size Résumé Une réaction anormale au succès et à l'insuccès semble caractéristique de plusieurs personnes qui cherchent des conseils ou du traitement à une clinique psychiatrique. Pour obtenir des données objectives et comparables sur ce trait de personnalité, on a inventé une expérience pour nous permettre de voir en action la dynamique du succès et celle de l'insuccès dans une forme aussi simple que possible. On a adopté le procédé suivant: on donne dix dards au sujet lesquels il jette à une cible; après cela on note les résultats et les écrit. Après quatre ou cinq fois le sujet sait assez bien le niveau approximé de son exécution. Puis on commence le vrai test: on demande au sujet de dire ce qu'il va accomplir. On arrange le système de sorte que le sujet désire prédire des résultats aussi élevés que possible sans s'exposer à trop de risques (de grandes peines s'il ne fait pas ce qu'il prédit). Il jette les dards encore une fois et on lui annonce les résultats—le succès ou l'insuccès. Sa réaction est montrée par sa prédiction suivante qui peut être ajustée ou non ajustée à la tendance selon les différences individuelles. On consacre le reste de l'article à une analyse de six personnes de traits différents. La Figure I montre une courbe qui montres des adjustements extrêmement instables et un manque de persévérance. En contraste avec ce malade-ci qui se décourage facilement et se laisse influencer par toutes sortes d'impulsions, la Figure 2 est le tableau du rendement d'une malade qui est très rigide et entêtée dans ses réactions. Cette rigidité expliquera un peu les tendances paranoïdes de cette malade. La Figure 3 est le rendement d'un individu aggressif dont les ambitions ne sont pas gouvernées par les capacités qui existent. Dans ce cas comme dans tous les autres il se trouve une corrélation très satisfaisante entre les résultats du test et le comportement dans la vie quotidienne. La Figure 4 est un bon exemple d'une personne qui est très sensible à des responsabilités qu'on lui donne; elle montre une \"sensibilité pour la charge,\" c'est-à-dire, un certain affaiblissement de son exécution quand elle est \"assez audacieuse\" pour prédire une meilleure exécution. La Figure 5 est l'exécution variable d'une manière surprenante d'une personne schizophrénique de bonne heure dont le comportement superficiel a été assez bon à l'époque du test. La Figure 6 représente enfin la persévérance moyenne et les ajustements sensés d'un adulte intelligent normal. Referat Eine abnorme Reaktion auf Erfolg und Miserfolg scheint für viele der in einer psychiatrischen Klinik Rat und Behandlung suchenden Personen karakteristisch zu sein. Um über diese Persönlichkeitseigenschaft objektive und vergleichbare Befunde zu erhalten, wurde eine Tätigkeit erfunden, die es uns ermöglichen sollte, in einer möglichst einfachen Form die Dynamik des Erfolgs und des Miserfolgs aktiv zu beobachten. Es wurde folgendes Verfahren verwendet. Es werden der Versuchsperson zehn Pfeile gegeben, die sie einer Zielscheibe entgegenschiesst. Danach wird die erzielte Zahl notiert und niedergeschrieben. Nach 4 oder 5 Versuchen kennt die Versuchsperson ziemlich genau das approximative Niveau ihrer Leistung. Danach fängt die eigentliche Prüfung an. Es wird der Vp. gesagt, dass sie auf ihre Zahl zu bieten [bid] hat. Das Bietungsystem ist so eingerichtet, dass es in der Interesse der Vp. liegt, so hoch zu bieten wie sie kann ohne übermässig viel zu riskieren. (Es gibt hohe Strafen bei Nichterfüllung des Kontraktes). Die Pfeile werden wieder geschossen und das Resultat (Erfolg oder Miserfolg) wird der Vp. gemeldet. Ihre Reaktion hierauf wird in der folgenden Bietung erwiesen, welche der Richtung der Leistung, den individuellen Unterschieden nach, vielleicht, oder vielleicht auch nicht, angepasst sein wird. Im Übrigen beschäftigt sich die Abhandlung mit einer Analyse sechs karakteristisch verschiedener Personen. In der Abbildung I wird eine Kurve gegeben, in der extrem labile Anpassungen und Mangel an Beharrlichkeit erwiesen werden. Ein starker Kontrast zu diesem Patient, der leicht entmutigt wird und von allerlei Antrieben gelengt wird, ist in der Abbildung 2 dargestellt, welche die Leistung einer Patientin schildert, die in ihren Reaktionen sehr steif und hartnäckig ist. Diese Hartnäckigkeit erklärt wahrscheinlich teilweise die paranoiden Neigungen dieser Patientin. Abbildung 3 zeigt die Leistung eines aggressiven Individuums, dessen Ehrgeiz von seinen eigentlichen Fähigkeiten nicht regiert wird. In diesem Fall wie in allen übrigen Fällen gab es eine sehr zufriedenstellende Korrelation zwischen der Testleistung und der alltäglichen Benehmensweise. Die Abbildung 4 zeigt uns ein klares Beispiel der Leistung einer weiblichen Person, die für die ihr aufgelegten Verpflichtungen sehr empfindlicht ist. Sie erweist \"Empfindlichkeit der Aufbürdung gegenüber\" [\"Sensitivity to load\"]; d.h., die Leistung nimmt an Tüchtigkeit ab, wenn sie \"dreist\" genug gewesen ist, die Bietung zu erhöhen. Abbildung 5 zeigt die erstaunend umherirrende Leistung eines anfangenden Schizophreniefalles, dessen oberflächliches Benehmen zur Zeit der Prüfung ziemlich gut war. Abbildung 6 stellt schliesslich die mittelmässige Beharrlichkeit und die verständigen Anpassungen eines intelligenten, normalen Erwachsenen dar.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Some stress is normal and even useful, it can be helpful if you need to work hard or react quickly as it can help you win a race or finish an important job on time but if stress happens too often or lasts too long, it can have bad effects. Excessive job stress can be damaging to your mental health and stress can also be a trigger for someone with depression or anxiety and may cause an existing condition to worsen. With all of this it’s not just your health that can suffer it can as well as affect your relationships and life outside work thus stress can increase your risk of injury, fatigue and be exhausted. It should also be noted that with busy schedules, it’s easy to become overwhelmed with work and not find time for anything else thus the trick is trying to achieve a balance that promotes your overall health and the success of your career or business and this more often recreational activities could just do the magic. Employers should therefore try to provide a stress-free work environment and they should also try to recognise where stress is becoming a problem for staff and therefore take action to reduce stress. ALCEF Riviera amusement park, a private initiative is an ideal location to shake off work stress and share priceless moments with loved ones and as a recreational park its programs provide organized, structured and enjoyable activities for all ages. Swimming at the ALCEF Riviera Amusement Park in a hot town like Limbe, has always been a corrective fun activity. Keywords: amusement park, stress, recreation.",

      "title": "Learning Altruistic Behaviours in Reinforcement Learning without External Rewards",
      "abstract": "Can artificial agents learn to assist others in achieving their goals without knowing what those goals are? Generic reinforcement learning agents could be trained to behave altruistically towards others by rewarding them for altruistic behaviour, i.e., rewarding them for benefiting other agents in a given situation. Such an approach assumes that other agents' goals are known so that the altruistic agent can cooperate in achieving those goals. However, explicit knowledge of other agents' goals is often difficult to acquire. In the case of human agents, their goals and preferences may be difficult to express fully; they might be ambiguous or even contradictory. Thus, it is beneficial to develop agents that do not depend on external supervision and learn altruistic behaviour in a task-agnostic manner. We propose to act altruistically towards other agents by giving them more choice and allowing them to achieve their goals better. Some concrete examples include opening a door for others or safeguarding them to pursue their objectives without interference. We formalize this concept and propose an altruistic agent that learns to increase the choices another agent has by preferring to maximize the number of states that the other agent can reach in its future. We evaluate our approach in three different multi-agent environments where another agent's success depends on altruistic behaviour. Finally, we show that our unsupervised agents can perform comparably to agents explicitly trained to work cooperatively, in some cases even outperforming them.",

      "abstract": "Het onderscheid tussen theoretische en praktische kennis, ook wel aangeduid als 'professionele kennis en kunde' of 'expertise' wordt door denkers en onderzoekers in uiteenlopende disciplines aan de orde gesteld. Algemeen wordt aanvaard dat experts niet geheel en al kunnen expliciteren hoe ze doen wat ze doen. Dit verschijnsel wordt 'tacit knowledge' of 'impliciete kennis' genoemd. Medische praktijkkennis is een verbijzondering van praktijkkennis in algemene zin en heeft eveneens 'tacit' componenten. Het bestaan hiervan noopt tot leren door observeren (met opleiders als voorbeeld) en tot regelmatig sturend commentaar op vorderingen in dialoogvorm (feedback). Een empirische verkenning onder aios heelkunde en kindergeneeskunde (aan de hand van semi-gestructureerde interviews) laat zien dat artsen in opleiding tot specialist (aios) hun opleiders voortdurend nauwlettend gadeslaan. Aios heelkunde geven aan vooral operatietechnische vaardigheden van hun opleiders te observeren en na te volgen, terwijl aios kindergeneeskunde speciaal letten op communicatieve vaardigheden. In de loop van de opleiding is een verschuiving waarneembaar: ongedifferentieerd 'afkijken' en 'afluisteren' maakt plaats voor het bewust en selectief kiezen voor bepaalde vaardigheden die aios zich nog eigen willen maken alvorens de opleiding te verlaten. Kijkend door de ogen van aios blijkt 'feedback' een schimmige term die verwijst naar drie commentaarvormen: commentaar op de werkvloer, commentaar in de voortgangsgesprekken en commentaar in de vorm van het regelmatig nabespreken van praktijkhandelingen en -activiteiten. Laatstgenoemde commentaarvorm wordt door de aios beschouwd als waardevolle feedback waaraan vooral in de vroege jaren van de opleiding behoefte bestaat en waarvoor opleiders doorgaans weinig tijd maken. De behoefte aan deze commentaarvorm ebt in de loop van de opleiding weg. (Stegeman JH. Gezel bij moderne meesters. Tijdschrift voor Medisch Onderwijs 2009;28(2):65–73)",

Most professionals gain their identity through prolonged study, examination of their competence, and practice. Once accredited (e.g. through GMC registration and licensing) the question is then how best to maintain, and ‘revalidate’ professional skills, so as to offer a proper quality service to those who benefit from professionals’ skills. Accreditation and revalidation relate to both technical competence and ethical practice, which are intertwined (persisting with poor technique cannot be ethically justifiable; and ethical decision-making is part of clinical practice, see p.III.233). Maintenance of professional identity is achieved by: ... Guidelines are authoritative statements by the bodies that issue them, and in this context cover both clinical and ethical matters. An unjustified failure to follow guidelines may contravene good ethical practice, and might also be relevant in any legal proceedings.",

      "title": "Restoring Responsibility: Promoting Justice, Therapy and Reform Through Direct Brain Interventions",
      "abstract": "Direct brain intervention based mental capacity restoration techniques—for instance, psycho-active drugs—are sometimes used in criminal cases to promote the aims of justice. For instance, they might be used to restore a person’s competence to stand trial in order to assess the degree of their responsibility for what they did, or to restore their competence for punishment so that we can hold them responsible for it. Some also suggest that such interventions might be used for therapy or reform in criminal legal contexts—i.e. to make non-responsible and irresponsible people more responsible. However, I argue that such interventions may at least sometimes fail to promote these responsibility-related legal aims. This is because responsibility hinges on other factors than just what mental capacities a person has—in particular, it also hinges on such things as authenticity, personal identity, and mental capacity ownership—and some ways of restoring mental capacity may adversely affect these other factors. Put one way, my claim is that what might suffice for the restoration of competence need not necessarily suffice for the restoration of responsibility, or, put another way, that although responsibility indeed tracks mental capacity it may not always track restored mental capacities.",

The objectives are as follows: To determine whether cognitive rehabilitation after stroke or other adult non‐progressive acquired brain damage improves executive function. Specific research questions In adults with stroke or other non‐progressive acquired brain damage with executive function problems: is cognitive rehabilitation more effective than no or placebo intervention at improving executive function? No intervention will include participant groups who did not receive any specific cognitive rehabilitation training or functional training. Placebo includes interventions which have been determined by the researchers to have no active impact on the aspect of cognition being studied, for example, a repetitive container filling task to work on problem solving skills; is cognitive rehabilitation more effective than standard care at improving executive function? Standard care will include stroke and brain injury sensorimotor rehabilitation programmes without specific cognitive rehabilitation components. Sensorimotor interventions are defined as those intended to improve physical function including movement, strength, balance, co‐ordination, dexterity sensation and endurance. As most therapeutic interventions contain aspects of cognition training in the form of increasing awareness, improving attention and problem solving, only those which explicitly state the intention of improving an aspect of cognition will be defined as cognitive rehabilitation; are some cognitive rehabilitation interventions more effective than other cognitive rehabilitation interventions at improving executive function? This could include comparisons of attention training with goal management training for self monitoring, or electronic memory devices versus mental imagery techniques for improving decision making.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The process of bringing about change is based on simple, common sense theory, but the implementation of that theory is complex and riddled with hazards. It involves a move from collecting, collating, and presenting data to an alteration of behaviour in the practice to improve the quality of care (Rogers 1971). In the introduction to Part II the characteristics of a healthy practice were outlined. Those characteristics allow a practice to perform effectively and the time and effort expended in attaining them are well rewarded. Often such ideal circumstances are unobtainable; for instance, due to a long history of resistance to change within the practice, or due to one powerful partner blocking all progress. If these or other similar circumstances apply to you, do not be put off introducing audit. Often the process of examining the quality of the care you provide, including team work, discussion, planning, and effective meetings can help to bring about the metamorphosis to a healthier practice. If you are the person trying to introduce change into your practice do not get too disheartened by initial resistance and failures, but use the ideas and principles in the following chapter to help ‘sell’ your ideas to the other members of your practice.",

      "title": "Relationships between Stages and Processes of Change for Effective Stress Management in Japanese College Students",
      "abstract": "With a primary prevention focus, it would be important to help populations engage in stress management. The Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change is one of potentially useful models to formulate interventions. The model describes behavior change as progression through five stages: precontemplation (not ready), contemplation (getting ready), preparation (ready), action, and maintenance. Processes of change (strategies and techniques to enhance the progression) facilitate stage transition. Their use is hypothesized to depend on stage of change. The processes tend to be used the least at the precontemplation stage. Use of experiential processes (affective and/or cognitive strategies such as seeking information) increase over time and tend to peak at the contemplation or preparation stage and then decease. In contrast, behavioral processes (behavioral strategies such as seeking social support) tend to be used most at the action and/or maintenance stage. This study examined relationships between stages and processes of change for effective stress management. Effective stress management is defined as any form of healthy activity such as exercising, meditating, relaxing, and seeking social support, which is practiced for at least 20 minutes. Four hundred and five Japanese college students participated in this study. A paper-pencil survey was conducted at colleges in Japan. The process use was least in precontemplation. Experiential processes peaked in preparation. Except for one experiential process, no significant difference was found between preparation and maintenance. Behavioral processes peaked in preparation, action, or maintenance. Most of these inter-stage differences of processes are in line with the prediction from the model. This study represented an initial but important test of validity of applying processes of change to stress management. The results partially supported its application.",

Psychological insights show that attention exhibits bottom-up and top-down components. Attention is attracted from the bottom-up towards unusual, exceptional, and unexpected sensory information. Top-down attention, on the other hand, filters information dependent on the current task-oriented expectations, which depend on the available generative models. This computational interpretation enables the explanation of conjunctive and disjunctive search. Different models of attention emphasize the importance of the unfolding interaction processes and a processing bottleneck can be detected. As a result, attention can be viewed as a dynamic control process that unfolds in redundant, neural fields, in which the selection of one interpretation and thus the processing bottleneck is strongest at the current focus of attention. The actual focus of attention itself is determined by the current behavioral and cognitive goals.",

The individual differences in the levels of these experiences and their change trends were associated with baseline differences in well-being, reflective processes, self-management, and self-control skills, as well as autonomous motivation to engage in the course.Individuals who are initially more autonomous and mindful find it easier to engage with online mindfulness interventions and draw more benefits from the process, whereas those with lower self-regulation skills or higher proneness to rumination are more likely to experience mindfulness as effortful and boring, and, eventually, to give it up.",

      "title": "Risk and Rationality in Adolescent Decision Making",
      "abstract": "Crime, smoking, drug use, alcoholism, reckless driving, and many other unhealthy patterns of behavior that play out over a lifetime often debut during adolescence. Avoiding risks or buying time can set a different lifetime pattern. Changing unhealthy behaviors in adolescence would have a broad impact on society, reducing the burdens of disease, injury, human suffering, and associated economic costs. Any program designed to prevent or change such risky behaviors should be founded on a clear idea of what is normative (what behaviors, ideally, should the program foster?), descriptive (how are adolescents making decisions in the absence of the program?), and prescriptive (which practices can realistically move adolescent decisions closer to the normative ideal?). Normatively, decision processes should be evaluated for coherence (is the thinking process nonsensical, illogical, or self-contradictory?) and correspondence (are the outcomes of the decisions positive?). Behaviors that promote positive physical and mental health outcomes in modern society can be at odds with those selected for by evolution (e.g., early procreation). Healthy behaviors may also conflict with a decision maker's goals. Adolescents' goals are more likely to maximize immediate pleasure, and strict decision analysis implies that many kinds of unhealthy behavior, such as drinking and drug use, could be deemed rational. However, based on data showing developmental changes in goals, it is important for policy to promote positive long-term outcomes rather than adolescents' short-term goals. Developmental data also suggest that greater risk aversion is generally adaptive, and that decision processes that support this aversion are more advanced than those that support risk taking. A key question is whether adolescents are developmentally competent to make decisions about risks. In principle, barring temptations with high rewards and individual differences that reduce self-control (i.e., under ideal conditions), adolescents are capable of rational decision making to achieve their goals. In practice, much depends on the particular situation in which a decision is made. In the heat of passion, in the presence of peers, on the spur of the moment, in unfamiliar situations, when trading off risks and benefits favors bad long-term outcomes, and when behavioral inhibition is required for good outcomes, adolescents are likely to reason more poorly than adults do. Brain maturation in adolescence is incomplete. Impulsivity, sensation seeking, thrill seeking, depression, and other individual differences also contribute to risk taking that resists standard risk-reduction interventions, although some conditions such as depression can be effectively treated with other approaches. Major explanatory models of risky decision making can be roughly divided into (a) those, including health-belief models and the theory of planned behavior, that adhere to a \"rational\" behavioral decision-making framework that stresses deliberate, quantitative trading off of risks and benefits; and (b) those that emphasize nondeliberative reaction to the perceived gists or prototypes in the immediate decision environment. (A gist is a fuzzy mental representation of the general meaning of information or experience; a prototype is a mental representation of a standard or typical example of a category.) Although perceived risks and especially benefits predict behavioral intentions and risk-taking behavior, behavioral willingness is an even better predictor of susceptibility to risk taking-and has unique explanatory power-because adolescents are willing to do riskier things than they either intend or expect to do. Dual-process models, such as the prototype/willingness model and fuzzy-trace theory, identify two divergent paths to risk taking: a reasoned and a reactive route. Such models explain apparent contradictions in the literature, including different causes of risk taking for different individuals. Interventions to reduce risk taking must take into account the different causes of such behavior if they are to be effective. Longitudinal and experimental research are needed to disentangle opposing causal processes-particularly, those that produce positive versus negative relations between risk perceptions and behaviors. Counterintuitive findings that must be accommodated by any adequate theory of risk taking include the following: (a) Despite conventional wisdom, adolescents do not perceive themselves to be invulnerable, and perceived vulnerability declines with increasing age; (b) although the object of many interventions is to enhance the accuracy of risk perceptions, adolescents typically overestimate important risks, such as HIV and lung cancer; (c) despite increasing competence in reasoning, some biases in judgment and decision making grow with age, producing more \"irrational\" violations of coherence among adults than among adolescents and younger children. The latter occurs because of a known developmental increase in gist processing with age. One implication of these findings is that traditional interventions stressing accurate risk perceptions are apt to be ineffective or backfire because young people already feel vulnerable and overestimate their risk. In addition, research shows that experience is not a good teacher for children and younger adolescents, because they tend to learn little from negative outcomes (favoring the use of effective deterrents, such as monitoring and supervision), although learning from experience improves considerably with age. Experience in the absence of negative consequences may increase feelings of invulnerability and thus explain the decrease in risk perceptions from early to late adolescence, as exploration increases. Finally, novel interventions that discourage deliberate weighing of risks and benefits by adolescents may ultimately prove more effective and enduring. Mature adults apparently resist taking risks not out of any conscious deliberation or choice, but because they intuitively grasp the gists of risky situations, retrieve appropriate risk-avoidant values, and never proceed down the slippery slope of actually contemplating tradeoffs between risks and benefits.",

Given the simplicity of the basic tenet of this approach, that behaviour is learned and unlearned, we have to grapple with words such as modelling, observation, learning, imitation, social learning and vicarious learning — all of which appear to mean the same thing! Educators such as Sheldon and Hudson, whose work is referred to here, have helped to make the concepts relevant and accessible to social work. Learning theory, on which behavioural principles are based, is a vast, well-researched field. Also, behaviourism has influenced social work practice in a number of ways. In working with people with learning difficulties the principles of ‘normalisation’ or age appropriate behaviour involve the basic principles of learning theory. Programmes working with offenders, especially those who are dependent upon substances such as drugs or alcohol, involve cognitive behaviour therapy, as do those working with people experiencing depression. In some ways, there are similarities between behavioural approaches and the task-centred practice, in that both focus on a particular problem, follow specific procedures and impose time limits. Finally, when we discuss groupwork, we will see that aspects of learning theory operate in group situations.",

      "abstract": "Activities in the learning require students to communicate, collaborate, create material, and review each other´s work in their group. Working in a group can be very challenging for some people because of dominant behavior disruption group dynamics. In this study, social dominance and particularly “the know-it-all” who acts knowledgeable and who dismisses the opinions, comments, or suggestions of others, is discussed and how resulting problems effects the group dynamic. A case study about a dominant “know-it-all” student in a laboratory practical class group work is described in the report. Different groups were compared and the general disruptive effects were indicated on know-it-all in group dynamics. Results show that dominant individuals consistently attained high levels of influence to other group members, and controlled the group with a low tolerance for correction and contradiction. The other group members’ work can be misinterpreted as free-riders if agreeing to everything with the know-it-all’s suggestions without proper discussion and participation. The achievement of the intended learning outcomes when the group dynamics are disrupted can be severely affected, diminishing the knowledge transfer between teacher-student. The cultural background, learning environment and first experiences in the career can have a huge impact on the way that that each individual deal with group dynamics. The report presents solutions from a teacher’s perspective to the two different categories of the know-it-all: The true know-it-all and the think-they-know-it-all. In the former example the teacher can talk individually with the person acknowledging the student´s deep knowledge but explaining how the other students are effected. In the latter example the teacher´s role is monitoring the students learning by asking questions and if students feels oppressed or personally offended by the know-it-all engage in a circular response discussion.",

      "abstract": "A wise person learns from others’ mistakes. Mistakes are common even though most are preventable! Serious mistakes occur in business, government, and even in personal lives. Frequently mistakes are caused by not recognizing the situation, environment or system (referred to as system hereafter). The tendency is to hide or dismiss mistakes. That in itself is a mistake! Many times, by examining system causalities, actions can be planned and taken to either prevent the mistake or to reduce its impact. Two types of common mistakes to thinking clearly (defined as recognizing the system causalities) are identified and studied: 1.the proposed action does not solve the system problem; 2. the proposed action solves the system problem but causes some unintended serious negative consequences. Eliyahu M. Goldratt developed the theory of constraints (TOC) thinking processes (TP) to apply the scientific method to solving business problems. Rather than select a personal or business problem, since science is based on causality within reality, three major scientific activities, inference (type 1 mistake), observation (type 2 mistake), and prediction (types 1 and 2 mistake prevention) are used to provide a tutorial on the TP and its use in addressing these types of mistakes.",

Häufige Konfliktquellen sind unerfüllte Erwartungen, Intimität, finanzielle Schwierigkeiten, häusliche und familiäre Verpflichtungen, Erziehungsverhalten, Eifersucht, schlechte Angewohnheiten und vieles mehr. Neuere Untersuchungen haben gezeigt, dass die Einnahme einer kontroversen Kommunikationsebene nützlich sein kann, wenn ernsthafte Probleme angegangen werden müssen – vorausgesetzt, die Partner sind in der Lage, sich zu ändern. Diese Kommunikation ist jedoch dann schädlich, wenn die Partner nicht selbstsicher genug sind, um damit umgehen zu können. Im Gegensatz dazu kann die kooperative Art der Kommunikation schädlich sein, wenn ernsthafte Probleme gelöst werden müssen. Sie kann jedoch auch nützlich sein, wenn die Probleme gering sind oder nicht geändert werden können oder die Partner mit einem Abwehrverhalten die Problemlösung einschränken. In dieser Studie wird auf bestehende Ergebnisse in der Kommunikationsforschung aufgebaut. Ziel ist, erfolgreiche Kommunikationswege zu finden, um Konflikte in der Partnerschaft zu bewältigen.",

      "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify and explain key training needs regarding redundancy handling which is increasingly affecting people, often for the first time Design/methodology approach The authors use their background in the employee relations area to identify and explain key skills that are involved in redundancy handling. While knowledge of relevant law is part of what is required, it is only one aspect. Managers can suddenly find that they are thrust into a complicated conflict situation, in a deteriorating workplace atmosphere when they may also be unsure about their own job security. Findings Staff surpluses do not automatically mean redundancy. Options can include re‐deployment, short‐time working, temporary lay‐offs and temporary closure and pay cuts. However, in these situations, as with redundancy, managers may find that the situation may be very stressful. This may be aggravated by a collapse in morale combined with a need to maintain a reduced level of production and/or services. Policies of multi‐skilling may both help avoid redundancy in the first place and failing that help with the re‐deployment of surplus staff. Training and development may also have a crucial role in helping an organisation adapt to the circumstances that caused a staff surplus. Adaptation is likely to need to include the positive management of redundancy survivors. Originality/value There are two main features of the paper – it explains the key issues in redundancy handling for people who may be unexpectedly involved in it – which is increasingly likely; it also focuses on the training issues – especially for those having to implement redundancy.",

The key component of these five areas on which this study focuses is self-control. Since the method of this research is a literature review, then the objectives of this paper are to define academic procrastination and self-control, describe the variables that affect students’ academic procrastination, list the aspects and kinds of self-control, and identify the impact of self-control on academic procrastination based on prior studies. The review of literature reveals that students’ academic procrastination is significantly influenced by self-control techniques. The majority of earlier studies determined that there is a negative association between academic procrastination and self-control which means a student's self-control will be poor if academic procrastination is high, and vice versa.",

The consultant may be held back by too much loyalty to the theories and methods of her firm, or the consultant notices indirect signs via psychosomatic symptoms that something is amiss. It is an important challenge in the work of the organizational consultant to plan consultation assignments in such a way that one has the necessary time and financial means for continually enhancing one's professional skills. In a systemic perspective, supervision works because a person step(s) into the picture, working from a different position in relation to the assignment than the consultant in charge. Supervision usually takes place as strictly planned activities within the same organization—a counselling centre, and a treatment institution. The supervisor should plan the situation with a view to promoting the learning processes of the person who is receiving supervision.",

      "title": "\"It's Not Brain Surgery\": Construction of Professional Identity Through Personal Narrative",
      "abstract": "This article addresses how the professional identity of a teacher is constructed through narrative with two intended goals: 1) to examine the ways in which theories of teacher education are embedded in professional identity, and 2) to suggest the inclusion of individual narrative analysis as a reflective tool in professional development and teacher education. A teacher’s spontaneous conversation about his or her work is analyzed in terms of personal and professional knowledge, collegiality and isolation, and teaching as a reflective practice versus technical activity. The complex, and sometimes contradictory, results support the obvious challenges and tensions facing teacher education; however, the use of conversation analysis as a tool for teachers to examine their own identity offers a new dimension to reflective inquiry, allowing teachers to make connections among public images, individual thoughts, and professional practice. Public images of teachers as ill-prepared, unskilled workers are often displayed in media and reflected in public conversations. Judgments such as those who can’t do, teach along with complaints that teachers do not work enough hours and have insufficient preparation are part of a public discourse in which teaching is reduced to a non-challenging career choice. Every so often someone stands up for the martyr teacher who is recognized for unfaltering dedication and personal sacrifice—this constitutes a good newspaper story or movie screenplay. These polarized images present public images of teachers as incompetent buffoons or social miracle workers. Professional educators, on the other hand, work in the area between these stereotypes and are aware of the complex nature of teaching, the intellectual involvement, and institutional constraints that define the profession. The gap between public and academic conceptualizations of teaching inspired me to ask the question of how teachers see themselves as professionals within this dichotomy. How do teachers portray their professional lives in casual conversation? First, the narrative analysis in this study is presented as part of a process of understanding how certain images of teaching are constructed through language and embedded in a teacher’s talk about his work. Second, the narrative is explored as a potential tool for professional development.",

De summatieve en formatieve aspecten van de PG beoordeling spreken elkaar niet tegen, maar kunnen prima in één beoordelingssysteem verenigd worden. Hoewel aan verdere ontwikkeling en uitvoering van de formatieve aspecten, het longitudinale karakter en aan het scholen van studenten en staf wordt gewerkt, blijven deze aspecten een uitdaging voor de toekomst. Momenteel krijgen meer mannen dan vrouwen een onvoldoende oordeel PG, maar slechts een zeer kleine minderheid van de studenten vertoont dusdanig onprofessioneel gedrag dat verdere begeleiding noodzakelijk is. De redenen voor de onvoldoende oordelen zijn met name terug te voeren op de binnen PG vallende categorieën ‘omgaan met werk’ en ‘omgaan met anderen’.",

      "title": "A Systems Model for Low Vision Rehabilitation. I. Basic Concepts",
      "abstract": "The basic concepts and structure of a hierarchical systems model for low vision rehabilitation is developed and presented. The model is built on the assumption that the patient has a desired life state, which is not realized because of the visual impairment. Life state is defined as a set of activities that the individual wants or needs to perform. The activities that constitute life state are represented hierarchically in a system called the activity breakdown structure (ABS). The highest level of the ABS represents the objectives served by the activities (e.g., daily living, vocational, recreational, social, and educational objectives). Under each objective is a set of goals that serve that objective. Any goal could serve multiple objectives. The requirements for successfully achieving a goal may vary with the objective that goal serves. The lowest level of the ABS consists of tasks that must be performed successfully to achieve particular goals. Any task could serve multiple goals. Each goal and each task has a value to the patient (i.e., level of importance) and also is associated with a level of difficulty. The need for rehabilitation, which is captured in the formal construct rehabilitative demand, for each goal and its subsidiary tasks, scales with the value of the goal or task and with the difficulty in achieving the goal and/or performing the task. Successful rehabilitation will reduce rehabilitative demand by reducing the level of difficulty associated with the goal or task and/or by reducing the value assigned by the patient to the goal or task (as a result of counseling or of learning alternative strategies).

      "abstract": "The article deals with the structure of professionalism of principals of general secondary education institutions, which contains the cognitive component of professionalism of management activity (system of knowledge about the essence, structure of management activity of the principal); motivational and value component (principal's motivation to professional activity, positive attitude and desire to develop their professionalism in management, high level of readiness for management, interest in it, professional values, vocation to management activity,); operational and technological component (a set of skills, abilities, methods of action, techniques, technologies to ensure the development of professionalism).The psychological factors of formation of professionalism of principals of general secondary education institutions are described.The dependence of the formation of professionalism of principals on their gender, age and work experience is revealed.Male principals pay more attention to non-standard ways of solving problems, are guided in decision-making by logic rather than feelings, prefer intrinsic motivation, acutely experience periods of meaningless existence.Women principals use their intuition more often than men, they are more communicative, have deeper emotional experiences, more often smooth out conflict situations, prefer external motivation.With aging, the importance of such values as the social authority and recognition, the possibility of self-development, selfimprovement, the creative nature of management increases.The instrumental value of executive discipline, responsibility, intransigence to one's own shortcomings and the shortcomings of subordinates also increases, the values of self-control and the availability of free time decrease.Principals with 11 to 15 years of experience have the greatest hope for success, and those with more than 21 years of experience have the least hope.Limitations of principals of different genders, ages and length of service in management positions, which hinder the development of their professionalism, are also described.",

The primary reasons individuals report for setting an eating goal are health, physical appearance, mood, athletic performance, and moral reasons. Health reasons for setting an eating goal can be prompted by any number of reactive health issues, such as having high cholesterol or blood sugar, but can also be motivated by a proactivedesire for increased energy or improved overall health.

      "title": "The Roots of Impasse in the Mind of the Mediator",
      "abstract": "Impasse in mediation can arise on a fundamental level from differences in the cognitive frameworks within which the participants – and the mediator – think and act. I argue that people involved in mediation tend to speak and act in accordance with one of four qualitatively distinct mental frameworks: 1.) distributive compromise; 2.) creating new value through attention to underlying interests; 3.) relationship; and 4.) mutual understanding. Each framework tends to operate to the exclusion of the others. Talk and action appropriate for one can be badly out of place in another. When the mediator and other participants inhabit different frameworks from each other, impasse can result. For the most part, these frameworks apply tacitly. They comprise four different heuristics with which to deal with the tasks of mediation. Moment by moment, and with little or no awareness or conscious control, each swiftly elicits framework-appropriate words and actions. But the frameworks also provide a way to deal with the very impasses to which they might contribute. Unlike the explicit “schools” of mediation thought, which they resemble, they do not necessarily persist throughout a mediation. Participants and mediators can flip from framework to framework in the course of a single mediation, and often do so. I argue that each framework is associated with one or more of seven different kinds of subject matters. Each of these subject matters – such as historical fact, law and legal rights, fairness and moral rights, what can happen in the future, feelings, and so on – is more characteristic of some frameworks than of others. Consequently, the degree to which a subject matter remains under discussion can show mediators which mental framework is most likely in play. Similarly, mediators can try to shift everyone’s thinking from one framework to another by steering the conversation to a different subject matter.",

      "title": "89 Mindfulness at GOSH",
      "abstract": "<h3></h3> Mindfulness is a form of awareness training that helps people relate more effectively to their experiences. It involves paying attention to thoughts, feelings and body sensations in a way that increases awareness, acceptance and self-compassion to help manage difficult experiences, and create space to make wise choices. <i>'Mindfulness is the awareness that emerges through paying attention on purpose in the present moment and non-judgmentally to things as they are'</i> (Kabat-Zinn, 1994.p4). Some families demonstrate resilience in the face of their child having a condition that is treated at GOSH. But others experience the demanding treatment regimes, the shift in roles, and responsibilities as stressful. Studies have found associations between <b>parenting</b> stress and adverse caregiver &amp; child psychological sequelae (e.g., Mullins et al. 2004). Parenting stress may also affect child health-related outcomes as it can interfere with the management of a child's chronic condition (e.g., Barakat et al. 2007a). Mindfulness is associated with self-reported positive affect (Brown and Ryan 2003), less anxiety and depression (Brown and Ryan 2003), greater relationship satisfaction and less relationship stress (Barnes et al. 2007). Mindfulness develops and enhances skills such as emotional intelligence, decision-making, communication, collaboration and teamwork, which are all skills important for the <b>workplace</b>. According to the Health and Safety Executive, UK businesses lose approximately £530 million a year due to stress-related illnesses. Given the elevated risks of burnout when working in healthcare, it would seem logical to bring mindfulness to the healthcare workplace. I have been running groups for a) GOSH staff and b) parents of GOSH children for five years. Self-reported measures indicated improvements in mood, anxiety and stress in all participants. These were statistically significant for mood in staff and for stress in parents. Groups moved online during the pandemic with similarly positive qualitative feedback as the face-to-face groups received.",

      "title": "From field of view to field of reach - could pointing emerge from the development of grasping?",
      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event From field of view to field of reach - could pointing emerge from the development of grasping? Verena V. Hafner1* and Guido Schillaci1 1 Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Institut für Informatik, Germany I. INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION Pointing behaviour is an important skill that develops during early infancy. It starts with imperative pointing around the age of 9 months [1]. This form of pointing is exhibited by the child regardless of whether an adult is present in the room or is actually looking at the child. This form of pointing turns into declarative pointing around the age of 12 months. It is used to draw somebody else’s attention towards an object of interest. Pointing behaviour and pointing recognition is one of the main ways of attention detection and manipulation in humans, and an important prerequisite for joint attention. Other prerequisites for joint attention are social interaction and intentional understanding ([2], [3]). Since imperative pointing is not directly used to draw attention, it is possible that it arose from grasping objects within the reach of the child and turned into pointing for objects that were outside the field of grasp. It is interesting to note that a pointing gesture by someone else is not understood by the child until about the age of 18 months [4]. Some studies showed that there is no relation between producing pointing gestures and understanding them [5]. This hints to the conclusion that the two skills develop independently from each other and strengthens the hypothesis that pointing may arise from grasping and is not learned by imitation. In order to test this hypothesis, we set up a robotic experiment where a humanoid robot learns to reach objects by building a body map during random body babbling [6]. Body babbling observed in infants has been classified by Meltzoff and Moore [7] as a mechanism that provides experience for mapping movements to the resulting body configurations. In [6], we implemented learning through self-exploration on a humanoid platform whose dimensions resemble those of a child, actually simulating the real visual input perceived by a young human subject. We used such a technique for learning the mapping between different sensory modalities and for equipping the robot with predicting abilities of sensory consequences (the position of the hand of the robot) from control commands applied to its neck and its arm [8]. In a second phase, we equipped the robot with prediction abilities of arm movement commands that allowed for and resulted in pointing towards an object presented outside the reach of the robot. II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP The reaching experiment described above is implemented on the humanoid robot Nao from Aldebaran. We use 4 DOF in the arm, 2 DOF in the neck, together with the camera input. The object is tagged with AR markers for simplicity. During the learning phase, the marker is attached to the hand of the robot and a mapping between the point in joint space and the marker position in the image (2D case) or in the world (3D, egocentric) is performed. The robot performs random arm movements and tries to estimate the position of its end-effector (the hand), analysing the frames grabbed from its head camera. We equipped the robot with an elementary attentive system for perceiving parts of its own body and for moving its head to focus on them. During babbling, each time a marker has been detected, we stored the vector containing the marker position together with the neck’s and the arm’s joint configuration into a knowledge base. The knowledge base can be used for inferring data. In [8], a mapping between the proprioceptive data, represented by the 6D vector [neckJoints; armJoints], and the external data, represented by the (x; y) image coordinates of the marker placed on the hand of the robot, has been used to perform forward predictions: given a configuration of the neck and arm joints, infer where the position of the hand will be (here: the coordinates of the marker, if detected, in the image). Given a query (neck and arm joints), we used a k-Nearest Neighbours algorithm to find the k closest vectors in the knowledge base. For each vector, the elements related to the marker position were extracted; the prediction of the outcome is computed as the mean of these values and a control command is then applied to each joint both of the neck and of the arm, as the mean of the respective elements of the k vectors. During early exploration behaviour, babies bring objects close to the face and use different sensory modalities for discovering the novelty of the object (like touching, biting, looking at it). Proprioception seems to play a bigger role in hand-eye coordination for infants than for adults [9]. In such a developmental phase, it seems that distance is irrelevant as infant vision first needs to develop. We tried to reproduce this inability in our first experiment, where the robot learned the mapping using only the image position of the marker. In this phase, the robot is not able to generate any pointing gestures: an infinite number of arm and neck configurations could result in the same perceived marker position in the image (see Fig. 1). Depth perception seems to start around the age of 5 months in human infants. We simulated this new ability by the robot learning to use the estimated 3D marker positions with respect to the torso coordinate frame. We used the Random Walk babbling strategy [8] for learning and, as in the previous experiment, the prediction was based on the k-NN algorithm with k=5. We performed learning both on the real robot and in simulation (using Webots, wherein the robot was equipped with a marker, as in the real experiment). In simulation, having the robot learn for 30 minutes resulted in 14068 collected points. Using the real robot, 20 minutes of learning resulted in 7531 points. Both knowledge bases have been used for generating pointing gestures using the algorithm described in the next section. III. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS In the second phase, objects tagged with AR markers were presented outside the reach of the robot but within its field of view in a distance of up to 1 meter from the robot’s head. The experiment consisted of predicting and generating the joint configuration of the arm which corresponds to the shortest distance between the hand and the detected marker. No markers were placed on the hand of the robot. The configuration of the arm was generated taking from the knowledge base (collected during the previous learning phase) the 5 nearest neighbours to the estimated object position. In the case of the object being outside of reach, the hand position should be on the hull of a sphere representing the robot’s field of reach (Fig. 2). As expected in this case, the forward model tends to place the hand as close as possible to the object, resulting in fact in a pointing gesture (see Fig. 3). “How can pointing emerge from grasping behavior (T2.3)?” has been one of the open issues in developmental psychology and developmental robotics identified by Kaplan and Hafner [3]. We presented here one robotics approach to identify the necessary sensory and informational prerequisites for realising this effect using body babbling together with a simple prediction model. In the experiments, the robot’s behaviour that was based on learning to reach for an object automatically resulted in pointing behaviour when the object was outside the reach of the robot. Figure captions: 1) Different configurations can result in the same perceived marker position. 2) An illustration on how pointing gestures are generated. k-NNs are expected to be on the hull of the field of reach (here represented as an ellipsoid). 3) A sequence of pointing gestures. An AR marker is placed on the non-visible surface of the object held by the user. An interesting side effect of the body babbling is that the robot automatically follows with its gaze when trying to reach an object.

      "title": "How to be flexible (or not): Modulation of the Flexibility-Stability-Balance",
      "abstract": "Goal-directed behavior in a constantly changing environment requires a dynamic balance between two antagonistic modes of control: On the one hand, goals need to be maintained and shielded from distraction (stability), and on the other hand, goals need to be relaxed and flexibly updated whenever significant changes occur (flexibility). A dysregulation of this stability-flexibility balance can result in overly rigid or overly distractible behavior, and it is therefore important to understand how this balance is regulated in a context-sensitive, adaptive manner. In the present article, we review recent evidence on how positive affect, reward prospect, and task context modulate the stability-flexibility balance. Two distinct underlying cognitive mechanisms will be discussed: Flexibility may result either from lowering the updating threshold in working memory or from keeping multiple tasks active in working memory. Critically, these two mechanisms allow different (testable) predictions: Whereas lowering the updating threshold should ease the access of new information in working memory and thereby increase flexibility in general, concurrent task activation should only increase flexibility between the respective tasks.",

      "title": "Performance and human factors: considerations about cognition and attention for self-paced and externally-paced events",
      "abstract": "Abstract The cognitive psychology school of thought has spawned models of sequential stages or phases of information processing associated with various tasks. It has encouraged the study of cognitions and attention as related to learning, performance and high levels of achievement in goal-directed complex activities in which movement is the medium of expression. Although more recently proposed dynamical systems models challenge the simplicity of this approach, there is little doubt that the ability to learn as well as to excel in performing movement skills depends to a great degree on the effective self-regulation of cognitive processes in a variety of situations. What to think about (or not think about) prior to, during and even after an event can have great consequences on present and subsequent performance. Relevant externally-provided and selfgenerated strategies should enable these processes to function at an optimal level, and are the subject of an increasing amount of research. For such purposes, it is convenient to categorize events as self-paced (closed) and externally-paced (open). Examples of both types of events exist in sport as well as in various occupations and recreational activities, with different information processing demands associated with each one. Any breakdown in a particular stage of processing will potentially lead to poorer performance. Special training techniques and strategies are evolving from the cognitive and psychophysiological research literature that might improve the level of functioning at each stage for either self-paced or externally-paced skills.

      "abstract": "Problem statement: Learning is a complex phenomenon which involves all the psychic functions and processes, in different moments in time their involvement varying according to age and psycho social environment. Research questions: The work discusses the level of instruction of the educators, parents, mentors, the dynamic of the formal and informal affiliation groups as variables of the learning effectiveness. Purpose of the study: The mnezico-prosexic functions are studied in direct report to practical exercises, highlighting the voluntary / involuntary ratio, the progressive memorization techniques, the attention as a factor of the motivational process and factor of scholastic success. Research methods: The measuring of the development index could be done in various ways: 1. The psycho-motor determination. 2. The social clinical determination, by delimiting the development structure: stages of intellectual development (Piaget); psycho-motor development (Gesell); affective development (Freud); moral development (Colbert). 3. The formative determination, which captures the learning capacity, without expecting that a certain manifestation to take place, but trying to capture and evaluate the individual potentiality (the proximal development area). Findings: The development factors are: genetic (phenotypic maturation), stimuli adequacy, on time apparition, the filtering function in sensitive people, the elasticity of the personality system. The influence of the environment is a condition for forming and learning. Starting from the procedure of acquiring information, we can make an analytical description of the construction of intellect sides - the capacities to: dissociate, abstract, generalize, understand, transfer, argument, classify. Conclusions: The traits described before match a certain dimension of the personality which is intelligence.",

Consciously or unconsciously, habits determine the behaviours of individuals in their personal and working lives. When the personal and work habits affect positively the manner of making decisions, the completion of particular tasks, the achievement of goals, etc., this can result in either an effective or ineffective management process. The combination of positive and negative habits places individuals in different situations at their work place, which in turn requires from managers to interfere adequately. They should look for opportunities for managing both their and their subordinates’ habits. This demands from them to be able to use their leadership skills as well as to have thorough knowledge of the habit formation process.",

Using content and factor analysis, we identify three key categories of factors that hinder anger expression at work, most to least frequent, respectively: professional courtesy, fear of repercussions, and organizational norms. We argue that rather than self-focused concerns of retaliation or sanctioning, most people fail to speak up when angry because of perceptions that “professionals” do not express anger, or the concern that anger expression shows a lack of respect for fellow organizational members. Although this is admirable in its other-oriented (versus self-centered) focus, there is a false assumption that keeping one’s anger and concerns hidden about a problematic workplace situation is helpful for the organization.

In their descriptions of not-knowing, however, many youth workers mention acute discomfort at the feeling of control having been stripped away from them rather than willingly surrendered or shared. This chapter describes the second of five themes associated with youth workers' experiences of not knowing what to do: the loss of control and features of despair. In addition to presenting the dominant theme of helplessness and loss of control, this chapter discusses the three variations on the theme, as described by youth worker participants: (a) There was nothing there to protect me, (b) Something else just took control of everything, and (c) What does he have to do, kill someone?!",

In fact, based on our experience, we’d have to say that their missing your point is likely to be more the norm than the exception. Very often the reason they miss your point is because you are sending feedback at one level and they are receiving it at another. For example, perhaps you are talking specifics to a new employee who mistakenly thinks that you are making a generalizable point and is looking to come up with a formula for success. Or perhaps you’re talking to someone whose behavior you’ve observed for some time, trying to address the thinking behind an entire class of misdirected behavior, illustrating with a specific, and that person thinks it’s the specific that’s important and, in the process, misses the bigger point. Understanding that there are different levels of advice and feedback, recognizing mismatches between the levels at which influence is being given and sought, and learning how and when you can bridge levels are the subjects of this and the next two chapters.",

      "title": "Interpreting behavior",
      "abstract": "How we interpret behaviors determines the ways we respond to them. For the benefit of ourselves, our students, and our co- workers, it can be helpful to rethink the ways we see common behaviors. A three- phase process can structure our interpretations. 1. Observe. Pause to broaden your view. Is the student inten­tionally breaking the rules, misbehaving, harming? Or is the student oblivious, distracted? What do you see? 2. Interpret. Ask, “What else could it be?” Pause to consider innocent motives. The shift from home to school behaviors can be drastic and difficult for some. What do you think? 3. Respond. Feel inner calm as you firmly address the student and the behavior. Response can be a simply stated command without criticism, judgment, or punishment. Escalating conse­quences occur as necessary. How do you act? Sometimes, especially in tough situations, we can become pouncers who “run a tight ship” and pride ourselves on how fast we exert control. So what differences might behavior reinterpretation make? Loud talking may be forgetting to speak quietly. Bumping into another may be the usual way friends play. Profanity or lewd gestures may be normal behaviors at home. Outbursts of shov­ing, laughing, joking, and insulting may reflect how students live during the many hours they are not in school. Neutral directives, with varying degrees of firmness, can deliver the desired expectation without accusation or excessive scolding. • “The noise level is way too high right now. Fix it.” • “Toby, you are interrupting Jamey. Listen.” • “If your voice is too loud, I’m going to assume you are not listening.” • “Physical roughness doesn’t belong in this school.” • “Language like that is not acceptable here.” When we momentarily reserve judgment about students’ behav­iors, we may be more likely to acknowledge that, outside our classrooms and schools, the behaviors we find offensive may be acceptable and preferable. Once we interpret the possible motives of students’ behaviors, we are direct about what needs to change without demeaning the student or the behavior.",

      "title": "Existential Poverty: Welfare Dependency, Learned Helplessness and Psychological Capital",
      "abstract": "Abstract Being in existential poverty means living in a state of, or near, persistent material poverty while also being socially excluded, marginalized, or disadvantaged. It is a life‐disempowering experience, one that privileges both immediacy over the future, and welfare over work. This results in learned helplessness, manifesting as a lack of will to take control of life. The existentialist explanation is that those in this mental state do not have an authentic way of life. Positive Psychology, and its offshoot, Positive Organizational Behavior, provide the cognitive change strategies that focus on building in people their sense of self‐efficacy, optimism, hope, resilience, and subjective well‐being, as well as their emotional intelligence, all of which are mental attributes that have demonstrable positive impacts on human performance. This can enable people to pursue gainful, meaningful, and sustained self‐actualizing vocation, so lifting them out of persistent material poverty. The public policy challenges are (1) to determine whether it is in the public interest to redress the negative agental consequences of welfare dependency; (2) to redesign the features of social assistance programs that exacerbate learned helplessness amongst beneficiaries; and (3) to determine how best to reduce the psychologically incapacitating effects of welfare dependency.",

Stress has a negative impact on one’s mental and physical wellbeing. Throughout a lifetime, one may experience thousands of different episodes of stress. It means that stress may be a normal, adaptive reaction to threat. Its role is to signal and prepare individuals to take defensive action. Take for instance, fear of things that present realistic threats motivates individuals to deal with them or avoid them. . College and Post Graduation students experience stress connected to changes in lifestyle, increased workload, new tasks, interpersonal relationships and a lot of other things.

      "title": "The impact of emotion, life stress and mental health issues on driving performance and safety",
      "abstract": "Driver distraction is a significant road safety problem, worldwide. While observable distractions have been studied extensively (e.g. visual distraction due to interactions with a mobile phone), less obvious sources of distraction, such as that derived from being emotionally aroused, have not been so frequently examined. As such, the overarching purpose of this article is to review relevant literature and present an analysis of how emotions may impact on driving performance and safety. Three potential impacts can be discerned from the literature: (a) elicited emotions, both positive and negative, may impact on driving performance; (b) the experience of stressful life events (e.g. financial issues) may 'spill over' into other areas of ones' life, and impact driving safety; and (c) mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, may impair driving performance and safety. The implications of these findings are discussed and some potentially fruitful avenues for future research are suggested.",

      "abstract": "Serial action involves planning, and planning can be controlled or monitored. For instance, when we reach for a cup, we can adapt the trajectory of our reaching movement in case there is an obstacle, like a milk bottle. Similarly, speakers can monitor their own speech. Speech monitoring is usually viewed as intimately related to ongoing speech planning: Speakers monitor what they will say and what they have just said. Moreover, in order to hold a conversation, tell a story, or give a talk, speakers must keep records of their utterances over seconds or minutes. This suggests cross talk between the production and the comprehension system. In this chapter, I focus on one of the levels of representation that is involved in this cross talk.",

      "title": "Privacy and behavioral research: Preliminary summary of the report of the Panel on Privacy and Behavioral Research.",
      "abstract": "From our examination of the relation of behavioral science research to the right to privacy, we have been led to the following conclusions. 1) While most current practices in the field pose no significant threat to the privacy of research subjects, a sufficient number of exceptions have been noted to warrant a sharp increase in attention to procedures that will assure protection of this right. The increasing scale of behavioral research is itself an additional reason for focusing attention in this area. 2) Participation by subjects must be voluntary and based on informed consent to the extent that this is consistent with the objectives of the research. It is fully consistent with the protection of privacy that, in the absence of full information, consent be based on trust in the qualified investigator and the integrity of his institution. 3) The scientist has an obligation to insure that no permanent physical or psychological harm will ensue from the research procedures, and that temporary discomfort or loss of privacy will be remedied in an appropriate way during the course of the research or at its completion. To merit trust, the scientist must design his research with a view to protecting, to the fullest extent possible, the privacy of the subjects. If intrusion on privacy proves essential to the research, he should not proceed with his proposed experiment until he and his colleagues have considered all of the relevant facts and he has determined, with support from them, that the benefits outweigh the costs. 4) The scientist has the same responsibility to protect the privacy of the individual in published reports and in research records that he has in the conduct of the research itself. 5) The primary responsibility for the use of ethical procedures must rest with the individual investigator, but government agencies that support behavioral research should satisfy themselves that the institution which employs the investigator has effectively accepted its responsibility to require that he meet proper ethical standards. 6) Legislation to assure appropriate recognition of the rights of human subjects is neither necessary nor desirable if the scientists and sponsoring institutions fully discharge their responsibilities in accommodating to the claim of privacy. Because of its relative inflexibility, legislation cannot meet the challenge of the subtle and sensitive conflict of values under consideration, nor can it aid in the wise decision making by individuals which is required to assure optimum protection of subjects, together with the fullest effectiveness of research.",

This concern appears justified because 1) they often are confused with eyewitness lineups, 2) not very much research has been conducted on how effective they are and 3) clear-cut procedures as to how they should be carried out -- and especially good standards for their conduct and interpretation -- are but minimally available. Yet they can be most useful to investigations/trials when a person is a victim, or an observer, of a crime wherein they did not or could not see the perpetrator but could hear him or her speak. This article will briefly summarize the status of earwitness identifications, review acceptable procedures, and set standards for their conduct.",

      "abstract": "Listening is the important aspect of communication that has been paid less attention by communication experts now a days, which is very useful in day to day life even at work place. Listening and hearing considered as same but it can be easily differentiated. Good listening involves deep understanding of speaker or sender message as well as emotions, which leads to best interpersonal relationship. Effective and good listening reduces conflict, increases trust and get knowledge how to inspire and motivate others at workplace or in any of interpersonal relationship. It is a habit which is mostly ignored by people because of illusion that they are good listeners. Effective listening at workplace improves formal and informal relationship with your co-workers and increase work efficiency. Good interpersonal relationship at workplace turns out to be a motivational factor for better work performance. In communication we are much bothered about language which is only one part of the communication but effective communication is impossible without effective listening. Type of listeners we come across in our day to day life. Passive listeners are not concerned about speaker intention, feelings and emotions. While active listener care about speaker emotions, feeling and therefore they possess patience levels, they ask question to clarify, they focus on speaker. It means that non verbal communication helps much in active listening. This paper deals with importance of effective listening at workplace. Purposive sampling under non-probability sampling technique applied. Survey method with questionnaire tool has been used for collecting data from 123 respondents of different educational organizations in Bhopal. Research concluded that lack of effective listening affects their formal and informal relationship at workplace. This research also suggested that effective listening helps them to understand work culture.",

Also a person may seem untouchable since they may be from a minority or have long seniority with the company. Additional reasons can include a supervisor who feels sorry for the employee or has a friendship with that person resulting in that employee being treated differently and encouraging problem behaviour. Other employees′ behaviour will also be impacted on since they see this different treatment and may grow to resent it – thus affecting their work performance.",

Elles ont aussi un rôle fondamental dans la résolution de problèmes.

Sur la base de nos recherches, nous proposons une conceptualisation des liens entre régulation et sources de contrôle des régulations tenant compte de certains éléments connus du fonctionnement du cerveau.

      "title": "Habit Interventions",
      "abstract": "Habitual behaviors are initiated automatically in response to situations in which they have been repeatedly performed in the past. Making a desired behavior habitual is thought to shield it against lapses due to low motivation, while disrupting habitual performance of undesired behaviors may aid cessation. This chapter outlines how developing new cue-behavior associations so that a habit can form may disrupt unwanted habitual actions. The strategies are suggested: avoiding cues, inhibiting responses to cues, or learning new habit associations to displace old ones. Forming a new habit requires sustained motivation and ability to initiate and maintain change as new associations form. Among those willing to change, behavior change techniques that promote action control (e.g., action planning, goal setting, using prompts and cues) may particularly facilitate habit formation. Purposeful habit disruption, requires motivation but is also facilitated by identifying triggers and either avoiding them or planning alternative responses. Habit change can be facilitated or obstructed by characteristics of the target behavior, situation, or actor. For example, behaviors that are easier to perform and driven by intrinsic motives rather than external pressure are likely to rapidly become habitual. Evaluations of habit interventions suggest that they are typically acceptable to recipients and show potential in achieving meaningful behavior change.",

      "title": "Cognitive Processes and the Impact of Stress upon Doctoral Students: Practical Applications for Doctoral Programs",
      "abstract": "Doctoral-level graduate training is, by definition, very demanding from a cognitive perspective. As graduate students adjust to the significant academic demands of doctoral education, they are often in a period of financial, personal, and relational flux or challenge. In addition to what are likely more obvious social and emotional effects, cognitive performance may be impacted by these stressors and negatively impact doctoral training. In terms of cognitive functioning, these stressors most clearly affect working memory—the limited capacity to hold and engage units of information or concepts in one’s active thought. This foundational functional capacity is utilized in complex thought, problem solving, and learning/memory. Under stress, working memory might be over-utilized and then may become degraded during these times of distress, negatively impacting performance in the doctoral program. In these instances of stress, the limited capacity of working memory becomes allocated to the stressors rather than to the complex and high-level thinking of doctoral training and education. Graduate program directors must therefore consider not only how best to mitigate the risks of psychological and social difficulties related to these stressors, but also work to minimize the impact of these stressors upon cognitive performance. Given the potential influence upon academic and cognitive performance in graduate studies, the impact of stressful events upon working memory and the related effects upon cognition/cognitive performance and potential interventions/recommendations to enhance graduate student performance are considered.",

      "title": "[P2–480]: A MULTI‐MODAL INTERVENTION TO ENHANCE COGNITIVE COMPENSATION STRATEGIES AND PROMOTE BRAIN HEALTH ACTIVITIES",
      "abstract": "Neuropathological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) start decades before diagnosis. Subjective cognitive concerns (SCC) and subtle changes in functional abilities also begin very early. Older adults with difficulties in everyday executive and memory abilities are at risk for eventually losing independence in instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) and progressing towards mild cognitive impairment or AD. Thus, there is a critical window of opportunity for intervention to delay further loss of function. This unique multidimensional intervention builds on compensatory training with other populations to directly target the functional abilities most likely to maintain independent living. Targeted compensatory training includes 1) a calendar system to support planning and memory, 2) goal planning and task-lists to increase sense of purpose and accomplish goals, 3) an organization system to maximize daily efficiency. This multidimensional intervention program also targets engagement in healthy lifestyle activities (physical/cognitive exercise, emotional wellbeing) to promote brain health. This project tests the feasibility and efficacy of a 10-week intervention designed to enhance compensation skills to directly support everyday activities among independent cognitively normal older adults with SCC. A primary goal is to provide evidence that the intervention results in changes in target behaviors. Secondary goals are to obtain preliminary evidence of the program's impact on everyday function. A randomized wait-list control (WLC) group design will be employed. Initial recruitment is as follows: 50 individuals attended information sessions about the program or received information over the phone, 30 were not interested due mostly to travel complications or schedule conflict, and 20 were randomized with 10 individuals to each the immediate and WLC group. Results from previous pilot data (n=30) provide preliminary evidence that this intervention can result in enhanced compensation skills and more frequent engagement in cognitively stimulating activities and changes can be maintained at three month follow up. Pilot data for this intervention indicates a well-accepted, novel intervention to support everyday function. Initial recruitment data highlights recruitment complications, most notably travel difficulties for older adults. Thus, this intervention will be provided more directly in the community in which older adults live to enhance recruitment.",

      "title": "Tools for managing feline problem behaviours: Psychoactive medications",
      "abstract": "Practical relevance: When a cat is presented for evaluation of a problem behaviour, it is likely that the cat’s wellbeing is negatively affected by the condition. In addition, the owners and any other animals around the cat may also be experiencing negative consequences. When managing these cases, it is important to consider all options (including behaviour modification, environmental changes, medications) that can help to reach an optimal solution. Medication cannot teach the cat how to behave or change a particular behaviour; it can, however, reduce arousal, excitability, reactivity and anxiety. Rationale: The rationale for using psychoactive medications in behavioural medicine, or veterinary psychiatry, is to increase the wellbeing of the animal and to aid the owner and practitioner in managing problem behaviours. Medications should always be used as an adjunct to behavioural and environmental modification. Clinical challenges: Many psychoactive medications cannot be used in the face of certain physical illnesses or concurrently with other medications. Some medications may also have side effects, not be effective at the recommended dose or have a paradoxical effect. Furthermore, success is reliant on the owner being able to administer the medication. Aims: This article aims to guide practitioners by discussing questions such as how to choose the appropriate medication, how to dose it and how long to use it. The psychoactive medications most commonly used in feline medicine are reviewed, as well as some that are newer or less common. Evidence base: Data for the use of medications in cats is limited, with just a small number of clinical-, species- and problem-directed studies available, and a few more case series and case reports. Where feline-specific research is not available, the authors have drawn upon research published in other species, such as humans, dogs and rats, as well as anecdotal reports and expert opinions.",

      "title": "Measurement of reaction time in groups of young athletes in the conditions which require focused attention",
      "abstract": "The notion of maintaining visual attention, with its synonyms; prolonged concentration, intensity, mental attitude, are used to determine a mental ability which refers to ‘a state of readiness to detect, recognise and react to unusually subtle changes in the surroundings which occur during a longer period of time’ [1]. According to Linhart [2], ‘concentration of active attention is understood as a period during which a subject is able to perceive conventional signals without errors which might be a result of distracting attention, in a way that is active, purposeful and continuous’ [2, p. 324]. It must be added that this state of active readiness to react has a latent form and refers to a tendency to focus attention at a high level, mostly on tasks requiring a high standard of performance. Therefore, it does not determine a general level of possibilities to accomplish a given task, but it undoubtedly has an impact on it. In experimental psychology, an ability to focus attention is perceived in two ways: – as a certain personality disposition, – as a certain feature of behaviour which depends on a situational context. For the purpose of examining human behaviours in the conditions which require focused attention, many researchers suggest using attentional tasks, also referred to as continuous performance tests that ought to be characterised by the following three conditions: – relatively long duration, – low probability that a signal will appear, – relatively shallow principle of information selection during an analysis of stimuli [3,4].",

Fundamental principles imbedded in the behavior therapies include: a) detailed observation; b) specification of treatment goals; c) objective measures of outcome; and d) relevance to patients' real-life situations. Application of specific behavioral techniques engenders types of difficulties that occur with regularity: a) an overly constricted view of treatment indications; b) tendencies either to quit too soon or to persist too long; c) the glib use of pseudobehavioral jargon; d) a miring in loyalty struggles and pseudoethical issues; e) over-zealous or apologetic application; and f) casual experimentation. Remedy of these problems begins with reappraisal in terms of general behavioral principles rather than rote applications of techniques. Emphasis on empirical precepts has the further advantage of engendering a healthy and vigorous, rather than contentious, eclectic atmosphere.",

Hal tersebut mengakibatkan hubungan harmonis sesama manusia jarang terlihat. Semua orang asik dengan dunianya sendiri. Maka tak heran jika dihadapkan pada kondisi interaksi langsung banyak konflik yang terjadi akibat ego yang tak terkontrol. Jika kondisi ini terus berlangsung maka perasaan saling menyayangi dan peduli akan hilang karena merasa tidak saling membutuhkan dan saling menjatuhkan. Kondisi sepeti itu dalam istilah psikologi disebut kurangnya rasa empati atau kemampuan merasakan apa yang orang lain rasakan.\r\nDari masalah yang ada, maka peneliti bertujuan untuk mencari solusi bagi masalah tersebut.

      "title": "Striking Out Swinging: Specialist Success Following Forced Task Inferiority",
      "abstract": "Organizing work around specialized professionals leverages their deep expertise and mastery of particular skills. However, as work becomes more flexible, organizations often require specialists to perform some work outside their specialization. These tasks, which distance specialists from the area of their greatest contribution, could diminish their performance by being distracting or tiring or by creating negative comparisons with others who are more proficient in that work. Contrary to these perspectives, we find robust evidence that specialists’ performance can be enhanced, rather than diminished, after work outside their specialization. Using archival data from 22 years of Major League Baseball (MLB) games and interviews with former MLB players and coaches, we find that specialized players perform better in their specialty after obligatory tasks outside of their specialization. We argue that this occurs through a process we call forced task inferiority, in which underperformance in tasks outside their specialty frustrates specialists, generating heightened arousal and drive that they can channel into better performance in their specialty work. The results are robust to alternative mechanisms, such as tasks outside a specialist’s area of specialization leading to learning, breaking monotony, or threatening the specialist’s professional identity. This research advances knowledge about managing specialists and flexible work arrangements by showing that when tasks are particularly sequenced, specialists’ performance can be enhanced, rather than diminished, by doing work outside their specialty.

      "abstract": ": Cognition includes all phases of valid functions and processes, e.g., sensitivity, judgment, assessment, and decision-making. Thinking is also a cognitive procedure since it involves considering potential opportunities. There are various types of cognition. Hot cognition involves mental procedures where emotion plays a role, while cold cognition includes mental processes that do not include feelings or emotions. Cognitive memories of various types include sensor memory, sensing touch, smell, and sight; short-term memory allows one to recall, e.g., what one had for lunch a few days ago; working memory includes remembering telephone numbers or directions to a destination; and long-term memory comprises of major milestones in life and recalling one’s childhood events. These are further classified as episodic, e.g., the first day in primary school, and semantic memories, such as recalling the capital city of a country and filling out crossword puzzles. Declarative memories include remembering significant past events, such as global information. Cognition is affected by factors, such as nutrition, aging, addiction, environment, mental health, physical activity, smoking, and keeping the brain active. Consumption of plant- based foods plays a prominent role in the prevention of cognitive memory. Playing games and instruments, reading books, and being socially active make life more satisfying, thus assisting in the preservation of mental function and slowing mental decline.",

During online searching, people first decide which queries to submit to an information retrieval system, after that they decide which links to click on, and based on the quality of search result content, they further determine whether to stop viewing the current returned result set or to refine the query. At some point a person decides to terminate searching. For tasks that require a single answer such as a navigation task, it is relatively clear when a person decides to stop searching -- he or she has either found, or not found, an answer to his or her question. However, for tasks that have no obvious end-point, it is unclear when and why people decide to stop searching and more importantly, it is unclear how to model such behavior. The research question of deciding when information is enough to complete one's task is mostly investigated under the term \"search stopping behavior\" [3], even though no formal definition has been given in the literature.",

      "abstract": "Feedback pedagogies and research tend to focus on immediate corrective actions rather than learning for the longer term. This approach means that feedback may not support trainees who are managing complex, competing, and ambiguous practice situations, often with limited supervision. There is an opportunity to consider how feedback can help medical trainees sustain their own development into the future, including when they have completed formal training. This article explores how feedback pedagogies can facilitate medical trainees’ abilities to develop challenging aspects of practice across multiple clinical environments to eventually practice without supervision. From a sociocultural perspective, clinical training takes place within a practice curriculum; each clinical environment offers varying opportunities, which the trainees may choose to engage with. The authors propose feedback as an interpersonal process that helps trainees make sense of both formal training requirements and performance relevant information, including workplace cues such as patient outcomes or colleagues’ comments, found within any practice curriculum. A significant pedagogic strategy may be to develop trainees’ evaluative judgment or their capability to identify and appraise the qualities of good practice in both themselves and others. In this way, feedback processes may help trainees surmount complex situations and progressively gain independence from supervision.",

Istraživanja su pokazala da je potrebno 100 ms da se o nekome stvori dojam. Na formiranje dojma utjecu razni faktori poput redoslijeda prezentiranja informacije, verbalnog i neverbalnog ponasanja, fizickog izgleda, lica, odjece, raspoloženja i slicno. Svi ti faktori cine skup informacija na temelju kojih se oblikuje cjelokupan dojam o nekoj osobi. Međutim, prilikom stvaranja dojmova pojedinac može koristiti kognitivne precace poput stereotipa i implicitnih teorija licnosti koje mogu dovesti do pogresne percepcije i procjene drugih. Naime, cinjenica da je nesto sto je lijepo ujedno i dobro, ne mora uvijek biti tocna. Važno je naglasiti da su prvi dojmovi vrlo bitni, pogotovo u poslovnom svijetu i svaka se osoba trudi ostaviti sto bolji prvi dojam na druge jer možda nece imati priliku kasnije poboljsati utisak koji je ostavila.

Na kraju, prilikom formiranja dojma važno je u obzir uzeti sve dostupne informacije kako bi dojam i procjena osobe bile sto tocnije te da ne bi doslo do pristranosti.",

      "abstract": "Purpose While many approaches in the field of unlearning aim at describing, understanding or explaining the “what” and/or “how” of unlearning, this paper aims to focus on the “where-to” and the goal of unlearning. In many cases, unlearning starts off with a specific result or goal in mind. This paper suggests that such an approach has to be challenged in the context of a highly complex and uncertain world and to introduce a mode of unlearning following a strategy of future-oriented open-endedness. Design/methodology/approach This conceptual paper draws on (both theoretical/philosophical and empirical) interdisciplinary evidence from a wide variety of fields, such as organization studies, organizational (un)learning, systems theory, cognitive science and innovation studies. Findings It turns out that open-endedness in unlearning processes plays a central role, especially if we are confronted with high levels of uncertainty and complexity. In such an environment, following a strategy of co-becoming with an unfolding environment and with an emergent goal seems to be more promising than aiming at a preconceived (un-)learning goal. Originality/value The unlearning literature provides various approaches to what unlearning is and how it can be executed. However, understanding the actual goals and outcomes of unlearning and how these goals are identified and determined is a rather under-researched field. In many cases, they are preconceived in advance finding their realization in new forms of knowledge, assumptions, belief systems, values or routines. This paper challenges this strategy and addresses the gap of how it is possible to unlearn toward an uncertain future. This has an impact on the process of unlearning itself; it has to be reframed and understood as an open-ended strategy for identifying emerging future potentials, purposes and goals in a process of co-becoming with an unfolding future.",

      "abstract": "Consider the distinction between training and teaching. The concept of training has application when (a) there is some specifiable performance that has to be mastered, (b) practice is required for the mastery of it, and (c) little emphasis is placed on the underlying rationale. The typical term for the educational process by which people are brought to understand principles is teaching, for teaching - unlike training or instructing - implies that a rationale is to be grasped behind the skill or body of knowledge..1\n\nIf I ask someone how to do something and their answer begins with the words “Always and only,” then I know that I am in a training environment. The matter is not up for discussion, there are not exceptional circumstances; just do it and do it like this. Some of medicine is like this: the disposal of sharps, scrubbing up, keeping patient records. But to understand not just what is done but why it is done we must turn to teaching, to the rationale behind professional action.\n\n### Summary points\n\nTeaching postgraduate doctors the sensitivity and discrimination required in the complex process of making clinical judgments cannot be done through the checklists and competence bases used in training. Action is provisional to the context in which the doctor must act, rather than being pre-specified.

To achieve an equilibrium state, agents must come to understand one another’s intentions. Communication can facilitate this understanding under some, but not all, circumstances. In the absence of communication among agents, coordination may also sometimes be achieved with the aid of extrinsic signals that have come to be associated with the actions of others. In some settings, past actions themselves serve as precedents, without the benefit of any communication.",

This includes moment‐by‐moment understanding of that information, as well as the potential application of any knowledge acquired from that information in future settings. Studies of literacy have often focused on the types of activities that are necessary to ensure successful reading experiences. These have included case studies of classroom behavior, investigations of teacher practices, analyses of the processes that underlie visual encoding of letter stimuli, and interventions designed to remediate struggling readers' difficulties (to name a few areas of interest). In line with the simple view of reading, as offered by Gough and Tunmer (1986) and Hoover and Gough (1990), many of these projects have focused on two core sets of reading activities—basic‐level processes that underlie the types of pattern recognition activities necessary to decode and identify words and sounds, and higher‐order processes that are necessary to extract meaning from words and sentences. Additionally, these projects might be broadly categorized as investigating two aspects of reading experiences: (a) the study of the learning products that result from reading, as measured by tests of reader comprehension and memory after reading is completed ; and (b) investigations of the internal mental processes that individuals engage in as they read a text .",

      "abstract": "Abstract Characterizing and Addressing Student Learning Issues and Misconceptions (SLIMs) in Materials Science with Muddiest Point Reflections and Fast Formative FeedbackIt is generally acknowledged in engineering education research that, prior to instruction, studentsmay have faulty knowledge about how the world works, such as misconceptions. In order tocreate, develop, or restructure instructional materials and activities, instructors must be informedby that prior knowledge. In a sense, however, prior knowledge in a classroom setting alsoconsists of a variety of both Student Learning Issues and Misconceptions (SLIMs). These otherlearning issues can consist of different categories of impediments or barriers to learning. Onegeneral category could be called \"gaps\". One such type of gap is \"knowledge gaps\". Anothertype might be \"gaps related to words and language\" and could include vocabulary gaps ofmisunderstood, misused, incorrect or missing words and language gaps from faulty grammar orforeign language issues. Another gap type, \"skill gaps\", could include skills that are lacking,faulty, or misapplied in areas such as calculations, analysis, computation, and graph reading andinterpretation. These gaps in knowledge, words and skills fall under the general heading of thestudent learning issues part of SLIMs. Effective instructional materials and classroom practiceneed to be informed by and address such SLIMs, which might be acquired from broad formativeassessment of foundational knowledge of students who are learning new content. Suchassessments can span a broad range and include concept inventories, concept tests, homeworkassignments, tests, etc., but such instruments usually span longer time sequences of instructionthan a single class and may not provide timely and focused feedback to students. While class-by-class formative assessment could provide such information, such data collection and analysis iscumbersome. Presently, short formative assessments such as minute papers and muddiest pointshave been given with a card or sheet of paper to students near the end of a class. Compiling andanalyzing such data is tedious, but new web-enabled approaches can now provide quick and easyturnaround with rich and insightful data. One such approach will now be described.Initially, in a project called JTF (Just-in-Time-Teaching with Interactive Frequent FormativeFeedback), collecting Muddiest Point student response data was tedious, but has been transformedby a powerful tool, called the Concept Warehouse (CW), cw.edudiv.org. It is a web-enabledresource developed by Milo Koretsky at Oregon State University, that has automated Muddiest Pointdata gathering and analysis capabilities. Now, anonymous student Muddiest Point responses can becollected via the web to CW via smart phone, tablet or laptop computer. Then, CW can automaticallyoutput student response data in tabular quotation format, with a student Muddy Point intensity scaleof 0-5 for each response, along with a Word Cloud with word size proportional to word frequency.The word cloud allows instructors to instantly identify key words associated with student learningissues and misconceptions (SLIMs) from Muddiest Points feedback. Instructors can use the wordcloud and quotes with intensities, in order to strategize how to adjust instruction, create interventions,or create student learning resources such as activities, pencast tutorials, or Muddiest Point YouTubevideos. Research has shown that attending to learning issues as quickly as possible withimmediate feedback is most effective for motivation and learning. In this paper, a variety ofMuddiest-Point-generated SLIMs related to introductory materials science will be given asexamples along with strategies for addressing them. Additionally, assessment tools and results todetermine the effectiveness and impact of such cyber-enabled data collection and formativefeedback approaches for improving instructor teaching and student learning will be discussed.",

Teknik pengumpulan data dalam penelitian ini melalui observasi, wawancara, dan dokumentasi. Analisi data yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah analisis Miles &amp; Huberman.Hasil penelitian terlihat dari gambaran kemandirian pada usia lanjut, dimana kemandirian emosional dapat dilihat bahwa dalam melakukan kegiatan sehari-hari subjek tidak mengeluh kepada orang lain mengenai kegiatan yang dilakukannya. Ketika subjek merasa sedih dan merasakan kekecewaan, ia tidak menceritakannya kepada orang lain, subjek hanya menceritakannya kepada keluarganya saja, kemandirian tingkah laku dapat dilihat bahwa dalam mengambil suatu keputusan subjek mempertimbangkan terlebih dahulu apa yang akan dilakukannya, apakah keputusan diambil baik atau tidak bagi dirinya. Ketika membuat keputusan subjek tidak pernah ragu dengan keputusan yang dibuatnya, seperti dalam mengambil keputusan kalau subjek akan tetap bekerja atau berjualan di pasar walaupun anak-anaknya sudah melarang, karena bagi subjek berjualan dengan mengikuti banyak kegiatan bisa membuat ia merasa bahagia, kemandirian nilai dapat dilihat bahwa dalam memecahkan suatu masalah yang dihadapi, subjek tidak langsung menyelesaikannya sendiri, tetapi subjek mufakat terlebih dahulu dengan suami dan anaknya bagaimana cara menyelesaikan masalah tersebut. Subjek memiliki harapan untuk berhasil, dengan cara menerapka keyakinan bahwa ia akan berhasil dengan cara selalu berusaha.",

Comprendre, per tant, el paper dels estressors, entenent-los com a ambientals o condicions croniques que objectivament amenacen la salut o el benestar psicologic dels individus d'una edat particular en una societat particular, edeve una prioritat basica per tal de poder dissenyar intervencions que redueixin l'exposicio dels estressors i millorin les capacitats de manejament i d'adaptacio als estressors vitals. Les nostres vides estan influenciades no nomes per allo que ens passa, per les nostres experiencies, sino tambe per les creences que tenim de per que ens passen les coses que ens passen. En aquest sentit, el locus de control, entes com una expectativa generalitzada sobre si allo que ens passa esta sota el control de les nostres accions o depen de la sort, el desti o la influencia dels altres, es a dir, com a expectatives de contingencia, ha esdevingut un dels constructes mes utilitzats els ultims anys. En el nostre treball hem volgut estudiar la relacio que els esdeveniments vitals estressants i el locus de control poden exercir sobre el rendiment academic dels alumnes de 6e de Primaria. Hem dut a terme un estudi observacional, prospectiu i longitudinal amb 385 alumnes que han contestat diversos questionaris que mesuren els esdeveniments vitals estressants (EAVI), el locus de control (EAVI) i el rendiment academic (Questionari PA o NM) en dos moments, a l'inici i al final de curs. Els resultats ens permeten concloure que: 1) els esdeveniments vitals estressants viscuts al llarg d'un curs academic, influeixen negativament sobre el rendiment academic, 2) els alumnes que tenen un locus de control mes alt, obtenen un millor rendiment academic, 3) el locus de control es mante estable al llarg d'un curs academic en aquestes edats, 4) la influencia entre esdeveniments vitals estressants i el locus de control es bidireccional. A mes esdeveniments vitals estressants, menys locus de control intern i a menys locus de control intern, mes esdeveniments vitals estressants, 5) semblaria que el locus de control pot esmorteir la relacio entre els esdeveniments vitals estressants i el rendiment academic, 6) els propis alumnes en son els millors informadors d'allo que els passa. Els resultats d'aquest treball tenen implicacions sobre les actuacions educatives amb elsalumnes. Per una banda, cal tenir en compte la seva incidencia sobre els aprenentatges i, per tant, incorporar sistemes d'avaluacio en moments determinats i, per l'altra, cal incidir especialment en el modelament d'un locus de control que n'afavoreixi un afrontament mes positiu davant d'allo que s'ha d'aprendre.",

      "title": "Designing for crowd well-being: Needs and design suggestions",
      "abstract": "This paper investigates the needs or criteria for sustaining well-being in crowded situations through two focus group discussions with a total of ten participants. We conclude that pursuing crowd well-being could be divided into two different cases: one is obtaining the enhancement of the current state in normal situations, and the other is avoiding the deficiencies in case of emergencies. The psychological needs are different in these two cases. Crowd members pay attention to higher level of psychological needs, i.e. staying autonomic, connected, competent and respected in the former situation, while their focus will immediately change to low level needs, i.e. safety and security issues, when unexpected things happen. These findings are consistent with Sheldon et al.’s new hierarchy of needs. We also find that all the crowd types mentioned in the focus group discussions could be classified into two categories, namely event crowds and non-event crowds. A crowd can also consist of both event moments (e.g. watching performances or dancing with the crowds) and non-event moments (e.g. waiting in queues). The event crowds are looking for enhancement of their experiences in the crowds, whose needs are usually higher level, whereas the non-event crowds usually cannot help joining the crowds in order to achieve their goals. The event moments when the higher level needs is fulfilled are usually associated with positive moments. The non-event moments when only security is promised and have no support on higher level needs are usually associated with negative moments. To get insights into how crowd well-being is currently fulfilled by crowd management strategies and designs, we investigated a number of influential crowd management literatures. The results reveal that emphasis is placed on supporting the safety. Most strategies focus on preparation and prediction instead sustaining real-time crowd well-being. Most of the designs tend to be coercive instead of respecting the autonomy. In conclusion, designing for crowd well-being could change towards the real-time and aim at fulfilling the higher needs, i.e. autonomy, competence, self-esteem and relatedness on the premise of security.",

      "abstract": "The attributional egotism of individuals may be particularly important when they serve as members of cooperative groups. Within a group one's fellow members may be granted or denied credit for a group performance in order to manipulate one's own perceived responsibility for the outcome. In this study, group members privately or publicly reported their assessments of their own and others' responsibility for group successes and failures. Subjects privately claimed more responsibility for success than for failure but did not do so (in public) when the other members were expected to see their reports. Moreover, under public conditions, subjects claimed less responsibility for a group success than they gave to the other members, an effect which disappeared in private. Subjects were clearly sensitive to the interpersonal implications of their attributions, displaying less egotism under public conditions.",

This is so because our desire to solve these problems and our experience of dealing with them has equipped us with spontaneous reactions, which usually result into solutions However, sometimes when we face an unusual or a difficult problem we get as stuck our routine reaction fails to produce a solution. In such cases, various approaches and ways have to be tried. An entrepreneur is likely to face a variety of problems in the course of implementation and management of his small-scale enterprise. If an appropriate system, approach and methodology is developed for solving problems, it will help him to manage his affairs smoothly and he would not remain under stress and tension when he encounter's problems.",

      "abstract": "atthew seems to be the kind of student every teacher would enjoy having in class. He is polite, pleasant, and very likable. When a reading activity is assigned, he appears to read it. Even his mother corroborates that he usually reads his homework assignments. Yet, he has difficulty with recall when questioned about the content of the reading. This is evident in both class discussions and on tests. This scenario is often seen by teachers. There are students who appear to be performing assigned reading tasks but have difficulty with retention. Such students maintain that they were reading, yet, when asked to describe what was going on in their minds when they were reading, they cannot. Students who are unable to describe these mental processes may be suffering from a metacognitive deficit. Metacognition may be defined as the knowledge and awareness of one's own cognitive processes and the ability to regulate, evaluate, and monitor one's thinking. The monitoring process allows a person to more effectively control his or her cognitive processes, thereby affording more efficient and active learning. Metacognition involves two basic behaviors. First, the learner possesses knowledge pertinent to progressing toward the learning task. This knowledge can be assessed by having the learner talk about his or her mental processes when learning. Second, the learner knows the nature of the learning task and what is required to learn or understand the materials being read or studied. The",

Muitas pesquisas avaliadas apontaram que muitas vezes ha por parte dos profissionais falta de comprometimento, o que por si so nao apeas na area de educacao fisica, mas em todas as ares profissionais e uma atitude antietica. Os estudos apontam que ponto que mais influencia nas atitudes sao os lacos que o educador fisico, ou personal treiner cria com os sues clientes, pois alem da cobranca por parte do outro ha tambem o respeito. Quando os profissionais nao agem corretamente acabam prejudicando a outra pessoa, o dano pode ser temporario ou permanente. Resultados positivos tambem foram encontrados, a exemplo quanto o trabalho e conduzido com seriedade e etica, ha maior probalidade de se alcancar homens e mulheres com saude e estetica semelhante a desejada, levando ao bem estar. Concluiu-se, que o ser humano, como pessoa e como profissional exerce uma grande interferencia na vida de outro,  esta influencia e maximizada no campo de atuacao relacionado a saude, desta forma evidencia-se a necesidade de profissionais capacitados e responsaveis para com os seus educandos, que possam ser mais do que professores possam ser exemplos de estilo de vida, de saude e de profissionalismo.",

      "title": "Alternative Assessment: Has It Come of Age?",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACTAlternative is type of practice that seeks to assess learners' language abilities, in ways other than how traditional standardized tests did. The present article reviews the issues related to and adopts a partly critical position regarding some of the related arguments. The advantages as well as quality concerns are discussed and a number of challenges that need to be dealt with are considered. Finally suggestions are made to ameliorate practice.KEY WORDS: Alternative Assessment, Traditional Tests1. IntroductionIt is the common practice among students (language students or other majors) to raise their objections to their scores when they fail to get a criterion score or when they feel they have not gotten the score they deserve. Even somehow similar attitudes can be found among those who have gotten the required scores and so do not have any problem of moving on to the next level, grade, class etc. Where is the problem? Does the sheer act of taking a test and getting a score produce bitter feelings in students? Most likely no. Do they feel their abilities are underestimated? Or simply, they just want to have their scores changed for higher ones? Although the answer as to why of this customary practice is not clear, what is clear is that testing has kept open the channels that produce such judgments of inefficiency of testing from the part of test takers. If this is the case, what is the problem with tests and/ or testing that results in attitudes like these? One major answer is that tests - or at least tests that are used in such situations - do not allow the students to display their full range of abilities, especially if they are language students. Individuals who sit in one corner of the test-taking hall, and provide answers for a number of questions are well excused for voicing their discontent with such tests, if the phenomenon to be tested is an ability rather than knowledge.One way to overcome the problem referred to above, is to use methods of testing other than what has been practiced so far. In other words, practitioners are advised to try forms or methods of testing; those that reach out to probe more into language learners' abilities. Alternative is one solution. It is a form of that claims to break away with the traditional tests, and provide a better picture of what learners can do with language. These claims are appealing. Provided that stands up to the claims it makes, it can be of much help to remedy the limitations of traditional tests. But, does it? It is to this that I now turn to in the following section.2. Alternative Assessment: What is it?From the very start the difficulties associated with manifest themselves. The term alternative assessment is suffering from a number of shortcomings. I see two problems with this label; one is the fact that this label is not used unanimously by scholars. Hamayan (1995), for example, names some of the terms that have been used by different writers, all of whom referred to assessment. These terms are alternative assessment, informal assessment, authentic assessment, performance assessment, descriptive assessment and direct assessment (pp. 213). The second problem with the label is that it does not refer to a coherent group of activities that can be put together under one term as a representative (Balliro, 1993). Alternative includes a variety of activities, very different in nature, aimed at generating data about individual learners. Although all of the activities share the common goal of producing information about an individual's language competence, considering them as homogeneous with shared features is misleading. More discussion about what these activities are is provided below. Balliro (1993) also expresses the vagueness she perceives is present in the term. …",

      "abstract": "Cheating seems as an ordinary habit for most of teacher, so they tend to ignore it and rarely to discuss as a central issues in learning evaluation. Cheating is one of manifestations in using illegitimate ways, means to achieve a legitimate end. Cheating problems is become very crucial cases since it will be bring into the job places and daily life. Therefore, self-efficacy is absolutely needed to build up the childrenâ€™s confidence; it is also very important because selfefficacy have many functions, such as: (1) to develop the strong commitment, (2) to establish children in having their grand plans to achieve the goals, (3) to stimulate childrenâ€™s braveness in facing the challenges, tasks, and tests, and (4) to avoid children from doing any acts which may appear the failure. In order to discover those problems, we need to use the psychological approach based on Albert Banduraâ€™s theory and to invest the religious charactersâ€™ values related to the Al-Qurâ€™an in Ali Imran, verse 139. There are two kinds of cheating done by children, they are; (a) cheating by self-effort, in a small note form, in pencil box, tucked inside of calculator, and putting into HP, (b) cheating together, by creating the codes or signs which make them easy to understand each other. The cheating happened not only because of the supervisorâ€™s irresponsible and careless, but also arises from pressures which force children to gain the good score and pass the exam. This habit is supported by the social media and much of link which provide safely cheating tricks, through Facebook, limakaki.wordpress.com, munsypedia.com, caranyontek.blogspot.com, tololpedia.com, etc. Based on the writer analysis, there are two kinds of learning activities which may threat the childrenâ€™s selfefficacy, are: (1) teacher often gives punishments that make children shame. In fact, punishment itself would arise the negative legitimating among children. It is better to use the Sinaas Apple punishments are termed by Jan Ligthart, (2) teacher less give the studentsâ€™ opportunity to be more creative. Itâ€™s because the class tends to apply the teacher-center learning, where teacher as a central who wonâ€™t to be bothered by the questions or studentâ€™s feedback. Consequently, we need to change the teacherâ€™s mindset, parentsâ€™ views, and also social environment that proved by the result of this study.",

The aim of the study is to show and discuss the reflexive relationship between the questions, what they were occasioned by and how they are responded to. Procedures and anatomical features, that for the seminar leader are unproblematically seen in endodontic terms, repeatedly present problems for the students. Visible but unrecognized shifts in the dentist’s work, for instance, provide occasions for questions of the form ‘What is he doing now?’. In the midst of an ongoing procedure, questions tend to be formulated as noticings that elicit instruction either about some detail of the dentist’s actions or about what a generic ‘one should’ or ‘should not do’, what ‘frequently’ happens and so on. It is shown, however, that the movement between specific here-and-now features on the one hand and more general issues on the other characterizes the entire scope of the relevant material, particularly because the seminar leaders’ answers tend to place even minute details within more general endodontic considerations.",

      "abstract": "Along with the start of the business and its exponential growth, business transfer is the third\r\n critical point in the company's life cycle. Business transfer is a process in which ownership of\r\n an enterprise is transferred to another person or enterprise and continuous of commercial\r\n activity of the enterprise is assured. This process has legal, economic, social and emotional\r\n implications on the enterprise owner. In particular, psychological barriers and emotional\r\n underpinnings are underestimated, which often take away more time than legal and economic\r\n issues. Business transfer is usually an once-in-a-lifetime event and it is considered to be a highly\r\n emotional event. Given the importance of this event and the impact that a business transfer\r\n decision may have on the business and all stakeholders, especially on the family of the business\r\n owner, it is worrying that business owners are relatively unfamiliar with the process. Some of\r\n the psychological barriers for which reason some entrepreneurs resist or delay business transfer\r\n are distrust in the successor, difficulties in choosing a possible successor among their own\r\n children and prejudice against succession planning. Given the traits of the entrepreneur/owner\r\n and the circumstances of the situation, i.e. subjective experience of the situation, individuals\r\n use different ways of coping with psychological barriers in different situations. Some of them\r\n are use of emotional support, active coping, turning to religion, denial, etc. The topic of business\r\n transfer is especially important in Republic of Croatia because there is lack of system support,\r\n insufficient examples of good practice, the complexity of this problem is underestimated and\r\n there is a significant number of SMEs that will face the transfer of business in the near future.\r\n For that reason, in the empirical part of this paper results of a semi-structured interview with\r\n the owner of a small enterprise that is facing the business transfer process are presented.",

It is not always obvious which questions may be perceived as sensitive or threatening. Ten measures are suggested that may assist in reducing the bias. These are reliability checks, embedding the question, adopting non‐personal interviewing methods, the use of diaries and panels, selecting an appropriate time‐frame, using open questions, contacting informants, formulating longer questions, incorporating familiar words, and loading the question.",

      "abstract": "One need a particular kind of practice i.e., deliberate practice to develop leadership. To begin with practice, we will engage in one designed specifically to improve performance. Engaging in a designed learning experience just once or twice does not cut it. It has to be done over and over and over again until its automatic. That takes hours of repetition. An important characteristic of deliberate practice is the availability of feedback. Without knowing how one is doing, it's difficult to gauge whether he is getting close to his goal and whether he is executing correctly. There are many other ways to bring deliberate practice into the workplace. Analyzing case studies and role-playing, for instance, are both terrific ways to safely practice how to respond to critical incidents. To become best leader, one should know his strengths and weaknesses in some areas and that he must address them.",

There are various methods of treatment at the ergotherapist's disposal: activities of everyday life, such as self-help and household training, functional games, craft skills and neurotraining, which aims in particular at improving intellectual function. In a well-protected environment the patient learns to judge his or her capabilities correctly once again and to make the best of his or her strength or weaknesses in daily life.",

      "abstract": "직장괴롭힘은 기업의 노동생산성을 떨어뜨린다는 점에서도 문제지만, 무엇보다 근로자의 노동 인격을 침해한다는 점에서 결코 간과할 수 없는 문제다. 직장괴롭힘에 대한 사회적 여론이 환기됨에 따라 많은 연구들이 진행되고, 구체적인 직장괴롭힘의 유형들이 체계화되고 있다. 이러한 유형 중 가장 근로자들에게 강한 심리적 압박감을 가하고 있는 것이 ‘가학적 인사관리’이다. 따돌림, 모욕, 명예훼손, 폭행 등 외견상으로 명백한 폭력 행위와는 달리 가학적 인사관리는 사용자가 정당한 인사권을 행사하는 양태를 띠기 때문에 직장괴롭힘으로서 인정받기 힘든 경우가 많다. 정당한 이유 없이 계속 업무에서 배제하거나, 업무상 필요 없는 행위를 반복적으로 시키는 지시, 그리고 업무와 관련 없는 시설로의 전보 명령 등을 예로 들 수 있다. 이러한 가학적 인사관리는 피해 근로자에게 모멸감과 공포감을 심어줄 뿐만 아니라 근로자 집단전체에게 공포감을 내면화하고 부조리에 둔감하게 하여 사용자에 대한 집단적 · 자발적 복종을 유도한다.BR 가학적 인사관리를 규제하기 위해서는 먼저 정확한 개념부터 설정해야 하는 바, 직장괴롭힘의 일반적 정의규정을 참조하여 “직장 내외에서 직장 내의 지위나 다수의 우월성을 이용하여 특정 근로자나 특정 근로자 집단을 대상으로 의식적 · 지속적 · 반복적으로 신체적 · 정신적 공격을 가하거나 소외시키는 일체의 행위” 중 하나로서 “조직 및 경영상 목적으로 인사 권한을 수단으로 한 것”으로 정립할 수 있다.BR 또한, 사용자 측은 가학적 인사관리가 정당한 인사권의 일환이며 이는 경영권에 기반한 것이라고 주장하기도 하는데, 경영권은 그 권리의 실체성조차 불투명하며 그것이 물적 시설이 아닌 인적 자원에게도 미치는지가 의심된다. 따라서 인사권이란 어디까지나 사용자와 근로자 간의 근로계약의 성립에 따른 계약상의 채무라고 볼 수 있고, 인사권이 남용되어 가학적 인사관리가 됨에는 사용자 측의 악의가 필요 없다.BR 법제적으로 가학적 인사관리를 포함한 직장괴롭힘을 막기 위해서는 특별법의 제정이 가장 효과적이라 생각한다. 재직 중인 근로자 외 채용절차 중인 구직자와 특수형태근로종사자까지 직장괴롭힘 방지의 보호를 받아야 하기 때문이다. 이러한 특별법 제정에는 많은 사회적 논의가 필요한 바 현행 법제의 보완으로는 「근로기준법」 내 별도의 ‘괴롭힘編’을 만들어 직장 내 성희롱과 직장괴롭힘을 동시에 규정하는 방법을 생각할 수 있으며,「근로기준법」제8조의 ‘폭행’의 개념을 ‘폭력’으로 확대하여 여러 가학적 행위를 금지할 수도 있다. 또한, 당장 일어나고 있는 직장괴롭힘을 피하기 위해 현행 「산업안전보건법」 제26조상의 ‘작업중지권’ 적용을 해석론으로 인정해주는 것도 제안한다.",

      "title": "Board 140 - Program Innovations Abstract Improving Unit Culture from the Ground Up - Empowering Staff to Make the Change (Submission #1432)",
      "abstract": "Introduction/Background One of the hardest things that an established organization faces is gaining buy-in when implementing a new policy, procedure or process.1 The reason for this is often due to many different facets. In general, an employee will experience a work related obstacle several times before taking the issue to their manager. If the issue is not a safety related issue then the complaint may not become a priority for the Manager to address until it is voiced multiple times. The same process happens when taken up the chain of command. This is where the buy-in and culture suffers. Not only will the process feel painstakingly slow to an employee, it will also leave an impression that their concerns are not relevant. When or if a solution is presented to the staff, it often has a negative impact and can appear to be worse than the initial issue. This is because the solution derives from someone that does not fully understand the process and purpose because they do not perform the work directly.1 The Results are often both crippling and costly to not only leadership but the organization. This is due to lack of organizational trust, low staff productivity or efficiency, poor job satisfaction which Results in decrease of staff retention.2 To overcome these detrimental issues, team training is often implemented sue to its proven success in changing the culture. Methods TeamSTEPPS3 is an evidence-based program created to address issues related to teamwork and communication. A key component to this program is the staff driven approach, leading from the bottom-up rather than top-down. The staff were empowered to make these change and assembled as the Change Team’ which typically consists of 8-14 multidisciplinary staff members who were chosen to support the unit change initiative. The group was given unit specific tools to increase teamwork and communication on the unit. Following training, the team facilitated staff training over a short period of time (e.g. six-day period). The entire unit staff were asked to attend one staff training session which includes a plus/delta discussion. Each session was comprised of five to eight multidiscipline staff members to allow for open discussion and improved role clarity. During the educational discussion, staff identified positive aspects of teamwork and communication as well as opportunities for improvement for their unit. The facilitator reinforced that the discussion was open and safe. No names or identifiers were attached to the feedback. Through a review process by the OhioHealth Learning (OHL) team, items are grouped into two-three main themes or categories with the trends for each of the main categories. From this information, a recommendation letter was created for the unit. The Change Team members, not management, were charged with identifying which project or items they addressed and a subcommittee consisting of unit staff were then chosen. The individual subcommittees not only set their own meeting schedules but they were charged with brainstorming for solutions to the identified topic. The unit Manager’s role in this process was to allow for process clarity and support when needed. Results: Conclusion By allowing staff to be empowered and lead change, they became invested in the organization. Staff learned to problem solve and think independently versus waiting or being disgruntled with leadership. Additionally, they have an increased awareness of the change process, increased ownership and accountability for their units success. Situation awareness also improved, resulting in a reduction of errors while allowing for task assistance. The open communication and crucial conversations created a direct approach to problem solving with coworkers, leading to an improved work/home life balance resulting in improving team unity. Ultimately resulting in job satisfaction and improved staff retention saving the organization money. References 1. Gillespie BM, Gwinner K, Fairweather N, Chaboyer W.

One can imagine a similar training sequence in the learning of a new motor skill such as driving a car. Initially the driver actively goes through a mental checklist, sometimes aloud, which includes verbal rehearsal, self-guidance, and sometimes appropriate self-reinforcement, especially when driving a stick-shift car. Three different psychometric tests were used to assess changes in behavioral and cognitive impulsivity during the pretreatment, posttreatment, and follow-up periods.

Events that break those streaks (e.g., an incorrect guess after a series of correct guesses) are more unexpected and, thus, held more responsible for overall outcomes. How these findings contribute to the contemporary understanding of responsibility judgments is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).",

      "title": "MOTOR PERFORMANCE OF CEREBRAL PALSIED CHILDREN AS A FUNCTION OF THEIR SUCCESS OR FAILURE IN ACHIEVING MATERIAL REWARDS1",
      "abstract": "The successful physical and occupational rehabilitation of cerebral palsied children is dependent primarily upon the efficient learning of motor skills. A mastery of motor fundamentals (i.e., pre-functional activities) and the acquisition of complex, integrated motor patterns (e.g., eating, dressing, washing, etc.) often represent important therapeutic goals. The development of such motor skills is influenced, to a large extent, by the child's interests and attitudes toward treatment. The importance of motivational variables is reflected, too, in the fact that long and arduous retraining procedures in which the handicapped child participates tend often to produce discouragement and a consequent lack of effort toward attaining treatment goals. Even prior to the inception of therapy, it frequently has been observed that many chronically handicapped children lack the drive and interest which are necessary for learning self-help activities. These observations emphasize the importance of understanding the influence of motivational factors on the motor performance of the cerebral palsied child. The present study sought to determine the effect of success and failure in securing material rewards on the cerebral palsied child's speed of performance of a pre-functional activity similar to those taught in the hospital's occupational therapy department. It was decided to use material rewards because such incentives had been found by other investigators to be successful in improving the verbal and motor behavior of non-handicapped children. Certain fairly consistent findings from these previous studies are as follows: I. The greater effectiveness of reward and reproof in facilitating performance as contrasted with non-incentive conditions (1, 2, 3, 5, 6). 2. The gradual decline in the effectiveness of repetitive, standardized",

      "title": "A CONCEPTUAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BASIS FOR RESEARCH IN THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEISURE",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT It is vogue to define leisure as a “state of mind” rather than time or activity. Subjective definitions make difficult the psychological study of leisure, though it appears imperative that the psychological assumptions underlying the leisure state be examined. Factors such as freedom of choice, intrinsic-extrinsic motivation, work/leisure attitudes, personality dispositions, et cetera, must be examined. One barrier to research is the failure to recognize the “leisure state” as both a permanent cognitive disposition (attitude) and a transient disposition (experience). Leisure “experience” is more amenable to psychological research techniques used in the laboratory. Leisure “attitudes” might best be examined in longitudinal studies. Operationalizing the leisure state has provided an additional barrier to research. A number of measures are discussed. To illustrate the approach an exploratory experiment examining the effects of freedom of choice and competitive motivation on the leisure “experience” derived from an activity is discussed. A time duration estimate scale, a situational memory test, and a mood checklist operationalized leisure “experience”. Subjects having no choice estimated significantly longer activity involvement for a standard time period than high choice subjects (p <. 05). Significant (p <. 01) effects for competitiveness and choice demonstrated that awareness of the immediate environment decreased as a function of greater competitiveness and choice in an activity.",

      "abstract": "Generally speaking, educational research has considerably progressed in recent time ; evaluation too. It is better and better understood that normative evaluation is not of great help to monitor learning. Need for achievement is a critical factor and the learner should be continuously informed of his situation in the domains of knowledge, skills and attitudes. The sources of learning difficulties must be diagnosed. Criterion-referenced testing and formative evaluation are the answer. Minimum competency testing is also at the order of the day. There is a better awareness of the superficiality of much achievement testing. It often happens that only one facet is tested. The theory of generalisability clarifies the issue. Performance testing is another issue. Among other things, it must be realized that multiple choice items have still a place in testing, specially in abstract subjects like mathematics or logics, but they must be geared on higher cognitive processes. Performance portfolios open new evaluation perspectives ; however, they are not necessarily free from bias or lack of representative As for direct observations of performances, they are often time consuming and lack of validity and reliability is not exceptional. In recent decades, major advances in cognitive psychology have been implemented. Some of the ways it should influence educational evaluation are indicated. A better dissemination of these innovations in school practice should be stimulated. Progress is achieved, but it is too slow as compared with the breath taking changes in our way of life and in technologies.",

      "abstract": "I think it is better to summarize some cognitive issues in relation to this subject; how we learn, how we should organize learning (instructions), knowledge, etc. before treating creativity and rationality. Is it, really, possible to consider creativity without any kind of involvement of the ability of problem solving? Do designers not solve a kind of problem while they ‘create’ an (conceptual) artifact? What kind of mental process is creativity? Is it a mental ability of physical nature only, or is it also a kind of constructed form what we might have built up through our lives because of our tendencies ever since our childhood? Have not we built up our present knowledge by experience, by intuition and by many other learning instructions? Do we use our rationality only to solve algorithmic problems or is creativity also, somehow, a quick, well constructed rationality? Maybe both are of the same the same type of intelligence but creativity is more mystical to explain and the other seems to be easier to clarify. What is it to be creative or rational in terms of mental process? What do a creative and a rational mental behavior look like? Do not we use (creative) methods that are rational as well as creative behavior? What might a creative method mean to us? I would like to give some examples from my teaching experience by hoping that it gives some hint about this issue. When I ask my students to make some analysis or design for a given task, actually, they use declarative, procedural and tacit knowledge as well as their intuition while trying to reach their creative design solutions. Every semester they produce mostly similar results in many ways but also somehow different from each other. Each student has a different background in some ways as well as similar ones since the media gives them the chance of immediate communication besides that of local experience. I would like to present some examples of my students’ work during the conference, which will reflect some of their rational and intuitive thinking within the global and regional effect. One of the human cognitive faculties is intuition, as we all know. Students are more successful when we set them free to use their intuition besides using declarative, procedural and tacit knowledge. In all fruitful creative design process, teachers should rationally, motivate them to activate all their mental abilities to employ but then by helping them to find out the constraints of the issues at hand, since otherwise students can be lost in the sea of chaotic trivial and indirect relevant variables. Finally, education should be rational enough to stimulate students to get trained in using mental leaps, which goes with the analogical reasoning, for a creative learning process in the widest sense including how to achieve creative design solutions. They should learn to use all their abilities simultaneously to enjoy the synchronic effect of it.",

The present research tested how social power predicts prefactual thought when its benefits are clear versus ambiguous. Power enhances flexible behavior adaptation and action tendencies—presumably without much forethought. We therefore proposed that power diminishes prefactual thought, unless the situation suggests that such thought is adaptive (i.e., could benefit performance). Power-holders indeed generated less prefactuals than the powerless (Experiments 1 and 2), but only if benefits for performance were ambiguous rather than clear (Experiment 3). These findings indicate that social context factors related to confidence affect prefactual thought, and that power-holders’ flexible adaptation to the situation sometimes elicits inaction (i.e., prefactual thought) rather than spontaneous action.",

      "abstract": "Talk is one of the primary ways people have of learning. The question that must be asked is What is it that is being learned? One generally accepted notion is that through talking and interacting with others, people learn about self, about others, and about the world. Recently, however, other types of learning have been identified. For example, through participating in a variety of communicative situations, people learn conversational rules for when to talk, where, with whom, in what ways, for how long, and for what purposes (Hymes, 1974). In other wors, by taking part in conversations, people acquire information about the topic of the conversation and about how to do conversation. This view of talk does not provide a complete picture of what is occurring, however. In any communicative event, people also make visible to others how they have read the requirements for responding and for participating. That is, by the content of their responses and their ways of providing information (the forms of the response), they show how they have interpreted what they heard. One important factor that influences how people interpret conversational expectations and decide how to participate is the fact that how one talks and what one talks about is culturally patterned (Gumperz, 1982). In other words, people learn to talk in ways that match the talk in their homes and communities, and different communities have different ways of speaking (e.g., ways of",

      "abstract": "The paper considers the concept of “chronological age”, approaches to its understanding, and features of use. The leading psychological characteristics of the period of adulthood – early, middle, and late – are outlined. It is noted that the period of adulthood (or maturity) is the longest phase of ontogenesis (in developed countries it is 3⁄4 of the human life), which tends to achieve the highest development of physical, intellectual, and spiritual abilities of the individual. Signs of adulthood are given, namely: other nature of development, less related to physical growth and rapid cognitive improvement; the ability to react, respond to changes, and successfully adapt to new conditions, constructively resolve contradictions and difficulties; overcoming addiction and the ability to take responsibility for oneself and others; certain character traits (firmness, moderation, reliability, honesty, ability to empathize, etc.); social and cultural guidelines (roles, relationships, etc.) for the success and timeliness of development in adulthood.The hypothesis about the influence of the age category on the course of axiopsychological projection of life achievements of an individual in the period of adulthood – early, middle, and late – is tested and confirmed.It was stated that the study involved 239 people, of whom 90 (38 %) were respondents of early adulthood – students of 4-5 courses majoring in “Primary Education”, 86 (36 %) – respondents of secondary, and 63 (26 %) – late adults – primary school teachers working in general secondary education institutions of Chernivtsi and Chernivtsi region.Based on the results of the empirical study, differences in the determinants of the axiopsychological design of life achievements of the individual by age were established. It was found that respondents of late adulthood better assess their psychological age in contrast to their younger colleagues – representatives of early and middle adulthood; they are also distinguished by a better indicator of subjective life, they are more optimistic, seek new knowledge, have a higher level of self-esteem and social self-efficacy, and better build a strategy of their own lives. The regularity is revealed: from the period of middle to the period of late adulthood, instrumental-subjective abilities acquire special significance in axiopsychological projection of life achievements of the person.",

      "abstract": "The supervisory relationship in counseling is one in which the student and supervisor are brought together to achieve certain professional purposes. It is a relationship that exists within the framework of a learning situation in which the supervisor's main function is that of teaching and enabling and the student's that of learning and becoming able. In other words, the emphasis and focus of supervision is on the tasks to be mastered, while the relationship is the vehicle or means by which the teaching and mastery of learning are to be achieved. The idea that a counselor who is knowledgeable and competent as a practitioner is, ipso facto, capable of teaching what he knows and practices is a fallacious one. The counseling supervisor must be able to give up the security of his skills as a practitioner and take on a new function, must learn to communicate knowledge and skills to others, adapt to differences in students' learning patterns and styles of helping, differentiate between situational anxieties and neurotically fixed anxiety, etc. Just as a situation of change calls forth in some measure for all of us earlier ways of adaptation, the learning and change necessitated by the assumption of a supervisory role may involve a repetition of old patterns of behavior. Needless to say, the repeating of the past pertains even more strongly to the counseling student, the beginner, who is the major learner in the supervisory situation. In this paper, I should like to focus not on the supervisor's role, but on the functioning of the beginning student and specifically on issues in his learning situation that may involve emotional separation from the past.",

      "title": "The principle of employability as a fundamental tool for managing people with disabilities and/or vulnerabilities",
      "abstract": "Introduction. Employability is a set of conditions—skills, understanding, and personal attributes (including physical and mental health)—that make individuals more likely to perform a particular job and succeed in their assigned occupations, benefiting themselves, their coworkers, the community, and the business and social economy.Disability refers to a person who has a physical or mental impairment that has a substantial and medium- to long-term negative effect on their ability to perform normal daily activities, including work.The aim of those involved in employability management is to ensure its applicability to people with disabilities as defined by the social security system or by the work suitability requirements/restrictions formulated by occupational physicians. This objective must be achieved through a road map of practical and feasible solutions to enable all workers to be truly included in the work process, ensuring well-being and productivity.Objectives. Anyone with physical, mental, and/or cognitive limitations or who is otherwise diverse (including personal characteristics of the workforce such as age, sex, gender identity, and ethnic origin) must be allowed to work safely and productively by reducing occupational risks and eliminating the obstacles that stand in the way of this project.The objective should be achieved by designing and implementing workstations that comply with threshold limits for physical work, cognitive and mental demands, and by early detection of physical and mental functional deficits in work capacity.The first step is a proactive preventive approach to avoid having people with limitations and/or disabilities as a result of work activity. The second step is reactive and positive management of workers with disabilities/prescriptions and work fitness limitations.In fact, not all workers can achieve the same productivity as a person without a disability or impairment, even with technical or organizational ergonomic measures, due to the high level of disability. These workers must also be included in the employability management process.The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, adopted in New York on December 13, 2006, uses “reasonable accommodation” as a synonym for employability. Reasonable accommodation consists of “necessary and appropriate modifications and adjustments” to ensure “the right to work of persons with disabilities on an equal basis with others.” . The United Nations' goal is to have “decent work” for all people.The principles established by the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union on April 11, 2013, can be extended globally and to the extent of “reasonable accommodation”/ employability and could be applied, taking into account local legislation, not only to those who are recognized as disabled and handicapped by specific public bodies in accordance with the legislation of each country, but also to any worker suffering from a condition that compromises their full fitness for work, regardless of whether the disability is certified. Disability should not be assessed solely on the basis of the diagnosis of diseases, but by considering the overall residual functional capacity of each person and using standardized and validated questionnaires such as the ICF short version.Results. There are several critical issues to be addressed in order to achieve a common global approach to managing employability:Different legislation in different countries Resistance to accepting workers with severe disabilities or prescriptions/limitations that significantly limit their fitness for work (even if only in the short term) Different approaches are used in different countries for risk assessment.Different tools are used to assess the risk associated with ‘ergonomic problems’.Different criteria adopted to formulate the prescription/restriction by the occupational physician.Consequently, the difficulties are:Adopting a common strategy to map the risks associated with workstations.Having a standardized approach to link the workstation analysis phase with the phase relating to the worker's specific limitations in order to proceed with work reintegration. Properly managing the principles of employability.The employability of people requires awareness, knowledge, and commitment on the part of managers and leaders. They are key stakeholders in the efficiency of the employability management process. For this reason, one of the main issues is to provide and expand the culture of integration among leaders and managers to ensure that work is adapted to people with disabilities and specific physical/mental needs.The approach to correct employability management is summarized in the flowchart below. IMAGE By following the process shown in the flowchart, it is possible to identify certain priorities.For the Worker/Restriction Phase:All restrictions assigned to a worker to safeguard their health must be standardized using a code that can be linked to each workstation (at least country by country). Standardize the meaning of work requirements and restrictions between different sites/countries using a common language.The Workstation phase requires:Risk exposure data must be coded (chemical agents, vibrations, biomechanical overload) to map each workstation. The coding of risk exposure depends on the strategy adopted for risk assessment and must be linkable to the worker's restriction.The allocation phase will be the result of an analysis of the compatibility between the results of the cross-evaluation of the work phase and the workstation phase; in the event of incompatibility, it will be necessary to analyze how to adapt (if possible) the workstation with engineering or administrative solutions.The assessment of compatibility between the disability or chronic condition and the workplace can be expressed through a work plan defined in agreement with the worker's manager (team leader, supervisor, human resources member) based on the occupational physician's recommendations, supported by ergonomists in the event of ergonomic issues, and considering the health/ propensity of the worker, who modulates/avoids work activities/tasks that could be harmful or aggravate the worker's health conditions.Only if it is not possible to adapt the workplace or identify a personal work plan will it be necessary to identify a new job/work position. This is because it is necessary to consider the difficulty, often associated with the lack of guarantees of maintaining productivity on the one hand and acceptability/professional satisfaction on the other.Following the process shown in the flowchart, it is possible to identify some priorities.For the Worker/Restriction Phase:All restrictions assigned to a worker to safeguard their health must be standardized using a code that can be linked to each workstation (at least country by country).

      "title": "A PRELIMINARY STUDY OF DEVELOPMENTAL TRENDS IN SOCIEMPATHY ACCURACY OF PERCEPTION OF OWN AND OTHERS' SOCIOMETRIC STATUS1",
      "abstract": "Sociempathy is a form of social perception which refers to an individual's awareness of his own and others' sociometric status in a given group of which he is a member. Among other properties this content of awareness may be more or less accurate, i.e., may correspond more or less to the actual situation with respect to sociometric status depending on sociempathic ability. Hence from an operational standpoint, a person may be said to have good sociempathic ability if he can accurately predict the relative degree of acceptance or rejection accorded the component members of the group (including himself) by the other group members. In general, the few available studies we have in the area of sociempathy have dealt with the sociempathic ability of teachers (i.e., their ability to predict the sociometric status of their pupils), and have ignored the pupils' awareness of their own status and that of their classmates. As a result, at least two large gaps remain in our knowledge of the development of social perception in children: What does the growth curve for sociempathic ability look like? What are some of the determinants and consequences of individual differences in sociempathic ability? The present study represents an exploratory attempt at devising a method for measuring various developmental aspects of sociempathy, i.e., growth curves, changes with age in the distribution of ratings and predictions of status, and teachers' sociempathic ability.",

      "abstract": "Counting Sheep is a Good Way to Get to Sleep, but the Occasional Aardvark Will Wake You Up: How a Salient Event Improves Performance Bella Z. Veksler (zafrib@rpi.edu) Wayne D. Gray (grayw@rpi.edu) Department of Cognitive Science, 110 8 th St. Troy, NY 12180 USA Abstract attention begins to wander. You begin thinking about the upcoming football game or what color to paint your living room or, worse yet, you start dozing off. Now imagine that all of a sudden, WHAM! Something unexpected happens that grabs your attention so that you become engaged in the lecture once more. This external stimulus is separable (not integral) to the semantic content of the lecture or to the current goals of task performance. Yet, somehow this occasional aardvark thrusts itself into your attention and by so doing manages to increase performance long after it has vanished. Prior work on vigilance decrements has established the performance decline effect but has made little progress on countering it. The current study begins an effort to determine how to alleviate the waning attention that results from prolonged time on monotonous tasks. We ask whether a small and unexpected change in a stimulus occurring far into a long monotonous task could somehow increase attention and thereby reduce the vigilance decrement effect. Sustaining attention is a problem many of us face in various settings from the workplace to school. Sustaining attention is often crucial for good performance. Vigilance decrement refers to a decline in task performance as time on task increases. The current study induces a vigilance decrement across 2000 trials of a monotonous task. In this study each trial is composed of one target and one distracter presented to the participant and the participant’s goal is to determine if the target is above or below the distracter. In the control condition, both stimuli are always presented in black font. For the experimental condition, on trial 1200 and 1900 the target is presented in red font. There are no other differences between conditions. This minor, task irrelevant change suffices to reduce the vigilance decrement relative to the control condition on all subsequent trials. We dub this phenomenon the Aardvark Effect. Keywords: vigilance, sustained attention, alertness, performance, stimulus salience, oddball paradigm, boredom Introduction Sustaining attention in monotonous tasks is crucial in many areas of the workplace and in school. Because often times attention is fleeting, we would want to be able to formally quantify those instances in which attention is waning. Along the same lines, knowing which stimuli are capable of attracting and sustaining one’s attention and improving performance in vigilance-type tasks is crucial in many domains. The vigilance decrement for perceptual-motor detection and discrimination tasks is well established by over a half century of research (Bakan, 1955; Jerison & Pickett, 1963; Mackworth, 1948). It is defined as the slowing of reaction times and/or the decrease in accuracy over time on task. This decrement typically occurs about 30-45 minutes into the task (Mackworth, 1948) and is aggravated when the tasks are especially monotonous and do not require a great deal of cognitive processing (Adams, Humes, & Stenson, 1962; Adams, Stenson, & Humes, 1961). There have been several theories postulating why such a decrement occurs, citing differences between controlled and automatic processing of information, decreases in sensitivity or criterion changes as per signal detection theory, decrease in motivation, and fatigue (Fisk & Schneider, 1981; Frankmann & Adams, 1962; Jerison & Pickett, 1963; Pattyn & Soetens; Scott, 1957; Williges, 1969). The problem of vigilance decrement can be extended to real world tasks that are not typically thought of as vigilance tasks. For example, imagine you are sitting in class listening to the lecture and after twenty-five to thirty minutes your Background Much of the work on vigilance began in the mid-1900’s, driven, as much research is, by an applied military problem (Mackworth, 1948). Radar operators often times had to monitor radar screens for critical signals for many hours without rest. It was found that their performance in detecting critical signals worsened the more time they spent on task. Researchers were called in to study the optimal time on task that radar operators could sustain a passable level of detection performance. Mackworth approached this problem by manipulating the duration any one operator spent on task. The task was simply to monitor a clock hand that rotated 360 degrees every minute, like a second hand typically does. The critical signal to be detected was the movement of the hand two clicks instead of the usual one per second. This double movement occurred 12 times every 20 minutes. He found that operators who did the study in half-hour spells with half hour breaks over the 2 hour period exhibited less decrement that those who remained on vigil the full two hours. This suggests, perhaps not surprisingly, that injecting breaks into a monotonous vigilance task helps maintain alertness. Mackworth ran another condition in which participants on a 2-hour vigil of watching the clock also had to monitor a telephone message that would give them additional instructions. In fact, only once did the phone ring – at the end of the first hour of watch – and the message was to “do even better for the rest of the test.” The finding for this group was",

In particular, cognitive effort is thought to be closely related to the assessment of cognitive control’s costs. I argue here that the construct of cognitive effort, as it is deployed in cognitive psychology and neuroscience, is problematically unclear. The result is that talk of cognitive effort may paper over significant disagreement regarding the nature of cognitive effort, and its key functions for cognitive control. I highlight key points of disagreement, and several open questions regarding what causes cognitive effort, what cognitive effort represents, cognitive effort’s relationship to action, and cognitive effort’s relationship to consciousness. I also suggest that pluralism about cognitive effort – that cognitive effort may manifest as a range of intentional or non-intentional actions the function of which is to promote greater success at paradigmatic cognitive control tasks – may be a fruitful and irenic way to conceive of cognitive effort. Finally, I suggest that recent trends in work on cognitive control suggests that we might fruitfully conceive of cognitive effort as one key node in a complex network of mental value, and that studying this complex network may illuminate the nature of cognitive control, and the role of consciousness in cognitive control’s proper functioning.",

      "title": "Il fenomeno della resilience",
      "abstract": "The study of the effects of child mistreatment, including sexual abuse, neglect and physical abuse, suggest that the interaction between exposure to adverse experience and risk or protective factors produces a variety of phenotypic expressions; this variety includes both individuals with severe psychopathology and individuals seeming well-adapted. In substance, positive adaptation means competence with respect to behavioral, social and/or cognitive functioning (despite past or present maltreatment) and well-adapted individuals are considered resilient. This adjective is derived from resilience, term that has been improperly used as synonym of invulnerability, stress-resistance, adaptability. Reviews of literature show that resilience is currently considered a dynamic and multidimensional developmental process involving positive adaptation within the context of significant adversity. There are several variables that influence, in a positive or negative manner, the development of resilience: protective and risks factors. Investigators have identified a triad of protective factors: 1) dispositional / temperamental attributes of the child, including higher cognitive ability, positive self-esteem, internal locus of control for good events, external locus of control for abuse (or external attribution of blame), spirituality, ego-resiliency, coping strategies; 2) familial cohesion; 3) extrafamilial support. The three elements of this triad often collaborate in determining resilience, in opposition to risks factors usually coexisting in maltreatment situations (as low socio-economic level or maternal depression). In research on resilience some methodological features are more important in regard to data collection: all the sources of data, as parents', teachers' and peers' ratings, with the help of intelligence and achievement tests and grades in school, but also children’s self-reports.",

Motivation theory and research have traditionally, if tacitly, sought to explain decision‐making (e.g., What to prioritize? How much to invest?) based on goal‐specific value. But several goal‐related decision regularities are not easily explained by accounting for goal‐specific value alone, such as online workers choosing a lower‐paying assignment (over a higher‐paying assignment) if it allows them to complete the last step in a sequence and college students electing to do more work sooner (rather than less work later) if it provides them closure. Accounting for goal‐generic value—such as the positive experiences of purpose, progress, closure, and accomplishment—offers additional insight into people's decisions. More generally, auditing goals in a way that accounts for both goal‐specific value and goal‐generic value is crucial for understanding goal pursuits.",

      "abstract": "As a physiologist interested in contemplative practice and meditation I have enjoyed the opportunity of lecturing to students engaged in the study of contemplation. My pedagogic role was to expose them to some of what we know of the biological phenomena that are or may be taking place during various meditative states — explicating for them the details of how the human body actually works. In the course of working with students and faculty engaged in meditation I formulated the following questions relating biological science and contemplative practice: What should a practitioner or a teacher of meditation know about basic human anatomy and physiology? Is it necessary for someone engaging in contemplative practice to understand how the human organism is actually put together and how it works? Will knowledge of how the various organs work with one another enhance one's ability to meditate or can we dispense with this information and suffer no consequences in our practice? The fundamental importance of somatic or physical phenomena in meditative practice (for example in control of breath, heart rate, or metabolism) and most people's lack of understanding of basic human anatomy and physiology led me to answer yes to all of these questions. In this paper I outline the physiological knowledge and particular insights I have found useful for enhancing a person's understanding of how we breathe, how we regulate our heart rate, and how we control our metabolic rate in 'control' or non-meditative states and the kinds of changes we might expect in a meditating subject. I link what is perhaps the fundamental principle of physiology, the concept of 'homeostasis', with the balance and integration of the body systems sought by people engaged in contemplation. Mind-body harmony or an enhanced awareness of this linkage between the mind and the body can, in my opinion, be more fully realized when coupled with an understanding of what Hippocrates called, 'the nature of the body', that is, what the body actually does and how it does it.",

Specifically, the purpose of the study is to investigate the stuttering experiences and the perception of adults who stutter in their twenties. Methods: In-depth interviews with 6 adults who stutter in their twenties have been administered and analyzed by the grounded theory approach, which is one of the qualitative research techniques. Results: Nine significant subthemes and three main themes were drawn from the final analyses.

      "title": "Overcoming WOCNCB Test Anxiety",
      "abstract": "Introduction Test anxiety is defined as perceived arousal, reported worry, self-denigrating thoughts, tension, and reports of somatic symptoms in examinations or similar evaluative situations.1 It is common and can develop for a number of reasons. Test anxiety may be a reminder of previous negative experiences, lack of confidence, fear of failure, or anxiety over employment linked to successful certification. Factors likely to aggravate test anxiety include poor study habits, inadequate preparation, and feeling overwhelmed by the amount of information that must be mastered. Although some degree of apprehension is helpful when preparing for a certification examination, excessive anxiety can prompt negative thoughts and frustration. These distressing emotions may result in “going blank” when trying to recall important information, misreading questions, or changing correct answers to incorrect. Physical reactions related to test anxiety gone awry include heart palpitations, nausea, and sweaty palms. With some simple strategies, high levels of anxiety can be controlled, resulting in improved test performance. The Knowledge Base, Anxiety control, Test–Taking Skills2 framework was developed to assist new nursing graduates to pass the NCLEX exam. This same skill set can be useful in assisting the WOC nurse in preparing for the WOCNCB Certification Exams. Knowledge is enhanced by developing a study plan based on your assessment of your own personal strengths and weaknesses. We recommend beginning the least familiar components of the examination. For instance, if you work in a wound care clinic and also see ostomy patients, your strongest skill set is most likely those that have pouching difficulties. So, begin your ostomy review with those types of ostomies that are unfamiliar to you, such as continent or pediatric diversions. We also recommend using a standardized practice examination to determine areas of need. The WOCNCB's Self-Assessment Exam (SAE) is available on the WOCNCB Web site (http://www.wocncb.org/about/). It provides multiple-choice questions that reflect the content areas, level of difficulty, and format of the actual examination. Practice examinations are accessible through any computer with Internet access. The SAE is constructed to give the test-taker feedback on all answer options and thus is an invaluable tool in developing a study plan on the basis of identified problem areas. Multiple strategies can be used to control anxiety. Self-awareness can be pivotal in managing test anxiety. Maintaining a positive attitude and avoiding negative thoughts about your performance are powerful tools to overcome testing anxiety. We have observed that getting a good night's sleep and eating a healthy diet contribute to a feeling of well-being that reduces the negative effects of text anxiety. Familiarity with types of questions used on the certification examination helps the tester feel more confident. Here is where the SAE is particularly helpful. It identifies the type of question and offers insights on correct and incorrect options. Three types of questions are used on the WOCNCB certification exams: recall, application, and analysis. Refer to Amy Schaffner's 2009 Certification Feature column (volume 36, issue 3, pages 327-329) for a more detailed explanation of these question types. 1.

J Nurs Educ. 2008;47(4):183–185. Question 1: A 70-year-old patient with a new ileostomy due to a ruptured diverticula returns from physical therapy complaining of lethargy, muscle cramps, and abdominal cramping. Past medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. The WOC nurse understands that it is important to teach the patient to: Take blood pressure medication as prescribed Increase fluid intake to 10 to 12 8-ounce glasses per day Eat foods that are high in potassium Check blood glucose before and after physical therapy Answer: B. Lethargy, muscle cramps, abdominal cramping, increased thirst, decreased urine output, and dry mouth are all common symptoms of dehydration. A person with an ileostomy is at risk for dehydration because of the loss of the colon's absorptive function. Exercise can compound this risk so it is imperative that the patient is taught to recognize the symptoms of dehydration, and how to prevent dehydration with an adequate fluid intake of 10 to 12 eight-ounce glasses of liquid per day. This question tests an understanding of potential complications with an ileostomy and applied education for prevention of those complications. Distractors A. Symptoms of hypotension include lethargy, weakness, fatigue, and dizziness, but there is nothing to suggest that this patient has either under- or overmedicated with his antihypertensives. Similarity to the symptoms of dehydration can be confusing, but there is no indication in this scenario that the patient is overmedicated with antihypertensives. C. Eating high-potassium foods may be important if the patient is not taking a potassium-sparing diuretic, but this is not noted in the question. D. Symptoms of hypoglycemia include shakiness, diaphoresis, lethargy, irritability, restlessness, and possibly disorientation. Although similar to the symptoms described here, there is no abdominal pain or muscle cramping associated with hypoglycemia. Content Outline Number: 020405; Question Type: Analysis 1.

Question 2: A patient is admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain, cramps, and bloating. The WOC nurse is consulted to mark the patient for an ileostomy in the right lower quadrant. The colonoscopy reveals small lesions of mucosa and submucosa that balloon out through the muscularis layer of the intestinal wall. The WOC nurse knows that this finding is consistent with: Ulcerative colitis Diverticulitis Crohn's disease Diverticulosis Answer: D. Diverticulosis is a condition in which pouches of intestinal lining balloon out through weakened areas of the intestinal wall. The pouches are called diverticula. Some people may experience crampy pain or discomfort in the lower abdomen, bloating, and constipation with this condition. Distractors A. Ulcerative colitis is characterized by edematous, granular, and erythematous smooth bowel mucosa with pinpoint ulcerations. B. When diverticula become inflamed and/or infected, diverticulitis is suspected. The most common symptom of diverticulitis is severe abdominal pain that comes on suddenly. The intensity of the pain can fluctuate. A person may experience cramping, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, or a change in bowel habits. C. Crohn's disease is characterized by focal, discontinuous, irregular-shaped ulcerations predisposing to strictures and fistulas. Content Outline Number: 020100; Question Type: Recall 1.

Question 3: A patient with bladder cancer has a radical cystectomy with construction of an orthotopic neobladder. Incontinence can be a problem postoperatively, so the WOC nurse teaches the patient that the one of the best ways to prevent this is by: Performing pelvic floor muscle (PFM) exercises up to 2 to 3 times daily Clean intermittent catheterization Irrigating the neobladder to reduce mucous Drinking enough fluids (2-3 L) to dilute the urine Answer: A. The postoperative patient with an orthotopic neobladder must first learn to recognize the sensation of bladder filling. This may be difficult, especially at night, so incontinence, especially at night, is common. Patients then must learn how to regain control over urination. Because the orthotopic neobladder lacks the contractility of a normal bladder, patients are taught to relax and bear down. Correctly identifying and relaxing the PFMs will facilitate emptying. Conversely, learning to strengthen and squeeze the PFMs can prevent accidental leakage. Distractors B. Clean intermittent catheterization may be performed postoperatively and sometimes long term to facilitate emptying and help evacuate mucous. C. Irrigation may be done to prevent blockage from mucous, always short term and sometimes long term, but is not the primary method of preventing incontinence. D. Adequate fluid intake is important to reduce the risk of urinary tract infection and constipation postoperatively, but this is also not the best answer related to incontinence.

      "title": "Desarrollo de los procesos atencionales",
      "abstract": "El desarrollo de la atencion es esencial para el de otros procesos cognitivos asimismo es un indicador para predecir el nivel cognitivo en la ninez. En especial se ha comprobado tanto en ninos como en adultos, que a mayor capacidad de atencion mejor es la ejecucion en las tareas cognitivas. La mayoria de las investigaciones sobre la atencion han tendido a centrarse en la atencion visual, a pesar de la importancia que la atencion auditiva tiene para la adquisicion de conocimientos linguisticos, entre otros. Sin embargo no se puede explicar el desarrollo de la atencion auditiva basandose en los mecanismos atencionales visuales, por lo que se hace necesario estudiar el desarrollo de la atencion tanto en modalidad visual como auditiva. Las pruebas para la evaluacion de la atencion de las que se dispone en la actualidad, se centran, la mayor parte de ellas, en un unico aspecto de la atencion o en una unica modalidad sensorial. Al no estar basadas en un mismo modelo teorico los resultados obtenidos en estas investigaciones no son comparables. Por lo tanto, uno de los objetivos en este estudio ha sido el desarrollo de cuatro pruebas para la evaluacion de la atencion sostenida y selectiva tanto en la modalidad visual como auditiva. Estas pruebas se han elaborado partiendo del modelo clinico de la atencion de Sohlberg y Mateer. Para su diseno se ha tenido en cuenta los intereses de la poblacion a la que van dirigidas asi como que fueran tareas ecologicas. Se ha evaluado la atencion sostenida y selectiva de 200 ninos entre 3 y 10 anos. Los datos obtenidos muestran que el desarrollo de la atencion sigue un proceso discontinuo salvo en el caso de la atencion selectiva auditiva cuyo desarrollo forma un continuo. Por otra parte, se observa que el desarrollo de la atencion depende de la modalidad sensorial, siendo la modalidad auditiva previa a la visual. En cuanto al tipo de atencion se comprueba que el desarrollo de la atencion sostenida auditiva se produce con anterioridad al de la selectiva, alcanzando, a los 10 anos, niveles de ejecucion practicamente adultos. Los resultados obtenidos son de gran utilidad para la comprension de trastornos como el trastorno por deficit de atencion e hiperactividad. Asimismo posibilita, no solo la realizacion de un diagnostico diferencial mas preciso, sino tambien la elaboracion de programas de intervencion.",

      "abstract": "There is ample evidence that emotions affect performance. Positive emotions can improve performance, while negative ones can diminish it. For example, the fears induced by the possibility of failure or of negative evaluations have physiological consequences (shaking, loss of concentration) that may impair performance in sports, on stage, or at school. There is also ample evidence that individuals have distorted recollection of past events and distorted attributions of the causes of success or failure. Recollection of good events or successes is typically easier than recollection of bad ones or failures. Successes tend to be attributed to intrinsic aptitudes or effort, while failures are attributed to bad luck. In addition, these attributions are often reversed when judging the performance of others. The objective of this paper is to incorporate the phenomenon that emotions affect performance into an otherwise standard decision theoretic model and show that in a world where performance depends on emotions, biases in information processing enhance welfare.",

By holding semi-structured interviews with 12 people working with elderly care qualitative data were obtained and later analyzed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). A range of different thoughts and attitudes towards documentation were found, some that could facilitate documentation, but also some that could hinder a good documentation practice. Also different insecurities were found such as lack of experience/knowledge about documentation, technology or language. Colleagues are a great resource for helping and educating personnel but it might be hard for them to explain some things they do if they aren’t aware of how they do it. It might also take time to readjust to new procedures such as a common information structure, especially for the experienced workers that have formed routines for how to do things.

It reflects the belief that psychology belongs to the natural sciences—instead of the cultural realm of research. Psychology offers no exact and clearly definable concepts, therefore mathematics are principally out of the play—or at least much reduced in their possibilities.2. A test-result is supposedly built on a previous test-validation against a convincing and exact criterion. No such criteria are to be found in the psychological field.3. The interpreting and commentating psychologist is the central event. Therefore the education and training of psychologists necessarily has to stress courses in personal contact, interview and characterology.4. The problem is accentuated when the psychologists today are confronted with the task of giving an advice in connection with the admission of students to the teachers colleges and to similar branches of academical training.

A social worker began to resist the expectations placed upon them where they felt that they conflicted with their own identity. In some situations, the consequences for feeling ashamed and guilty of one’s actions outweighed the consequences for potentially being shamed by people within the organisation. Not being able to cope with what one had done led social workers to resist the pressures and expectations designed to direct their actions in a particular manner. In some situations, this required action that compromised the organisational expectations, forgoing any desire for praise and acceptance, yet still complied with the minimum standards to avoid being shamed. In other situations, the social workers sought to conceal actions that they felt were right but defied the organisational expectations. In still other situations, it was considered necessary to challenge the pressures and expectations to influence action that they considered inappropriate or immoral and avoid feeling ashamed of their actions. Such acts of resistance provided greater opportunities for relational engagement, recognising both social workers and parents as human, with individual strengths and struggles.",

      "title": "A Importância da atençäo na aprendizagem de habilidades motoras",
      "abstract": "According to Fitts & Posner (1967), during a motor skill learning an individual will pass through three stages: cognitive, associative and autonomous. Among several characteristics of each stage, one important change due to practice occurs over the attention process. First, in the cognitive stage, the individual does not know where and what to look for in order to select relevant information, putting a lot of stress over the attention mechanisms and therefore resulting in inconsistent performance. Then after a period of practice, he will make a transition to the second stage, associative. The individual is able to maintain a steady performance and to detect some errors. Attention requirements are much lower in this stage. After a lot of practice, he will reach the third stage, where performance is accomplished automatically, with very little attention effort. The individual is able to identify and correct his errors as well as redirect his focus of attention to other relevant aspects of the performance. His performance is now very consistent. An example of the transition between the learning stages is a child learning how to dribble a basketball, starting from a static movement which she needs to look at the ball, passing to dribble while moving in all directions until she is able to dribble in several ways and at the same time she observes the team mates and adversaries during a game. The transition to automaticity may occur naturally, however the necessary time to occur will depend on the amount of practice and the complexity level of the task. Even though it will occur as a function of practice, it is important that teachers and coaches know the differences among children and adults in using selective attention strategies, speed of information processing and the use of control processes to process and store information, which can increase learning difficulty. Knowing this information, we will be able to create an environment to facilitate learning by decreasing the needs of attention through the use of cognitive strategies",

Pero tambien, frente al violentamiento del que son objeto, mencionan acciones que muestran la posibilidad de resistir, por lo que se podria pensar que no necesariamente los procesos de pauperizacion deben ser acompanados de empobrecimiento de la subjetividad, sino que la posibilidad de resistir e instituir se encuentra en tension con otros modos mas ligados a la alienacion. A partir de los sentidos que insisten en los diferentes discursos de las docentes se realizo una categorizacion, no excluyente, que permite mostrar posibles modos subjetivos: posicionamientos subjetivos con posibilidad de instituir; posicionamientos subjetivos que ponen en evidencia la necesidad de utilizar mecanismos adaptativos que les permiten continuar con su tarea, no mostrando posibilidad de instituir cambios; y modos subjetivos ligados a la alienacion.

From the senses that insist on the different speeches of teachers a categorization was realized, not exclusively, and allows to show possible subjective manners: subjective positioning with possibility of instituting; subjective positioning that put in evidence the need of using adaptive mechanisms that allow them to continue with their task, not showing the possibility of instituting changes; and subjective manners tied to the alienation.

      "abstract": "Tanto en la vida personal como en la comunitaria, nos vemos en situaciones que nos interpelan y nos exigen tomar decisiones. Algunas son rutinarias, otras son extraordinarias. Mientras que unas tienen poco impacto en el contexto, otras acarrean consecuencias importantes y a largo plazo. La mayoria de las personas creen que las grandes se toman en soledad, de a una y como respuesta definitiva al problema. Suponemos que hay un experto en tomar decisiones y delegamos en el o ella toda la responsabilidad, sea por la decision en si como por las consecuencias que acarrea. Sin embargo, en las organizaciones se detectan con mas frecuencia los sintomas que alertan sobre algo que no anda bien. Esta situacion nos interpela, nos interroga y nos fuerza a la accion. Existe la creencia de que los problemas son malos y por eso hay que resolverlos. Nuestra postura es que como humanos, nos caracterizamos por ser solucionadores de problemas. De hecho, al profesional se le paga por resolver problemas y no, (como muchos estudiantes creen) por la cantidad de materias aprobadas o por las calificaciones obtenidas. Esto explica por que muchos profesionales consiguen, inventan y mantienen su trabajo mientras que muchos graduados no trabajan en el area para la que se formaron durante tantos anos.",

It selects certain events or objects in the environment to focus on and maintains focus on the object of interest while information provided by that object is processed. Additionally, while attention is focused on one object, shifts in attention to distracters are inhibited. These aspects of attention show major developmental change throughout infancy.",

      "abstract": "All relationships could be described in terms of the coordinations and conflicts between competing needs for attention and the mechanisms utilized to seek this goal. In this article, I introduce the initialism AGM (Attention-getting Mechanism) to refer to an interpersonal style or particular behavior or constellation of behaviors that one adopts and displays publicly that is unhealthy, repetitively counterproductive and ultimately harmful to self and/or others. Delineated from socially- and personally- productive modes of seeking attention, self-defeating AGMs categorize across varied spectra, from subtle and seemingly inhibited, to blatant, excessive, or frankly pathological. They arise in response to trauma and psychological disturbance and, as such, are the outcome of enduring deficits in getting appropriate and sufficient attention. I record the evolution of my thinking and doing, over the course of leading two group sessions, spaced several months apart, regarding dilemmas in getting attention. The first drew me to the topic, and, unexpectedly, stimulated personal associations and remembrances, which centered on a cumulative childhood trauma organized around the term, “AGM.” I approached the second session better equipped to understand the proceedings, and to connect my ideas to current diagnostic criteria, technical considerations, clinical research, and metapsychological theory.",

Methods: regarding our method, we made use of a qualitative research, which has been carried out at the Home Care Service of Belo Horizonte. The data has been collected through interviews performed with all the 7 caregivers and 6 healthcare practitioners. All the info has been analyzed under the scope of the the discourse analysis research method. Results: the caregiver acts with his/her heart, he/she listens and looks very carefully and attentively. Care is characterized by an intense and permanent process of conflict between the duty due to the assingned functions and the moral desisre of taking care of other human beings. Those two dimensions can be expressed sometimes by affection, gratitude and solidarity, but, in other times, it is guided by duty, resulting in work overload and concerns that make the caregiver unique in his/her moral condition. Conclusion: the person in charge of being a caregiver finds himself/herself surrounded by feelings and responsibilities, in a heavy load of relationships that are shaped by the subjective and subjectfying experiences, which makes critical the implementation of supportive social networks to aid the caregivers. keywords: Caregiver; Home Care Services; Home Care.",

It seems, however, that a distinction should be made between the of a general field of activity into constituent activities and the of a particular activity to discover not only the various elements of activity but also certain methods and standards of successful performance. The difference between the two occasions for may be made clearer by an illustra tion. If the whole field of civic is analyzed to determine the numerous civic activities which constitute the field, or if the whole range of human experience is analyzed to discover the major fields of activity, we have an example of activity in its more general form. On the other hand, if a particularized activity, such as operating a machine drill or making a speech, be subjected to this process, we have an example of activity in its more particularized form. The former is an of activity (general) ; the latter is an of an activity (particular). The former particularizes by discovering con stituent activities only ; the latter particularizes not only by pointing out lesser units of a certain performance but also by defining standards of successful performance and by discovering methods, attitudes, knowledge, and skills required for successful performance. The former may be called conduct analysis ; the latter is often designated by the term analysis. In the voca tions, job is the accepted term for the of par ticular activities, jobs, or positions connected with the labors of any vocation. In this discussion the term will be used to indicate the general of human experience and activity will be reserved for the more specific of par ticularized performances.

      "abstract": "Demographic ageing in the Western world means that the average age of the working population is increasing. This has major consequences for the labour process. Growing older is linked to physical and cognitive changes which can influence performance of tasks. We are faced with an important challenge: to keep an ageing population healthy and deployable in the long term. One of the cognitive problems that employee’s experience is mental fatigue. Previous research described that after or during a period of mental workload, problems related to cognitive control arise. To prevent these problems, we aim to find objective methods that could detect mental fatigue in an early stage, that is, before a decline in performance emerges. An experiment was developed to examine what problems arise and how different physiological (i.e. brain activity, muscle activity, hart activity and eye movements) and behavioral (i.e. sitting behavior and keyboard and mouse use) parameters change during a period of mental workload. Results show people make more mistakes after a period of mental workload. Some people seem to change their strategy and are able to correct for their mistakes, while others show a stable decrease in performance over time. Further analyses should point out what patterns in behavior and physiology could be related to the decrease in performance. First results point to backspace use as an indicator of mental fatigue.",

The third phase of ICT is articulation of a learning agenda and plan to use one’s strengths to move closer to the Ideal Self while possibly working on developing one to two weaknesses. It is a joyful exploration of possibilities. For most people, setting specific goals prematurely limits options, but later in the change process specific goals can help focus attention toward the new thoughts or behavior. The frontoparietal control network (FPCN) is key to instrumental thinking during goal setting. When the Task Positive Network is activated along with the FPCN, the Default Mode Network is suppressed. Specific goals can also cause a person to focus on the wrong things. The Ought Self invokes the Negative Emotional Attractor and further inhibits sustained effort, and also moves the person away from their own desires. When the challenge is not routine or task defined, learning-oriented goals, a growth mindset, and promotion self-regulatory focus help sustained, desired change. People with a relatively high Need for Achievement like specific goals. For most people, domain and direction planning may be a more effective form of planning.",

      "title": "Investigating Feature Set Decisions for Mental State Decoding in Virtual Reality based Learning Environments",
      "abstract": "In modern workplaces with rapidly changing skill requirements, suitable training and learning environments play a key role for companies to remain competitive, effective and ensure job satisfaction. To provide an immersive, interactive, and engaging learning experience, Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a revolutionary technology. Especially when erroneous behaviour is associated with severe consequences or great resources, VR offers the opportunity to explore actions and visualize consequences in safely and at affordable costs. In addition, it provides an easy way to personalize educational content, learning speed, and/or format to the individual to guarantee a good fit with skills and needs. This is decisive, since insufficient or excessive workload during training sessions results in demotivation and reduced performance. In the latter case, persistent professional exhaustion, pressure to succeed and stress can lead to long-term psychological consequences for employees. Besides skill and ability, current physical conditions (e.g., illness or fatigue) and psychological states (e.g., motivation) also affect the learning performance. To identify and monitor individual mental states, Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) measuring neurophysiological activation patterns, e.g., with an electroencephalography (EEG), or functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can be integrated in a VR-learning environment. Recently, fNIRS, a mobile optical brain imaging technique, has become popular for real-world applications due to its good usability, portability, and ease of use. For the reliable online decoding of mental states, informative neuronal patterns, suitable methods for pre-processing and artefact removal, as well as efficient machine learning algorithms for the classification need to be explored. We, therefore, investigated and decoded different working memory states in a free moving fNIRS experiment presented in VR. different working memory states in a free moving fNIRS VR experiment and the possibility of decoding these states properly. 11 volunteers (four female, right-handed, mean age of 23.73, SD = 1.42, range = 21−26 years) participated in the study. The experimental task was a colour-based visuo-spatial n-back paradigm adapted from Lühmann and colleagues (2019) with a low (1-back) and high working memory load condition (3-back) and a 0-back condition as active baseline. Brain activity was recorded using the mobile NIRx NIRSport2. To capture brain activation patterns associated with working memory load, optode montage was designed to optimally cover the prefrontal cortex (PFC; in particular, dorso- and ventrolateral parts of the PFC) with some lateral restriction by the VR head-mounted display (HMD). fNIRS signals were processed using the python-toolbox mne and mne-nirs. For the decoding of working memory load, we extracted statistical features, that are peak, minimum, average, slope, peak-to-peak, and time-to-peak, from epochs of oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated (HbR) hemoglobin concentration per channel. A Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Gradient Boosting classifier (XGBoost) were explored and compared to a Dummy classifier (empirical chance level). We also investigated which cortical regions contributed to the decoding when choosing single features and which feature combination was suggested to optimize performance. With this study, we aim to provide empirically supported decision recommendations to reach the next step towards future online decoding pipelines in real-world VR-based learning applications.",

The more common definition is similar to the following: Learning is a relatively permanent change in behavior brought about by practice or experience. However, (a) learning as a process should be identified and distinguished from the behavioral results or the products of that process; (b) learning does not necessarily produce a change in behavior—the behavior may remain relatively unchanged while there is a change in the effectiveness of the stimuli eliciting it; (c) ambiguous words, such as practice and experience, are replaced by words that more clearly represent what happens during learning. The following is suggested as an improved definition: Learning is the process by which a relatively stable modification in stimulus–response relations is developed as a consequence of functional environmental interaction via the senses.",

This can all look very baffling to a student, something akin to the 'women's intuition' articulated by Zeldin in Chapter 2. So how are those decisions made?",

As a consequence the grasp of what supervision means and entails, as well as its underlying purpose, can remain vague. The paradox is that there are few other professions where supervision is as highly valued and revered. Most social workers continue to demand supervision long after the completion of their training. Despite this positive culture many experiences of supervision disappoint and frustrate. This contrast between the real and the hoped for is often recounted by social workers. Why is this so? One possible explanation is that dissatisfaction is a by-product of the privacy that envelops supervisory relationships and which inhibits collective analysis and evaluation. A second is that, like the role of the college tutor, the function and purpose of supervisor has attracted little critical questioning and scrutiny.",

      "abstract": "In this article the most important etiologic factors related to dental anxiety are presented and form the basis for the exposition of a model for the psychologic development of dental anxiety. The model shows that personality factors related to emotion and cognition can influence the development of dental anxiety. In order for the anxiety to develop and become manifest it is also necessary that: 1: the individual experiences a given stimulus as presenting a physical threat, e.g. in the form of pain, 2: the individual has been exposed to an experience or a learning situation involving the stimulus, and finally, 3: the individual in connection with this stimulus, experiences somatic reactions such as sweating, abdominal discomfort or tachycardia. This triad interacts in such a way that the individual elements can reinforce each other and thus increase the anxiety, (full-drawn arrow) or also the opposite, (stipled arrow). In this way pain control (anesthesia/sedation), positive reinforcement/information or bodily control (relaxation/biofeedback) will contribute to attenuate or prevent the development and manifestation of anxiety. The model further demonstrates that odontophobia also develops and is contingent upon the opinions, attitudes, feelings and behavior with regard to dental health, hygiene and dentists which is present in the social relationships in the family, the group, social class and the culture. This complex social psychologic process is called socialization, and it expresses the individuals more or less conscious adaptation to society. An important part of this process is imitation or social learning, which forms an important aspect of human development.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "This article discusses human skills. Skills are interpreted as actions that a person performs to acquire motor or intellectual abilities, carrying out those actions in the appropriate manner. It is shown that, alongside new skills, new knowledge and habits also emerge during the process of activity. Skills are formed through various activities in the learning process, such as work, tasks, games, exercises, tests, projects, etc. In the classification presented in the article, skills are divided into fields such as perception, learning, labor, or-ganization, communication, and so on. The psychophysiological characteristics of motor skills, which form the basis of other skills, are explained. It is stated that without motor skills, the development of other skills is impossible. The article also provides a classification of cognitive skills. A brief explanation is given for cognitive skills formed through the perception of sensory signals, attention, memory, thinking, speech, and other cognitive processes. Another issue highlighted is the relationship between cognitive skills and other psychological constructs that stimulate their application. It is noted that the social-cognitive skills include motivation, teamwork, self-regulation, organizational skills, goal setting, decision making, social intelligence, emotional intelligence, social role behavior, and so on. In conclusion, the important role of skills in human life and professional activity is emphasized.",

      "title": "Mental Health",
      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Only in the last 30 years has psychiatry begun to develop empirical approaches to conceptualizing and assessing positive mental health. Six models of mental health are reviewed here. METHOD: The author points out pitfalls in research on mental health, e.g., equating average with healthy, failing to distinguish trait from state, overlooking cultural norms, and conversely, blindly accepting the culture’s values. He describes the six models and provides history and research needs for each. RESULTS: The first model, being “above normal,” is epitomized by DSM-IV’s axis V, the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale. High scores represent “superior functioning in a wide range of activities, life’s problems never seem to get out of hand, is sought out by others because of his or her many positive qualities.” The goal of the second model, positive psychology, is intervention to maximize positive qualities, such as self-efficacy. Maturity and Erikson’s four developmental tasks (identity, intimacy, generativity, integrity) are the basis of the third model. The author adds two other tasks: career consolidation and “keeper of the meaning.” The fourth model is emotional or social intelligence, the ability to read other people’s emotions. Surprisingly, subjective well-being, the fifth model, is as much a characteristic of temperament as of a benign environment. The last model, resilience, is epitomized by DSM-IV’s Defense Function Scale, which categorizes coping mechanisms in terms of adaptational value. CONCLUSIONS: As with the blind men and the elephant, each model describes only some aspects of mental health. Further research may reveal the contribution of each.",

While much is regulated based on the biological and societal scaffolding of lifespan development, certain challenges for motivation and self-regulation are more substantial and need to be managed by the individual, providing opportunities for researchers for testing the limits of individual capacities in developmental regulation. These challenging circumstances include major changes in age-graded opportunities for goal pursuit, uncertain or obfuscated opportunities, and major unexpected losses of control. Under such challenging circumstances, the consequences of individual differences in motivational self-regulation, such as optimism, action vs. state orientation, and goal-disengagement capacity are enhanced and may contribute to adaptive patterns of developmental regulation.",

It illustrates that the variation in the percentage of heads in each process is vastly different, as is the accuracy of forecasts. When there is a lot of randomness, or noise, in the behavior, one cannot expect to forecast it very accurately. Real-life demand patterns may or may not have an underlying structure. What makes real life demand patterns so difficult to forecast is that the underlying mechanisms guiding their behavior may not be so apparent or may not even exist. Even if there is some structure to the historical pattern, it may not be obvious and can require good software or a skilled analyst to uncover it. While fundamental issues are being addressed, there are other common mistakes and bad practices that can stifle forecasting improvement efforts.",

      "title": "El sesgo atencional en los trastornos relacionados con sustancias. Aspectos teóricos, evaluativos y de tratamiento",
      "abstract": "The objective of this work is to investigate attentional bias as an automatic cognitive process and its implications in substance use disorders. Cognitive processes are fundamental in the formulation of the different explanatory models about psychopathology. Of the various cognitive processes, attention is a significant determinant, because although it fulfils various activities such as orientation and wakefulness, it is cognitive control that arouses relevant interest for it. This is due to the fact that it fulfills a task of linking between signal uptake and the achievement of other cognitive processes that intervene in the behavioral response mechanism. When a cognitive process like attention is markedly altered it will trigger impaired sequential cognitive functioning, along with the emission of disturbing behavior. Psychology considers that cognitive processes operate consciously (voluntarily) and automatically (implicitly); that is, in a dual way in which these processes such as attention maintain a continuum of coordinated gradual variations that regulate behavior. Failure to consider automatic cognitive processes is a notorious limitation for current explanatory models of psychopathological behavior (including compulsive substance use); given that many of these underlying cognitive processes are often not considered to influence higher mental processes and therefore behavior, without the individual necessarily being aware of this. In fact, this can help to understand pathological behaviors that for the investigator or the professional of psychology can be incomprehensible or paradoxical. Among the various underlying and altered processes, the attentional bias towards critical signals associated with substances has investigative relevance. Since it is a dysfunctional mechanism of selective attention, which operates frequently at an automatic level and in which the allocation and focus of attention are disproportionate in time, between a specific stimulus (image or word related to a drug) versus a neutral stimulus. And it attracts a person's focus of attention to the critical stimulus, from which it later becomes difficult to decouple. This later facilitates other altered cognitive processes subsequent to consumption. The generation of an attentional bias towards a specific signal has its origin in the association between the signal and the behavior, which can be avoidant (recurrent in phobias) or attractive (frequent in substance or food consumption) and that is conditioned until becoming an automatic process of difficult voluntary control. Although it is true that attention bias may be present in all individuals, the evidence reveals the marked and recurrent presence in various pathologies such as mood disorders (depressive), anxiety, food intake, phobias, of personality among others. And also included in substance use disorders. The findings show that attention bias has an impact on substance use, course, the severity of the disorder, craving, withdrawal, relapse, and the probability of treatment failure. Working with an attentional bias for specific signals on substances can generate difficulty, in the case of evaluation because it is assessed through software that usually measures the eye-hand reaction time or eye movement when faced with neutral and critical signals, which can be a limitation for the usual clinic; while at the intervention level, it is required to formulate bias retraining processes that require continuous exercise as a complementary technique to the usual cognitive-behavioral treatment. It is considered necessary to explore this line of research and its relationship with substance use disorders within the region. https://doi.org/10.16888/interd.2022.39.1.5",

We differentiate between practicum and internship experiences, focusing on the goals of each, and then discuss helpful orientation information such as working in multidisciplinary teams and matching your assets with preferred client populations and sites. A specific focus is placed on self-reflection, self-assessment, and identification of personal strengths and areas of challenge. Finally, we review where you are heading, including information related to certification, licensure, and employment. Entering the field experiences of practicum and internship is often a time of excitement because it is an opportunity to work with real clients rather than practicing counseling skills by role-playing skills with peers. It may also be a time of trepidation, as many trainees ask themselves questions like, “Do I really have the skills for this?” or, “What if my supervisor doesn’t like me?” or, “What if I have a client with issues I can’t handle?” All these questions are a normal part of entering a new experience. An important goal for you at this point is to prepare for the anxiety you may experience as you move from practice to real-life situations. But remember, this is what you have trained for in your many classes and experiences. In addition, this is your career choice, and hopefully, you are excited about finally being able to begin your career as a professional counselor.",

      "abstract": "<div class=\"abstract\" data-abstract-type=\"normal\"> Success in mathematics—however you wish to define it—comes from a strong sense of self-confidence: the confidence to acknowledge one's emotions and to calm them down, the confidence to pause over ideas and come to educated guesses or conclusions, the confidence to rely on one's wits to navigate through unfamiliar terrain, the confidence to choose understanding over impulsive rote doing, and the confidence to persevere. Success and joy in science, business, and in life doesn't come from programmed responses to pre-set situations. It comes from agile and adaptive thinking coupled with reflection, assessment, and further adaptation. Students—and adults too—are often under the impression that one should simply be able to leap into a mathematics challenge and make instant progress of some kind. This not how mathematics works! It is okay to fumble, and flail, and to try out ideas that turn out not help in the end. In fact, this <span class='italic'>is</span> the problem-solving process and making multiple false starts should not at all be dismissed! (Think of how we solve problems in everyday life.) It is also a natural part of the problem-solving process to react to a problem. “This looks scary.” “This looks fun.” “I don't have a clue what the question is even asking!” “Wow. Weird! Could that really be true?” “Who cares?” “I don't get it.” “Is this too easy? I am suspicious.” We are each human, and the first step to solving a problem is to come to terms with our emotional reaction to it—especially if that reaction is one of being overwhelmed. Step 1 to problem-solving mentioned in the previous section in vital. Once we have nerves in check, at least to some degree, there are a number of techniques one could try in order to make some progress with the problem. The ten strategies we briefly outline in the appendix are discussed in full detail on the MAA's CURRICULUM INSPIRATIONS webpage, www.maa.org/ci. There you will find essays and videos explaining each technique in full, with worked examples and slews of further practice examples and their solutions. </div>",

Exploring these four factors in detail may make it possible to resolve much of the controversy that now surrounds MDM, and to acquire fresh insights into its cognitive and affective foundations",

Die Neuauflage des Ratgebers vermittelt Informationen über typische innere Zustände, sogenannte „Schemamodi“, die unser Erleben, unsere Gefühle und unser Handeln stark beeinflussen. Der Ratgeber nimmt dabei Bezug auf die Schematherapie, eine aktuelle Entwicklung in der Psychotherapie. Zunächst werden die für die Schematherapie zentralen Konzepte erläutert. Anhand anschaulicher Fallbeispiele werden dann typische innere Zustände („Schemamodi“), die vielen Menschen Schwierigkeiten bereiten, illustriert. Darauf aufbauend wird aufgezeigt, wie solche Schemamodi entstehen, wie man sie erkennen kann und wodurch sie aktiviert werden bzw. wann sie typischerweise auftreten. Der Ratgeber stellt eine Vielzahl praktischer Übungen und Möglichkeiten vor, die dabei helfen können, eigene problematische Schemamodi zu verändern, zu reduzieren oder besser zu steuern. Zudem wird erläutert, was man aktiv dafür tun kann, hilfreiche Schemamodi häufiger zu erleben.",

When they carry out laboratory experiments they get tangled up in many rhetorical tricks, turns of phrase that refer to the others as the ‘subjects’ when those others are being treated as if they were objects. And in this kind of situation the experimenter, who is really the subject of the narrative – ‘I asked such and such people to perform this task in these different conditions’ – disappears altogether. Although the experimenters did it and write about what they did, they are not allowed to write in the first person. Psychology students learn quickly that there is no place for the ‘I’, for personal experience or reflection on their position in experimental reports, and they are often penalised for making themselves present in essays or any other kind of writing in psychology journals.",

The commander makes his decision but has a feeling that there is a better way--he needs more time, more information or a clearer head. The decisions commanders, staff officers and warfighters make are driven by education, training, experience and personal preference. A lifetime of learning allows them to set goals, assess conditions, identify and evaluate alternatives, and make quick, complex decisions. The human mind can make remarkable decisions under extraordinary conditions-an ability technology lacks. However, the mind is subject to adverse effects by environmental factors such as fatigue, stress and hunger. It is well documented that decisions made under these conditions are generally inferior to those made by well-rested, fed, comfortable and relaxed leaders. The US military strives to select commanders based on their proven ability to make good decisions under adverse conditions. The opening scenario provides a good example of decision making under adverse conditions. Consider the same adverse conditions-with another decision-making tool for commanders. A computerized intelligent agent is programmed with lessons learned from classrooms and training. The software runs on the same computers that are used to type memos and create briefing slides. It accesses the data in the battle command systems and planning tools, including powerful networked computer systems, handwritten notes and sketches. The intelligent agent is oblivious to time, temperature and a commander's physical and mental condition. Based on all available information, it evaluates the COAs and lists each strength, weakness and issue in a matter of seconds. The commander quickly scans the list, discards some COAs and considers others until he reaches the element critical to the decision. Based on his judgment, his staff s recommendations and a few key factors that he might otherwise not have had the energy or awareness to identify, he decides. The strengths, weaknesses or issues might be based on planning considerations learned by a lieutenant in basic course; discovered by a captain during an after-action review; or noted during senior service college. They might be based on new enemy tactics observed during a battle yesterday. The intelligent agent combines the things a computer does best-sorting and sifting through massive data while remaining immune to fatigue, stress or environmental factors-with the things a human can do best, such as learning from experience. The agent combines doctrine and tactics with lessons learned throughout military history. It does not replace the commander or make the commander's decisions; it provides concise, relevant and explainable information the commander can consider when making decisions. This is how we can use intelligent agents in the command post of the future. Learning Agents Laboratory Automated decision support systems, expert systems and intelligent agents are not new but have played a limited role in military command and control or support systems. Even with today's rapid growth in computing power and connectivity, most software products that claim to be intelligent do not solve complex, real-world problems. Government, industrial and academic researchers have made recent progress in moving intelligent systems from hype to reality. …",

      "title": "Academic careers and promotion: character and conduct deserve greater emphasis",
      "abstract": "‘Let the superior man never fail reverentially to order his own conduct, and let him be respectful to others and observant of propriety’. (Confucius; Analects, book 12, http://www.gradesaver.com/the-analects-of-confucius/e-text/section12/). This Editorial aims to examine a few questions about character and workplace conduct that some academics and others may wish to contemplate or discuss with colleagues. Given the competitive nature of promotion procedures and the limited positions the higher one ascends the academic ladder, it may be asked: what percentage of ‘achiever-survivors’ who began with honourable intentions remain committed to ethical behaviour towards others in challenging situations involving peers, superiors, and students? Career planning is regarded by many to be a rational, intentional, goal-oriented, and intrinsically useful activity (e.g. Billings 2008a,b,c); however, the human foibles of the planner, or the professional culture and context within which a career unfolds are often not considered. In fact, the best laid career plans will not be fulfilled for many reasons. First, different people have varying interpretations of the idea of ‘career’, and for many, a career coincides with the idea of an occupation or vocation, rather than a sense of driving towards something more prestigious, better remunerated, or on a more lofty position on the ladder. Other common assumptions built into career planning are less tangible – aspirations, desires, and vision – and can be in danger of coalescing with wishful thinking, hazy self-perception and unrealistic beliefs about self and the nature of academic institutions and their everyday exigencies. Contrary to developing and adhering to a plan, commonly professionals have been ‘lucky’ or found themselves ‘in the right place at the right time’. According to Moran et al. (2011), many senior nurses report that they had not planned their career, but had instead been open to opportunities. Taking up an unexpected opening may relate more to risk-taking aspects of personality, the congruence between professional skills and those demanded within the setting, or even the way in which senior personnel recruiting to the position present, describe, or sell the opportunity. Furthermore, a range of pragmatic down-to-earth factors are required for career progression, including the parameters of the worker's role within an adult partnership, whether the individual is directly responsible for raising children, the health status of family members in more than one generation, and flexible, supportive, family-friendly workplace facilities and staff (Moran et al. 2011). If a successful career is tantamount to rising to the top, or near-top, of the ladder – admittedly, a narrow definition of ‘success’ – then very few academics do so, in part because these positions are scarce. A relationship with a trusted mentor can be very helpful in terms of career progression (Billings 2008b), with research showing that those who enter mentorship programmes have ‘increased performance and promotion rate, early career advancement, greater upward mobility, higher income, greater job satisfaction, enhanced leadership ability and perceptions of greater success and influence in an organisation’ (Moran et al. 2011, p. 48). Some organizations have a commitment to mentoring, but it would be unusual for an academic institution to have structured mentoring opportunities available to all staff members from neophytes to department heads and research leaders and Faculty deans. Consequently, mentoring may involve self-directed connections whereby certain ambitious personnel seek out pivotal mentors, or mentoring is provided selectively to those who have shown significant ‘promise’ as defined by the organization or key individuals. In academia, career pathways are now commonly linked to research output (such as the number and size of grants received, or the quality of research-based publications) as well as outstanding contributions to teaching, committee work, administration, the profession, or broader community. When considering professorial positions, the expectations are even higher. A professor is expected to have produced – and continue to produce – a substantial body of work, with evidence of significant contributions to the discipline, have an established national and international academic profile, contribute meaningfully to the Faculty and wider University, as well as lead research projects, provide mentorship, and supervise higher degrees. Given the diversity and complexity of expectations, which may be impossible to fulfil completely, determining appointments may, at times, relate more to the Faculty profile, politics, interview demeanour, or even ‘group-think’ during the processing of applications. Academics’ priorities are as likely to be character-based as they are principle-based, and for well-rounded academics, the two may closely coincide. For other academics, there may be wide divergence. An understanding of what our job actually is can be open to interpretation, depending on the department, general guidelines, and the specific teaching and research requirements, among other considerations. Succinctly, academic responsibilities for most employees involve teaching, research, thinking, writing, administration, and committee work. To this list may be added pastoral care of students, unofficially mentoring new academics, supporting students with specific learning issues (e.g. coaching in mathematics-based subjects or explaining complex aspects of English for those who use it as a second language), engaging with health providers, and seeking input from clinicians about workplace needs relevant to undergraduate and postgraduate curricula. The opening Confucian quote arose from ancient Chinese humanist philosophy that was concerned with human virtues and how people treat each other in society. The patriarchal beliefs built into the system may be anomalous today, but the salience of positive, respectful human relations and practising good governance are not. The ‘superior person’, we could say, is someone with a well-developed, virtuous character, which includes having an open mind, being sincere, having purity of purpose, and being courageous (and more). Such a person of good character is obliged to act with propriety: character precedes propriety, as mere conformity to rules is an empty performance, and character is exemplified by good behaviour in interaction with others. Thus, within Confucianism, character and moral virtue are prerequisites for good relations and governance. Within the academic body, the emphases each of us places on students, intellectual concerns, and research will vary. Some staff will be more inclined to adhere to their own principles in making priorities, while others may feel more beholden to the demands made by others, especially those in positions of authority; these differences can occur even when they are in the same department and employed at the same level. Those who are true to their own ‘virtuous’ principles in keeping with Confucianism or secular humanism are more likely to have an open view of students and their educational needs, and, for example, to spend extra time working with them to deal with course challenges. Others who are more responsive to power may be committed to obedience even if it means, for instance, ‘teaching’ beyond the depth or breadth of their knowledge. In contemporary academia, both groups are likely to be overworked – stretching themselves for students, or doing too much administration or teaching at the distant reaches of their professional and experiential repertoire. Decisions or non-decisions made by academics over time – whether they are principled, strategic, following the least line of resistance, or simply haphazard – will determine whether people are likely to be promoted. There are likely to further needs and goals factored in when academics aim for top jobs: these may relate to money acquisition, power over others, bolstering ego, status within the broader society, compensation for feelings of intellectual inadequacy, an excessive belief in one's own capacity to effect change, etc. Some reach the apex by working diligently, doing what is expected at the time, seeking favour with those in positions of power. On the other hand, many may plan or act in similar ways, but do not reach the pinnacle they hoped or for which they aimed. Although top positions are, by definition, rare, a minority of academics may end up in senior positions – not intending to be number one in that department or Faculty, but finding they have accepted this role. Again, character and principles will determine the methods and behaviours used by both academics who have risen to the highest positions and those who have not. There is an expectation that people in senior academic positions should be of good character and have a ‘virtuous disposition because they inescapably influence the moral development’ of others (Osguthorpe 2008, p. 288). The belief that academics at all levels should be of good character is most likely held by students and their families, and quite possibly, this is most clearly articulated by consumers when something has gone wrong at ‘The University’, revealing that such expectations have not been fulfilled. Whether academics or other leaders ‘inescapably’ influence the moral development of young adults they teach and supervise is debatable, but if moral development is a long-term personal project, then at least these role models may precipitate reflection or discussion with peers about how professionals should conduct themselves in public positions. If Confucius was concerned about society as a whole, then the percentage of visibly virtuous people in academic positions is surely relevant to the character of academe at large and the health professionals who receive an education there. An observation some academics make is that the general style of interaction staff display towards each other is often mirrored in how they conduct themselves in classrooms with students. Broadly, those with a humanistic orientation enacted through mutual respect, good manners, an inclusive engagement with all comers, and an egalitarian modus operandi, tend to approach peers and students similarly. Such behaviours are congruent with Confucian interest in respect and good conduct. Respect for students and staff excludes ‘put-downs’ and diminishment. Good manners involve entering an arena with positive intentions and starting interactions politely and constructively. Dealing inclusively with all participants means that nobody is ignored and nobody has an especially cosy relationship, and treating people equally prevents the formation of in-groups and out-groups that impede whole-group learning and whole-department functionality. These modes of academic conduct ultimately devolve on character and moral behaviour. Furthermore, what we will not do is as important to virtue ethics and group dynamics as what we must do. Regardless of whether we admit to making ongoing subtle assessments of peers, bosses, superiors, and students, invariably we do observe, take note, and develop opinions about others’ behaviours. Hopefully, more of us do so with the backing of personal experience and evidence, rather than hearsay, rumour or even lies transmitted along the workplace grapevine. According to some, the ‘notion that we might be constantly appraising the moral behaviour of each other might seem in some way insulting or offensive, but ‘in reality’ that is what we are expected to do in the public interest’ (Begley 2011, p. 21). Unfortunately, it is likely that negative reports about others are perceived to have greater weight than neutral, balanced, or positive information (De Bruin & Van Lange 1999). Consequently, there is a requirement for academics with good character, good intentions, and a constructive approach to people and situations to be self-aware and alert, as even listening to and accepting gossip without passing such beliefs on to others can interfere with staff or students being given a fair hearing or receiving a just assessment. In summary, in this editorial, we have raised questions about how thoroughly academic institutions and interviewing personnel consider good character to be relevant to the quality of the culture and teaching–learning experience provided by their university. To assist in these considerations, we have drawn briefly on Confucian focus on conduct and propriety as well as humanism's virtue ethics. Both have interests that transcend individualism and go the heart of human relations within families, groups, and governing bodies. Implicit in this discussion are concerns that, in career planning and promotion criteria and processes, these matters – which, after all, constitute the very fabric of University teaching groups and research teams – are not given sufficient emphasis.",

      "title": "I Was Going to Do That, but Then You Told Me To!",
      "abstract": "\"Well, what YOU NEED TO DO is work out, eat healthy, get enough sleep, manage your stress, have meaningful relationships …\" Let me just tell you this is how not to motivate us. Maybe we are a rarity, unicorns if you will, in that telling us what we need to do does not automatically result in us doing the behavior. The only behavior I (LH) can guarantee will occur from a statement like the above will be the whiplash that occurs as I pop my head around to see who had the audacity to say it. How do you respond when someone tells you what you need to do? When a family member, a significant other, or a friend (potentially about to be ex-significant other or ex-friend) tells you what you need to do, the verbal form of a finger point to the face — what is your initial response? Is it immediate acceptance or does resistance rise up — even if you know the individual is right? Often times with lifestyle behaviors, many individuals realize that modifications need to be made, but the question is, does being told or commanded to do so by another help in changing the individual's behavior? In specific situations — sure, but we would like to highlight another option when trying to help a client engage in long-lasting behavior change — motivational interviewing (MI). MI: WHAT NOT TO DO If we view communication as walking with a client on a path, there are three major ways to make the journey. In directing, we would be the leader and the client would walk behind us; in following, the opposite would occur; and in guiding, we would walk alongside the client and point out different routes that could be taken and allow the client to choose which path to journey down. Miller and Rollnick (1) define MI as a collaborative conversation style for strengthening a person's own motivation and commitment to change. Many professionals, with good intentions, default to the directing style of communication and rarely move along the communication spectrum, which can prove to be ineffective and counterproductive in eliciting the desired behavior change (1). How do you respond when you see a client walking down the wrong path? Do you have the natural desire to yell out, \"No! Don't do it! Do this instead!\"? Although we certainly cannot speak for you, we admit that we both have very strong, inherent, \"Fix it!\" mentalities. Unfortunately, and to our dismay, this \"righting reflex,\" defined as a desire to fix what seems to be wrong with clients and to set them promptly on a new course, is often ineffective in our quest to get clients to engage in positive behavior change (1). Why? In one word, ambivalence: individuals have mixed feelings about changing a behavior; meaning, people want to change and do not want to change all at the same time. We all know change is difficult — if this were not the case, our clients would often never approach us. Ambivalence is a normal part of behavior change, and if we listen closely when talking with a client who is ambivalent about change, we will hear two distinct types of talk: change talk (the person's own statements that favor change) and sustain talk (the person's own statements for not changing) (2,3). What happens when an ambivalent client talks with someone like us with the \"fix it\" righting reflex? It's actually quite predictable. Our arguments for positive behavior change trigger the ambivalent client to defend the opposite viewpoint. Houston, we have a problem, as this is a no-win situation, as individuals tend to believe their own over others' opinions (4). As we argue for the behavior change, our client will be arguing against the behavior change. In other words, abort, abort, the ship is sinking quickly as this conversation is becoming counterproductive! Not convinced? Have one of your lovely, wants-the-best-for-you friends tell you one thing that he/she thinks you need to change in your life, argue why you should make the change, and end with a \"fix it now\" type comment for good measure. Disclaimer: we do not assume responsibility for what may occur because of this conversation. How do you feel? Ready to make a change or are you experiencing a bit of defensiveness and resistance to what was said? Hmmm … might others experience these same feelings when we try to quickly fix them? Let us learn a bit more about MI and to see if it would be a helpful tool to add to our toolboxes (1,4,5).SPIRIT OF MI We engage in the spirit of MI, which includes partnership, acceptance, compassion, and evocation, to achieve MI's primary goal of behaving in a way that will reduce resistance talk and evoke change talk in our clients (6). Partnership: This step of MI is crucial to begin a relationship with your client. It creates an environment of mutual collaboration that does not include one individual dominating another. We must humble ourselves before coming into the conversation, realizing our client is the expert on himself/herself. Once our humbling occurs, the waltz of communication and the sweet sound of the philharmonic will begin. Acceptance: Alert, alert, people do not enjoy feeling judged! Do you? We sure don't. This is not a time to listen with the purpose of having a response or to give holier than thou advice. This is a time to listen and process what the client is saying and seek to better understand the client and the why behind the behavior. The client is more concerned with your attitude toward him/her as he/she allows you into his/her inner world. Is it one of judgment or acceptance? Compassion: We aim to do our best to promote the client's well-being and pursue his/her best interests. We strive to understand him/her without engaging in judgment, either explicit or implicit. With compassion, we understand that everyone is seeking to live a fulfilled life, and we accept the individual's path and choices with no judgment. We have all made those decisions that we regret (and some of us have pictures to prove it). We want to create an environment where the client feels respected. Let us do to others as we would want them to do to us. Evocation: This is a game changer. MI uses a strength-based approach, one in which we believe that individual clients have much of what is needed to bring forth positive change, and our job is to call it forth. Instead of pointing out what is wrong with the client (don't do it), we highlight strengths and previous victories of our client. We aim to evoke the client's passions — the \"why\" behind changing a behavior. For example, \"Why are you considering changing this behavior? What benefits might occur if you were to change this behavior?\" CORE SKILLS OF MI In MI, we believe every client has the capacity and potential for positive behavior change, and we use the core skills of MI (OARS + I) to try to evoke an individual's internal motivation for change (6). Open-ended questions: Full disclosure … this takes practice. Open-ended questions allow a client to elaborate on a response instead of giving a restrictive yes or no. In formulating questions, we seek to provide an opportunity for clients to think deeper about the \"why\" of the behavior and think long term about potential benefits and drawbacks of engaging in a behavior. It can be as simple as asking, \"How would you like things to be different? What have you tried before to make a change? If you continue engaging in this behavior, what will your life look like in 10 years?\" Affirmations: Affirmations are statements that highlight a client's strengths. They are important because they build confidence in the client's ability to make a change. Affirmations are what people strive for, especially athletes and the people pleasers of the world (are we right?). This desire for affirmation begins young and continues into adulthood, and unfortunately, we often receive fewer affirmations from others because of our deficit-model society (focusing on deficits over strengths — you need to fix this deficit of yours). Providing positive affirmations to your client expresses belief in that individual; helping encourage that what he/she possesses inside is enough to positively change his/her behavior. Importantly, to be effective, affirmations need to be genuine. For instance, affirming that LH could beat MG in a foot race is just plain rude. Reflective listening: Oh the frustration that arises when we feel that we are not being listened to. Enter reflective listening, the secret ingredient to MI. In reflective listening, we seek to understand the client and offer the idea back to the client for clarification. It may seem small, but it has a huge impact. It is a chance to encourage the client to continue. It shows the client that he/she is being heard and understood. It allows us to make sure we have a clear picture of what the client is stating and feeling. It eliminates the air of assumption. Good reflective listening encourages the client to continue in the conversation. Summarizing: Summarizing is the outcome of sustained reflective listening. Although you give the signs of listening and affirmations throughout the conversation, summarizing is the tying together of the whole conversation and presenting it back to the client for review. We offer our summary of the conversation to the client for approval and clarification. By asking the client if our summary is correct and what should be added, we give control to the client. Autonomy to the client — yes please! We aim to make the client feel in control, heard, and cared for. Information giving: At this point, you have proven yourself to your client and the client feels accepted and is potentially open to your advice. High five! Make sure to thank the client for sharing with you before asking — this is key, check the article title — if they would like to hear some suggestions for changing their behavior. Some might say, \"nope!\" That is okay; we repeat, that is okay; change is hard and is a process, and engaging in a nonjudgmental conversation is a positive step. Alternatively, the client may accept your offer of suggestions. At that time, offer suggestions, resources, or programs, all the while realizing it is up to the client whether or not to take what is offered. Speak and offer humbly and give control back to the client by asking if he/she would like to try any of these suggestions. Remember, the client will be making all decisions once leaving your session. WRAP-UP We believe engaging in MI will help elicit an individual's internal motivation to lead to long-lasting behavior change. MI has shown promising results in increasing physical activity levels in adults (7), adults with chronic health conditions (8), and adults with type 2 diabetes (9) — might it work with your clients? A friendly reminder, \"In some ways MI is simple, but mastering it is neither quick nor easy\" (1). If you would like to learn more about MI, we strongly suggest Miller's and Rollnick's Motivational Interviewing: Helping People Change as a great first resource.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive states are typical of students' educational activity, which is accompanied by high activity of cognitive processes.Management of this activity is impossible without the knowledge of the structure, function, and mechanisms of actualization of cognitive states in various learning situations.Th e research relevance of the problem of cognitive states in the context of students' intellectual activity is due to their unique role in the regulation of the thinking process, maintaining a steady focus on the solution of the problem within a certain period of time.Th e purpose of this article is to study the structure of the cognitive states that arises in the process of solving intellectual problems (through the example of carrying out R. Amthauer's intelligence structure test).Leading methods to the study of this problem were tests with standardized questionnaires and retrospective self-reports.According to the results of factor analysis, ten key factors underlying the structure of the typical cognitive state of interest/mental stress have been identifi ed.A system-forming factor of this condition has been emphasized, which is an \"attitude\" to intellectual activity in the context of the overall semantic orientation of the subject.Th e obtained results can be of interest to researchers in the fi eld of psychology of emotions as well as to specialists involved in the diagnosis of students' intellectual abilities.",

      "abstract": "In several situations agents need to be assigned to activities on basis of their preferences, and each agent can take part in at most one activity. Often, the preferences of the agents do not depend only on the activity itself but also on the number of participants in the respective activity. In the setting we consider, the agents hence have preferences over pairs \"(activity, group size)\" including the possibility \"do nothing\"; in this work, these preferences are assumed to be strict orders. The task will be to find stable assignments of agents to activities, for different concepts of stability such as Nash or core stability, and Pareto optimal assignments respectively. In this respect, particular focus is laid on two natural special cases of agents' preferences inherent in the considered model.",

      "abstract": "Abstract You Might (or Might Not) Know More Than You Thought: Student Self-Perception vs. Performance in First Year Engineering Graphics and Programming Students' perceptions of their abilities in fundamental engineering skills such as graphics and computer programming may be influenced by their familiarity with these skills, as well as their assessment of how well they were able to perform them upon exposure and practice. While some students may believe in or doubt their ability to master these skills, others possess a sufficient level of confidence and persistence to overcome any doubt about their current or future ability. The similarity between belief in one's ability to acquire a particular skill (self-efficacy), and the belief that one can be successful (self-confidence) may also lead some students to conclude that they can't become \"good\" at something if they can't be successful at it on the first or second attempt. This is likely to be due to their limited amount of exposure to and experience with a particular engineering skill, such as graphics or computer programming. The results of a beginning of semester survey of students' current abilities in engineering graphics and computer programming were compared to their homework assignment and test grades in engineering graphics and computer programming. The graphics unit consisted of four weeks of manual drafting followed by four weeks of computer-aided drawing (CAD) with Autodesk Inventor. The programming unit, lasting six weeks, consisted of review and expansion of MatLab skills and tools. The first year engineering design course in which this study took place is taught at a large multipurpose university in the eastern United States, in sections of 30 students each. In the survey, students offered feedback enabling us to code their current ability in graphics and programming, respectively, as Beginner, Average or Expert, depending on their previous experience in these skill areas and attitudes toward them. The distribution for current graphics ability was approximately 30% Beginner, 40% Average and 30% Expert. For programming, the distribution was approximately 35% Beginner, 45% Average and 20% Expert. When each student's survey results were compared to their combined homework and test percentage grades in graphics and in programming, we found that students with prior experience usually earned higher grades on graphics homework and tests than those with no experience. However, prior experience with MatLab did not guarantee success in our programming unit, and prior experience with Java, C++ or Python, without MatLab, yielded mixed results at best.",

      "abstract": "The Internet has grown increasingly relevant in the practice of forensic psychiatry. To a psychiatrist conducting a forensic evaluation, the evaluee's Internet use can be relevant in nearly all aspects of the analysis. An evaluee's Internet presence may help to confirm, corroborate, refute, or elaborate on the psychiatrist's general impression of the person. Questions about the individual's choice of screen names, activities, images, and phrases can be valuable conversational tools to increase candor and self-disclosure, even among less cooperative evaluees. Difficulties in mood or affect regulation, problems with thought process or content, and impaired impulse control may be apparent in the evaluee's behavior in various Internet forums-for example, hostile or provocative behavior in social forums or excessive use of gaming or shopping websites. Discussions about the evaluee's behavior on the Internet can help the psychiatrist to assess for impaired insight and judgment. Perceptual disturbances, such as derealization and depersonalization, may be related to an evaluee's overidentification with the virtual world to the neglect of real-life needs and responsibilities. Furthermore, digital evidence can be especially useful in assessments of impairment, credibility, and dangerousness or risk, particularly when the evaluee is uncooperative or unreliable in the face-to-face psychiatric examination. This discussion will provide illustrative examples and suggestions for questions and topics the forensic psychiatrist may find helpful in conducting a thorough evaluation in this new age of the Internet.",

      "title": "THE SYMPTOM OF PERFORMANCE ANXIETY IN RELATION TO ARTISTIC DEVELOPMENT",
      "abstract": "The symptom of performance anxiety is always an obstacle for the artist’s endeavour. Although the symptom can be described objectively in terms of physiological and cognitive variables, the psychological meaning might differ qualitatively to a great extent. The obstacle to good achievement always occurs in a context consisting of various processes and factors. The obstacle turns the artist into an under-achiever instead of over-achiever which may have serious consequences. The artist’s greatest professional concern is his or her positive development. There are many obstacles to overcome. The problem arises for the caregiver to make the proper diagnosis for the proper treatment. However, the artist’s symptom can be due to work overload, marital problems, musical challenges, childhood issues etc. In each case, maladaptive processes have contributed to the symptom and its presence. It is beneficial to look at the symptom from a wider scope. The concept of artistic development is based on the assumption that at each state of development or process, organized structures of ”elements are the results of previous processes and forms, at the same time, the basis for current processes (Magnusson et al, 1993). Quantitative and qualitative studies with opera singers and classical dancers indicate that the artistic development is shaped by individual characteristics (personality, motivation), psychosocial factors (meetings with significant others, roles/ musical pieces, family life) and phases (positive musical experiences in childhood, age-related issues, learning of specific skills). There is a constant interaction taking place between social world, individual characteristics, certain life and artistic phases. These factors and interactions promote on one hand change in terms of progress, insight and failure, on the other hand stability in terms of maintenance of adaptive processes. The occurrence of obstacles can be interpreted as a sign of maladaptive processes and factors. Among the group of very successful opera singers, early signs of outstanding musical or singing skills were not noted. A discussion about obstacles and facilitating experiences for artistic growth and development will follow.",

      "abstract": "Choking under pressure has largely been explained by two different classes of theories.Distraction theories propose that pressure-induced failure occurs because attention needed to perform the task at hand is co-opted by task-irrelevant thoughts and worries.Explicit monitoring theories claim essentially the opposite -that pressure prompts individuals to attend closely to skill processes in a manner that disrupts execution.Although both mechanisms of choking have been shown to occur in certain contexts, it is unclear when distraction and/or explicit monitoring will ultimately impact performance.We propose that aspects of the pressure situation itself can lead to distraction and/or explicit monitoring, differentially harming skills that rely more (or less) on working memory and attentional control.Using category learning as a test bed, in three experiments we show that performance-contingent outcome pressures hurt rule-based category learning heavily dependent on attentional control.In contrast, pressure involving monitoring by others impairs information-integration category learning thought to run best without heavy demands on attentional control (Experiments 1-2).In Experiment 3, we leverage our knowledge about how specific types of pressure impact performance to design interventions to eliminate choking.Skill failure (and success) under pressure depends on the type of pressure one is under and the control structures of the task being performed.",

Any given conversation of this type may include: (a) the human forming an intent, (b) the human expressing that intent as a command or utterance, (c) the AI performing one or more rounds of inference on that command to resolve ambiguities and/or requesting clarifications from the human, (d) the AI showing the inferred meaning of the command and/or its execution on current and future situations or data, (e) the human hopefully correctly recognizing whether the AI's interpretation actually aligns with their intent. In the process, they may (f) update their model of the AI's capabilities and characteristics, (g) update their model of the situations in which the AI is executing its interpretation of their intent, (h) confirm or refine their intent, and (i) revise their expression of their intent to the AI, where the loop repeats until the human is satisfied. With these critical cognitive and computational steps within this back-and-forth laid out as a framework, it is easier to anticipate where communication can fail, and design algorithms and interfaces that ameliorate those failure points.",

      "abstract": "There is an increasing understanding of requirements engineering as a group activity. Those who have participated in requirements workshops and meetings will recognise that success often depends on the mediation skills of the workshop facilitator. However, the role of the facilitator is a subject of some debate. He or she is described as a planner, a guide, cheerleader, coach, arbitrator or a soothsayer (1). Their role description varies from having ‘100% control of the process and 0% control of the content’ to being ‘a session leader who facilitates debate and preparation of documents’ (2). A facilitator ‘should be someone who is free from vested interest’ (3). Opinions differ on the facilitator’s status within a group. Some of this difference can be explained by the ‘bias’ of the source. For example, if the facilitator is to perform some leadership function for the group then he or she will be in a position of power over the other group members. If he or she is someone who is brought in from outside of the group as a professional facilitator, then his or her function will be more of an assistant to the group, helping the group members to achieve their objectives without having any stake in the outcome (4).",

Each time we end our contact with users, be it at the end of an interview, home visit or group session, important principles of preparing ourselves and the other person for the parting or ending have to be kept in mind. Also social work can be episodic. We can undertake a piece of work in our capacity of care manager or court officer, and then another worker may be involved. Although the contact with the agency might not end, the particular relationship between you as worker and the user does. Final termination or these transfers of work may be planned or unplanned, initiated by client or worker, mutually agreed or unilaterally decided. Closing 'cases' and ending relationships receives surprisingly little attention in the literature, though the topic of evaluation is stressed by policymakers, researchers and managers (see Davies and Knapp, 1988; Coulshed, 1990). Good care management, as a system and as a practice, depends on showing that we have achieved planned goals in a cost-effective, accountable way.",

Furthermore, methods for collecting psychological data are depicted. As examples for psychophysiological stress research under natural conditions, a showmaster's heart rate responses during a TV show are reported, as well as psychophysiological effects of work demands in air traffic controllers and in simultaneous interpreting. The latter example shows that mental overload in simultaneous interpreting may change the attitude to the job: It is taken less seriously and a certain carelessness sets in. This might be an effective self-defense mechanism against mental overload caused by situations such as increased time on task, extremely fast speakers, unintelligible speakers, and long working hours. It seems to occur rather automatically, without being noticed by the performing interpreter. Especially with increased time on task, interpreters' own judgement of output quality, whether they are novices or experts, seems to become extremely unreliable.",

Occupational stress is based on work-related stress. It is a feeling of emotional embrace and inadequate pressure that came from the workplace. Occupational stress is a chronic condition that can affect a person’s well-being and job performance. When employees are under stress, their ability to focus, making decisions and work effectively will reduce. Which will in turn reduces productivity and negative results on employees’ performance. So, identifying stressors and using management strategies is crucial to maintain an effective work environment. Physical activity is a form of physical workout that requires more energy than rest. Walking, running, dancing, swimming, yoga and gardening are examples of physical activities. Regular physical activity is one of the most important things that improve our health and decline our stress level. It can boost our confidence and feelings that becomes an antidote to manage stress. Effective stress management includes healthy lifestyle practices such as exercise, relaxation strategies and seeking social support. Getting support from colleagues, supervisors or mental health professionals can make a big difference. Although stress is a part of life and effective physical activities is crucial to our overall well-being.",

Manual reminders are effective compared with other interventions. Manual paper reminders combined with other interventions are effective compared with no intervention. Manual paper reminders combined with other interventions are effective compared with manual reminders alone. Manual paper reminders combined with other interventions are effective compared with other intervention. 3 and 4 are not possible if we follow the criteria for selection of the studies (see below, other methodological criteria) I don't know why do we have to make comparison #4, Should we delete comparison #4 and include #5? Effect modifiers: Type of reminder: 1.Reminders that include some individual patient‐specific information are more effective than generic reminders. 2.Reminders that indicate a response should be recorded or given are more effective than reminders that do not. Development of reminder: 3.Reminders developed with the involvement of target clinicians are more effective than reminders developed without their participation. Delivery of reminder: 4.Reminders delivered by or with the knowledge of the target clinician's colleagues or the patient are more effective than reminders delivered by other means. Content of reminder: 5.Reminders that offer explicit advice on patient management are more effective than reminders that offer general information only, eg. about disease prevalence. 6.Reminders that include an explanation of their content or advice are more effective than reminders that do not include this. 7.Reminders that are explicitly from or justified by reference to an influential source are more effective than reminders from another source. An influential source is a person or body likely to be perceived as credible by the target clinician. Behaviour targeted by intervention: 8.Reminders vary in effectiveness according to the type of clinical activity targeted.",

      "abstract": "This chapter discusses verbal and nonverbal communication strategies and tactics that increase leaders' ability to influence project delivery teams. The chapter also covers effective strategies to move teams toward greater productivity through better communication and constructive conflict resolution. Everyone uses and interprets the meanings of words and symbols differently, so during the communication process, even simple messages can result in an entirely different meaning than was intended. Content is the words or symbols of the message that are conveyed through language. Spoken and written words combine into phrases that make grammatical and semantic sense. In addition to words, number sequences such as equations, tables, graphs, images, or architectural symbols that represent spatial or physical elements can also be conveyed through forms of verbal and visual language. Self-involvement is likely one of the greatest barriers to communication. People often focus on themselves in conversations rather than on the other person, which can lead to confusion and conflict. People do not perceive things the same way when under stress, when there is a considerable time constraint, or under budget restrictions. Outside of project-based factors, communication can also be affected by personal tragedy or emotions. Listening is a selective activity, which involves the reception and the interpretation of aural stimuli. It involves decoding sound into meaning. Listening is divided into two main categories: passive and active. Passive listening is little more that hearing. It occurs when the receiver of the message has little motivation to listen carefully, such as when listening to music or television and when being polite.",

A aprendizagem como processo e entendido como a aquisicao de reflexos e emocoes e passam pela formacao de habitos, habilidades, atitudes, valores e raciocinios. A aprendizagem depende de varias condicoes fisiologicas e psicologicas. Em muitos casos os alunos que apresentam problemas de aprendizagem sao, decorrentes da falta de atencao e concentracao, entendimento, valorizacao, dialogo, desajuste familiar, etc. As criancas e adolescentes estao carentes de conhecimento e precisam ser elogiados. No entanto muitas vezes recebem mais criticas do que auxilio e compreensao. Mediante esta concepcao, devemos refletir constantemente sobre a nossa pratica e responsabilidade em promover a construcao de ser sujeito, pesquisador, reflexivo e consciente de suas capacidades e potencialidades. As dificuldades de aprendizagem compreender as descobertas ou disturbios manifestados por dificuldades significativas na aquisicao e uso da escuta, fala leitura, escrita, raciocinio ou capacidades matematicas. Esses transtornos sao intrinsecos ao individuo, provavelmente devido a disfuncao do sistema nervoso central que pode ocorrer durante a vida. Quando as criancas nao se ajustam a instituicao escolar, nao avancam. As autoridades da escola ocasionalmente consideram mais faceis culpar aos alunos, ao inves de examinarem suas proprias deficiencias. Existem muitos casos em que o aluno realmente apresenta limitacoes em algumas aprendizagens, para sintetizar alguns conhecimentos ou por diferentes motivos nao quer aprender. Para muitos nao foram oportunizados as aprendizagens significativas de forma prazerosa e interessante. A escola tambem nao pode representar uma instituicao sem atracao ou motivacao para seus integrantes. Mediante o fracasso causado por uma conjuncao de fatores interligados que impedem o bom desempenho do aluno, destacamos a visao de Smith e Strick onde os mesmos apontam o funcionamento cerebral e os problemas psicologicos envolvendo ambientes domesticos e escolares como fatores que causam dificuldades na aprendizagem.

      "abstract": "More research is emerging that finds workplace anger expression (versus suppression) is more likely to promote positive individual and organizational outcomes.However, many angry employees at work choose to remain silent rather than express their anger.What factors contribute most to this decision?Using content and factor analysis, we identify three key categories of factors that hinder anger expression at work, most to least frequent, respectively: professional courtesy, fear of repercussions, and organizational norms.We argue that rather than self-focused concerns of retaliation or sanctioning, most people fail to speak up when angry because of perceptions that \"professionals\" do not express anger, or the concern that anger expression shows a lack of respect for fellow organizational members.Although this is admirable in its other-oriented (versus self-centered) focus, there is a false assumption that keeping one's anger and concerns hidden about a problematic workplace situation is helpful for the organization.Management can play a key role in changing social norms to allow for honest and helpful expressions of anger by employees without fear of appearing unprofessional or receiving organizational sanctions.",

We discuss one practice used in achieving suspension, an action combination where items such as wait or hang on first identify on-going or emerging multiactivity and are followed by talk that somehow addresses the interactional contingencies involved. We show that suspension turns are indicative of participants’ orientation to incompatibility between multiple courses of action or activities. This may be related to such local contingencies as mobility, temporality and the use of different embodied resources. The database consists of approximately 36 hours of audio- and video-recorded everyday interactions in English and Finnish from a variety of situations. The study employs the methodology of conversation analysis.",

Job burnout can be manifested in the following 3 aspects: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and diminished personal accomplishment. If job burnout is not controlled timely and effectively, it will bring significant and negative effects on their teaching work and personal life. Job burnout is not an over reaction to any specific evident, but an accumulation of stress rising from all sides of life during a long time period. Overall speaking, job burnout is a result of social, organizational, professional and personal factors. Prevention of job burnout can start from organizational management of school and individual management of teachers. Schools or universities should take human oriented management as a measure to prevent happening of job burnout among teachers. At the same time, teachers should make great efforts to adjust themselves from bad situation and create positive motivation for work while they realize that they are in negative emotion and have negative trends.",

Optimum intellectual development should be imparted through interactive sessions only. Interest in the material to be learned is the best stimulus to learning rather than such external goals such as grades or later competitive advantage. Communication is more than verbal in teaching learning process. Although we continually send and receive nonverbal messages, most of us are not fully aware of the ways that we communicate nonverbally. Areas of Nonverbal Communication include all forms of communication that are not part of the language that we speak or write. There are many ways that we reveal ourselves nonverbally for e. g. Eye contact, body language or vocal cues. An awareness of nonverbal communication and nonverbal signals will disclose confidential information or weaknesses in your position.

As anxiety is reduced, the behaviour ceases. Anxiety often returns soon after cessation.

Both of these conditions can interfere with the person’s ability to live his or her life. The division between the two can blur; such distinctions can be less than helpful in that they tend to focus attention on a “condition” rather than encouraging the examination of the origins of behaviour and a constructive approach to alternatives which the individual can utilize in order to restructure his or her style of living.",

Ne pas prendre en compte cette specificite revient en quelque sorte a nier une condition indispensable a tout processus d'apprentissage : le sentiment de pouvoir se tromper en toute securite. A la lumiere de cette condition, nous mettrons en perspective l'apprentissage en situation de travail en montrant qu'il ne va pas de soi : alors que la securite psychologique est une condition indispensable, elle ne se retrouve pas a priori dans toute situation organisationnelle.",

Retention of things learned is the most difficult as well as the most essential of all the memory factors. Memory varies with the individual. Some people have good memories with marvellous powers of retention. Others complain of their inability to retain things. The fixation of memory traces in the mind takes place as soon as the impressions are received. Fixation is a process of consolidation, a process of making all impressions as secure as may be in the memory.",

      "abstract": "We often hear questions like “What must that leader have been thinking?” “What possessed her to do that?” “That leader needs to give his head a shake!” or “It is so disappointing to see the pain caused by one wrong-headed and self-serving leader!” This chapter describes how leaders may subtly fall into rationalization, self-justification, foolishness, and callous indifference through maleficent internal narratives. How is it that leaders who have found the favor of others in the service of a great cause (i.e., the education of children and youth) find themselves sucked into clearly wrong or unthinkably bad actions? In this chapter, vicious (non-virtuous) thinking, inner political churnings, unconscious reinforcement of systemic evil, and hurtful ways of influencing others are explored, named, and challenged.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter discusses spatial attention, working memory, and executive function—cognitive functions that are crucial for communicating, learning, and functioning in society. Spatial attention is important for higher-level processes such as navigating in space, attending to relevant stimuli in the environment, and ignoring irrelevant stimuli. It consists of three primary components: alerting, orienting, and executive control. Working memory refers to a basic cognitive process that allows for temporary storage and manipulation of information necessary for numerous complex cognitive tasks such as language, spatial analysis, and decision-making. Executive functioning is a multidimensional construct that includes higher-order cognitive processes such as initiation, planning, problem-solving, cognitive flexibility, behavioral regulation, metacognition, and feedback utilization.",

      "abstract": "The resource model of self-control casts self-control as a capacity that relies on some limited resource that exhausts with use. The model captured our imagination and brought much needed attention on an important, yet neglected psychological construct. Despite its success, basic issues with the model remain. Here, we ask six questions: (1) Does self-control really wane over time? (2) Is ego depletion a form of mental fatigue? (3) What is the resource that is depleted by ego depletion? (4) How can changes in motivation, perception, and expectations replenish an exhausted resource? (5) Has the revised resource model unwittingly become a model about motivation? (6) Do self-control exercises increase self-control? By providing some answers to these questions — including conducting a meta-analysis of the self-control training literature — we highlight how the resource model needs to be revised, if not supplanted altogether.",

      "title": "Restoring Responsibility: Promoting Justice, Therapy and Reform Through Direct Brain Interventions",
      "abstract": "Direct brain intervention based mental capacity restoration techniques - for instance, psycho-active drugs - are sometimes used in criminal cases to promote the aims of justice. For instance, they might be used to restore a person’s competence to stand trial in order to assess the degree of their responsibility for what they did, or to restore their competence for punishment so that we can hold them responsible for it. Some also suggest that such interventions might be used for therapy or reform in criminal legal contexts - i.e. to make non-responsible and irresponsible people more responsible. However, I argue that such interventions may at least sometimes fail to promote these responsibility-related legal aims. This is because responsibility hinges on other factors than just what mental capacities a person has - in particular, it also hinges on such things as authenticity, personal identity, and mental capacity ownership - and some ways of restoring mental capacity may adversely affect these other factors. Put one way, my claim is that what might suffice for the restoration of competence need not necessarily suffice for the restoration of responsibility, or, put another way, that although responsibility indeed tracks mental capacity it may not always track restored mental capacities.",

This interdependence of outcomes can arise if the material or psychic welfare of others affects my own psychic welfare (Chapter 5). (2) The outcome of each can depend on the actions of all. This interdependence reflects general social causality (Chapter 18), illustrated in such phenomena as (human-made) global warming. (3) The action of each depends on the (anticipated) actions of all. This interdependence is the specific topic of game theory (Chapters 19 and 20), which also integrates (1) and (2) within its framework. (4) The beliefs of each depend on the actions of all. This interdependence can arise by a variety of mechanisms, such as “pluralistic ignorance” or “informational cascades” (Chapter 23). (5) The preferences of each depend on the actions of all. This interdependence is perhaps the least well-understood aspect of social interaction.

Serial position analyses demonstrate that labeling improves performance at recency positions, but has a deleterious effect which increases with age at the primacy positions. With age, children increasingly rely on the use of their own rehearsal strategies to perform in memory tasks. Particular strategies are developed appropriate to particular task situations. Young children who do not rehearse spontaneously can be induced to do so. It is argued that, through experience, the child learns that his behavior determines how well he does. He is thus motivatedto perfect his strategies and to develop new ones.",

Bullying can be directed at individuals, groups of team members, or leaders and can include a variety of behaviors. Disrespectful behaviors are learned, tolerated, and reinforced; a certain degree of disrespect is accepted in some settings. Perioperative team members should use direct and meaningful communication to encourage and contribute to healthy work environments that address conflict and promote patient safety. They should follow applicable zero‐tolerance policies on bullying and report disrespectful behaviors to leaders who, in turn, should address the behavior in a fair manner according to disciplinary guidelines. When disrespectful behaviors are reported and managed appropriately, bullying in the workplace can be minimized or even eliminated, which improves the overall workplace culture.",

Visualisation techniques can improve motor skills, grow muscle strength, increase selfconfidence, attention concentration and decrease anxiety. Through the use of imagery, pain management, endurance, performance motivation and physical performance can also be enhanced in athletes. To achieve the best results, visualisation techniques should include the five major senses (touch, hearing, sight, smell and taste) and should consider key aspects such as perspective, emotion, environment, task and timing. Mental rehearsal (or visualisation) is powerful because the subconscious processes the experience as a real one (by firing those neurons that are responsible for skill acquisition), makes the person calmer and more adapted to stressful situations, and can speed up the learning process in athletes and not only. One hour of mental training a day in 6-10 sequences has a special benefit that cannot be obtained by any other means. By applying both guided imagery techniques and practice, athletes design their mental road maps for success.",

Specifically, the HA effect is more evident when the players have less experience, fewer hours of practice or poorer conditions of practice (e.g., amateur leagues or university competitions). Also, at lower levels, travelling conditions will be more difficult, while players and referees will be less trained to cope with a hostile home crowd. This chapter will focus on the importance of the HA effect in leagues and competitions below the elite professional level and how the contributions of the specific explanations for HA can depend on the level of play.",

      "title": "Enhancing peer instruction in physics: Understanding cognitive processes and refining rules",
      "abstract": "Peer Instruction gives practice in the abstract language of physics, addresses common misconceptions among students, and is more effective than traditional lecturing. However, it is not clear what makes Peer Instruction effective nor how we might improve the method. An emerging perspective is that what makes Peer Instruction effective is how it stimulates certain cognitive processes. Research also indicates that providing rules for discussion may improve the effect of peer instruction. Hence, we wanted to answer two research questions in this study: (i) What cognitive learning processes occur during peer discussions? (ii) How do students follow discussion rules? To answer our research questions, we recorded and thematically analyzed peer discussions during Peer Instruction in an introductory physics course. The most prevalent cognitive process during peer discussions was decoding the problem. The most prevalent type of explanation was explanations with physics concepts, which usually led the students to an incorrect answer. The next most prevalent type of explanation was explanation with physics models, which usually led the students to the correct answer. The students also explained with reference to their experience or examples—intuitive or analogical explanations—and it usually added little to the conversation, was wrong, or created confusion. Some discussion rules had limited impact, prompting suggestions for rule improvements to optimize Peer Instruction. Our work contributes to the literature on Peer Instruction with a cognitively based description of the learning processes and how we might further improve and ensure the effectiveness of Peer Instruction.

The National Standards Project (2015) review of empirically supported interventions for individuals with autism as well as systematic reviews and recent single-case design studies focused on differential reinforcement were used to inform this chapter. Differential reinforcement has been used to effectively increase and decrease numerous types of target behavior (e.g., language, making choices, sports) and has been found beneficial across populations (e.g., individuals with autism with low to high support needs), ages (e.g., early childhood to adulthood), and settings (e.g., clinics, schools, home or residential centers). Differential reinforcement is a flexible approach to intervention that should be individualized based on behavioral assessment and implemented by a qualified practitioner or well-trained caregiver.",

Before you figured out (or read) the answer to that question, did you possess the information that the word that is the answer is an English word that ends in ‘MT’? In a sense, yes: the word was in your vocabulary. But in another sense, no: perhaps you weren’t able to immediately answer the puzzle question. For finite agents, this phenomenon is unavoidable. We often possess a piece of information for some purposes (or with respect to some elicitation conditions) but not for other purposes (or conditions). This suggests that a mental state be represented not by a single batch of information, but rather by an ‘access table’—a function from purposes to batches of information. This representation makes clear what happens during certain ‘aha!’ moments in reasoning. It also allows us to model agents who exhibit imperfect recall, confusion, and mental fragmentation. And it sheds light on the difference between propositional knowledge and knowledge-how. The upshot is that representing mental states using access tables is more fruitful than one might have dreamt.",

      "title": "Collective Intentionality",
      "abstract": "Collective intentionality concerns the intentionality of groups or collectives. Intentionality is the property of being about, directed at, oriented toward, or representing objects, events, properties, and states of affairs. Examples of intentional states (states with intentionality, not just intentions) are belief, desire, hope, intention, admiration, perception, guilt, love, grief, fear, and so on. Collective intentionality involves joint, shared, or group intentionality and the intentionality of members (qua members) of groups that have joint or shared attitudes. More broadly, the study of collective intentionality concerns forms of intentionality that underpin social reality. What is distinctive about the study of collective intentionality within the broader study of social interactions and structures is its focus on the conceptual, ontological, and psychological features of joint or shared actions and attitudes, that is, actions and attitudes of (or apparent attributions of such to) groups or collectives, their relations to individual actions and attitudes, and their implications for the nature of social groups and their functioning. It subsumes collective action, intention, thought, reasoning, emotion, phenomenology, decision-making, responsibility, knowledge, trust, rationality, cooperation, competition, and related issues, and how these underpin social practices, conventions, institutions, and social ontology. The two main theoretical questions in the study of collective intentionality concern the ontology and psychology of collective agency and collective attitudes. The main ontological question is whether we should admit into our ontology group subjects of intentional states or attribute intentionality only to their members. The main psychological questions are, if we admit group subjects of intentional states, first, how to understand what they come to, whether they are the same or different than the intentional states we attribute to individuals and if different exactly how, and, second, what is special about the attitudes of individuals who participate in group action or whose attitudes underpin attributions of intentionality to groups? More specifically, can we understand what is special about the attitudes of individuals who participate in group agency or sustain the potential for group agency in terms of concepts already available in our understanding of individual agency, or must we introduce new concepts either of the modes of intending, believing, etc., or in the contents of such attitudes? Both questions concern the debate between methodological individualists and holists about the social, the first with respect to its ontology, the second with respect to its ideology.",

      "abstract": "O mundo das organizacoes esta cada vez mais competitivo e exigente. As entregas precisam ser realizadas em tempo menor. A qualidade dos resultados e medida atraves da observacao da relacao entre metas e indicadores; estes indicam uma tendencia que definira o atingimento das metas estabelecidas pela empresa. A alta competitividade entre empresas e seus individuos levam os recursos humanos a uma situacao constante e permanente de pressao, elevando os niveis de estresse no ambiente organizacional, aumentando com isso, a probabilidade desses individuos adoecerem. Esta pesquisa pretende identificar quais comportamentos resilientes trabalhadores especialistas de uma empresa possuem. O individuo que possui comportamentos resilientes tem maior resistencia as pressoes sofridas no dia a dia de trabalho, favorecendo um melhor equilibrio entre sua saude fisica e psicologica e desenvolvimento profissional. Por outro lado, encontramos individuos menos resistentes que adoecem frequentemente, provocando altos indices de afastamento do trabalho, gerando demora ou impossibilidade de desenvolvimento profissional. De acordo com alguns autores, a resiliencia pode ser desenvolvida; sendo assim, surge a questao: como podemos desenvolver nestes individuos um perfil resiliente que permita melhores niveis de saude e bem estar. Tem este trabalho o objetivo de observar a resiliencia em 17 funcionarios com cargo de especialista, em diversas areas de uma empresa multinacional de grande porte, atraves da aplicacao do QuestResiliencia, (Barbosa, 2006). A metodologia utilizada e de cunho exploratorio e descritivo. O instrumento utilizado permitiu realizar o mapeamento das crencas que organizam o comportamento resiliente e apresentou como o(a) respondente estrutura os Padroes de crencas face ao estresse. Os resultados revelaram que sao eles: autoconfianca, empatia, autocontrole, otimismo para com a vida, sentido da vida, leitura corporal, conquistar e manter pessoas.",

An important differentiator between different JDM tasks in sport is the timeline, as choices, such as a playmaker's decision to pass to a teammate, can take mere milliseconds, up to much lengthier decisions that can take months or years, such as an athlete's choice to end her career. Sport JDM researchers using the main theoretical approaches we have reviewed have created a strong and growing knowledge base. There are clever and elegant studies, using various methods, and important findings. The study of action choice in sport was particularly accelerated with the use of and ability to easily edit video of gameplay.",

      "title": "Heart, Brain and Behaviour: Interactions That Underpin the Biopsychosocial Model of Care",
      "abstract": "The brain acts as a control centre for a range of human behavioural responses to environmental and social challenges. These responses include eating, drinking, learning, coping with stress, and formation of social bonds. The brain and the heart have a complex but close relationship to each other. They strongly influence, and are influenced by, behaviour (exercise, diet, smoking, sleep, relaxation, risk taking) and behaviour-related factors (anxiety, depression, anger, aggression, risk appraisal, social support, psychological and social stress). The autonomic nervous system provides a two-way connection between the brain and the heart. Ideally, a balance should prevail between the sympathetic and the parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system. In some conditions, excessive sympathetic activity (or parasympathetic underactivity) results in physical and psychological distress and behavioural problems. The interactions between the brain, the heart and behaviour show that while the mind ('psyche') and the body ('soma') are not one, they are not two either. These interactions point to the eminence of the discipline that has been known as Psychosomatic Obstetrics and Gynaecology (Psychosocial or Biopsychosocial Obstetrics and Gynaecology in some countries). Knowledge of the interactions between the brain, heart and behaviour mediated by hormones and neurotransmitters underpins the biopsychosocial model of care. It should be an essential part of the undergraduate and postgraduate training in women's health. Towards that goal, this chapter describes the basic anatomy of the brain, describes role of hormones in the regulation of physiological and social functions by the brain, outlines how cardiac indices could reflect the brain's regulatory function, and links all of these with human behaviour.",

In considering such potentialities, several questions arise: Are any needs morally important, meaning that they operate as morally relevant details of a situation? What is the correct moral stance to take with regard to situations of need? Are moral agents ever required to tend to others’ well-being by meeting their needs? What justification or foundation, if any, can be given for requiring moral agents to respond to others’ needs?",

The context is horse-riding lessons. Riding instructors are shown to teach sustained embodied activities in orientation to four temporalities. Most fundamentally, they co-construct these activities as an ongoing and continuing timeline, for example, by giving action-continuing directives and by projecting continuation prosodically. In addition, instructors attend to the temporal organization of individual component actions of the activity. They situate actions in the past, present, or future along the timeline of the sustained activity; they co-construct the duration of individual actions as flexible; and they orient to individual actions as brief and transient. The analysis reveals practices that do not initiate or respond to specific actions but that accompany an activity as such, treating progression itself as a target for instruction and calling into question the often-assumed sequential adjacency of action pairs.",

They underpin the consistency with which we think, act and feel across different situations and over time. Adult personality traits are thought to be derived from early life differences in temperament; these are partly genetically determined and shape exposure to social experiences.1 There have been many taxonomies of personality traits, but research over the past 20 years has converged on the view that there are five broad personality dimensions, each of which accommodates a number of lower-order traits. The five factors are: extraversion or positive emotionality (incorporating traits such as sociability, energy, shyness and dominance/subordination); neuroticism or negative emotionality (including lower-order traits such as proneness to anxiety, irritability, sadness, insecurity and guilt); conscientiousness (factors such as reliability, carefulness, persistence and self-control); agreeableness (cooperativeness, consideration, generosity, kindness and politeness); and openness to experience (imaginativeness, insight and aesthetic sensitivity). Individuals vary on all these dispositions, so each person is thought to have a particular combination of trait strengths. Personality traits predict a range of outcomes with moderate consistency, including quality of social and family relationships, marital status and satisfaction, occupational choices, political attitudes and criminality.2\n\nThe role of personality in coronary heart disease (CHD) …",

The most robustly deflationary answer to the question of what is involved in basic action understanding comes from empiricist approaches which hold that all that is required is sensitivity to behavioural and environmental factors. This chapter lays out exactly what such a behaviour-reading model might look like, exploring the approach, first, as it emerges in comparative and developmental research, second, as grounded in the activity of so-called mirror neurons, and, finally, in the form of so-called regulative and submentalizing models.",

      "title": "The Learning Helix.",
      "abstract": "This paper discusses a mental model of learning based on the processes of attention, perception, processing, and application. The learning process starts with attention, such as curiosity, excitement, expectation, or fear; in pedagogy this is called motivation. New impressions are dependent on and interpreted against the background of previous experience and learning, or frame of reference. One oi the main reasons for using pictures in magazines, newspapers, and books is to draw attention to the material; in the case o2 moving images, the visual material and presentation must constantly redraw the attention to hold the viewer's interest. The concept is a collective designation for the processes in which an individual obtains information on the outside world. The laws of perception include: figure/ground contrast; similarity; proximity; continuity; closure; common fate; objective set; contrast; and previous experience. Information processing and storage is referred to as memory. Memory functions include sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory; forgetting is the process through which information in memory becomes inaccessible. Results from several experiments show that when contents are the same in visual, audio, and print channels, learning is maximized. After the attention, perception, and processing of information, new knowledge can be applied and tested in different applications. Four figures depict these processes, including the combination of all processes in the learning helix model. (Contains 51 references.)

      "abstract": "This article focuses on proactive techniques that have proven effective in controlling the misbehavior ofstudents with learning disabilities in both regular and special education classrooms. Highlighted are three major categories of alternatives for handling misbehavior: (a) preventative planning techniques, (b) anticipatory response techniques, and (c) systematic interventions. Emphasized are preventative planning techniques since misbehavior in most settings can be prevented from occurring. Such techniques are the easiest to teach to others and do not require a great deal of time, effort, and training. Specific preventative planning techniques, including teacher movement, social modeling, attention and approval, and rules, are described in detail. Vmous anticipatory response techniques and brief descriptions of some systematic interventions are additionally inclUded.",

      "title": "Building on Diversity: A Moment-to-Moment Analysis of Students Collaboratively Solving Mathematics Problems.",
      "abstract": "Differences among students can yield rich benefits as well as pose difficult problems during collaborative learning. Students can draw on diverse individual experiences to exchange information, to understand different expressions of shared commonalities, and to construct new possibilities jointly. However, they also face the potential pitfalls of entrenching themselves in opposition to different views, dismissing other perspectives as less important or valid, and misinterpreting others. To examine how individual actions create these benefits and problems, a three-dimensional space is defined, created from the dimensions of evaluation of the previous action (supportive, critical, or unresponsive), problem knowledge content (contribution, repetition, and null), and interactive form (command, question, and statement). Analysis of particular patterns of individual actions indicates how they create beneficial or harmful interactions. Three examples of conversations taking place during collaborative problem solving in an algebra class show how particular individual actions can facilitate or hinder students' collaborative learning. Educators can use a framework developed through this analysis as a collaboration and assessment tool to help students benefit from their individual experiences.

      "abstract": "Constructivism, social cognitive theory (SCT), situated learning theory and activity theory come from different traditions, but all recognise the role of context in learning and can be applied to simulation-based education. Simulation is suited to a constructivist approach as it is highly experiential, requiring mental and physical activity and affords the opportunity for reflection. SCT is primarily Albert Bandura's work and is congruent with constructivism. Two key concepts in SCT are ‘self-efficacy’ and ‘self-regulation’, both of which Bandura suggests are essential to learning. Situated learning theory reinforces the need for educators and learners to highlight and manage the ways in which the ‘real’ practice environment will vary from the simulated learning environment. Change of practice or learning can occur where there are serious contradictions within the activity system - in the example, the doctor may never provide advice and the practised division of labour may be in conflict with the actual rules.",

Emotional distress is a broad term that can refer to a wide range of symptoms from a variety of mental health disorders. Anyone can experience emotional distress, even if they do not meet the criteria for any psychological disorder. Whether or not a mental health problem is present, emotional distress can be overwhelming effect on daily functioning. The workplace can be a stressful environment, and while some stress may be motivating, too much is often overwhelming. The major causes of emotional distress related to work may include concerns about job security or job performance. Sometimes, circumstances build and combine in unexpected ways to cause distress for relationships with colleagues or managers. A person can experience poor working conditions in any workplace and at all levels of an organization. Among the many possible causes of emotional distress at home are personal or environmental factors, such as: experiencing relationship problems with partners, other family members, or friends. It may include living in a neighborhood that faces inequity and a deprivation of resources.",

The main aim of this program is to intervene in those failures, trying to improve the quality of life of this population sector, more and more numerous.The specific objectives of this Program are: to inform on what it is, how it works and how it is possible to improve the memory; to learn a wide range of useful strategies to obtain it; and to modify attitudes and beliefs on the memory of older people. The phases of the Program are: 1. Pre training evaluation: a battery of test, that have relation with the tasks and strategies that they are going to handle in the training sessions, is administered. 2. Training program: it consists of nine sessions of 90 minutes of duration each one, with a frequency of two sessions per week. In the sessions they deal with attention, concentration, memory, perception, language, etc., through the learning of the following strategies: association, categorization, visualization, repetition, etc. Each session has its own objectives, tasks and strategies to learn. There are 10 or 12 people in each group. 3. Posttraining evaluation: it is applied when finalizing the nine sessions of training. The same wide range of tests than in the first evaluation is administered (different forms or versions). 4. Final evaluation: it is made to the six months of the application of the training program. It tries to measure if the subjects keep on using the learnt strategies. 5. Monitoring sessions: during the six months mentioned, two monitoring sessions are carried out to fix the strategies to learnt. 6. Evaluation of the program: an evaluation of human and material resources employed and activities is made, just like the satisfaction with the program. At the present time, this program has been applied to 34 older than sixty people, and the results obtained demonstrate the existence of a clear improvement after the training, which is maintained six months after. But in addition to the mentioned improvement, the data show a reduction in the levels of anxiety and depression.",

As the therapeutic relationship is often experienced as an intimate, emotionally charged, asymmetrical, and nurturant relationship, psychotherapy is likely to activate many attachment-related patterns of thought, feeling, and conflict. Typical examples of therapeutic immediacy include: exploring parallels of how interpersonal and affective themes covered in other relationships during a session might be expressed or occur in the therapeutic relationship; expressing an immediate in-session affect or association regarding the therapeutic relationship or treatment process; asking one member of the therapeutic relationship to take the perspective of the other; asking one or both parties to reflect on/process what is happening in the immediate therapeutic interaction or feeling in the room; exploring emotional experiences in the relationship that might have been avoided or gone unrecognized and addressing a rupture event.",

Programs have effectively developed behaviors related to self-care, social interaction, general deportment, work competence, language usage, and academic achievement, to mention major target areas. In spite of the successes achieved, or perhaps in light of them, several issues have become important in implementing or evaluating behavior modification programs. It is frequently assumed that if staff perform appropriately, consequences that follow their behavior will maintain the behaviors. This is probably a naive view of the natural contingencies and their power in shaping staff behavior. Unresponsiveness of clients to behavior modification programs can be attributed to other aspects of reinforcement or its delivery.",

      "abstract": "A teenager goes off on an eating binge whenever she feels lonely or depressed. A bank manager runs for hours each morning to take his mind off his impending divorce. A politician is struggling to hide her joy over a rival’s downfall during a press conference. A CEO practices yoga to handle the stress of her demanding work life. A student works through a childhood trauma by keeping a diary on his innermost feelings. In these and in many other situations in everyday life, people are at once engaged in the selfregulation of action (briefly, selfregulation) and the selfregulation of emotion (briefly, emotion regulation). Selfregulation and emotion regulation are often so intertwined that it is hard to say where one ends and the other begins. Over the past few decades, both types of regulation have become the focus of considerable theoretical and empirical research (for reviews, see Baumeister, Schmeichel, & Vohs, 2007; Koole, 2009; for comprehensive overviews, see Gross, 2007; this volume). Nevertheless, the interface between selfregulation and emotion regulation has only recently received systematic attention. Learning how selfregulation interfaces with emotion regulation is likely to generate important new insights into both processes. Among other things, selfregulation research may illuminate how people function as active agents in managing their emotional lives. Conversely, emotion regulation research may illuminate how people direct their actions in emotionarousing contexts. In this chapter, we contribute to the ongoing integration between selfregulation and emotion regulation research by reviewing contemporary research on the selfregulation of emotion. Our plan in this chapter is fourfold. First, we consider the emotion part of emotion regulation by discussing the kinds of responses that people may target in the emotion regulation process. Second, we turn to the regulation part of emotion regulation by discussing the control processes that may underlie emotion regulation. Here, we",

      "abstract": "Whereas some actions are aimed at changing the world, others are aimed at learning about it. For example, someone might press on a door to open it, or to determine whether it is locked; someone might shake a container to shuffle its contents, or to figure out what’s inside. The distinction between ‘pragmatic’ and ‘epistemic’ actions is recognized in other fields—but do people naturally make this distinction when observing others? Here, 4 experiments show that naive observers infer the pragmatic or epistemic intent of another person’s action, in ways that suggest hierarchical organization of goal representations. We filmed naive subjects playing a ‘box-shaking’ game with either an epistemic goal (e.g., determining the number of objects inside an opaque box) or a pragmatic goal (e.g., shuffling the box’s contents). Then, separate subjects observed these videos and inferred the actors’ goals: Who was trying to learn something, and who was trying to do something? Regardless of whether they were informed (Experiment 1) or uninformed (Experiment 2) of candidate actions, observers distinguished pragmatic from epistemic goals, based purely on the box-shaking dynamics. Moreover, when asked to label each video’s corresponding action, ‘swapping’ errors revealed that pragmatic actions were more confusable with one another, as were epistemic actions—a hallmark of hierarchical processing (Experiment 3). Finally, these effects emerged with free responses (Experiment 4). These results suggest that observers are sensitive not only to an actor’s specific goal, but also that goal’s ‘type’: Learning looks different from doing — and people can tell.",

      "title": "Motivationale und volitionale Prozesse zu sportlicher Aktivität bei älteren Menschen im Altersheim und deren Veränderung durch ein Krafttrainingsprogramm",
      "abstract": "Viele altere Menschen wollen ja aktiv sein, sich sportlich bewegen, etwas fur ihre Gesundheit tun. Sie sind richtig motiviert dazu, doch irgendwie schaffen es viele dann doch nicht die Schwelle der Trage und Faulheit oder sonstige Hindernisse zu uberwinden, die sie davon abhalten, ihre sportlichen Vorhaben in die Tat umzusetzen. Auch Senioren und Seniorinnen im Altersheim wollen kontinuierlich mehr sportlich aktiv sein und bei angebotenen Bewegungsprogrammen mitmachen. Fur die konkrete Verwirklichung ihrer diesbezuglichen Absichten, benotigen sie oftmals Unterstutzung bzw. gute Gegenstrategien und Selbstkontrolle. \r\nDiese Arbeit gibt Aufschluss daruber, welche motivationalen und volitionalen Prozesse und Determinanten zu sportlicher Aktivitat altere Menschen im Altersheim haben, insbesondere um bei einem Krafttrainingsprogramm teilzunehmen, aufrechtzuerhalten und es womoglich selbststandig weiterfuhren zu wollen. Daruber hinaus wurde analysiert, ob sich und wie sich diese Prozesse durch den Einfluss eines Krafttrainings verandern. \r\nDer entscheidende Grund fur eine Untersuchung dieses Themas lag einerseits darin, um den Mangel an Forschungsbestanden und Wissen daruber, speziell fur die Zielgruppe der Senioren und Seniorinnen in Altersheimen, entgegenzuwirken. Andererseits wurde diese Forschungsarbeit gewahlt, um einen besseren Einblick in das Leben alterer Menschen in Heimen zu bekommen und durch Gesprache bzw. Befragungen uber ihre motivationalen und volitionalen Prozesse zu sportlicher Aktivitat, auch ihre Einstellung dazu ein wenig positiv zu beeinflussen.\r\nDazu wurde mittels geeigneter Literatur und ahnlicher Studien, speziell fur die Zielgruppe der Teilnehmer und Teilnehmerinnen des Forschungsprojekts Active-Ageing im Alter 65+, ein Fragebogen erstellt und mittels diesem Befragungen durchgefuhrt. Die daraus gewonnen Ergebnisse, anhand empirisch quantitativer Analyse der Fragebogen, wurden mit den Erkenntnissen aus dem Theorieteil verglichen, um daraus resultierend Anregungen zu geben. \r\nAufgrund der Resultate konnten vielerlei volitionale und motivationale Prozesse der teilnehmenden Senioren und Seniorinnen des Krafttrainingsprogramms festgestellt und in dieser Arbeit angefuhrt werden. Hauptmotivation, warum altere Menschen in Heimen sportlich aktiv bzw. bei einem solchen Bewegungsprogramm mitmachen wollen ist, um ihre korperliche Gesundheit zu erhalten bzw. verbessern, damit sie keine Gehhilfe (Rollator) bekommen oder womoglich auf der Bettenstation landen. Die meisten denken daran, wie gut sie sich nach der korperlichen Betatigung fuhlen werden oder fuhren sich zuvor die Vorteile dieses Trainings nochmal vor Augen, um ihre Hindernisse strategisch leichter uberwinden zu konnen. Ihre Konsequenzerwartungen vor dem Programm stimmen vorwiegend mit ihren Konsequenzerfahrungen des Programms uberein, womit eine Zufriedenheit der Teilnehmer und Teilnehmerinnen entsteht und viele deshalb auch die Absicht haben, das angelernte Training zukunftig selbststandig weiterzufuhren. Uber dies sind die meisten teilnehmenden Personen des Active-Ageing-Programms sogenannte Lebenszeitsportler, welche uber ihr ganzes Leben hinweg immer regelmasig sportlich aktiv waren. Aus diesem Grund fallt diesen Sporttypen auch noch in den spateren Jahren etwas leichter, bei Bewegungsprogrammen mitzumachen. Bei der Analyse von motivationalen und volitionalen Komponenten uber einen bestimmten Zeitraum hinweg, konnten keine signifikanten Veranderungen (Ausnahme bildet die Selbstwirksamkeit) durch den Einfluss eines Krafttrainingsprogramms identifiziert werden.\r\nAus dieser Arbeit lasst sich auch folgern, dass bei zukunftig angebotenen Bewegungsprogrammen in Altersheimen ganz besondere Unterstutzung und Hilfe fur jene altere Menschen gegeben werden sollte, die zwar motiviert sind, aber nicht wissen wie sie ihre Absichten umsetzen konnen. Denn Viele waren fruher nicht sehr sportlich aktiv, weil sie dazu oft gar keine Moglichkeit hatten bzw. fruher das Wissen uber den positiven Zusammenhang von Gesundheit und sportlicher Aktivitat noch nicht so stark vertreten war, wie heute. Mit diesen Programmen konnte zukunftig den immer mehr alter werdenden Menschen (2050: 28% der osterreichischen Bevolkerung uber 65 Jahre, 53% sind 20-64 Jahre und 18% unter 19 Jahre ), so lange wie moglich die Chance auf korperliche Gesundheit und Fitness gegeben werden.",

      "title": "Faking in Personnel Selection",
      "abstract": "Faking has been defined in several ways but generally refers to intentional distortion of responses on psychological measures. This behavior is a potential concern in personnel selection contexts because applicants who are motivated to obtain a job might consciously distort their responses on selection measures in an attempt to increase their chances of receiving a job offer, especially when perceiving their true ability and qualifications to be inadequate. More specifically, job applicants may exaggerate or completely fabricate positive qualities and downplay or completely deny negative qualities. Although the reasoning underlying concerns regarding faking in personnel selection is fairly easy to understand, the antecedents, nature, and consequences of faking have turned out to be less straightforward. As a result, researchers and practitioners have devoted substantial time and attention to these issues in an attempt to understand faking and address it in practical selection contexts by preventing this behavior or measuring and adjusting assessment processes to account for it. This article focuses on major examples of this work. Much of the empirical research, theoretical development, and practical interventions in this area focus specifically on self-report personality measures, but the psychological processes can often be generalized to other measures in selection such as employment interviews or biographical data inventories. The focus on personality likely stems in part from the potential practical benefits of using these measures in selection (e.g., they are easy to administer and have demonstrated criterion-related validity) and the perception that they are easily faked, as they do not imply a strictly correct answer (in contrast with cognitive tests). Thus, key examples of work on personality measures and other assessments are covered.",

      "title": "Delegation: developing the habit.",
      "abstract": "Often, individuals take personal delegation skills for granted and assume the presence of expertise with the practice of delegation, which may not be the case. Those assumptions can be found at both ends of the process, with the manager and the employee. Every time a manager places an employee in a job and gives him or her a job description or a set of instructions, the manager has delegated. The manager has placed someone in a position to perform operations for which ultimately the manager is responsible. Delegation is both a process and a condition. The process is the act of assigning work to an employee; the condition of delegating a job is a thorough and mutual understanding between the supervisor and the employee of specific results and methods by which these results can be achieved. The condition goes far beyond the simple process of assigning a job. The point at which many managers fail in delegating is in neglecting to move past the process and take the required steps to establish a true condition of delegation. Failure to delegate is the leading cause of managers retarding their professional growth. In the case of a workaholic--someone who fails to learn the value of delegation--the job soon becomes too much, and the effectiveness of the department may suffer. By reducing the burden of technical duties and busy work, managers will find that it is possible to be more effective and actually spend more time managing. A number of the reasons why managers fail to delegate are complex and subconscious, such as insecurity, fear of competition and even fear of not being recognized for accomplishments achieved. Other reasons for failing to delegate are habit and shortages of staff members or time. Delegation is an investment in time. The eventual gain from such an investment, which may temporarily cause the department to fall further behind during a training period, outweighs the costs. The manager is the final authority in such duties as approval, recommendations and implementations. Remember that to delegate authority does not mean to delegate ultimate responsibility. Only the manager should bear the burden of responsibilities that directly affect his or her career. One of the most common mistakes in the process of delegating is to turn an employee loose on a job with inadequate instruction. Too often this is caused by lack of time. Strictly speaking, when managers assign tasks to employees, they are delegating the authority to perform the task. However, all responsibility for the completion of the task remains with the manager. In most instances, responsibility for the failure of a delegated project lies with the manager, not the employee. While some failure is to be expected, it can be minimized by proper evaluation of the situation and proper communication. Delegation is a calculated risk. The manager should be willing to take a risk to see if an employee does have the skills and ability to perform the specific task. How else will the manager ever know? Developing a strong habit of delegation will lead to development of an effective and efficient staff and department. Delegation will serve not only the organization well, but also managers throughout their careers.",

      "title": "Modelling Perspectives to Support Multiple Information Demands",
      "abstract": "When viewing the world each of us has a unique perception of his/her surrounding. The way and mode we use to notice important and interesting details is heavily influenced by things like our education, our academic discipline, or our personal interests. The cognitive patterns we prefer, our (working) habits, and in general our focus are often affected by our way to perceive the world. In contexts like multidisciplinary research projects, companies with various diverse departments, or so to say in contexts where many modes of perception and thus many different interest foci shall collaborate, this can be challenging. Different groups need different information to perform their working tasks. Different (data) structures, formats, and namespaces are requested. Even when examining the exact same object different experts will have different perspectives. In this paper we will approach this situation from a data managers point of view. In general these perspectives are no indicator for deficiencies. The different perspectives just mirror the differing tasks and purposes which are addressed. Mostly the existing structures and forms of information (re)presentation are reasonable and adapted to the needs of the people following the perspective. Nevertheless the amount of perspectives is possibly numerous, as potentially each task requires a slightly different way of structuring the available information. Thus it is in the general case infeasible to maintain all possible perspectives as physical data structures. We therefore suggest to systematically describe perspectives and use the information from these models to generate appropriate interfaces on demand.",

The need to diagnose before treatment is obvious. Sometimes, however, this is not fully accomplished, and targeted symptoms (e.g., psychosis, excitement, trouble keeping a job) get treated rather than the processes underlying the symptoms. The problems with this “target symptom” approach are discussed in the pharmacology section of this chapter.",

Communication and interaction in a team implies the importance of the ability to work together with others, developed communication skills and the ability to work collectively. Task motivation is provided by personal motivational attitudes that support readiness to perform military duties, including commitment to duty and achievement of strategic objectives. The speed of decision-making under stressful conditions, the ability to effectively and quickly make decisions under limited time and during stressful situations affects the successful completion of tasks. The general readiness of military personnel is determined by their socio-psychological characteristics, which allow them to work effectively in a team environment and ensure a high level of task performance even under conditions of stress and danger. The criteria are integrated to create an effective command environment and ensure successful military operations. The balance between these criteria allows servicemen to meet the requirements of the modern combat environment and ensures the success of the assigned tasks.",

      "title": "Emotional intelligence, success and psychological adaptability to the environment as factors in ensuring the effectiveness of social management",
      "abstract": "Abstract: The problems of emotional intelligence (emotional quotient, EQ), success and psychological adaptability to the environment in the complex and systemic integrity are important factors in ensuring the effectiveness of social administration. The modern form of social administration involves the factors of emotional leadership and emotion management, including the ability to connect with people, inspire and encourage them, keep them highly motivated and achieve the development and prosperity of the social organisation as a whole. The concept of «emotional intelligence» is closely related to the categories of «social success» and «psychological adaptability to the environment». The latter two factors should be interpreted as a consequence of sufficient development of emotional intelligence of a fully developed person. People due to objective reasons have different levels of EQ. Following this, they are differentiated as either socially successful or not socially successful, adaptive or not susceptible to the mechanisms of psychological adaptation to the environment. This differentiation is partly a genetic predisposition of a person to manifest organisational abilities and leadership qualities, but no less important are the purposeful and organised efforts of people to learn, develop and self-improve their emotional and intellectual qualities. In social management it is of particular importance, because it significantly affects the effectiveness of interaction between objects and subjects of administration, thus creating a favourable emotional climate in the team or, on the contrary, contributing to the rise of negative, pessimistic and emotionally unstable moods in the managed community.&#x0D; Research methods. When studying the problems of emotional intelligence, success and psychological adaptability to the environment, the author used a wide range of methods of cognition, which are developed and tested by modern socio-psychological science. Among them there are analysis and synthesis, induction and deduction, observation, survey, method of analysing documents and results of social activity.&#x0D; Results. As a result, the author proposes a number of theoretical and methodological constructs and practical guidelines for social managers, which enable them to take into account the emotional content of administratively significant information, to maintain a proper sensual atmosphere of communication, to minimise socio-psychological conflictogens and to suppress unconstructive interaction between people.",

A compreensão deste tema possibilita o delineamento de intervenções que possam melhorar a qualidade de vida da população idosa, tendo em vista as tendências mundiais de mudança na constituição da pirâmide etária. Durante o envelhecimento, ainda possua alto grau de escolarização, o ser humano passa por declínios cognitivos relacionados à idade (também chamado de envelhecimento cognitivo). Mesmo durante o envelhecimento típico (não patológico), há evidências de que o envelhecimento se relaciona ao declínio em diferentes graus em algumas habilidades cognitivas, como memória de trabalho, funções executivas, velocidade de processamento, memória episódica; ainda que haja um crescimento no vocabulário. Há também crescentes evidências de que os déficits relacionados à idade são moderados por outros fatores importantes, como metas, motivação e conhecimentos prévios. Como exemplos de intervenções, serão trazidos estudos sobre aperfeiçoamento da flexibilidade cognitiva através de operações focadas em treino de raciocínio e argumentação. Também serão relatados resultados de um estudo empírico realizado pelos autores com 15 idosos num programa de intervenção focado em argumentação adaptado para pessoas idosas, com duração de 10 semanas. Os resultados deste estudo sugerem que, quando comparado ao início da intervenção, houve maior densidade de flexibilização do raciocínio e menor densidade de polarização do raciocínio dos participantes ao final da intervenção. A escassez de estudos nesta área se constitui num campo promissor que abre uma importante agenda de pesquisa, especialmente num mundo no qual se observam mudanças na constituição da pirâmide etária.",

      "abstract": "In this article, the problems faced by professional employees with time management are discussed. Through empathic listening method, 10 people working in the professional field were interviewed in depth. The problems of being stuck between work, family and other tasks and not being able to realize themselves were examined. Especially, professionals have a high sense of responsibility which blocks the holistic time management. The importance of what one should do in life as a priority in time management was revealed. When people's priorities and responsibilities other than themselves dominate, time management turns into performance management determined by others. It focuses on how to allocate certain hours of the day from a mathematical perspective. It was understood that time management should be evaluated in psychology and social psychology as well as administrative sciences. Based on the interviews, a 3-step time management model was proposed. The first step is to recognize oneself. It is the determination of what the person wants to do in life by revealing the intrinsic motivation elements. The second step is to communicate around them, convey their demands and share their responsibilities. The third step is to create reasonable pressure on oneself to complete the work (extrinsic motivation). Extrinsic motivation is not separate from intrinsic motivation but complementary.",

Most of these behavioral rules can be expressed as relatively simple \"if-then\" statements which correspond to stimulus-response pairs based upon a change in the internal or motivational state of the individual. These processes involve multiple interactions (the individuals or events are numerous) in the form of positive or negative feedback loops. These interactions modify the characteristics of the system and provide new stimuli for further interactions. In these systems, forms of positive feedback, such as recruitment, often involve specific behaviors by individuals; in contrast, the negative feedback often arises \"automatically \" as a result of the limits or constraints in the system (e.g. the depletion of building materials or the consumption of food).",

      "title": "Learning from others’ emotions",
      "abstract": "This chapter provides a theoretical discussion of the boundaries of affective social learning (ASL), focusing on the conditions under which ASL takes place and the processes underlying ASL. In other words, the question is not so much what, but rather how we learn from others' emotions. I propose three conditions that form a minimal requirement for others' emotional reactions to have an initial impact on an individual: (1) the source (displaying the emotion and from whom the target learns) needs to show some emotional expression; (2) the target pays attention to the source, and is aware of the source's focus of attention and the relevance of the emotion expression for him or her; (3) the source needs to put some trust in the source's judgement or evaluation of the world. I next discuss the conditions under which we are most motivated to learn from others – when we are in an uncertain or ambiguous situation, for example, but also when the target experiences or expresses emotions, which can then be regulated by the source. This form of ASL may form the basis of emotional psychopathology in families, where children's emotions are often met with depressed, anxious or indifferent reactions by their parents, through which children unintentionally learn inappropriate emotional responses. Different types of learning are then discussed that may be involved in ASL, ranging from fear conditioning to cognitive learning.",

      "title": "Digital Games and Mindfulness Apps: Comparison of Effects on Post Work Recovery (Preprint)",
      "abstract": "<sec> <title>BACKGROUND</title> Engagement in activities that promote the dissipation of work stress is essential for post work recovery and consequently for well-being. Previous research suggests that activities that are immersive, active, and engaging are especially effective at promoting recovery. Therefore, digital games may be able to promote recovery, but little is known about how they compare with other popular mobile activities, such as mindfulness apps that are specifically designed to support well-being. </sec> <sec> <title>OBJECTIVE</title> The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the effectiveness of a digital game and mindfulness app in promoting post work recovery, first in a laboratory setting and then in a field study. </sec> <sec> <title>METHODS</title> Study 1 was a laboratory experiment (n=45) in which participants’ need for recovery was induced by a work task, before undertaking 1 of 3 interventions: a digital game (Block! Hexa Puzzle), a mindfulness app (Headspace), or a nonmedia control with a fidget spinner (a physical toy). Recovery in the form of how energized participants felt (energetic arousal) was compared before and after the intervention and how recovered participants felt (recovery experience) was compared across the conditions. Study 2 was a field study with working professionals (n=20), for which participants either played the digital game or used the mindfulness app once they arrived home after work for a period of 5 working days. Measures of energetic arousal were taken before and after the intervention, and the recovery experience was measured after the intervention along with measures of enjoyment and job strain. </sec> <sec> <title>RESULTS</title> A 3×2 mixed analysis of variance identified that, in study 1, the digital game condition increased energetic arousal (indicative of improved recovery) whereas the other 2 conditions decreased energetic arousal (F2,42=3.76; P=.03). However, there were no differences between the conditions in recovery experience (F2,42=.01; P=.99). In study 2, multilevel model comparisons identified that neither the intervention nor day of the week had a significant main effect on how energized participants felt. However, for those in the digital game condition, daily recovery experience increased during the course of the study, whereas for those in the mindfulness condition, it decreased (F1,18=9.97; P=.01). Follow-up interviews with participants identified 3 core themes: detachment and restoration, fluctuations and differences, and routine and scheduling. </sec> <sec> <title>CONCLUSIONS</title> This study suggests that digital games may be effective in promoting post work recovery in laboratory contexts (study 1) and in the real world, although the effect in this case may be cumulative rather than instant (study 2). </sec>",

      "abstract": "We study theoretically and experimentally how the bracketing of non-binding goals in a repeated task affects the level of goals that people set for themselves, the actual effort provided, and the pattern of effort over time. In our model, a sophisticated or (partially) naive individual faces a motivational problem because of present-biased preferences. Using an online, real-effort experiment that varied whether subjects set separate daily goals for how much to work over a one-week period or one weekly goal, we find support for the theoretical predictions. Subjects with daily goals set higher goals in aggregate and provided more effort than those with a weekly goal. The higher effort was driven by the higher goals set. Additional treatments complemented internal commitment through goals with an externally enforced minimum work requirement to get started working each day. Here, average performance dropped because of high dropout.",

      "abstract": "Prospective memory (PM) refers to the ability to perform planned activities in the appropriate future situations. It needs to be planned in advance and processed through multiple stages such as encoding, retention, retrieval, and execution, which usually require more attention resources. Impulsivity trait individuals are usually characterized by lack of consideration, premature expression, excessive risk-taking and easy to make inappropriate reaction, so they are more likely to show disadvantages in PM. Nevertheless, increasing the importance of PM tasks can promote more adequate and effective cue encoding, and encourage individuals to devote attention to PM tasks, which may change the disadvantage of impulsivity individuals in PM performance.",

A much more reasonable assumption is that a number of these operations carry on outside the bounds of awareness and produce results or outputs that eventually are used by centrally controlled processes. In this article I consider the implications of this assumption for (a) the memory representation of specific reading episodes, and (b) the role played by such memory representations when material is read on multiple occasions. Special consideration will be given to a form of memory for reading episodes that appears to operate outside the domain of executive control processes.",

      "title": "What is coping? A critical review of the construct and its application in audiology",
      "abstract": "The term 'coping' is increasingly used in audiology, in particular by researchers and clinicians interested in the psychosocial aspects of hearing disorders. Coping has been defined as the process of managing demands (external or internal) that are appraised as taxing or exceeding the resources of the person. It is seen as a process involving at least two stages: primary appraisal (is this something to bother about?), and secondary appraisal (what can I do about it?). It is proposed to serve two distinct purposes: to do away with the problem (i.e. problem-focused coping), and to regulate emotional reactions (emotion-focused coping). The following observations are made: (1) there is a lack of correspondence between what people in general mean by coping and how the concept is used in research; (2) coping is most often measured by checklists with questionable validity; (3) the outcome of using different coping strategies is largely unexplored; and (4) what is regarded as coping in some circumstances (e.g. telling about your hearing impairment) can become a problem in another situation, or even the same situation (e.g. stigma). Finally, some recommendations regarding the future use of the coping construct in audiology arc made.",

      "abstract": "With the further development of linguistics, people gradually realize that emotional factors and foreign language teaching are closely related.Foreign language learning efficiency depends not only on the level of students' cognitive ability, but also on the positive or negative factors in the process of English learning.The current foreign language education should get rid of the following two misunderstandings.Firstly, pay attention to the development of knowledge and intelligence but neglect the development of emotion, which result in the \"emotional illiteracy\".Secondly, ignore the relationship between emotion and cognition, especially the effect of emotion on promoting or blocking language learning.In education, we emphasize on the cultivation of cognitive ability and in the process of developing cognitive ability, we ignore the influence of emotion.The practice has proved that the solution of emotional problems is helpful to improve the students' learning effect and develop the function of positive emotions such as self-esteem, confidence and motivation.However, in the practical English teaching, many teachers pay less attention to the emotional factors, or though they want to pay attention to them, but the training and inspiration go the wrong way and fail to bring the emotional factors' in English learning into role.Teachers should pay attention to the students' will, emotion and needs and attach importance to the establishment of a good relationship between teachers and students, so as to form a suitable learning atmosphere with emotional rapport.Strengthen the positive emotional communication, and make it \"catalyst\", \"stabilizer\" and \"lubricant\" in the process of English teaching.",

They monitor one another's cooperative behaviors to detect any (potential) problems in alignment and affiliation. The present study describes one interactional strategy Japanese speakers use to deal with detected problems in three nonmain sequences (i.e., side, preexpansion, and postexpansion sequences). In the practice I call anchoring shared knowledge, the action (or activity) initiator uses the utterance-final desho to request ratification of shared knowledge from the recipient. Positioning of this request relative to the main action makes the desho-speaker's action interpretable to the recipient as seeking alignment to and affiliation with the main action. The study demonstrates (a) the interactants' constant attention to alignment and affiliation, (b) their orientation to the relevance of local practices to the main action or activity, and (c) the complex interrelationships between epistemics, actions, and social relations.",

Two-term shaping changes properties of actions by the timing of reinforcement that selects extremes of a learner's current performance. Shaping occurs whether or not anyone is aware that it is going on. Two-term shaping is also called \"free operant\" shaping. Shaping is a process of building new behavior by selecting the best properties of a student's actions with reinforcement. Shaping new behavior, as in programmed instruction, involves providing prompts at first. Subsequently the prompts may be made more difficult to see (literally \"fading\"), or parts of prompts are removed bit by bit (\"vanishing\"). Effective teaching begins at current levels of skill and builds to more complex performances. Many educational techniques break down advanced skills into successive approximations, the steps that students carry out as they progress.",

      "abstract": "Competence with emergent intuitive awareness, from fringe-of-consciousness hunches to compelling difference-in-kind realisations, is an imprecise qualitative skill and, on this basis, one generally overlooked in clinical psychology training and supervision. This situation is at marked odds with an expanding literature highlighting that intuitions emerging from unconscious inferential cognition serve as a primary resource in the decision-making of expert practitioners across a dissimilar range of professions. Additionally, (i) over forty years extensive and distinct research into working memory conclusively demonstrates that System 1 autonomous inferential reasoning is the mind’s powerhouse, yet moreover (ii) plays a determining role in attention allocation and thereby meta-level reasoning processes (i.e., System 2; cognitive control/metacognition), the very constituents of reflective practice. In short, the case appears overwhelming for clinical intuition competency training. Additionally, a substantial reflective practice training literature which could readily be modified to include clinical intuition considerations sits immediately at hand. One difficulty, however, is that an accommodating model which will seamlessly link, firstly, difference-in-kind S1 emergent awareness, and, secondly, meta-level reflective practice, is yet to be highlighted. Remarkably, coherence-based reasoning sits in plain sight as a potential bridging position. Finally, expanding upon elementary suggestions in the literature, the toolbox skills ‘slow-onset speech’, ‘affective inquiry’, and ‘therapeutic presence’ are put forward as therapy technique functional for enhancing a clinician’s intuition sensitivity.",

Thomas DeLong, an academic and consultant to executives, and Sara DeLong, a psychiatrist, argue that it's often because they're afraid to demonstrate any sign of weakness. They're reluctant to ask important questions or try new approaches that push them outside their comfort zones. For high achievers, looking stupid or incompetent is anathema. So they stick to the tasks they're good at, even while the rest of the organization may be passing them by. In short, they'd rather do the wrong thing well than do the right thing poorly. They get stuck in this unproductive and unfulfilling pattern and can't break free. Of course, leaders in organizations bear some of the blame for this type of play-it-safe mind-set. They don't always want to hear that a person is struggling, nor do they necessarily reward risk taking, even though they might pay lip service to innovative initiative.

It is, therefore, reasonable if we suggest that the construction of leadership communication has very strategic roles. There are two postulates of the above strategic roles. The first is the dimension of consideration . By this concept, a leader emphasizes to motivate in order that the subordinates or members of the group can accomplish the tasks to achieve objectives. Besides, the leader maintains internal and external harmony and members satisfaction. The second is the dimension of initiating and directing . This concept primarily concerns with specifying ways and means for accomplishing the objectives of the group and coordinating activities of several members by making policy, planning, and executing. It is important for a leader to do a self-construction in   communicating messages because: 1) a leader is an  executive; he or she must be the top coordinator of the group activities, 2) a leader is a planner; he or she must decide the ways and means by which the group members shall achieve the goals, 3) a leader is a policy planner, he or she must establish the goals and policies, 4) a leader is an expert; he or she must be ready to be available as a source of information, experiences, and skills, 5) a leader is a controller of both internal and external relations of the group by governing the specific details of the group structure, and 6) a leader is a purveyor of reward and punishment which enables him or her to control the group members.",

This tendency is especially troublesome, since what we end up “doing” is often very different from our best-laid plans. Fortunately, we need not be overly anxious about this, since we will so often be given opportunities for redemption from forms of work and other activity that do not suit the rest of our lives. A number of examples from the legal profession raise the more important questions of “being”: how we will live our lives, how we will “be” in the world. The chapter concludes with the description of a life in which both sets of questions—of doing and being—played a significant role.",

We study herding in context of teams with a measurable outcome and discuss how they impact group performance. We use Conradt’s model of four levels of decision making with group member’s characteristics (incompetent, indifferent, imitator and interactor) and propose a three stage model to study herding. Our study indicates that herding is dynamic and develops as levels of communication changes with incompetence and indifference of members. Our study also reveals that ”partial” herding can occur where some group member(s) herd while others continue the work. This study is significant since it includes indifference and incompetence as two new factors that can lead to herding possibly leading to sub optimal results. Professors/managers making teams should pay attention to incompetence to avoid herding and suboptimal results. Future research areas are also discussed.",

      "title": "Eye contact effect: The role of vagal regulation and reactivity, and self-regulation of attention",
      "abstract": "Abstract Eye contact is a crucial aspect of social interactions that may enhance an individual’s cognitive performance (i.e. the eye contact effect) or hinder it (i.e. face-to-face interference effect). In this paper, I focus on the influence of eye contact on cognitive performance in tasks engaging executive functions. I present a hypothesis as to why some individuals benefit from eye contact while others do not. I propose that the relations between eye contact and executive functioning are modulated by an individual’s autonomic regulation and reactivity and self-regulation of attention. In particular, I propose that individuals with more optimal autonomic regulation and reactivity, and more effective self-regulation of attention benefit from eye contact. Individuals who are less well regulated and over- or under-reactive and who do not employ effective strategies of self-regulation of attention may not benefit from eye contact and may perform better when eye contact is absent. I present some studies that justify the proposed hypothesis and point to a method that could be employed to test them. This approach could help to better understand the complex mechanisms underlying the individual differences in participant’s cognitive performance during tasks engaging executive functions.",

We propose that teams and organizations can disentangle incompetence traps by fusing devil’s advocacy (DA) and dialectical inquiry (DI). We further contend that certain learner types – Experiencers, Contemplators, Thinkers and Doers – should act as DAs pointing out faulty perceptions, reflections, conceptions and/or actions. Meanwhile, the rest of the team should act as DIs, both critiquing DAs and collaborating with them, to synergize advanced perceptions, reflections, conceptions or actions. Overall, we urge teams and organizations to synergize exploitation (i.e., continuous capabilities upgrading) and exploration (i.e., new capabilities creation).",

      "abstract": "Time Management is a set of principles, practices, skill, tool and systems that work together to help us to get more value out of our his/her time with the aim of improving the quality of our life. The most appropriate word which suites Time Management is self-management which helps us to keep stress to a maximum. Time is the scarcest resource and unless its management decides the success or the failure of an activity. Effective Time Management necessitates a sense of balance. Either extreme along the Time Management skill continuum can be problematic. On one hand, perfect Time Management skill do not make one a perfect student or employee. It is possible to excess time, such that one is so wrapped up in the minutiae that meaningful tasks are not accomplished. On the other hand, poor Time Management skill do not make one a stooge. Some brilliant peoples habitually are ‘a day late and a dollar short’. The main reason for managing time is just provide structure to one’s life and in turn, peace of mind. Managing time is just something one does for one’s own psyche, to make one’s days easier. It is important for a student to have effective strategies to manage his time to balance the conflicting demands of time for the study. Time Management skills are valuable for doing revision for examinations. Sometimes it may seem that there is not enough time to do everything that we need to. This can lead to a buildup of stress. When revising for examinations or during our final year when we have to combine the pressures of intensive study with finding time to apply for our task good management of our time can be particularly important. Once we have identification ways in which we can improve the management of our time, we can begin to adjust our routines and patterns of behaviour to reduce any time-related stress in our lives. Keeping this in view the paper has been prepared on some of the significance of Time Management and Academic Achievement of School Students.",

They are frequently defined by their deficits rather than their abilities. New concepts such as self-determination have challenged researchers and service providers to think differently about the abilities of individuals considered to have severe intellectual disabilities. Analysis of communicative events between individuals with and without severe disabilities provides evidence that individuals who are often considered least able to do indeed communicate, asserting control over their environments and activities. Careful attention to communication reveals that behaviors that on the surface appear to be random, maladaptive, or challenging are purposeful, even useful. The author proposes that embedded in each communicative act, there is a drive toward self-determination, but that in order for self-determination to be actualized, communication partners must learn to apprehend, and respond appropriately to, the messages.",

The mentally retarded, influenced by the same set of learning variables that influence and control much of the behavior of all humans, can experience a wide range of learning difficulties and deficits. The treatment or behavior change approach is an educational one. If a person is experiencing difficulty, he is presenting symptoms of a poor educational experience. The retarded may exhibit too much behavior in terms of general environmental requirements. Excessive behavior patterns are quite likely to be labeled as deviant or pathological by the social environment. Because of the apparent visibility of such behaviors, it is easy to notice conflict with or deviation from standards of conduct.",

The analysis of a group interview transcript reveals that: the turn-construction of the group interview is sometimes a multi-interactional model of “interviewer’s questioning, interviewee’s answering, interviewee’s questioning, intervie- wee’s answering, interviewer’s echoing”; the interviewer’s control of turn-allocation, turn-length, and content plays a crucial role in the efficiency of group interview; nomination and using paralinguistic features, self-selection, interruption, intrusion, and taking turns according to seat arrangement are strategies for taking the turn; using utterance incompletor, incompletion marker and hesitation filler, repetition, speech pacing and intonation are the useful strategies for holding the turn while applying utterance completor plus silence, etc. can be effective strategies for yielding the turn.",

In the process of understanding a problem and trying to solve it, a planner starts with a problem statement, at the end of the process a commitment will be made as to what the solution may be, but the problem still may be further resolved. By doing this, the planner determines further action – what to do about the problem statement. In this sense, the statement of a planning problem is an instant picture of a becoming situation, so is its resolution. In this paper, it is intended to explore a definition of planning problems aiming to aid the planning process preventing it from determining prematurely what is to be accomplished at the risk of addressing the ‘wrong problem’, or deciding too early which kind of plan to pursue. Problems in planning are mental constructions based on facts, discrepancies, causality and consequentiality.",

      "title": "7-12 岁儿童注意的发展及其与智力的关系",
      "abstract": "Attention is a kind of resource which is needed by all psychological activities. Although plenty of studies focused on attention, profound thinking is still needed on some  questions. The first one is the development research on attention.  There are many kinds of attention, however, studies on the development of different attention and the structure of attention are few.  The second one is  related to  the individual differences on attention. As we know, quite a few of intelligence theories mentioned about attention, which afford an appropriate  perspective to study the individual differences of attention. The third one concerns about the effect of environment on attention development. In all the environments which can affect attention, education environment is one of most important. Researches on the differences of individuals’ attention under different  education  environment can provide some important information on the environment effect on attention. \nTaking 7-12-year-old children as participants, the present study chose 7 attention tests (including alertness, focused attention, divided attention, attentional switching, sustained attention, spatial attention and supervisory attention) to investigate the development of different attention and their relationships with intelligence. There are three studies:  Study  1 explored the development of attention and delineated and separated  attention  in children into measurable constructs. Based on this, study 2 investigated the relationship between attention and intelligence. In order to promote our understanding about this relationship, we compared the differences of  attention tests performance between intelligent children and average children. Study 3 focused on the education  environment effect on the attention development of  intelligent children. The whole work indicated that: \nFirstly, the attention showed a significant development in 7-12-year-old children. Girls had better attention quality than boys did, especially in the stage of 9-10-year-old.  The  factor analysis showed that there was no stable construct of attention in 7-8-year-old children. The attention construct of 9-12-year-old children could be separated into perceptual attention and executive attention. However, the attention types which included by this two factors were somehow different from  that included in adults. \nSecondly, the correlations between  attention and intelligence were changing in 7-12-year-old children. In the stage of 9-10-year-old, the correlation between attention and intelligence was closest. Comparing to fluid intelligence,  attention had a closer correlation with  crystallized intelligence.  Executive attention had a more powerful prediction on intelligence than perceptual attention.   \nThirdly,  intelligent children who received enrichment education had better attention than intelligent children who received standard education. \nIn summary, the present study explored the construct of attention in children and throws light on the issue of the relationship between attention and intelligence from the perspective of development psychology.  The present study confirmed that intelligent children who received enrichment education had better attention than intelligent children who received standard education, affording theoretical support for the gifted education practice.",

      "title": "Relating Remedial Strategies to Diagnostic Considerations.",
      "abstract": "how one treats reading disabilities depends upon how one views the process of reading. Many reading specialists view reading disa bility as a disability relating clearly to the reading skill. Thus, reading is perceived as a skill that is learned either adequately or not; and if not learned adequately, then those facets of skills not learned need to be taught, re-taught, and sometimes drilled in order to remedy the reading problem. Another perception of reading is that reading is a caused be havior. One reads adequately or not depending upon many under lying factors. Some underlying factors in a child's development and environment cause him to be a good reader, and some deviations within these factors cause him to be a less-than-adequate reader. Language factors, emotional factors, socio-economic conditions, physiological, and neurological development all are underlying factors that affect how a child reads. From this perception of reading, remedial strategies will evolve that are closely related to each child's total development rather than merely to the child's acquisition or level of reading skill. However, while most reading specialists suggest or even encourage the examination of the underlying factors in a child's development, their remedial prescriptions, in fact, do not really utilize the information gleaned from such explorations. Too often the diagnosis is based on standardized reading tests and reference to cumulative folders. These diagnostic procedures are sometimes not only minimal in value, but can have negative implications as well, since cumulative records more often reveal the prejudices of the teachers than the essence of teacher-pupil interaction and actual pupil functioning. Moreover, standardized silent reading tests rarely tell the teacher more than the fact that a child has answered a question rightly or wrongly. Pursuing the point of relating remedial strategies to diagnostic considerations, certain basic concerns need to be delineated. 1. Reading is perceived as a language-related process which 353",

      "abstract": "Physical interaction with a partner plays an essential role in our life experience and is the basis of many daily activities. When two physically coupled humans have different and partly conflicting goals, they face the challenge of negotiating some type of collaboration. This requires that both participants understand their partner’s state and current actions. But, how would the collaboration be affected if information about their partner were unreliable or incomplete? We designed an experiment in which two players (a dyad) are mechanically connected through a virtual spring, but cannot see each other. They were instructed to perform reaching movements with the same start and end position, but through different via-points. In different groups of dyads we varied the amount of information provided to each player about his/her partner: haptic only (the interaction force perceived through the virtual spring), visuo-haptic (the interaction force is also displayed on the screen), and partner visible (in addition to interaction force, partner position is continuously displayed on the screen). We found that incomplete information about the partner affects not only the speed at which collaboration is achieved (less information, slower learning), but also the actual collaboration strategy. In particular, incomplete or unreliable information leads to an interaction strategy characterized by alternating leader-follower roles. Conversely, more reliable information leads to more synchronous behaviors, in which no specific roles can be identified. Simulations based on a combination of game theory and Bayesian estimation suggested that synchronous behaviors correspond to optimal interaction (Nash equilibrium). Roles emerge as sub-optimal forms of interaction, which minimize the need to account for the partner. These findings suggest that collaborative strategies in joint action are shaped by the trade-off between the task requirements and the uncertainty of the information available about the partner.",

The model posits that mind wandering begins when one is not engaged in goal-oriented cognition, whether when between tasks or when in the middle of a task but not actively thinking about one’s goal. At such times, the model thinks about other, highly-activated thoughts in memory. This model sheds light on both how task-oriented and more basic cognitive processes interact, as well as how mind wandering content is generated; both unresolved questions for mind wandering research. We compare our model against data presented by McVay and Kane (2013), who induced mind wandering in a laboratory setting by embedding participants’ personal goals and concerns in a lexical SART task. Overall, our model matched the data’s mind wandering rates very well. We discuss implications and future work on the model.",

      "title": "El funcionario de nivel medio en una institución federal de educación superior: vivencias de placer y sufrimiento en el trabajo / The Middle Worker in a High Level Educational Federal Institution: Experiences of Pleasure and Suffering at Work",
      "abstract": "El presente estudio tiene como tema central el análisis del trabajo de los asistentes administrativos de la Universidad Federal de Maranhão (UFMA). En este contexto organizacional, a partir del análisis de cincuenta cuestionarios y veintiuna entrevistas semiestructuradas, se identificó un número significativo de técnicos con potenciales poco apreciados, normalmente al margen de los procesos de decisión, funcionando como mero apoyo a las actividades académicas y, consecuentemente, implicando sentimientos de invisibilidad y desprestigio. Se puede constatar que este escenario crea un terreno fértil para el surgimiento de estrategias defensivas, de sufrimiento patogénico y, posiblemente, de menor compromiso y movilización. Se observa la necesidad de deconstruir la idea de que cualquier adaptación es fruto de la mala intención por parte de los funcionarios, infiriéndose que la inercia y la apatía pueden ser señales de sufrimiento psíquico o incluso de un proceso patológico, fruto de una dinámica organizacional que reserva un lugar de anonimato al profesional. Se advierte sobre la importancia de la creación de espacios laborales para los asistentes administrativos que favorezcan la valorización, participación y negociación, dando lugar a una oportunidad para que la actividad laboral sea un fin en sí misma, constituyéndose en una actividad significativa para el sujeto, para la universidad y la sociedad. Se concluye que el trabajo, considerado de esta forma, puede asumir sentidos de crecimiento, utilidad, coherencia y realización, tal vez otorgándole significado a todo el sufrimiento vivido al enfrentar adversidades tan presentes en el mundo laboral.&#x0D; Abstract: The main focus of this study is to conduct a job analysis of the administrative assistant at the Universidade Federal do Maranhão (UFMA). A great number of technicians with underused potential have been studied in the present organizational context and from an analysis of fifty questionnaires and twenty one semi-structured interviews. Such professionals have always been put aside the decision making processes, working as mere support for academic activities, experiencing, therefore, feelings of invisibility and low status. It notes that this scenario creates a fertile ground for the emergence of defensive strategies, of pathogenic suffering and, possibly, less commitment and mobilization. It points out the need to deconstruct the idea that all accommodation comes from workers’ trickery and bad faith, inferring that inertia and apathy can be signs of psychic disorder or even a disease process which is the result of an organizational dynamics that allows the professional an anonymity place. It warns about the importance of creating workplaces for the administrative assistant that favor the following: appreciation, participation and negotiation in order to provide opportunity for the work activity to be an end itself and becoming a significant activity for the subject, for the university and for the society. Finally it concludes that the work can take meanings of growth, utility, coherence and achievement and it can, perhaps, lend its meaning to all the suffering that has been experienced when facing the adversities greatly present of the work of world.",

      "abstract": "Psychological need frustration—experiences like failure, loneliness, or coercion—is emerging as a promising explanation for why people disengage with games and other entertainment media, and how media may induce dysregulated use and ill-being. However, existing research on game- related need frustration relies on general instruments with unclear content validity for games. We also do not know how need frustration arises in video games, nor how it leads to disengagement. We therefore conducted a semi-structured interview study with 12 video game players, following grounded theory methods to develop a model of need-frustrating play. We find that need frustration is a common and impactful experience in games, with distinct antecedents not fully captured in existing measures. Felt need frustration arises when observed need-frustrating events negatively violate expected need frustration or satisfaction; repeated violations update players’ expectations, which lead them to modulate or quit play to reduce expected frustration exposure.",

      "abstract": "Arbeidsuitval om psychische redenen start vaak met een of andere vorm van onbalans tussen de wensen van de medewerker en de werksituatie. De veronderstelling van de auteurs van dit artikel is dat het gedrag in reactie op dergelijke onbalans kan bepalen of deze wordt hersteld of juist uitmondt in verzuim. Bovendien verwachten de auteurs dat bepaalde organisatorische, relationele en individuele factoren mede bepalen welk gedrag medewerkers en leidinggevenden vertonen. Deze veronderstellingen worden grotendeels door vragenlijstonderzoek bevestigd. De conclusie is dat medewerkers en leidinggevenden samen verzuim kunnen voorkomen door de dialoog te organiseren. Het blijkt dat mechanismen die ervoor zorgen dat onbalans vroegtijdig bloot komt te liggen hieraan een bijdrage leveren. Ook een organisatiecultuur waarin problemen uitgesproken worden en een belonende stijl van leidinggeven, blijken het open overleg te bevorderen. Een goede relatie tussen leidinggevende en medewerker, alsmede het vertrouwen van medewerkers in zichzelf om problemen aan te pakken zijn tot slot belangrijke relationele en individuele factoren die open overleg stimuleren.",

      "abstract": "Simultaneous interpretation (SI) requires various cognitive efforts to be made all at once, such as listening, comprehension, target discourse production, short-term memory, and coordination. It can be performed successfully when the interpreter’s capacity exceeds the capacity required for the process. Many factors affect how much capacity the interpreter can exploit and how much is required at any given moment during SI. Source text (ST) is obviously one of such factors, and therefore, this study aims to understand its characteristics. Grasping the various traits of ST can help the interpreters to better anticipate what is coming, and hence, to better manage the cognitive load demanded during the SI process. The data consisted of 100 questions posed by audiences at various conferences. An analysis of their forms and contents shows that questions from the audience share some common traits. Discourse markers such as interrogatives and/or interrogative final endings can often be misleading, as the discourse function itself is not to ask a question, but to counter-argue, blame, and/or save face. When the discourse function is purely to ask a question, the question frequently comes in the form of request or statement. This finding also reveals characteristics of spoken language, such as the use of unfit conjunction, repetition, and use of personalized collocations and expressions. All these traits of ST can hamper the interpreter’s comprehension in the SI process. However, understanding them can help the interpreters, especially student or novice interpreters, to correctly anticipate what is coming and to implement an effective strategies to manage the SI process early on.",

      "title": "Executive functions and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder",
      "abstract": "The field of executive functions comprises the operation of numerous intra-connected processes. The majority of them starts developing in the early period, however, they are most prominent in the school period, during which the activities become more complex, and during the tasks’ execution in the adult period. They affect our entire performance and its success. With persons with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) it is typical that their executive functions are less developed, consequently such individuals are not as successful as they could have been.\r\nSelf-regulation includes both cognitive and metacognitive processes. It means the management of one's behaviour, emotions, motivation… Its development begins in the early period, but it does not develop equally in all people. It has been defined by several authors who represent different theories but only Barkley's and Zimmerman's theories are summarised in this part.\r\nMetacognition is considered a self-regulative process. It has been identified as a metacognitive knowledge, metacognitive experience, metacognitive skills and strategies and metacognitive objective by Flavell (1979, in Bakracevic Vukman, 2010). The metacognitive sections include the strategies of planning, regulation and monitoring. Metacognition also develops in the early period, therefore we need to help individuals in developing it with different strategies.\r\nAuthors like Barkley, Brown, Dawson & Guare and others have written about executive functions. Their definitions differ, nevertheless, they have many mutual points like self-regulation of emotions and motivation, working memory and inhibition of reaction.\r\n\r\nOur brain is a complex set of nerve cells, constantly connecting and thus carrying information, orders from one another. The frontal lobe has a special role in the development of executive functions, it is responsible for higher recognition processes, like thinking, which include planning, execution and the evaluation of tasks. Furthermore it affects the motoric execution of more advance and more complex tasks. Baddeley (2000, in Henry, 2012) presents two models of working memory. He has upgraded the original model by adding an episodic buffer. Other components of the working memory include the central implementation system and the system for temporary storage, divided into the phonological loop and the visual-spatial sketch.\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to plan strategies to help develop the executive functions in people with ADHD, we need to be familiar with some general, psychological and developmental characteristics of the disorder. Furthermore we need to have good knowledge of the before mentioned theoretical basics. Only then we can establish relevant forms of assistance or strategies, which may be useful to a specific individual.",

Emotional factors strongly effect the \"fruitfulness\" and \"direction\" of the intelligence; but we still insist upon treating intelligence as a thing apart. Evidence is offered that intelligence is part of a total organic attitude involving also attitudes of mind, emotional conditions, ingrained habits, and conditioned behavior. In children of high-school age this total attitude is the essential factor in counseling and segregation. The greater the emotional contribution to the total attitude, the more subordinate is the intelligence. This attitude is a changing complex in response to situational factors. Transient situations may produce emotional disturbances reflected in lower results in mental testing at such times. The inequalities in mental tests from a given child are an index to his emotional capacity. The total organic attitude becomes more complex through the operation of a long-continued disturbing situation, possibly also through inherent characteristics of the individual reacting in extraordinary ways to temporary situations. Inasmuch as behavior grows out of this total attitude and decisions in domestic, educational, and vocational crises are dictated by it, the total attitude itself and the situational factors which produced it are the essential factors in counseling high-school children. Classes segregated according to these factors present more uniform teaching problems than classes segregated on the basis of intelligence tests alone.",

      "abstract": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY * The purpose of is to grew responsible team members, freeing leaders to perform higher-order tasks. * Effective drives performance by strengthening accountability. * A strong avoids perpetually giving answers; instead he or she asks mentoring that challenge people to own tasks, and expand their capacity. * An effective has a person-to-person connection, telling stories of his or her own professional development and getting to know his or her team members' goals and challenges. * A strong should be skillfully challenging. The growth of the person being mentored is a higher priority than his or her personal comfort. The should go for by sharing penetrating insights. ********** [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] A mentor's job is to foster one-to-one relationships that challenge people to rise to higher levels of competence and responsibility. This article discusses three key characteristics of an effective mentor: 1. An effective asks challenging questions that help people expand their scope of responsibilities. 2. Art effective is highly connected to the person being mentored. 3. An effective challenges others with penetrating insights. THE BENEFITS OF MENTORING Most firm and organizational leaders see the value of mentoring. But is often narrowly viewed as supportive or educational rather than as a vehicle for delivering accountability and driving performance. The idea, for example, that is a way to challenge a young estate tax expert to grow into someone who brings in new clients is not well understood. Mentoring is commonly tepid and sparse, making brief appearances during reviews that are predictable if not superficial. But with practice, effective can become a strong foundation for every firm's growth and success. When Kevin Corcoran stepped into his role as CFO of VWR Education LLC, a scientific education products company based in Rochester, N.Y., he did not know anyone on his management team, including his own boss. He needed to be able to connect with his team quickly, and they with him, in order to become, and execute as, a strong leadership team. Fortunately for Corcoran, the senior management team had recently implemented a program to help its leaders become better mentors. The immediate goal was to improve communication and strengthen the connection among the leadership team members. Two years later, stronger has delivered much more. It has become part of a culture of accelerated professional growth where leaders challenge their top talent in regularly scheduled coaching sessions that are based on open discussions and yield tangible results. The notion that wastes time is false. It is a productivity accelerator. Effective grows responsible employees and frees up the to perform higher-order duties, such as developing new business. don't have time to mentor is usually a cover for don't know how. The leader who allows this mentality to prevail is choosing comfort over progress. Firm leaders should determine which of their tasks bring the most value to the business and draft a stop doing list, which includes responsibilities that will be transferred via mentoring. The road to a stagnant firm is paved with the phrase It's easier if I just do it myself. SKILL 1: MENTORING QUESTIONS One of the most important elements to a strong relationship is not giving people answers. Exceptional is more concerned with teaching people how to think rather than telling them what to think. You don't realize how good some professionals are until you put yourself in a conversation where you're discussing weaknesses and deficiencies. Voluntarily walking into your boss's office to openly discuss your shortcomings seems counter-intuitive but it can lead to an incredible depth of learning and understanding, Corcoran said. …",

      "abstract": "Effective feedback may be defined as feedback in which information about previous performance is used to promote positive and desirable development. This can be challenging as educators must acknowledge the psychosocial needs of the recipient while ensuring that feedback is both honest and accurate. Current feedback models remain reductionist in their approach. They are embedded in the hierarchical, diagnostic endeavours of the health professions. Even when it acknowledges the importance of two-way interactions, feedback often remains an educator-driven, one-way process.An understanding of the various types of feedback and an ability to actively seek an appropriate approach may support feedback effectiveness. Facilitative rather than directive feedback enhances learning for high achievers. High-achieving recipients undertaking complex tasks may benefit from delayed feedback. It is hypothesised that such learners are supported by reducing interruptions during the task. If we accept that medical students and doctors are high achievers, we can draw on some guiding principles from a complex and rarely conclusive literature. Feedback should focus on the task rather than the individual and should be specific. It should be directly linked to personal goals. Self-assessment as a means to identify personal learning requirements has no theoretical basis. Motivated recipients benefit from challenging facilitated feedback from external sources.To achieve truly effective feedback, the health professions must nurture recipient reflection-in-action. This builds on self-monitoring informed by external feedback. An integrated approach must be developed to support a feedback culture. Early training and experience such as peer feedback may over time support the required cultural change. Opportunities to provide feedback must not be missed, including those to impart potentially powerful feedback from high-stakes assessments. Feedback must be conceptualised as a supported sequential process rather than a series of unrelated events. Only this sustained approach will maximise any effect.",

Goals are typically set on the assumption that they will help bring the agent(s) closer to the desired state of affairs. However, sometimes endorsement of a goal, or the processes by which the goal is set, can obstruct its achievement. When this happens, the goal is self-defeating. Self-defeating goals are common in both private and social decision-making but have not received much attention by decision theorists. In this paper, we investigate different variants of three major types of self-defeating mechanisms: (1) The goal can be an obstacle to its own fulfilment (self-defeating goal endorsement), (2) goal-setting activities can impede goal achievement (self-defeating goal-setting), and (3) disclosure of the goal can interfere with its attainment (self-defeating goal disclosure). Different strategies against self-defeasance are tentatively explored, and their efficiency against different types of self-defeasance is investigated.",

      "abstract": "Cet article pose la question du lien qui existerait entre les explications des conduites ou de leurs résultats (tel que l'échec scolaire) et les comportements. Il s'agit de savoir comment les explica­tions que l'élève donne de son échec peuvent nous renseigner sur ses possibilités de mobilisations dans les diverses activités scolaires. Cette recherche donne les résultats suivants : Premièrement, pour les bons élèves, la réussite est liée à l'attention, puis à l'effort, puis à l'organisation. Pour les faibles, la réussite est liée à l'effort et à la volonté. Deuxièmement, les forts et les moyens ne se distinguent pas ; ils attribuent plutôt leurs difficultés à un manque d'effort alors que les faibles expliquent leurs difficultés d'abord par un manque d'efficacité. Ensuite, les forts comme les moyens expliquent leurs difficultés en français par le manque de capacité puis dans une moindre proportion par le manque d'effort ; les faibles en français expliquent surtout leurs difficultés par le manque d'effort. Les explications des difficultés en mathématiques sont d'abord le manque de capacité, puis la difficulté de la tâche et enfin le manque d'effort. Troisièmement, on constate que le style éducatif incohérent (marginalement déclaré) est associé plus fréquemment à l'abandon chez l'élève que les autres styles éducatifs.",

      "abstract": "An interpersonal-emotional history procedure, the Significant Other History, is administered to the early-onset chronically depressed patient during the second therapy session in the Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP). Patients are asked to name up to six significant others and answer two questions: (1) What was it like growing up with or being around this person? (2) What is the emotional \"stamp\" you take from this relationship that informs who you are today? An interpersonal-emotional theme reflecting the early learning history of the patient is derived from these \"stamps\" or causal theory conclusions. One transference hypothesis (TH) is derived from the Significant Other History (SOH) and is formulated in one sentence, such as \"If I do this, then the therapist will likely do that\" (e.g., \"If I make a mistake around Dr. E, then Dr. E will label me 'stupid' or 'incompetent'\"). The transference hypothesis highlights the interpersonal content that most likely informs the patient's expectancy of the therapist's reactions toward him or her. Throughout the therapy process, the therapist will proactively employ the transference hypothesis in a technique known as the Interpersonal Discrimination Exercise to help patients cognitively and emotionally discriminate the practitioner from hurtful significant others. The goal here is to increase the patient's felt safety within the therapeutic dyad and eventually to generalize the felt safety to the patient's other relationships.",

It is unclear, however, if different types of practice have the same or specific effects on mental functioning. Here we tested three consecutive three-month training modules aimed at cultivating either attention, socio-affective qualities (such as compassion), or socio-cognitive skills (such as theory of mind), in three training cohorts and a retest control cohort (N = 332). While attentional performance improved most consistently after attention training, compassion increased most after socio-affective training and theory of mind partially improved after socio-cognitive training. These results show that specific mental training practices are needed to induce plasticity in different domains of mental functioning, providing a foundation for evidence-based development of more targeted interventions adapted to the needs of different education, labor, and health settings.",

It is characterized by a state of apprehension about a perceived threat or potentially dangerous situation. In addition, fear is a negative emotion caused by the belief that someone or something is dangerous, likely to cause pain, or a threat. At mild to moderate levels, anxiety can be adaptive, motivating, and can help improve performance and attention. For example, prior to a significant life event such as an important test or presentation, some individuals may experience anxiety, which could serve as a motivator to work harder and perform better. Similarly, fear can be an adaptive response when one is confronted with a life-threatening situation, and a fight or flight response to danger is present and adaptive across many animal species. However, for some, anxiety or fear may be overwhelming, distressing, and interfere with functioning. This may require a person to seek treatment depending on the level of interference and could also result in the development of a psychiatric condition.",

The interdependencies, uncertainties and conflicting priorities create ‘wicked problems.’ Complex situations trigger differing viewpoints and can prompt an emotional response, particularly if current assumptions, values and principles are challenged. In such scenarios, the application of superordinate principles can help resolve issues by establishing a shared perspective.

The insights support solution-focused interventions, including action to develop psychological capital (PC).

Workaholic's most important difference from hardworking people are feeling extremely addictive to work, compulsive form of work, despite psychosomatic complaints continue to work, feel discomfort when they do not work they are willing to risk sacrificing work. Although many employees as workaholic people can also be an internal motivation to work, this job satisfaction shows a narcotic effect. In constant pursuit of workaholics to feel the effects of this work, it makes it an (2).However, there are eight characteristic symptoms of addictions in workaholism. First is the focus. These individuals are often seen as a treatment for study by themselves. Secondly mood variation; work on the basic regulatory function over individual feelings of the moment. Third tolerance; when it comes to work, there is a need for increasing the individual concerned. Fourth withdrawal symptoms; increased anxiety symptoms in the absence of the work. The fifth conflict; when encountering any problems in business life, they tend to enter into conflict with those around individuals. Sixth relapse, aggressive attitude towards work repeated in case of attacks. Eight 'Reward dependence' is a something that leads the way to become addicted for workaholic people (3, 4). Substances with addictive properties, especially ventral striatum, dopaminergic and opioids have powerful effects on the brain's reward pathways involved in the system. The impact on the reward system often shows itself in the form of behavioral disorders. This forms the basis of the limbic system in the brain reward system is the basis for the perception of pleasure, and to control emotions and behavior such as to avoid dangerous or aversive situation, motivation condition. These symptoms are very similar to the withdrawal symptoms in the substance and behavioral dependency (5).Behavioral addictions such as alcohol and substance abuse exhibit preoccupation, mood variability, tolerance, deprivation, interpersonal conflict and recurrence (relapse) that properties are the major components of dependence.

Deep processing involves devoting more attention to the and classifi cation of an idea suggested by a sym bol than to the symbol itself. For example, when asked to remember the word depression, a person might simply take note of how the word sounds and how it is spelled and repeat it five or six times. This proc ess will yield a shallow encoding. Another person might note that de pression refers to an emotional experi ence that is similar to, and different from, other emotions in certain ways. This process will yield a deep encod ing. E laborative processing refers to a way of processing information that enriches it and makes it more concrete and personally relevant. A person can elaboratively process the word by thinking of examples of depression from personal experi ence.

One of the particular challenges for leaders with regard to conflict pertains to the tendency to view conflict in negative terms, as a struggle, fight, incompatibility, or problem that must be solved or eliminated. Difficult communication situations are relatively common in workplace contexts, and often issues arise that must be addressed; avoidance may not be a viable option. Such situations may occur in one-to-one conversations, group meetings, and organizational settings. The classic example of a difficult conversation arises when an individual must share information that is likely to be regarded as negative or potentially upsetting. Formulating the action plan requires a determination of one's intended message and the selection of an appropriate venue or medium for the conversation given the identified goals.",

      "abstract": "Creative writing instructors who shake their heads and wonder why their students are not performing as expected can find answers in an unexpected source: neuroscience. Neuroscientists have proven that when an individual is stressed or threatened, a part of the brain stem called the Reticular Activating System (RAS) will shift control from the cerebral cortex to the limbic system. When the limbic system is in the ascendant, behavior is instinctual, based on the fight-or-flight response, or the result of deeply engrained training. Without significant input from the cerebral cortex, the individual is temporarily deprived of the ability to perform nuanced analysis and creative thought. Moreover, the individual is rarely aware of this shift and often attributes the resulting inability to perform her or his usual creative thinking as a lack of willpower, character or ability. What is typically thought of as writer’s block or other forms of writing resistance is the result the cerebral cortex being temporarily unavailable. Common forms of writing resistance can be categorized within the three instinctual responses the limbic system relies on: freezing (momentary paralysis), followed by the choice of fighting or fleeing. It is imperative that instructors understand the neurological causes of resistance, recognize resistance in its many guises, and find ways to help students relax in the writing classroom and during out-of-class writing so that their creative cerebral cortex can reengage.",

Micromanagement is associated more with the process by which a task is completed and less with the results that are achieved. In 2000, Wright1 suggested that there is a strong negative correlation between the degree of micromanaging and the amount of autonomy a micromanaged team member possesses. However, in certain cases, micromanagement can be used appropriately as an effective management tool. Managers must differentiate between setting goals and dictating each detail of a process. Effective micromanagement means knowing when to get involved and when to get out of the way. Micromanaging can have a deleterious impact on employee morale. For instance, employees may feel that they are not being listened to and can begin to either shut down or avoid making positive suggestions for continuous improvement. During a crisis situation, employees may not be willing to sacrifice their own time or resources to address the problem, assuming that their manager will take full responsibility and credit for managing through the crisis.",

Literature review: Because there are few materials found on this subject, and also because such rules are often changed, we found many references that addressed the issue goalkeeper - online. Much of the material found in journals on Internet sites. Materials and methods: We set out to analyze a game, creating a table notes that quantified the holdings of the goalkeeperline and its effectiveness in health and progression of the game your team. Results: In the games we see observed the direct participation of goalkeeper during the match, but were playing at specific times, eg, maintaining possession of the ball or balls of security. Discussion: The action interfered with the goalie-line matches, the outcome of the game, the teams that used this system of play at times in need of a better outcome in the game, to make, and reached the goal was to win or least tie the game. With the exception of CBA team (Carlos Barbosa), than playing against good team of Jaragua, well trained to suffer leakage of the opposing teams that acted with the goalkeeper-line did not reach the expected effect, so do not succeeding.",

      "title": "Memory Rehabilitation in Healthy Aging",
      "abstract": "Healthy aging is accompanied by decrements in episodic memory and working memory. Significant efforts have therefore been made to augment episodic and working memory in healthy older adults. Two principal approaches toward memory rehabilitation adults are restorative approaches and compensatory approaches. Restorative approaches aim to repair the affected memory processes by repeated, adaptive practice (i.e., the trained task becomes more difficult as participants improve), and have focused on recollection training, associative memory training, object-location memory training, and working memory training. The majority of these restorative approaches have been proved to be efficacious, that is, participants improve on the trained task, and there is considerable evidence for maintenance of training effects weeks or months after the intervention is discontinued. Transfer of restorative training approaches has been more elusive and appears limited to other tasks relying on the same domains or processes. Compensatory approaches to memory strive to bypass the impairment by teaching people mnemonic and lifestyle strategies to bolster memory performance. Specific mnemonic strategy training approaches as well as multimodal compensatory approaches that combine strategy training with counseling about other factors that affect memory (e.g., memory self-efficacy, relaxation, exercise, and cognitive and social engagement) have demonstrated that older adults can learn new mnemonics and implement them to the benefit of memory performance, and can adjust their views and expectations about their memory to better cope with the changes that occur during healthy aging. Future work should focus on identifying the personal characteristics that predict who will benefit from training and on developing objective measures of the impact of memory rehabilitation on older adults’ everyday functioning.",

A typical social interchange involves a holder’s responding improvisationally to what the person being held is doing, while at the same time the holder is performing her own identity and there are often other actors in the scene who must also be held in their identities. Given these complications, there are many ways the practice can misfire morally. This chapter identifies some of the more common moral failures of each moment of personhood and then revisits the question of when we must hold someone in her identity. The chapter closes with a discussion of excellent, poorly executed, and clumsy holding.",

Focusing on performative learning as the instructed production of expressive, aesthetic conduct such as dancing, I explore its instruct-ability and the role observability and intersubjectivity play in that. I examine how and when teachers intervene with directives, hints, corrections, and demonstrations, which can be produced along with, after, or by interrupting the performance. Different instructions require different temporal and sequential organization, multimodal format, and recipient design. Verbal, vocal, and gestural prompts punctuate dancers' performance. Corrections concerning what to enact when are easily accomplished verbally, and produced during dancing, whereas how to perform often requires (re)demonstration, hence postponing the correction or interrupting the enactment. Instructive actions are equally important and include the dancing of fellow practitioners, whose conduct is consulted continually to learn just – what to do (\"copying\") and for confirming whether one is moving properly (comparing). Self-monitoring and self-initiated correction are crucial and sustained by the mirror as an intersubjective technology. The \"pan-visual\" organization of activities in the dance studio makes instructed actions instructive themselves and supports a collaborative component, as dancers also offer explicit instructions (peer-to-peer coaching).",

      "title": "Habit Formation and Entrepreneurially-Minded Learning (EML) in Developing the User-Centered Design Mindset",
      "abstract": "Abstract To better help students develop a user-centered design mindset, a weekly activity is introduced into the Human Factors Engineering course that utilizes both the concept of human habit formation [1] and Entrepreneurial Minded Learning (EML) [2]. In each weekly activity, students are required to find a product or system that they think is designed poorly from a user standpoint. The poorly designed product or system examples can be any everyday thing students interact with. Following a predefined template provided by the instructor, students are required to showcase their examples by including photos, the user's goals as well as issues using the product, critiques, and a proposed design solution to address the user's needs. The instructor's main requirement for accepting a student's example is to evaluate whether it satisfies at least one of the three goals of human factors engineering (enhancing performance, safety, and satisfaction). Students share their examples with other students, who are then required to participate in a discussion (in-person or an online forum) and contribute to the proposed solution with constructive ideas or propose a different solution. The critical aspect of this activity is the weekly repetition. The goal of requiring a weekly assignment is to help students form a habit of consistently thinking about users during the design process and be cognizant of users' needs with their everyday products. The activity was experimented with in a Human Factors engineering course. To evaluate the effectiveness of the activity in developing a human-centered design mindset through habitual behavior, two methods were conducted: 1) a self-reporting survey by students, and 2) instructor analysis of the artifacts. Once the course concluded, students completed a survey in which they shared their experience and perception about the assignment. Students believed that the activity was an effective one (89% extremely and very effective, 11% somewhat effective) in developing a human-centered design mindset. Students believed (44% strongly agree, 56% agree) that after participating in the Hall of Shame activity, they became more cognizant of users' needs and their unpleasant experiences. They also believed that thinking about poorly designed products and systems regularly, the activity helped them unleash their curiosity. 89% of students believed that completing the activity helped them think about human-centered design issues beyond the course. This indicates that the activity could contribute to forming habitual behavior. Moreover, the instructor analyzed students' artifacts to assess Entrepreneurial Mindset Outcomes (EMO) including curiosity, connection, and creating value. The results indicated that the students' artifacts presented the EMO items (average percentage of observed occurrence): value creation (58%), connection (45%), and curiosity (42%). This paper will share the motivation and rationale behind creating and proposing such a habitual activity to develop a user-centered mindset in students through Entrepreneurially Minded Learning (EML). The paper also provides the activity instruction, learning objectives, and the instructor's lessons learned in applying the activity in class.",

Unfortunately many children have not gained these skills to a degree that is adequate to the demands of the primary grade.

Intentional communication is goal-intended; directed at changing mental states and as a consequence behaviour; about a referential object common to sender and recipient; and about objects that may be context-and referent-independent. Three different kinds of attention is discerned: scanning, attention attraction, and attention-focusing. The focus of attention can, depending on the abilities of the subject, be on objects or subjects that either are contextual or stable, and it can be individual or shared. For language use, subject-subject focusing along with shared attention are necessary. This does not require Gricean metarepresentations, but basically only attention contact between the subjects and behavioral co-ordination. Language use can be compared with tool use to bring out the characteristics that distinguish informational from intentional communication. The capacities required for tool use are in several cases similar to those required for language use. A basic similarity is that both activities are used as means to an end. (Less)",

      "abstract": "Abstract In this advanced review, the development of the three most commonly used functions of autobiographical memory—directing behavior, social bonding, and self‐continuity—and the support they have received in the literature are discussed. Support for this tripartite model often comes from correlational studies that use self‐report measures, but participants in these studies may not be aware that they retrieved autobiographical memories to fulfill certain goals. Not only is more experimental research needed to confirm the findings from correlational studies, this kind of research needs to be more rigorous. Moreover, the functions of the tripartite model may not be the only autobiographical memory functions that can be distinguished. For example, there is already substantial support for the emotion‐regulation function. Although memories can be used for multiple functions, patterns between aspects of the event (e.g., emotional valence) or memory (e.g., specificity) and their functionality have been found. In addition, individual differences (e.g., cultural background, depression symptoms) and situational factors (e.g., is there a goal that needs to be fulfilled) may regulate the functional deployment of autobiographical memories. Future research should therefore extend its focus on the conditions in which these functions can be observed. This article is categorized under: Psychology &gt; Memory",

      "abstract": "Abstract It is often the case that certain critical events can have enormous impacts on the dynamics of collective action. When such events appear to “trigger” or “spark” collective action by convincing potential participants that action is necessary or desirable, or mark a critical turning point in the dynamics of a particular pattern of mobilization, they may be thought of as precipitating events. These events will tend to fall along a varied range of characteristics. Some may be violent and traumatic, such as an assassination or an instance of police brutality, while others may be relatively civil or even celebratory, such as the election of a supported political candidate or the victory of a sports team. Some events may appear to be relatively isolated and singular, while others may occur in a cumulative pattern over time. An event might be planned and executed by movement participants, or be completely unexpected. One event might trigger explosive episodes such as riots, while others might lead to long‐term changes in a cycle of protest, such as shifts in a movement's strategy. Despite such variation, the defining feature of a precipitating event is that it serves as some form of social‐cognitive “trigger” that defines, in part, the forms of collective action that occurs in its wake.",

      "title": "Fostering and Measuring Skills: Improving Cognitive and Non-Cognitive Skills to Promote Lifetime Success",
      "abstract": "This paper reviews the recent literature on measuring and boosting cognitive and non-cognitive skills. The literature establishes that achievement tests do not adequately capture character skills: personality traits, goals, motivations, and preferences that are valued in the labor market, in school, and in many other domains. Their predictive power rivals that of cognitive skills. Reliable measures of character have been developed. All measures of character and cognition are measures of performance on some task. In order to reliably estimate skills from tasks, it is necessary to standardize for incentives, effort, and other skills when measuring any particular skill. Character is a skill, not a trait.At any age, character skills are stable across different tasks, but skills can change over the life cycle. Character is shaped by families, schools, and social environments. Skill development is a dynamic process, in which the early years lay the foundation for successful investment in later years. High-quality early childhood and elementary school programs improve character skills in a lasting and cost-effective way. Many of them beneficially affect later-life outcomes without improving cognition. There are fewer long-term evaluations of adolescent interventions, but workplace-based programs that teach character skills are promising. The common feature of successful interventions across all stages of the life cycle through adulthood is that they promote attachment and provide a secure base for exploration and learning for the child. Successful interventions emulate the mentoring environments offered by successful families.",

      "abstract": "The present paper explores the concept of negative perfectionism in the workplace. Negative perfectionism is unremitting and compulsive behavior in the process of striving to meet one's goals. We proposed that 4 types of negative or excessive behavior result from negative perfectionism in organizational settings: compulsive behavior, neurotic behavior, imposter behavior, and narcissistic behavior. Self‐concept‐based motivation theory was used as a framework for understanding how inaccuracies or inconsistencies between the evaluation of one's behavior in the workplace (goal‐setting behavior) and the type of feedback cues to which one decides to attend (feedback‐seeking behavior) might lead to these types of negative or excessive behaviors. Personal and managerial implications of negative perfectionism in organizational settings are discussed. . . . when personal characteristics grate harmfully on others or significantly derail the success of the persons themselves, psychologists regard them not just as personality traits, but as personality disorders. —Miller (1998)",

      "abstract": "There are a number of reasons why individuals engage in socially undesirable behavior. These behaviors produce personally desirable outcomes, but most individuals restrain themselves from action in favor of longer‐term goals. Inhibiting behavior serves as a key psychological process that governs numerous transgressive acts such as risk taking, aggression, and other impulsive behaviors. A prominent social learning theory model of disinhibition details three phases during which self‐sanctioning processes fail to limit or prevent transgressive behavior. These include justifying the nature of the conduct, rationalizing the effects of the conduct, and focusing on characteristics of the victim. The model emphasizes the role that observing others plays in disinhibition and thereby speaks well to media influences. The effects of media on consumers' likelihood of disinhibiting behavior operate on each of these three stages. Passive media such as television shows and movies, as well as interactive media, such as video games, social media, and web browsing, operate in both broad and specific ways to affect processes that occur within each stage.",

The exertion of self-control, however, is experienced as strenuous and aversive. Referring to theoretical approaches from motivation psychology, we assume that striving for performance goals can feel more or less strenuous, because the goal is based on the implicit or on the explicit achievement motive or on both types of motives. We argue that three sources of self-control demands (difficulty of the task, lack of activity-related incentives and motive-goal incongruence) determine whether the process of goal striving feels easy, moderate, or hard, or, in other words, whether the path to high performance is \"paved\", \"graveled\", or \"stony\".",

      "abstract": "The stability or change of problem solving strategies, without or with practice, is considered as an important aspect of human problem solving. It is proposed that a strategy is not situation dependent, but reflects stability in the problem solving skill of a subject. It is assumed that without practice in a task a strategy should recur in repeated solutions where the intervals between solutions are long. This hypothesis is investigated in this study. A production system, simulating in detail the behavior of one subject's solution to a spatial series task, is presented. The program is based on a think-aloud protocol produced by the subject while solving the task. The behavior of the program is compared to the subject's solution of the task one and two years later. These comparisons show that the subject uses mainly the same strategy or set of rules on the three occasions, even though the particular solutions on each occasion were rather different in terms of time to solution and answers given. Processing errors and rule modification are two factors that can explain the differences in behavior, rather than switches in the strategies the subject used. The study gives support to the hypothesis about stability of strategies.",

      "title": "Who Puts the ‘Active’ into ‘Active Learning’?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Learning is here considered to have taken place when someone has developed the habit, propensity, and disposition to attend productively to things not previously noticed, and in ways not previously experienced, to do with some specific and particular content. ‘Active learning’ sounds like a tautology, but was introduced as a contrast to the more passive activity of students sitting in lectures listening and transcribing mathematics written on a board or screen onto their own paper. The stance taken here is that effective and efficient learning involves active engagement in activity, but includes enculturation through being in the presence of a relative expert 1 who themselves is manifesting mathematical thinking, not simply passing on the records of the results of previous mathematical thought. Such ‘passivity’ does not necessarily require intention. Following Bennett 2 actions are here taken to involve three agents or impulses: initiating, responding, and reconciling or mediating. All three agents are thus active, but in different ways. Interactions intended to contribute to learning are considered to be actions, and so involve three agents: learner, teacher (in some manifestation), and mathematical content, all within a culture or ethos. Since there are six different ways in which the triple of agents can be assigned to the triple of impulses, six different modes are possible. Analysing these modes sheds light on different ways in which learning could be said to be ‘active’. Activity takes place within a mode of interaction. Again following Bennett, effective activity is here taken to require appropriate relationships among the gap between current state and intended goal, the resources available, and the tasks set. 1 Vygotsky (1978) pointed out that ‘higher psychological processes’ are first encountered in others. 2 Bennett (1993); see also Shantock Systematics Group (1975)",

In this review, I describe these three pupil responses, how they are related to high-level cognition, and the neural pathways that control them. I also discuss the functional relevance of pupil responses, that is, how pupil responses help us to better see the world. Although pupil responses likely serve many functions, not all of which are fully understood, one important function is to optimize vision either for acuity (small pupils see sharper) and depth of field (small pupils see sharply at a wider range of distances), or for sensitivity (large pupils are better able to detect faint stimuli); that is, pupils change their size to optimize vision for a particular situation. In many ways, pupil responses are similar to other eye movements, such as saccades and smooth pursuit: like these other eye movements, pupil responses have properties of both reflexive and voluntary action, and are part of active visual exploration.",

Eye fixations occur naturally during reading, and technology allows them to be recorded without intruding on the reader. Moreover, the reading task itself is undisturbed, and unaccompanied by unusual secondary tasks, such as monitoring for a second stimulus or making lexical-decision judgments. In the procedure that use most often, the reader sits in an armchair and reads a text displayed on a video monitor while his or her eye fixations are monitored and recorded from a distance. This procedure is relatively similar to normal reading in several respects. The main dependent measure is the gaze duration, rather than the duration of individual eye fixations.",

The claim is that affect plays a major role in SRL not only as an independent process that can facilitate or impede learning activities and performance but also through its interactions with cognition and metacognition. These interactions render metacognition a hot rather than a cold process. Critical cognitive states that have implications for affect and metacognition are processing fluency/disfluency, interruptions, discrepancies, or gaps in knowledge. Epistemic emotions focus on such cognitive states and are related to metacognitive experiences such as feeling of difficulty (in the case of surprise) and feeling of confidence (in the case of curiosity). Two studies exemplifying the relations between metacognitive experiences and epistemic emotions are presented. The implications of the findings for learning and SRL are discussed.",

      "title": "Taking recognition to the next level",
      "abstract": "FigureAs a leader, have you ever thought about which behaviors and actions you like and dislike in your employees? Maybe not intentionally, but I bet that many of you have rolled your eyes or sighed at the behaviors and actions that you don't appreciate and smiled at those you do. Are you seeing a lot of noteworthy behaviors and actions on your unit or in your area of responsibility? Are you rewarding them? In her book, Feel the Pull: Creating a Culture of Nursing Excellence, Gen Guanci states that the manager who simply recognizes \"the behavior they want, when they see it, is highly effective.\"1 Nurse leaders who have effective recognition habits engage effective nursing staff. Nurse leaders should be attentive and note the positive behaviors and actions that occur on their unit and within the organization. Staff members who promote and demonstrate the behaviors that you value need to be recognized. As you walk throughout your organization, participate in meetings, and interact with individuals, look and listen for the words and actions that reflect positively on your unit and on the nursing profession and acknowledge them with appropriate and timely recognition. Reinforcing these behaviors and actions in your area of responsibility and around your organization promotes a culture of positivity and professionalism.2 Relationships first Start by getting to know your staff. Spend time with them and encourage them to share their likes, dislikes, dreams, career goals, what inspired them to be a nurse, what drew them to your area, and so on. You should know if your staff members have a significant other and/or children. What are their hobbies? What motivates them to come to work every day? It may be money, it may be the patients, or it may be an opportunity to interact with other adults. Only knowing a couple of quick facts about your staff isn't enough; leaders need to build relationships and show genuine interest in their team members. This demonstrates that you value and appreciate them enough to take the time to get to know them on a personal level. Be sure to discern if your staff member likes to be recognized privately or publicly. Gratitude that's given in a group could be embarrassing for a staff member and make them uncomfortable. It can also lead to animosity among staff members if one individual is continually recognized and others aren't. Be mindful of the different personality types on your unit before you publicly recognize someone. Introverts are most comfortable \"interacting in small groups and with one-on-one relationships.\"3 Extroverts are sociable, assertive, and joyful, and \"enjoy being the center of attention.\"3 Each should be recognized differently. Devoting time to building relationships with your staff increases your knowledge and helps you make the recognition appropriate for the individual. A personal touch Making the recognition individualized shows thoughtfulness and compassion. How many coffee shop gift cards are you giving to a staff member who doesn't drink coffee? It's a nice gesture; however, if they don't drink coffee, they're likely wondering what you expect them to do with the gift card and grumbling to their coworkers about how you don't even know them. I'd also encourage you to take that gift card moment a step further. It's not personable enough to just hand a gift card to an employee and say \"thank you.\" Take the time to pick out a thank-you card, write a sincere note of gratitude, and place the gift card in the envelope. Let's talk more about thank-you cards. Are you choosing basic white cards with the words \"thank you\" printed across the front that come in a box of 100? Or are you using cards that have the company logo on the front? Stop being boring and cold! The card is just as important as the message.4 Choose a thank-you card that fits the person and the recognition you're giving. For your staff member who loves dogs, find a card with dogs on the front, and give the staff member who loves to garden a card with flowers on it. This may mean that you have to buy more cards in additional styles, but it won't go unnoticed by the person receiving the card.4 A heartfelt message Now you may be thinking to yourself: \"Thank-you cards? Really?\" You may prefer to send emails or write on the back of a gift card or simply buy someone lunch in the cafeteria as a gesture of recognition. These acts of appreciation and kindness are fine, too. I encourage you to make them as heartfelt as the handwritten note. Be sincere in your email. If you want to take it to the next level, type it up, print it off, and hand deliver it. Tell the individual that you didn't want to just send another email. If you're buying lunch or a coffee for someone, ask to do so before jumping in and paying. Let them know that as a token of appreciation for the wonderful thing they did for you, a staff member, or a patient, you'd like to buy them lunch or coffee, and ask them if that would be okay. Asking for permission in this way shows respect for the individual and explains the meaning behind the act of recognition.5 What are the right words to express your appreciation? How do you say \"thank you\"? Be sincere and specific. Start with how the behavior or act made you feel–grateful, appreciative, wonderful, pleased, surprised, and so on. Next, thank individuals for the specific behavior or act. Mention the patient, family, the event, or other pertinent details. Then, describe the impact of their behavior or act; for example, the department looked neater, the patient felt better, or the mood on the unit was positive. Finally, grammar counts. Be sure to write in full sentences and check your spelling. A poorly expressed thank-you can leave a bad impression.5 Keeping and sharing messages And what would you like individuals to do with these heartfelt thank-you notes? I recommend that everyone have a \"You Are GREAT!\" folder. Each time an individual receives a thank-you, they should place it in their folder. You could even have a department or unit folder to hold all of the patient and family thank-you notes. Order some plain file folders, markers, stickers, or other craft items and let staff members decorate their own folders, or give them meaningful folders as a gift. These folders give your team members the opportunity to reflect on the great work they've done and those who have appreciated them. They can read and share the notes that they've received to uplift and encourage themselves and each other. Designate time for individuals to share at huddles or staff meetings if they're willing to. Again, taking time to acknowledge the behaviors and actions you want to see as a leader reinforces them and creates a culture of nursing excellence. A daily dose of kudos Recognition for a job well done and positive behaviors makes an individual feel respected and treasured. It also provides your team members with positive motivation to continue to do an excellent job and be present in all the work they do. I had a leader who taught me to not let the sun go down without saying \"thank you.\" I encourage you to be the leader who gives thoughtful and immediate recognition before the sun sets each day.",

      "abstract": "Thinking psychodynamically involves looking for unconscious meaning in what patients say and do. Difficult thoughts and feelings that are unconscious are often expressed in actions. Aggressive and sexual wishes, which can be particularly difficult to acknowledge, are often revealed in behavior. Missing sessions and lateness, eating or drinking in the session, clothing choices etc this is by no means an exhaustive list any behavior can have unconscious meanings. A type of behavior for example, lateness does not always mean the same thing. Just because therapist suspects that a given behavior might have an unconscious meaning does not necessarily require to discuss this with patients. Therapist often waits until they have observed the behavior many times before therapist bring it to the patient's attention. The inherent characteristics of our patient's words and behaviors, as well as our reactions to them, are guides to unconscious meaning.",

Djelovanje jednog ili vise principa u nekoj pojavi, naziva se monizmom, odnosno pluralizmom. Upravo se za turizam opravdano kaže da to nije monouslužna djelatnost, jer u njoj sudjeluje vise drugih povezanih djelatnosti (trgovina, promet, ugostiteljstvo, turisticko posrednistvo i dr.). Isto se može reci i za hotelijerstvo, jer se za vrijeme boravka u hotelu (ili nekom drugom ugostiteljskom objektu za smjestaj) gostima ne pruža samo jedna usluga, vec veci broj međusobno komplementarnih usluga (smjestaj, prehrana, pice, sport, animacija, rekreacija i dr.). S druge strane, praksa je stvarna, neposredno korisna djelatnost. To je primjena, provedba u djelo, postupak obavljanje nekog strucnog rada određenog trajanja za vrijeme ili poslije zavrsenog skolovanja ali i aktivan covjekov odnos prema zbilji.

      "abstract": "Abstract At all stages of life, the body can be considered an occupational resource that interacts with social structures in identity formation and complicates personal adaptation to life transitions. As the body declines, the economic and social standing it confers also tends to decline, leading to socially embedded fears about physical decline and marginalization. This paper applies theoretical work from embodiment theory and the life course perspective to examine how perceptions of aging and life experience with sport (or lack thereof) influence exercise participation and athletic identity. Using a narrative approach, I examine in-depth interviews I conducted with elite athletes, masters’ athletes, coaches, athletic program directors, mature adults. Some participants struggled to exercise regularly, and others are exercising more in their later years than at any other point in their lives. Three key themes emerged: 1) bodily identity is tremendously important in relation to other forms of identity when it is affected by aging, ill-health, or other physical processes; 2) physical functional mobility becomes increasingly important with age; and 3) experiences with sports and athletic identity (or lack thereof) influence engagement in exercise in later life in surprising ways. The paper challenges society’s focus on youth in sports and elite athletes, to discuss how our greater longevity means that we must place more emphasis on identifying ways to keep physically active and mobile throughout adulthood.",

      "title": "INTELLIGENT AGENTS AS SYNTHETIC ROLE PLAYERS IN SCENARIO-BASED TRAINING",
      "abstract": "Intelligent agents are increasingly being exploited as synthetic role players (e.g., teammates, coaches, and opponents) in scenario-based training (SBT). However, the introduction of intelligent agents into training applications comes with its share of challenges given the unique requirements of each role. In particular, the required level of intelligence depends on the requirements of a particular role. For example, agents performing as \"extras\" in a scene require little or no intelligence, whereas an in situ remediation agent requires the ability to diagnose student deficiencies relative to, for example, the school solution and provide appropriate instruction to remedy the deficiencies. To perform some functions, agents require an understanding of the problem domain; for others, they merely need to understand their own tasks. In some cases, agents need the ability to plan, whereas in other cases they merely need the ability to react. A pedagogical agent that typically interacts with the learner stands to benefit from having a human persona (an avatar) and an instructor-like personality. In light of the foregoing, the implementation of these agents for scenario-based training (SBT) can take a variety of forms and vary in their level of sophistication. This paper presents the various roles that intelligent agents can play in SBT to dramatically lower training costs without compromising training effectiveness.",

      "title": "Attentional Sub-Processes Involved with Emotional Eating",
      "abstract": "Emotional eating behavior is characterized by eating a large amount of calorie dense sweet and/or high fat foods in an attempt to control, cope with, or avoid negative emotions. Numerous factors are likely to contribute to emotional eating behavior, including attentional factors, such as rumination and avoidance coping. Rumination based emotional eating (attention focused on negative stimuli while mindlessly eating) is often utilized to improve mood while dwelling on problems. However, for those inclined to escape/avoid troublesome thoughts, another type of emotional-eating pattern may be used. By focusing attention on food, emotional eating is believed to distract individuals from negative emotions. However, along with avoiding distressing thoughts, a strong attentional focus on food may also lead to diminished attention resources and subsequently the missing of self-preserving thoughts (e.g. dietary restraint or satiety). While Denke & Lamm (2015) explored neural mechanisms underlying rumination based emotional eating, to the best of our knowledge, no one has investigated the neural correlates underlying avoidance based emotional eating. This study examined how attentional sub-processes contribute to emotional eating behavior among female participants in a task designed to explore escape type emotional-eating behavior. Dense-array EEG and a version of the canonical attentional blink task were used to ascertain the neural correlates underlying the attentional sub-processes and how attentional activation differs for emotional eaters vs. non-emotional eaters. Findings do not support the food fixation escape type emotional-eater hypothesis, but do indicate task validity.",

      "title": "Time: The Uncertainty of Frame or Content",
      "abstract": "SummaryPsychoanalysis lends itself to the study of temporal uncertainty of frame and content. A psychoanalytic session has a fixed beginning and a fixed end, a rigid frame. The psychoanalytic patient, however, is encouraged to behave in a rather fluid way, to “free associate,” to say what comes to mind. A fixed temporal frame for a loose temporal content characterizes the psychoanalytic situation which includes the following characteristics:The patient’s analytic hour, his extended time-out (from work, usual activity, usual style of behavior and communicating), is the analyst’s extended and relatively usual time-in.The analyst, more than the patient, assumes that contiguity of communication (and of experience) has possible meaning implications transcending contiguity as such. Especially at the beginning of a psychoanalysis the patient may well think that he is shifting from one topic to another when the analyst listens for, or suspects, a hidden meaningful link between the apparently disparate themes.The analyst, more than the patient, assumes that temporal distance of communication (and of experience) does not eliminate the possibility of meaningful connection and may even be a defense against such connection. What a patient says at the end of a session may seem to him especially unrelated to what he said at the beginning. The analyst may well suspect not only a meaningful, but perhaps a painful connection between these temporally distant communications. He may hypothesize that the patient, unconsciously, may wish to emphasize their unrelatedness.The analyst may thus be said to be both a condenser and a dilator of time.Sequence may be translated in the context of clarifications and interpretations as having specific meaning as such. Sequential dream “phrases,” for instance, may sometimes be understood as prepositional clauses: dream scene A followed by dream scene B may be interpreted as “if A, then B.”The analyst, a condenser and dilator of time who attaches unusual meanings to sequences and pays strict attention to the beginning and ending of sessions, yet seems also to live in a different temporal world which he treats “loosely,” may for all these reasons be seen by the patient as dealing with time in a most peculiar way.The patient, who finds that some of these peculiar dilating and contracting ways of looking at time are productive and meaningful in furthering his understanding of his own mental processes, may adopt them as a tool in his self-investigation.The stage may thus be set for the patient’s on-going processes of reorganization of time experience.",

Practicing relaxation exercises and eye exercises has been shown to improve motor functions and attention. Yoga procedures like Pranayama, Trataka and Jala Neti (one of the procedures in Shatkarma) are recommended with high emphasis. The present review study is an effort to highlight the efficacy of Yoga in the management of refractive errors.For this study, a total of 6 articles were collected from the internet and were critically analyzed and compiled.All these studies showed significant improvements in signs and symptoms developed in refractive errors.However, those studies were conducted on a small sample size.So, for strong evidence of the role of Yoga in refractive errors, a greater number of research works should be carried out in a large sample size.",

Edward K. Strong, one of the most influential authorities on interests, proposed that interests involve enduring attention, positive feeling, and action directed toward the object of interest, as well as preference for that object over another. Occupational interests in particular may be understood as “patterns of likes, dislikes, and indifferences regarding career‐relevant activities and occupations.” Notably, interests only relay information about the likelihood that an activity will be initiated and continued; interest in the activity does not guarantee that the activity will be carried out successfully. For career interests this means that an individual's interest in a career does not carry the promise of his or her high performance in it. Additional factors, such as abilities, bridge the gap between interest and performance.",

Some strongly held beliefs, such as a commitment to justice, to high ethical standards of clinical practice, openness to the views of others, a belief in dialogue and inclusion, are easy to incorporate in the ethos of a systemic supervision group. David Campbell and Charlotte Burck wrote, trainee supervisors are often very interested to explore with tutors how they themselves use personal resonances in a reflexive way and they ask questions about what occasions a supervisor can use self disclosure. Supervisors are more likely to describe the activities that can be generalised in order to be of use to other supervisors, but the attempt to de-centre the supervisor's position can ignore the likelihood that those at the receiving end might tell a different tale.",

      "abstract": "In the affect and cognition literature, some studies demonstrate that dysphoric mood increases effortful processing of social and nonsocial information, but others demonstrate that it decreases such processing. Five studies examined the effect of dysphoric mood on perceivers' subjective unitization of an observed other's ongoing behavior into discrete meaningful actions. Dysphoria generally reduced unitization rate (i.e., number of actions discriminated). Additional evidence indicates that this reduction likely results from failure to initiate a higher (more effortful) unitization rate rather than from inability to achieve such a level of processing. Data also suggest that dysphoric mood can actually increase unitization rate when adopting that mode of processing might relieve the dysphoria. It is concluded that dysphoric mood may lead perceivers to exhibit a more discriminating \"cognitive palate\" in terms of how much effort they choose to expend on processing available information.",

Emotion regulation has many similarities to other regulatory tasks such as dieting, and abstaining from smoking, drugs, alcohol, ill-advised sexual encounters, gambling, and procrastination, but it differs in a few important respects. Emotion regulation is similar to other kinds of self-regulation in that it consists of three components: standards, monitoring, and strength. Emotion regulation involves overriding one set responses with another, incompatible set, just like with other types of self-control. And like other regulatory tasks, emotion regulation can fail either because of underregulation or because of misregulation. Although emotion regulation is similar in many respects to other regulatory tasks, it is a special case of self-regulation in that it can often undermine attempts at other kinds of self- control. Specifically, focusing on regulating moods and feeling states can lead to a failure of self-control in other areas.",

Results: The results of this research shown that the conversations found in Little Abid's book consist of 80% complementary conversations, 0% cross conversations, and 20% hidden conversations. Complementary transactions are complementary events occurring between the same two ego states (attitudes) and can occur between two different but complementary ego states (attitudes). Cross transactions, namely transactions occur when messages sent by the ego state do not receive the correct response or do not receive the response expected by the messenger (communicator). Hidden transactions are complex events involving two or more ego states.",

      "abstract": "From the side of upper-level applications which require planning the actions in robot or those which need to search the whole log of activities in smart home, the action predicate expressions in the form of knowledge graphs may play an important role. The sequence of activities alone, which can be supplied by the conventional activity recognition systems, may not be sufficient for those applications. The subject of the particular activity is crucial information in most of the cases, and the object of the particular activity is often necessary to identify the characteristics. From this perspective, we have investigated the activities recognized by activity recognition systems, trying to identify their hidden elements which play the role of the subject and the object of the activities, i.e. activity knowledge graph. If we focus on these hidden elements, they are categorized in two: (1) person (subject) - person (object) interaction, and (2) person (subject) - object (object) interactions. Depending on the class of activities, these two are sometimes faced great difficulties: the hidden elements for walk, pick-up, open, and drink are quite easy but those for look-at, see, watch, and throw are difficult. The source of difficulties arises from the fact that the object (object) is not contacted from the person (subject). In this paper we have developed a method which identifies non-contacted object by the direction of the eye gaze of the person (subject) in the category of watch (activity). Using \"Watching TV\" data by Stair lab, the proposed system achieved 85% in accuracy.",

      "title": "The influence of motivation on the psychophysiological state of a person",
      "abstract": "The influence of motivation on psychophysiological states of a person is investigated. It is established that motivation is a psychological process that controls human behavior. Motivation is a guiding tool of the individual in the process of achieving goals. At different stages of motivation a person has different psychophysiological states. There are six stages of motivation: 1. The emergence of needs; 2. Finding ways to eliminate the need; 3. Defining goals; 4. Implementation of the action; 5. Receiving reward for the action; 6. Elimination of needs. Psychophysiological state can be called the physiological level of mental state with special energy features. There is a classification of psychophysiological states: neutral (calm, confidence, etc.); activation (excitement, inspiration, rise, concentration, etc.); tonic, those states that reflect the resources of forces (satiety, fatigue, monotony, etc.); tension, showing what level of effort should be applied to the person (tension, stress, sensory hunger, etc.). Thus, in the process of achieving goals, motivation is an important component. Knowing the effect of motivation on a person's psychophysiological states will help him to use this tool in the best way. A survey of 200 people was conducted to help determine what psychophysiological states occur at different stages of motivation. After analyzing the results of the study, it was found that most often in the process of motivation in humans there are activating psychophysiological states, then tension and rarely tonic. When processing the results at each stage of motivation, three psychophysiological states were taken, which the subjects chose more often. It was found that activating psychophysiological states are more common in the first five stages of motivation, tension psychophysiological states are more common in the second, third, fourth and sixth stages of motivation, tonic psychophysiological states occur in the sixth stage of motivation.",

      "abstract": "Classical models of Situation Awareness (SA) describe it as a process involving self-agency, or as rooted in [externally directed] consciousness operating in a perceptual cycle. These models are robust for dynamic situations where events unfold gradually in the temporal dimension at a rate that is compatible with the ability of the human agent to process information, and where this information processing is largely unaffected by event-induced [aversive] emotional arousal. A model for SA acquisition for situations that express rapid dynamics for a limited duration, which are non-prototypical in nature, and involve high stakes, including danger-induced emotional arousal, does not exist. These types of situations are typically encountered in mission critical domains such as law enforcement, firefighting, aviation, combat, etc. In these situations, the traditional models of SA predicated on conscious perception of situation elements and processing of information may not be appropriate, because the [slow] speed and [high] bandwidth of consciousness are suboptimal for the occasion, thus preventing the agent from realizing successful outcomes. Furthermore, unconsciousness, which has largely been ignored by SA theorists, plays a critical role in acquiring SA under these circumstances. This paper presents a model for SA, referred to as Somatic Situation Awareness (SSA), for situations such as those described above. The SSA model shows that the incorporation of two key findings from psychology and neurosciences, unconscious or attention-driven orientation, and somatosensory processes, respectively, can adequately explain situation assessment for these special instances. In terms of the SA acquisition taxonomy, the aforesaid processes have been classified as belonging to the pre-cognitive phase. Next, the paper shows how this pre-cognitive phase of SA acquisition may influence the classical SA framework. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of SSA with regards to human-system design, computer cognition, technology and training.",

      "abstract": "In de meeste neuropsychologische handboeken staat geschreven dat bij diagnostisch onderzoek moet worden nagegaan of onvoorziene factoren de testresultaten beinvloeden en daarmee de interpretatie van het onderzoek vertroebelen. De bedoelde factoren kunnen van externe aard zijn, zoals lawaai ten tijde van het onderzoek, maar ook patientgerelateerd, zoals vermoeidheid, angstige gespannenheid, slechthorendheid, persoonlijkheidskenmerken. In veel klinische rapporten worden dergelijke factoren genoemd zonder dat duidelijk gemaakt wordt of, op welke wijze en in welke mate ze de interpretatie hebben beinvloed of zelfs gekanteld. Een eenvoudig recept voor het opsporen van en omgaan met onvoorziene factoren is niet te geven; een 'kookboek' is niet voorhanden en zou niet functioneren. Vakkennis, klinische ervaring en een kritische, open houding zijn van wezenlijk belang. Met dit artikel hopen we te illustreren dat zelfs nadat alle onderzoeksgegevens tot een ogenschijnlijk sluitende interpretatie hebben geleid en de oorzaak van de cognitieve of gedragsproblemen voor de hand lijkt te liggen, de onderzoeker op haar/zijn qui-vive moet blijven. Tevens pleiten we voor aanscherping van de notie 'stoorfactor' – of in beter Nederlands 'storende factoren'.",

      "abstract": "Las acciones que un sujeto lleva a cabo no son independientes; sus acciones conforman sus habitos. A traves de su accion el sujeto hace realidad sus deseos y define el contexto de sus decisiones y compromisos. Al ordenar su experiencia y prever los efectos de sus acciones evita ceder a un impulso que luego le reste libertad. Caer en la tentacion de una recompensa inmediata, renunciando a una mayor en el futuro, depende de su habilidad para sobreponerse a la frustracion, postergar recompensas, e imponer su libertad de accion conjurando las amenazas que representan ceder a la tentacion, la provocacion, la corrupcion de su voluntad, o la adiccion. En este trabajo se estudia como el exito de un sujeto en el control de su conducta depende de su experiencia y de su interaccion con otros, de como otros castigan y recompensan sus acciones. Se concluye que los discursos y politicas sociales no estan contribuyendo a ello al no modificar las condiciones de la experiencia del sujeto; las carencias se suplen con discursos que promueven la decepcion social y retoricas politicas de base nominalista..",

Causes of failure of an individual member of a group include early dropout and conflict with intimacy. Failure of the leader includes internal issues, such as countertransference, incongruent goals or desire for unrealistic treatment results, boundary issues, and setting of group structure through group rules. The leader's external issues relate to training and knowledge, while the leader's situational issues consist of those areas over which the therapist has little or no control, such as agency assignments. Failure of the group-as-a-whole may be due to therapeutic impasse or lack of cohesion. Cognizance of these factors is seen as primary in minimizing or preventing failures.",

      "title": "Learning",
      "abstract": "In spite of its critical importance within education, the problem of explaining how learning takes place, and analysing the factors that influence it, remains a confused area. Teachers, and educators generally, often blame the psychologist for this, and claim that he either presents them with several conflicting explanations of learning, each one based upon a different psychological theory, or a single coherent explanation with which he has to admit other psychologists would probably not agree. Yet perhaps this blame, though understandable, is a little unfair. The problem is that learning is such a highly complex activity. We each of us receive a constant and varied stream of experiences throughout our waking moments, each one of which potentially can give rise to learning, yet most of which apparently vanish without trace from our mental lives. What is it that makes some things memorable and others not? Why is it that a particular event can prompt learning in one person yet have no measurable effect upon someone else? Why does an individual learn readily from one teacher but not from another?",

      "abstract": "Warmth and respect are considered essential skills for relationship building in social work. However, these skills are often treated as common sense, and how to be respectful and warm, particularly in challenging situations, remains unclear. Practice guidance is commonly given as a list of generic behaviours or vague directions. Furthermore, it is not clear how being respectful or warm leads to effective relationships. In this article, we applied conversation analysis to examine transcripts of video recordings of 12 sessions of ‘Moving Forward: Making Changes’, the national groupwork programme addressing sexual offending in Scotland, to outline and specify the interactional practices that constitute instances of respect and warmth in social work practice. We found practitioners demonstrated warmth and respect by recognising and acknowledging clients’ accounts and identities in the interaction through subtle discursive practices. These practices include using hedging words and phrases (e.g. sort of, maybe), framing challenges as questions or suggestions rather than declarations, and using therapeutic phrasing (i.e. ‘I’m curious about’, I’m wondering’). As such, we propose the actions of demonstrating respect and warmth are achieved in interaction through the ways practitioners delicately manage issues of epistemic authority, that is, a person’s primary rights to knowledge about themselves, and face, that is, self-presentation. Drawing on the concepts of epistemic authority and face furthers our theoretical and practical understanding of the practice skills of respect and warmth, and their role in building effective working relationships.",

      "title": "Cognitive and metacognitive, motivational, and resource considerations for learning new skills across the lifespan",
      "abstract": "Abstract Across the lifespan, learners have to tackle the challenges of learning new skills. These skills can range from abilities needed for survival, such as learning languages, learning to walk during infancy, and learning new software for a job in adulthood, to abilities related to leisure and hobbies. As the learner progresses through novice to expert stages, there are cognitive and metacognitive, motivational, and resource considerations for learning new skills. In terms of cognitive considerations, fluid and crystallized abilities as well as executive functions interact to help the learner process and retain information related to the skills. In terms of metacognitive considerations, knowing what to learn and how to learn are important for novel skill learning. In terms of motivational considerations, changes in individuals' intrinsic and extrinsic motivation throughout the lifespan impact their pursuit of novel skill learning, and declines in motivation can be buffered through the cultivation of grit, growth mindset, self‐efficacy, and other personal factors. In terms of resource considerations, there are many tools that learners can use to acquire new skills, but allocation and availability of these resources differ based on life stage and socioeconomic status. Taken together, these considerations may provide learners with the best chance at acquiring new skills across the lifespan. Further research investigating these three factors, particularly among older adult learners, and their interactive effects could help increase our understanding of their impacts on skill learning and inform future cognitive interventions that can be tailored to learners' unique needs.

The findings from the limited research involving potentially painful, injurious or life-threatening situations indicate that high levels of anxiety may compromise bushfire survival-related decisions and actions in four ways: (a) threats may be overlooked and tasks may take longer than anticipated, with mistakes more likely; (b) attention is likely to become narrowly focussed on only a few aspects of the situation, while distracting thoughts may intrude; (c) it may be difficult to keep important things in mind and hard to remember survival-related information; and (d) forming sound judgements and making good decisions may become progressively more difficult.

      "abstract": "The 'business as usual' approach to insight problem solving suggests that working memory processes would have a prominent role in solving insight problems, as they do in non-insight (incrementally solvable) problems. The alternate 'special process' view would be compatible with a reduced role for working memory processes and postulates a large role for unconscious processes not limited by working memory capacity. This chapter systematically reviews available studies to assess their implications for working memory functions in insight problem solving. Results indicate that working memory has a somewhat lesser role in insight compared to non-insight problems, which is consistent with a role for special processes in insight problem solving, but the effect is small, indicating considerable overlap between the processes involved in insight and non-insight problem solving. An integrative view is that the solution of typical insight problems involve both business as usual and special processes, but that problems differ in the degree to which each type of process is involved. Some problems may involve very little in terms of business as usual and mainly depend on special processes, while others may require considerable business as usual (for example to reach impasse) and then involve special processes as a final brief stage.",

      "abstract": "Poetry aims to change people’s talk, thoughts and actions but does not do this through direct commands, mands, or directives. The aim of this paper is to explore poetry in a behavioral or contextual analysis to analyze (1) what poetry does to people and (2) how it does that. In exploring a first question, “What does poetry to do people?”, it was found that poetry is a way of writing which acts to disrupt normal forms and grammar of writing and, while the lack of grammar slows the reading fluency and accuracy, the disturbances have novel effects on readers’ actions, talking and thinking. In answer to a second question, “How does poetry have effects on people?”, the social disruptions which produce the effects of poetry have been developed over long histories and include disruptions to form and grammar, the written presentation on a page, line length, and the inclusion of stress patterns rhymes and rhymes. Some of these also help sustain the attention of the reader since the lack of normal grammar and presentation makes reading poetry more effortful. Finally, a few clinical applications are drawn out, especially since the experiences and ideas evoked through poetic forms, just like experiences of mental health, are ones which cannot usually just be stated as directives.

Anxiety disorders differ from normal feelings of nervousness or anxiousness and involve excessive fear or anxiety. Anxiety disorders can cause people to try to avoid situations that trigger or worsen their symptoms. There are several types of anxiety disorders, including Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a disorder in which people have recurring, unwanted thoughts, ideas, or sensations (obsessions) that make them feel driven to do something repetitively (compulsions). Repetitive behaviors, such as hand washing, checking on things, or cleaning, can significantly interfere with a person’s daily activities and social interactions. This Expert system which implements Dempster Shafer Method can help anyone to make sure that they have OCD and need psychologist help to prevent this distress from becoming worst.",

Any disorder that affects attention or memory may impact the ability to calculate. In addition, disturbances in the underlying grammatical structure of language, in visuospatial capability, in logical reasoning, or in problem solving may affect performance. Mental retardation is associated with deficits in this area. A dementia or delirium will impact computational ability. One can test for computational ability by asking the patient to perform mental calculations and possibly written computations during the interview. Commonly used tests include the serial subtraction of serial 7's from 100 or asking the patient to compute the amount of change that would be due after a simple purchase. Word problems not only test for the ability to calculate but also demand the use of conceptualization, logical reasoning, and problem-solving strategies.",

      "abstract": "Professional self-determination of young people is a controversial process complicated by the need to choose the field of activity and determine their place in life. Taking into account the complex influence of all factors on the professional orientation of young people is considered a reliable guarantee of the young person's choice of profession as part of life self-determination. However, it cannot be assumed that this process does not need management and practical support, and it can be carried out in a self-adjusting way. In addition, when choosing a profession, young people often rely on external attributes (publicity, showiness, prestige of the profession within the immediate circles) which gives rise to a corresponding interest in its development. Sometimes they do not take into account their correspondence to the requirements of the particular professional field: personal traits representing the importance of a professional, intellectual level of development, or the physiological capabilities necessary for the implementation of this professional activity. Increased attention is aimed at development of the natural instincts of the younger generation, as well as their professional formation, that is, on organizing assistance to young people in the choice of employment. At the same time, the choice should be made not only with a focus on the needs and opportunities of young people themselves, but also taking into account the labor market situation in the conditions of continuous updating of the list of popular professions. Willingness to respond quickly to market demands is the most approved approach to choosing a profession in modern conditions. Timely and qualified assistance in professional orientation would help young people meet the highest need: the need for self-realization.",

Using these criteria to eval uate the various options for deter mining words, four show capability for building power for the reader: sight words, phonics, structural anal ysis, and context clues. Sight words are those words recognized immedi ately without resorting to analysis. Phonics is the association of speech sounds with printed symbols. Struc tural analysis is the analysis of words through identification of meaningful parts. Context clues consist of clues given by the setting or function of the word in a sentence or paragraph. The four are not unknown to reading teachers. What seem to be the two major dilemmas in this situation are: 1) children may not employ all four of these word recog nition skills in a balanced, varied strategy, and 2) they may not apply se skills at the appropriate time during reading. The key resides in mastery of all four strategies. It is entirely probable that a child has some degree of achievement in each attack area.

      "abstract": "Summary The nursing assessment, and the contribution it makes to the identification of an individual's health needs, is often a complex and multidimensional process. This is always true when the individual concerned has a severe learning disability. The nurse should develop the assessment in partnership with individuals who may experience major communication difficulties, or have unappreciated levels of perceptual or cognitive dysfunction. They may also live with the ongoing possibility that their affective or behavioural responses may be misinterpreted as ‘challenging behaviour’. This case study focuses upon one particular young man with a severe learning disability living in a community home. Drawing upon the principles of qualitative research methods, especially those of ‘grounded theory’, this study aims to demonstrate how these can be used to develop a uniquely person‐centred assessment. A systematic process of observation, analysis and reflection produces a detailed picture of the individual and his or her particular health states. The strength of this approach is threefold. Firstly, the person is considered as an active participant and remains the central focus. Secondly, in contrast to many other forms of assessment, the person is viewed as dynamic with ever changing needs. Thirdly, the process of nursing judgement is made explicit and integrated into the assessment process.",

Se clasificara a los individuos por sus aptitudes visuales laborales para un determinado trabajo o un grupo de ellos: en buenos o aptos, I; medianos o aptos, II; malos o aptos, III, e ineptos. 4. En los casos de defectos de refraccion veremos de corregirlos opticamente, a fin de poner al sujeto en condiciones de trabajo, mejorando sus aptitudes visuales, para que realice la labor en las mejores condiciones posibles. Se hara constar en el resultado del examen que la agudeza obtenida lo es con correcion optica. Se tendran en cuenta aquellos oficios en los que nos se admite tal correcion. 5. Como norma general, debiera de investigarse la funcion visual del individuo, en relacion con la O.P., a la edad de doce a catorce anos; asimismo siempre que escogiera una profesion o cambiase de oficio. Con los progresos de la Psicotecnia Industrial, son ya en gran numero las empresas que exigen este reconocimiento previo a la admision de personal. 6. Componiendose el factor visual de multiples manifestaciones o funciones (agudeza visual, vision proxima, campo visual, vision cromatica, de relieve, etc.) se comprende que seran variadas y numerosas las pruebas a que habra que someter al sujeto. Todas, si se trata de un examen de Orientacion general o que asi lo exige la indole de su profesion escogida; parte de ellas, cuando se haya escogido oficio u ocupacion, en cuyo caso se llevaran a cabo aquellas que estan en relacion con las aptitudes visuales que se exigen para dicho trabajo. 7. Se procurara emplear en las exploraciones medios, metodos y aparatos que, a la sencillez de la construccion y manejo, unan la mayor precision de los resultados. 8. La Orientacion profesional, en relacion con el factor visual, implica problemas de indole anatomo-fisiologico, aptologico, economico y social, por lo que, para poder dar un buen consejo de O.P., se ha de estar en contacto con el medio laboral para saber las condiciones y ambiente en que se realizan los distintos trabajos y sus diversas manipulaciones, asi como las condiciones visuales minimas que cada labor requiere y las contraindicaciones que puedan existir por alteraciones o defectos visuales, o los perjuicios que pueda acarrear para el aparato visual el desempeno de una determinada labor y si existen medios para evitarlos. 9. Creemos que se facilitara esta compleja labor con la ficha de aptitudes visuales profesionales, para cada oficio o labor, que estamos confeccionando hace tiempo. 10. Adaptando los individuos al trabajo segun el factor visual o aptitudes visuales laborables, realizaran este en las mejores condiciones posibles, por lo que a la par que lo efectuaran mas a gusto trabajaran mas y mejor, o sea que mejorara la calidad y aumentara la produccion. Asi mismo se hallaran menos expuestos a tener accidentes del trabajo o enfermedades profesionales. Como se comprende, todo ello redundara en beneficio del productor y de sus familiares, del patrono, del medio social y, a fin de cuentas, repercutira sin duda en la Economia Nacional.",

Este sesgo puede cometerse de varias maneras: privilegiando la mención de una alternativa sobre otras o contrastarlas desventajosamente; prohibiendo o sancionando respuestas que no considera válidas desde su punto de vista; o desatendiendo u omitiendo aclaraciones sobre lo discutido en clase.

      "title": "Workplace Fun and Its Correlates: A Conceptual Inquiry",
      "abstract": "This article addresses the concept of workplace fun as a real phenomenon which has distinct causes and consequences, some of which we discuss in this article. We also present a fun continuum which says that workplace fun is not or nothing situation. Rather, workplace fun is experienced along a continuum of less fun to more fun. The importance of this theory is that it encourages organizational leaders to realize that (1) Some factors decrease (while other factors increase) the potential for workplace fun; (2) They and other stakeholders can work together to increase the extent to which people experience workplace pleasure; and (3) Workplace fun positively impacts key performance indicators which can result in increased employee morale, higher creativity and innovation, better performance, greater organizational commitment, and lower turnover. The concept of workplace fun has hypothesized correlates which we intend to investigate empirically in future research, especially in the area of employee performance. Introduction Workplace fun is not an oxymoron. Fun is enjoyment, pleasure. Fun is the pleasure you experience while you are involved in some action such as doing something, seeing something, or even relaxing. This paper discusses fun at work, i.e., experiencing pleasure while performing work for which one is paid money. Fun at work is not an all or nothing situation (i.e., no fun or 100% fun). Instead, fun at work is experienced along a continuum, that implies one can experience less or more fun at work and that there are factors that can decrease or increase the pleasure that one experiences at work. Therefore, this paper delves into the following three questions: (1) What factors decrease workplace fun? (2) What factors increase workplace fun? And (3) Why should we care about fun in the workplace or how does the existence of workplace fun positively impact safety, quality, employee absenteeism and turnover, and other key performance indicators? Padilla, Hogan, and Kaiser (2007) believe that a toxic triangle exists that is comprised of leaders, susceptible followers and conducive environments, . . . and they note that leadership emphasizes negative outcomes for organizations and individuals linked with and affected by them (p. 176). In other words, there is a confluence of leader, follower, and environmental factors that make destructive leadership possible (Padilla, et al, 2007, p. 176). This paper proposes that there are factors that could decrease fun (or contribute to limited fun) in the workplace such as: (1) Negative culture and work environment; (2) Management inadequacies and failures; (3) Non-management inadequacies and failures; and (4) Systems and structure inadequacies. While this paper supports the concept that the elements that Padilla, et al (2007) describe as the toxic triangle negatively impact the work environment, other factors (e.g., systems and structure inadequacies) also have the potential of decreasing fun at work. Correlates of a Lack of Workplace Fun Workplace fun can be dramatically decreased by a negative work culture and dysfunctional work environment. Such negative cultures and environments often do not tolerate creativity and suggestions for improvement; they allow gossip, harassment, and violence; and/or they are rife with distrust and fear. Van Fleet and Van Fleet (2007) emphasize that management and non-management employees must begin to understand and help improve dysfunctional work environments. Yet managers of dysfunctional work environments often contribute to the negativism as they micromanage, abuse power, lack anger management skills, threaten and demean others, and/or engage in other illegal, unethical, or de-motivating behavior. As a result, this negatively impacts the work culture, and good employees may leave; quality, productivity, and profit decrease; costs increase; and stress and frustration increase (Pryor, Taneja, Singleton and Gautam, 2008). …",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sometimes protests cannot get off the ground because they are preemptively silenced. Other times acts of protest are produced, but they are not heard; and yet in other cases, protests are noticed but they receive no uptake or only a superficial and defective uptake. This chapter develops a critical examination of the speech act of protesting and of the forms of illocutionary silencing and of perlocutionary frustration or disablement that often neutralize acts of protest because of defective uptake or lack thereof. More specifically, it will analyze the case of protesting racial violence and how so often these acts of protest fall on deaf ears and achieve no results because of specific communicative dysfunctions and problems of reception and uptake.",

      "title": "Conducting Multilevel Intervention Research: Leveraging and Looking Beyond Methodological Advances",
      "abstract": "Much human behavior is guided by the seemingly reasonable intuition that “more is better,” perhaps deriving from evolutionary demands to fulfill basic needs for food, water, shelter, and safety. Such an intuition undergirds many educational, medical, and industrial advances over the past century. One can see this intuition when designers move from single impoverished solutions to more complex approaches. To what extent is the intuition accurate? It appears so in some domains; for example, recent evidence suggests that “multidisciplinary” research teams can, at least under some circumstances, produce more generative science than can individual investigators (1).\r\n\r\nIs it the case that more is better when designing health interventions? That is the question posed by the articles appearing in this supplement, with a particular focus on more levels of influence. The guiding intuition is that well-meaning practitioners and researchers are often myopic in their attempts to change health outcomes because they do not acknowledge the rich social, organizational, policy, and structural environment within which such outcomes occur. Indeed, traditional theories of health behavior change focus almost exclusively on intrapersonal processes such as self-efficacy and attitudes without sufficient attention to environmental variables that explain appreciable variance in human behavior. This state of affairs highlights the need for multilevel interventions as described herein.\r\n\r\nMultilevel interventions are expensive in every currency, including time, financial burden, and human capital, however, so it is particularly important to build a scientific foundation justifying their development and implementation. Fortunately, the articles in this monograph offer an optimistic chorus. In addition to providing convincing evidence for the merit of adopting multilevel interventions, these articles offer a wide variety of practical tools to facilitate the kind of rigorous science that is required. Relatively new statistical techniques such as hierarchical linear models, Cox proportional hazard models, and latent curve modeling along with computer simulations building on deterministic, stochastic, and Bayesian models (2) hold tremendous promise as analytic tools that can be applied in multilevel interventions. The opportunity to test for mediated moderation and moderated mediation (3) allows investigators to understand not only what interventions work but when and why they work—key elements to maximizing reach and sustainability.\r\n\r\nComplementing these tools is an array of unique methodological designs that boast the dual benefit of practicality and rigor. As Cleary et al. (4) remind us, the seminal volume on quasi-experimentation in field settings by Cook and Campbell (5) introduces many designs relevant to multilevel approaches such as interrupted time series designs and nonequivalent group designs. Collins et al. (6) have developed a primer on the use of fractional (rather than full factorial) experimental designs. These and other tools can address the need expressed throughout this supplement to move away from cross-sectional approaches and to embrace experimental and longitudinal designs. At the same time, these tools will need to be adapted to handle additional complexities such as nonlinear effects over time (7), randomization challenges (4), and the possibility that interventions at one level can unwittingly and perhaps serendipitously influence outcomes at other levels (or serve as necessary conditions for efforts at other levels to be effective, as Weiner et al. observe) (3). On a related note, the Behavioral Research Program at the National Cancer Institute—one of the sponsors of this monograph—has now acknowledged these and related needs by developing a new branch devoted to the actual science of doing behavioral research, with concomitant attention to research methods, scientific infrastructure, and emerging technologies.\r\n\r\nAs newer tools develop, and as more nuanced multilevel interventions emerge, one will need to be mindful of the panoply of human processes that inimitably influence behavior. As one example, Cialdini (8) observed that people were paradoxically more likely to remove artifacts from national parks when reading signs admonishing them not to do so. Why? The simple presence of those signs indicated to park visitors that other park visitors must be partaking of artifacts themselves, framing the behavior as normative and appropriate. One can just as easily imagine efforts at one level of health care undermining efforts at another because of how those efforts are construed by the recipients. Such complexities reinforce the exhortation by Alexander et al. (7) that successful multilevel approaches must be informed by careful and extensive qualitative research.\r\n\r\nThe development and testing of multilevel interventions will benefit from greater attention to two methodological issues. The first is a clearer articulation of what exactly constitutes a level in a multilevel approach; the boundaries distinguishing these levels may be more porous than desired. In Eastern cultures, “individual” processes are intricately woven into social identities making the line between individual and family more heuristic than real. Influences at the state level are intertwined with those at the federal and even global level, particularly given the Web-driven breakdown in geographical and institutional barriers to information. Cleary et al. (4) also remind us that groups and organizations at any given level of influence can themselves differ greatly. Moreover, the putative outcomes of multilevel interventions must be clearly defined and greatly expanded beyond outcomes at the individual level (9). The endurance and sustainability of multilevel interventions may hinge dramatically on the success of communication and dissemination, which in turn will be hindered by a lack of consensus on underlying definitional issues.\r\n\r\nSecond, multilevel interventions are likely to be more effective when they integrate theory from multiple disciplines and perspectives. Theories can help us predict, for example, when multilevel interventions are best construed as tests of accumulation, amplification, facilitation, cascading, or convergence [strategies identified by Weiner et al. (3)]. Users will need to face the limitation, of course, that most theories target outcomes at only one or two levels of analysis. One can view this state of affairs as an outstanding opportunity to improve theory and identify synergies across disparate theories. New tools are also available to measure the manner in which theory is used in field research settings (10), and these tools will themselves evolve when used in multilevel settings. Successful use of theory in multilevel interventions will help land this research area into “Pasteur’s Quadrant” (11)—one that can celebrate the ideal interplay between theory development and application and, by extension, the marriage of so-called basic and applied research. Theoretically driven approaches are better positioned to put our intuitions about human behavior to the test and weave lessons learned into interventions that advance public health in a desired direction.",

      "title": "Goal Directed Behavior as a Source of Stress: Psychological Origins and Consequences of Inefficiency",
      "abstract": "Individuals prepare and execute actions in order to terminate specific problem states. Many psychological theories have adopted this perspective. Some theories of stress describe stressors as problems and coping procedures as adaptive problem-solving activities. A problem state is characterized by a set of repeated demands for mental and motor operations, whereas effective problem solving removes the demand for active concern. Studies of actual behavior in achievement situations have dealt with reactions to failure, but not with reactions to problem generation. Some information on reactions to harmful actions and other problems can be drawn from research on moral judgment. Actions often fail to produce intended results or produce unintended ones because the action space is not well represented in the actor's model. Inadequate model construction may refer not only to the actor's environment, but also to his own person. Any failure can be regarded as an unintended outcome, and when accomplishments fall below expectations, it may be because of unrealistic intentions.",

      "abstract": "If recovered memory experiences appear counter-intuitive, this is in part due to misconceptions about trauma and memory, and to a failure to adopt a comprehensive model of memory that distinguishes personal semantic memory, autobiographical event memory, and memory appraisal. Memory performance is generally superior when events, including traumas, are central to identity. Prolonged trauma in childhood, however, can produce severe identity disturbances that may interfere with the encoding and later retrieval of personal semantic and autobiographical event information. High levels of emotion either at encoding or recall can also interfere with the creation of coherent narrative memories. For example, high levels of shock and fear when memories are recovered unexpectedly may lead to the experience of vivid flashbacks. Memory appraisals may also influence the sense that an event has been forgotten for a long time. Recovered memories, although unusual, do not contradict what we know about how memory works.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of Conflict Management Games and Activities in Workplace",
      "abstract": "Conflict is a normal and usual part of the workplace. It happens in every business. For any team that wants to accomplish its goals, conflict is inevitable. While differences will occur, the effect doesn’t have to be negative. Conflict can produce openings. Conflict challenges us to think harder, to be more creative, to achieve greater understanding, and to search for alternative approaches that are more effective, more sustainable, and more successful. Unresolved conflict, however, can result in the dissolution of a group. When unaddressed tension occurs in the workplace, it can decrease productivity, hamper production, and increase absenteeism. It leads to increased stress among staff, decreased morale, and at worst, aggression or violence. Studies recommend that managers spend at least 25 percent of their time handling internal conflicts. This affects the productivity of the work force and can have a dramatic impact on organizational performance. Real-life situations, especially in the realms of competition and partnership, games will reveal the conventional way conflict is dealt with in the squad. Teams can begin to appreciate their usual solutions, and then go on to find more effective methods for dealing with similar scenarios. Experiential exercises allow team members to learn their reactions to conflict and their subsequent actions. In this journal, the observational analysis with regard to future workplace conflicts, we try to explore the means and the skills to bring about positive results by playing in conflict-resolution games, improve teamwork and challenge inefficient processes to create a team that is more unified and more successful.",

For example, the fears induced by the possibility of failure or of negative evaluations have physiological consequences (shaking, loss of concentration) that may impair performance in sports, on stage or at school. There is also ample evidence that individuals have distorted recollection of past events, and distorted attributions of the causes of successes of failures. Recollection of good events or successes is typically easier than recollection of bad ones or failures. Successes tend to be attributed to intrinsic aptitudes or own effort, while failures are attributed to bad luck. In addition, these attributions are often reversed when judging the performance of others. The objective of this paper is to incorporate the first phenomenon above into an otherwise standard decision theoretic model, and show that in a world where performance depends on emotions, biases in information processing enhance welfare.",

Unsurprisingly, it is present in humans from early in the first year of life. But what processes underpin infants’ sensitivity to others’ actions? Any attempt to answer this question must solve twin puzzles about the development of goal tracking. Why does some, but not all, of infants’ goal tracking appear to be limited by their abilities to represent the observed action motorically at the time it occurs? And why does their sensitivity to action sometimes manifest itself differently in dishabituation, pupil dilation and anticipatory looking? Solving these twin puzzles is critical for understanding humans’ earliest sensitivity to others’ actions. After introducing the puzzles, this paper argues that solving them may require identifying multiple, distinct processes for tracking the targets and goals of actions.",

      "abstract": "This chapter considers how the human performance is impacted by body rhythms, work schedules, and the use of common drugs. The human body functions in natural rhythms over a 24-hour period. Generally, we are prepared for physical and mental work during daily waking hours and for sleep at night. Schedule variations affect our ability to perform work and remain healthy: the impacts of shift work are well studied, with less known about the impact of compressed work-weeks and flex-time in work schedules. In general, we should keep consistent and predictable work schedules for optimal work, aligned with our physiological, psychological, and behavioral rhythms. Further, the use of alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs, many even in small doses, impairs nervous system functions, dulls the senses, weakens motor control, and slows cognitive processes. Consequently, the performance of work tasks is hampered in proportion to the amount of psychoactive substances.",

Individu yang mengalami kesulitan untuk memanajemen waktu yang dimilikinya terkadang merasa sangat terganggu. Hal itu dikarenakan individu tersebut ingin melakukan banyak hal tetapi merasa waktu yang dimilikinya sangat kurang dan tidak cukup untuk melakukan berbagai aktivitas yang ingin dilakukannya. Pendekatan dan konseling behavior yang berfokus pada tingkah laku yang tampak dirasa sesuai untuk menyelesaikan permasalahan ini. Pendekatan behavior memandang penyebab dari perilaku saat ini adalah hasil dari segenap pengalaman yang berupa interaksi individu dengan lingkungan sekitarnya. Sementara itu dalam konseling behavior yang bertujuan untuk mengubah perilaku, individu dapat mempelajari perilaku baru dan menghapus perilaku yang tidak sesuai karena pada dasarnya perilaku merupakan sesuatu yang dapat dipelajari. Hasil dari konseling ini adalah ditemukannya ketidakkonsistenan klien dalam mematuhi jadwal perencanaan kegiatan yang telah dibuat sebelumnya dan kurang mampunya klien dalam menentukan prioritas kegiatan sebagai perilaku yang tidak sesuai dan harus dihapus. Klien menyadari hal tersebut dan berusaha untuk menghapus perilaku yang tidak sesuai dan menggantinya dengan perilaku yang baru.",

      "abstract": "Researchers and practitioners have long regarded procrastination as a self-handicapping and dysfunctional behavior. In the present study, the authors proposed that not all procrastination behaviors either are harmful or lead to negative consequences. Specifically, the authors differentiated two types of procrastinators: passive procrastinators versus active procrastinators. Passive procrastinators are procrastinators in the traditional sense. They are paralyzed by their indecision to act and fail to complete tasks on time. In contrast, active procrastinators are a \"positive\" type of procrastinator. They prefer to work under pressure, and they make deliberate decisions to procrastinate. The present results showed that although active procrastinators procrastinate to the same degree as passive procrastinators, they are more similar to nonprocrastinators than to passive procrastinators in terms of purposive use of time, control of time, self-efficacy belief, coping styles, and outcomes including academic performance. The present findings offer a more sophisticated understanding of procrastination behavior and indicate a need to reevaluate its implications for outcomes of individuals.",

Beliefs represent what the agent believes to be the current state of the world. Desires specify the proactive behaviour of the agent, in that the agent works to make these true. Often desires can be mutually exclusive or contradictory, requiring the agent to select from among them, and so BDI implementations often use goals, which can be thought of as desires with some restrictions on them (such as requiring goals to be consistent, feasible and not yet achieved). There can be several types of goals, including achievement goals, whcih are dropped once they have been achieved, and maintenance goals, which are continually monitored, even when currenlty true. Intentions are plans of action that the agent has committed to to achieve its current goals. Often there are many ways to achieve a set of goals that the agent is working on, implying the need for a mechanism to choose between them.",

Evidence has been accumulating that functional gains are possible even many years after the damage. However, postacute rehabilitation must be motivating and related to real-life functional activities, or it may fail to enlist active participation. With CAMR programs, such as briefly reported here, instead of exercise, the patient is engaged in a game (e.g., ping-pong); instead of concentrating on the specific movements, he/she is concentrating on the game and the movements become subconscious. Patients, even those who initially consider that they cannot accomplish the task, show interest and improvement, and functional recovery appears to be extended beyond the specific movements that are being practiced. CAMR is also suitable for late functional reorganization programs in an educational model.",

      "title": "Cognitive Failure and Self Efficacy in Episodic Prospective Memory",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONMemory is a very complex, dynamic and multidimensional construct. We have memories of the past and also memories of the future. One of the charachteristics of human beings is that most of the behaviour is future oriented. Many of our action can be understood as goal directed and goals are realized in the future. The realization of future goals is as important as recalling past information. Prospective memory is memory for action to be performed in the furure like remebering to return the libarary books on due date, taking medicine on time (Einstein & McDaniel, 1990). Unlike prospective memory, retrospective memory involves the remembering of the past information such as remembering the content of a book. Einstein and MacDaniel (1990) distinguished two types of prospective memory task- event and times based task. Event-based tasks are those in which intended action is to be performed when certain external event occurs (giving someone message when you see somebody). This is the case of environmentally cued task. Time-based task requires that the subject remember to perform some action at certain time or after certain period of time has elapsed ( i.e attending a meeting at particular time). This type of task can be described as self-cued. The past few years have witnessed an increasing interest in prospective memory. Recent studies have shown that propsective memory is affected by attention, planning, monitoring and retrospective memory (Dobbs & Reeves, 1996). Prospective memory clearly relies on multidimensional set of cognitive processes.Meacham and Leiman (1975) made a distinction between episodic and habitual intentions. Episodic intentions are performed irregularly and infrequently, for example, going to receive somebody at airport. On the other hand, habitual intentions are those that are performed on a regular basis, such as brushing one's teeth every morning. Meacham and Singer (1977) found no reliable difference between episodic and habitual intentions, but a study conducted by Andrzejewski, Moore, Corvette, and Hermann (1991) to explore the relationship between these two kinds of intentions revealed a significant distinction between the two. Episodic prospective memory is the ability to deal with plans and intentions made by others, which are not in the conscious awareness during retention interval and need to be executed only once.Cognitive failure reflects cognitive lapse in perception, attention, memory and action. Cognitive Failure Questionnaire (Broadbent, Cooper, FitzGerald, and Parkes, 1982) is standardized questionnaire to measures the frequency of everyday cognitive mistakes which everyone makes from time to time, but some of which happen more often than others. The items actually measure a single unitary dimension of cognitive failure. Attempts have been made to understand the stable factor structure. One study identified 5 factors namely, distractibility, misdirected actions, spatial kinesthetic memory, interpersonal intelligence and memory for names. Another study reported a three factor solution. Factor I - items pertaining to forgetting, confusion and distractibility, bumping into people and dropping things. Factor II - items related to social poise, distractibility, and forgetfulness. Factor III concerned the processing and remembrance of people's names. Many have linked slips to automatic processing. Others have suggested that these slips in everyday life are related to performance on distributed attention task. Broadbent showed a high correlation between cognitive failure scores and neuroticism factors on the Eysenck personality inventory. The significance of correlation was seen in the cognitive failure questionnaire items related to lack of concentration.Another construct which may affect prospective memory performance is general self- efficacy. When individual has to memorize future intention, one of most important factor which affects memory is the knowledge or beliefs that each person has about his or her memory proficiency such as self- efficacy (Bandura, 1977). …",

      "title": "Issues in the study of obedience: A reply to Baumrind.",
      "abstract": "OBEDIENCE serves numerous productive functions in society. It may be ennobling and educative and entail acts of charity and kindness. Yet the problem of destructive obedience, because it is the most disturbing expression of in our time, and because it is the most perplexing, merits intensive study. In its most general terms, the problem of destructive may be defined thus: If X tells Y to hurt Z, under what conditions will Y carry out the command of X, and under what conditions will he refuse? In the concrete setting of a laboratory, the question may assume this form: If an experimenter tells a subject to act against another person, under what conditions will the subject go along with the instruction, and under what conditions will he refuse to obey? A simple procedure was devised for studying (Milgram, 1963). A person comes to the laboratory, and in the context of a learning experiment, he is told to give increasingly severe electric shocks to another person. (The other person is an actor, who does not really receive any shocks.) The experimenter tells the subject to continue stepping up the shock level, even to the point of reaching the level marked Danger: Severe Shock. The purpose of the experiment is to see how far the naive subject will proceed before he refuses to comply with the experimenter's instructions. Behavior prior to this rupture is considered obedience in that the subject does what the experimenter tells him to do. The point of rupture is the act of disobedience. Once the basic procedure is established, it becomes possible to vary conditions of the experiment, to learn under what circumstances to authority is most probable, and under what conditions defiance is brought to the fore (Milgram, in press). The results of the experiment (Milgram, 1963) showed, first, that it is more difficult for many people to defy the experimenter's authority than was generally supposed. A substantial number of subjects go through to the end of the shock board. The second finding is that the situation often places a person in considerable conflict. In the course of the experiment, subjects fidget, sweat, and sometimes break out into nervous fits of laughter. On the one hand, subjects want to aid the experimenter; and on the other hand, they do not want to shock the learner. The conflict is expressed in nervous reactions. In a recent issue of American Psychologist, Diana Baumrind (1964) raised a number of questions concerning the report. Baumrind expressed concern for the welfare of subjects who served in the experiment, and wondered whether adequate measures were taken to protect the participants. She also questioned the adequacy of the experimental design. Patently, Behavioral Study of Obedience did not contain all the information needed for an assessment of the experiment. But it is clearly indicated in the references and footnotes (pp. 373, 378) that this was only one of a series of reports on the experimental program, and Baumrind's article was deficient in information that could have been obtained easily. I thank the editor for allotting space in this journal to review this information, to amplify it, and to discuss some of the issues touched on by Baumrind. At the outset, Baumrind confuses the unanticipated outcome of an experiment with its basic procedure. She writes, for example, as if the production of stress in our subjects was an intended and deliberate effect of the experimental manipulation. There are many laboratory procedures specifically designed to create stress (Lazarus, 1964), but the paradigm was not one of them. The extreme tension induced in some subjects was unexpected. Before conducting the experiment, the procedures were discussed with many colleagues, and none anticipated the reactions that subsequently took place. Foreknowledge of results can never be the invariable accompaniment of an experimental probe. Understanding grows because we examine situa-",

      "title": "Teaching Critical Thinking and Problem Solving Skills",
      "abstract": "Abstract Critical is a learned skill that requires instruction and practice. Business education instructors at both secondary and post-secondary levels can enhance students' critical skills by (1) using instructional strategies that actively engage students in process rather than relying on lecture and rote memorization, (2) focusing instruction on process of rather than solely on content, and (3) using assessment techniques that provide students with an intellectual challenge rather than memory recall. Several barriers can impede critical instruction. Lack of training, limited resources, biased preconceptions, and time constraints conspire negate environments that promote critical thinking. However, actively engaging students in project-based or collaborative activities can encourage students' critical development if instructors model process, use effective questioning techniques, and guide students' critical processes. The examples provided challenge instructors of students as users of information rather than receivers of information. It is possible store mind with a million facts and still be entirely uneducated. -Alec Bourne Introduction What is critical thinking, and why is so important? The Critical Thinking Community defined critical as the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide belief and action (Scriven & Paul, 2007, p. 1). Critical has also been referred as metacognition (Tempelaar, 2006) or process of about thinking as defined and originally purposed by Flavell (1979). Critical skills are important because they enable students to deal effectively with social, scientific, and practical (Shakirova, 2007, p. 42). Simply put, students who are able critically are able solve problems effectively. Merely having knowledge or information is not enough. To be effective in workplace (and in their personal lives), students must be able solve problems make effective decisions; they must be able critically. Critical is not a new concept. Throughout nearly 300 years of policymaking in United States, educators have promoted eight broad goals of schooling: basic academic skills, critical and problem solving, social skills and work ethic, citizenship, physical health, emotional health, arts and literature, and preparation for skilled (Rothstein, Wilder, & Jacobsen, 2007, p. 8). Business education directly addresses work ethic and preparation for skilled employment as well as critical and problem solving. Yet many teachers continually struggle engage students in critical activities (Tempelaar, 2006), and students seldom use critical skills solve complex, real-world problems (Bartlett, 2002; Rippin, Booth, Bowie, & Jordan, 2002). Why? The answer may be in our instructional methods. Two quotes that are often cited together reflect this supposition (as cited by Schaf ersman, 1991). First, Clement (1979) stated that should be teaching students how think. Instead, we are teaching them what think (p. 1). Second, Norman (1981) noted that it is strange that we expect students learn, yet seldom teach them anything about learning (p. 1). Although content is important, process of how students learn material is equally important. Therefore, purpose of this article is analyze and synthesize secondary research provide best practices for incorporating critical instructional methods into business education classrooms at both secondary and post-secondary levels. …",

      "abstract": "In a wide variety of cognitive tasks, people's expectations of what their own performance is, was, and will be are an overestimate of reality. After documenting a number of situations in which people exhibit such overconfidence, several reasons for it are discussed. It is suggested that in these situations, the optimistic bias is not attributable exclusively to self-deception or wishful thinking. Rather, the information yielded up by the cognitive system, in combination with the heuristics used for making judgments of future and past performance tailored to the specific questions asked of participants, produces a bias toward believing that one knows, knew, and will perform better than actual performance substantiates. Consequently, in the cognitive domain, the inflated beliefs that result in overconfidence also result in cessation of efforts before the correct solution of problems is ascertained, before accurate retrieval of memorial information is attained, or before adequate learning of new material has been accomplished. This effect seems in contrast to findings on people's moods and self-esteem in real-world or threatening situations that suggest that an optimistic bias in these domains be person protective and adaptive.",

      "title": "Privacy and Behavioral Research",
      "abstract": "From our examination of the relation of behavioral science research to the right to privacy, we have been led to the following conclusions. 1) While most current practices in the field pose no significant threat to the privacy of research subjects, a sufficient number of exceptions have been noted to warrant a sharp increase in attention to procedures that will assure protection of this right. The increasing scale of behavioral research is itself an additional reason for focusing attention in this area. 2) Participation by subjects must be voluntary and based on informed consent to the extent that this is consistent with the objectives of the research. It is fully consistent with the protection of privacy that, in the absence of full information, consent be based on trust in the qualified investigator and the integrity of his institution. 3) The scientist has an obligation to insure that no permanent physical or psychological harm will ensue from the research procedures, and that temporary discomfort or loss of privacy will be remedied in an appropriate way during the course of the research or at its completion. To merit trust, the scientist must design his research with a view to protecting, to the fullest extent possible, the privacy of the subjects. If intrusion on privacy proves essential to the research, he should not proceed with his proposed experiment until he and his colleagues have considered all of the relevant facts and he has determined, with support from them, that the benefits outweigh the costs. 4) The scientist has the same responsibility to protect the privacy of the individual in published reports and in research records that he has in the conduct of the research itself. 5) The primary responsibility for the use of ethical procedures must rest with the individual investigator, but government agencies that support behavioral research should satisfy themselves that the institution which employs the investigator has effectively accepted its responsibility to require that he meet proper ethical standards. 6) Legislation to assure appropriate recognition of the rights of human subjects is neither necessary nor desirable if the scientists and sponsoring institutions fully discharge their responsibilities in accommodating to the claim of privacy. Because of its relative inflexibility, legislation cannot meet the challenge of the subtle and sensitive conflict of values under consideration, nor can it aid in the wise decision making by individuals which is required to assure optimum protection of subjects, together with the fullest effectiveness of research.",

      "title": "Mindfulness and Nondual Well-Being – What is the Evidence that We Can Stay Happy?",
      "abstract": "Research into subjective well-being (SWB) focuses on conducive life conditions, healthy cognitive-affective processes and adaptive behaviours, however, in this model, well-being fluctuates based on changing mental and physical phenomena. This inquiry explores the possibility that we can have a nondual experience of well-being that is unaffected by such movements and investigates if the literature supports this. The assertion in traditional mindfulness that the sense of self is constructed and responsible for such fluctuations is explored, along with what evidence there is that mindfulness practices deliver relevant cognitive and behavioural correlates associated with such a way of being. Proposed preconditions include (a) nondual awareness or the perception of no-self; (b) increased positive affect, decreased negative affect, and increased self-lessness; (c) increased capacity to maintain (or protect) well-being including heightened emotional self-regulation and resilience to aversive stimuli. Research findings provide some evidence that the sense of self can be both constructed and deconstructed, and that mindfulness training may target psychological dimensions that could contribute to an experience of well-being that transcends the impact of life conditions. Recommendations are made for a collaborative relationship between SWB research and mindfulness to expand the inquiry into possible causes and conditions of ‘nondual well-being’.",

      "title": "Traitement cognitif d'une tâche prioritaire. Déterminants et influences de l'inhibition d'un processus concurrent non prioritaire",
      "abstract": "Alors que le traitement de nombreuses tâches ordinaires (e.g., parler a son passager, repondre a un e-mail) est en cours, l'apparition d'un stimulus important (e.g., le klaxon d'un voiture) peut necessiter un traitement prioritaire. Paradoxalement, l'investigation de ce constat dans le champs de la psychologie experimentale ne rend compte que tres rarement compte de la possibilite d'interrompre une action en cours en vue de donner la priorite a une autre reponse motrice. Il apparait donc heuristique d'approfondir les limites et les effets de cette possibilite relativement repandue d'un point de vue ecologique. Pour ce faire, nous avons articule les problematiques inherentes a l'interference en double tâche et a l'inhibition motrice afin de mettre au point une serie de quatre volets experimentaux lors desquels la possibilite d'interrompre une reponse non prioritaire en vue de donner la priorite a une autre reponse motrice fut systematiquement donnee aux participants. L'ensemble des resultats convergent vers une diminution de la probabilite d'interruption de la reponse motrice non prioritaire lorsque le stimulus prioritaire apparait tardivement et peu frequemment. De plus, le caractere prioritaire d'une tâche motrice ne semble pas constituer un parametre suffisant permettant d'isoler les processus correspondants de ralentissement. Corollairement, l'interruption de la reponse motrice non prioritaire ne semble pas non plus totalement premunir le traitement de la tâche prioritaire de ralentissement notamment lorsqu'il n'est pas possible de predire avec certitude l'apparition du stimulus correspondant.",

      "title": "Les chemins de la connaissance",
      "abstract": "Les psychologues ont généralement privilégié un modèle unitaire, unidimensionnel, du développement cognitif, c'est-à-dire un modèle décrivant un cheminement unique, identique pour tous les sujets. Cette conception, souvent implicite, est sous-jacente aussi bien aux échelles psychométriques de développement de l'intelligence (QI), qu'à la théorie de Piaget ou aux modèles de développement plus récents inspirés du paradigme du traitement de l'information. Cette conception unitaire se heurte à plusieurs obstacles théoriques et empiriques qui seront évoqués en prenant l'exemple de la théorie de Piaget. L'alternative proposée est un modèle pluraliste, multidimen- sionnel, du développement cognitif. Ce modèle admet que dans beaucoup de situations, le sujet dispose de plusieurs modes de traitement pour résoudre un même problème. Ces différents modes de traitement ne sont pas aussi facilement évocabies chez tous les sujets (certaines préférences individuelles peuvent se faire jour au cours du développement) et ne sont pas sollicités au même degré par toutes les situations. Il en résulte des différences intra et inter-individuelles dans les conduites cognitives, qui donnent lieu à des cheminements différents dans la construction de la connaissance. Cette conception pluraliste du développement cognitif sera illustrée à propos du développement du langage.",

      "title": "Design Intentions: Engineering Students Looking Ahead to their Future Design Behavior",
      "abstract": "Abstract As we critically consider what we mean to accomplish in design teaching and learning, we can start to distinguish between awareness of design practices and processes (i.e., design awareness), intention to engage in design practices and processes in specific ways (i.e., design intention), and subsequent design behavior. The goal of this paper is to understand engineering student's design intent. We build on a long-term research program in which we have used research results from studies of design expertise to teach about the design process. Specifically, we leverage timeline representations of individuals engaging in a design task to convey design behaviors of designers with various levels of expertise. These representations have been shown to be very effective in promoting student awareness of important aspects of the design process (e.g., the need to spend time problem scoping before engaging in modeling; the need to engage in a broad set of design activities; the need to iterate among design activities). However, awareness about specific elements of design, while important, is not sufficient when it comes to engaging in specific design behaviors. Intent can be seen as an intermediate step between an individual being aware of an action to take, and actually taking that action. We ask: Do students articulate and understand their intentions for changing how they engage with design and if so, how? In this paper we present findings of what students declare as their intention to engage in a design behavior after they have participated in a classroom exercise. Specifically, 78 students from two different classes in a college of engineering in a large public research-intensive university (50 in a Civil Engineering class, 28 in a Human Centered Design & Engineering class) participated in a classroom activity that took approximately 50 minutes long. After learning about design processes of engineers with various levels of expertise and responding to questions about what they found to be important information, students were asked ‘Will Information from this exercise affect how you will do design in the future? How?’ Student responses were coded using first open coding and then axial coding to further articulate the themes within the responses once they were identified. Preliminary findings show that students are thinking metacognitively about design by articulating plans, managing time efficiently, monitoring their steps and evaluating their design process. While all students are able to articulate their design intentions, some demonstrate a refined understanding of their design intentions and actionable strategies that could directly impact how they design in the future. In the final paper we will describe these metacognitive plans in more detail, and will investigate if students from the different majors describe different intentions. This practical classroom activity can be used at the beginning of time intensive design experiences (such as term-long design projects or capstone design courses) to help students develop an awareness of important aspects of the design processes and set intentions for how they will engage in their design projects.",
