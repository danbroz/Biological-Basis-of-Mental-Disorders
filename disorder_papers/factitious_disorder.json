It is frequently difficult to adequately diagnose this disorder, above all, when the faked symptoms are those of a psychological or a psychiatric disorder. In these cases, there is often high comorbidity with other mental disorders, thus making it difficult to differentiate between real and factitious symptoms. Moreover, the lack of clear objective markers makes assessing the diagnosis even more difficult. In this article, we have aimed to clarify how a correct diagnosis of factitious disorder with psychological symptoms can be reached, to observe the different therapeutic strategies described in the literature and to analyze the utility of each one of them in a given case report.",

Illness behavior can be unconscious or conscious: In the former, the person is unaware of the mental processes and content that are significant in determining behavior; conscious illness behavior may be voluntary and conscious (the two are not necessarily associated). The first broad category of inappropriate illness behavior is defensiveness, which is characterized by denial or minimization of symptoms. The second category includes somatoform disorders, factitious disorders, and malingering and is characterized by exaggerating, fabricating, or denying symptoms; minimizing capabilities or positive traits; or misattributing actual deficits to a false cause. Evaluators can detect the presence of inappropriate illness behaviors based on evidence of consistency in the history or examination; the likelihood that the reported symptoms make medical sense and fit a reasonable disease pattern; understanding of the patient's current situation, personal and social history, and emotional predispositions; emotional reactions to symptoms; evaluation of nonphysiological findings; results obtained using standardized test instruments; and tests of dissimulation, such as symptom validity testing. Unsupported and insupportable conclusions regarding inappropriate illness behavior represent substandard practice in view of the importance of these conclusions for the assessment of impairment or disability.",

Psychological factors are decisive, and they usually include a major anxiety generated by intrapsychic conflicts, which are converted by unconscious defense mechanism into symptoms. The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness. The secondary gain is external and includes attention and care from caregivers or others.",

Negative attitudes towards people with mental illness are attributed to stigma. In the literature, stigma is regarded as something that is attached to a person ‐ like a badge or label. This is undermined by two facts. Firstly, it is the person who is regarded as disgraceful, not the illness or diagnosis, and secondly, the diagnosis of mental illness is itself evaluative. Mental illness is by definition bad, so to be diagnosed as mentally ill is to be defined as bad (or somehow wrong). The stigmatisation of the mentally ill will not stop until this negative evaluation is removed from diagnosis.",

      "title": "Elementary concepts of medicine: VII. Course of illness: manifestations, complications, outcome",
      "abstract": "Once the illness-defining somatic anomaly has come into being, the course of illness begins. The course is characterized, in its patient-relevant respects, by sickness manifestations (if any) and consequences of the illness (if any), of the illness-defining somatic anomaly. The course of the illness-defining anomaly per se, divorced from its manifestations and consequences, is not relevant to the affected person. A manifestation of an illness is something that, to one extent or another, reflects the presence of the illness-defining anomaly and, on this basis, is indicative of the anomaly's presence. It thus is an available fact simultaneous with the illness at issue – a positive finding of this kind, possibly a report (objective) of a symptom (subjective) or an inherently objective sign gleaned from physical examination or a laboratory test. Any such fact may be at variance with the corresponding truth, which may be difficult to define even. A manifestational fact, however accurate, is not inherently an effect of the somatic anomaly involved in the illness concept; different from effect, it may not be even of the form of a change but merely of a state of being. Even more notably, a patient-relevant manifestation, already present or potentially developing in the future, is integral to the very concept of illness, and it therefore is not really a consequence of illness, causally or otherwise. A consequence of an illness we take to be something wholly extrinsic to the illness. Consequences of illness in this meaning obviously fall into the principal categories of medical (i.e. somatic) and extramedical. Medical consequences we take to be of three generic types: complication, sequela and fatality. Under complication in our medical dictionaries, we find the following definitions: '(1) a disease or diseases concurrent with another disease; (2) the occurrence of two or more diseases in the same patient' (Dorland 1994); and 'morbid process or event occurring during a disease that is not an essential part of the disease, although it may result from it or from independent causes' (Stedman 1995). Although these definitions are surprising to us, they do accord with our idea (above) that a complication of an illness, different from its manifestations, is extrinsic to this illness, and more specifically also another illness, they do not identify complication as inherently a consequence of the illness. As for our proposition that a complication of an illness is a consequence of this illness, a couple of paradigmatic examples may serve to substantiate it. Peptic ulcer and peritonitis are two mutually distinct illnesses. When, and only when, the latter occurs as a consequence of the former, it is referred to as a complication of the former. Similarly, when, and only when, pulmonary embolism results from (occurs as a consequence of) deep-vein thrombosis, it is seen as a complication of the latter. In the meaning of consequence of an illness, thus, complication actually, and more specifically, is another illness caused by the illness at issue. It thus is another illness for which the original illness was aetiogenetic (aetiologic). As for the first example, it should be understood that perforated ulcer is but a stage in the course of ulcer and not another illness, and that it thus is not a complication of ulcer. Similarly, detachment of a segment of deep-vein thrombus is but an event in the course of that thrombosis and not a complication of it. Our medical dictionaries define the essence of sequela as: 'any lesion or affection following or caused by an attack of disease' (Dorland 1994); 'a condition following as a consequence of a disease' (Stedman 1995). Immunity resulting from an infectious disease satisfies the latter definition, but it is not thought of as a sequela of the disease. From the medical vantage, a sequela is not something desirable, nor even an innocent lesion; it is a somatic anomaly other than that which is definitional to the original illness, and it is one that already is, or in the future potentially will be, manifest in sickness. Thus, the medically relevant concept of sequela, like that of complication, has illness as its proximate genus. And further, while a distinction indeed is to be made between sequela and complication, a sequela of an illness is not caused by the illness at issue; it is a non-causal consequence of it. Thus, it is another illness for which the first illness was pathogenetic (rather than aetiogenetic; cf. complication above). This concept of sequela gains clarity when the nature of its non-causal connection to its parent illness is understood to represent a type of outcome of the original illness – just as any illness other than injury is the outcome of its pathogenesis. Stroke is an acute (i.e. non-chronic) disease, and a common outcome of it (of its completed course) is survival with a residual anomaly (chronic defect) in the tissues where the disease process took place. If this residual, post-stroke anomaly is manifest in sickness (say, paralysis), the anomaly represents patent sequela; if sickness is but a potential manifestation in the future, it represents latent sequela; and otherwise the outcome is survival with mere non-illness, non-sequela, innocent anomaly as a residue of it, the outcome now being complete recovery (to effective normalcy, with no material consequences as for outcome). It needs to be understood that just as perforated ulcer is not a causal consequence but merely a stage in the course of peptic ulcer, a sequela of stroke is not a causal consequence but, again, merely the anomaly stage that follows the completion of the course of the somatic process of stroke. Status post mortem is a sequela of life without being caused by life, nor is the transitional event death caused by life. For a sequela, the antecedent, original illness indeed represents pathogenesis (which is a merely descriptive concept) rather than aetiogenesis (which is a causal concept). Beyond sequela and complete recovery, the remaining principal type of outcome of illness, and equally a genuine potential consequence of illness, is of course fatality, death resulting from that illness. (When death results from some other, unrelated cause during the illness at issue, the course of this illness is thereby interrupted and its outcome does not materialize at all.) Different from sequela but akin to complication, the illness is causal to its fatal outcome, although only in the sense that it made death occur earlier than it otherwise would have occurred; but as it is not another illness, it therefore is not a complication. And because the fatal outcome is only the transitional event between living with the illness and being dead from it, and thus not a residual anomaly in vivo, at issue is a type of outcome different in form from that of sequela also. It deserves note that an illness commonly is not the direct, immediate cause of its fatal outcome. Instead, the immediate cause commonly is a complication of the illness to which the death is ascribed – or it is a complication of a complication, possibly many causal steps removed from the illness. Moreover, causation of death from a given illness can be mediated by its sequelae just the same. The illness that is designated as the cause thus commonly is merely a mediate, an underlying cause of the death. As we think of the course of illness in terms of its potential sickness manifestations and the potential medical consequences (complications, sequelae and fatality), we thereby exclude quality-of-life implications of sickness. A meteorologist is concerned with meteorological manifestations and consequences of whatever meteorological situation, but not with its agricultural (or farmers' happiness) implications, for example. A farmer's expert horizon on implications of weather is confined to those in the domain of farming, and the same applies to the implications of farming activities: issues of food production are within the farmer's expertise, effects of food consumption on people's health and happiness are not. Medically, the consequences of illness are medical (i.e. somatic). Health-related quality of life thus is a concern beyond the scope of medicine (Miettinen 2001).",

The diagnosis of a chronic and recurrent mental disorder influences a person’s self-image and has a strong impact on all members of the family. In the adjustment to the diagnosis, each individual usually undergoes a process in which a variety of beliefs and emotions may arise that will have to be dealt with, in parallel to education about and acceptance of the disorder. It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

Each of us is convinced of being a unique and stable individual, different from other individuals. These properties - stability ad coherence - belong to an image of ourselves that was proposed to us by the Other's look during the mirror phase. Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena. However, this is not observed in chronic sequelae of brain lesions (e.g. right hemisphere syndrome or amnesic syndrome), even though the patients may present a broken up image of themselves.",

In spite of the implicitly wrong conception of reality, the significance of these delusions as an attempt to express, interpret and cope with mental illness should not be neglected if an approach to the patient's own experience is sought. On the one hand, hypochondriacal delusions are based on altered body perceptions in mental illness, characterized by primary local or general dysaesthesias to the point of depersonalisation, or caused secondarily by the patient's increased attention to his own body. This alienated bodily experience is named in (lay) medical terms by the delusional hypochondriac. On the other hand, \"illness\" with its manifold cultural and psychological meanings stands as a polyvalent metaphor for the incomprehensible alteration of the patient's self-experience in general: thus, the feeling of exposure to external attacks, of guilt, sinfulness, shame, loss of self-esteem or even the experience of a disruption of personality may find their expression in the hypochondriacal delusion.",

      "title": "Pseudobulbar affect masquerading as psychosis: Managing a case of diagnostic dilemma",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Pseudo-bulbar affect (PBA) is a clinical condition characterized by uncontrollable emotional outbursts, incongruent with the person's emotional state and often out of keeping with the situational context. It manifests mostly as uncontrollable laughter or crying in inappropriate situations.[1] PBA is also referred to as Emotional incontinence, Pathological Laughter and Crying (PLC), and Involuntary Emotional Expression Disorder (IEED).[2] PBA is most commonly seen occurring in the background of neurological disorders like in post-stroke period, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease or traumatic brain injury.[3-5] However, it can also be seen without any apparent neurological disorders.[5] Historically PBA has been an under-recognized and under-treated condition, which brings in significant distress, stigma and shame for the person suffering from the condition.[6] Along with the social stigma of inappropriate laughing or crying, it often carries with it the burden of being tagged with mental illness.[7] The newer and probably less stigmatizing term IEED can provide some respite to those with the condition as an acknowledgement of their suffering. This case report presents a patient with PBA without any neurological comorbidities who improved significantly with fluoxetine and dextromethorphan. A 59-year-old, widowed female, coming from an urban background, presented with episodes of uncontrollable laughter spells in inappropriate situations for the past 1.5 years. She also reported occasional mild slurring and difficulty deglutition for the same duration. These laughter spells would occur every 2-3 days, occurring for 5-15 minutes. These would be typically incongruent to the context. For example, occurring while in inappropriate social situations like in a funeral house. These incidents would make her extremely embarrassed and she had to leave the situation altogether as she could not control her laughing. Her family members too would scold her for doing so, apparently a willful act as per them, and would ask her if she has gone mad. She would feel sad over these incidents and tell her family members that she was not doing this willfully and it was not under her control. These episodes were accompanied by on-and-off difficulty in deglutition, mild slurring of speech and a subjective sense of hypersalivation. These symptoms would aggravate prolonged speaking or chewing. All these incidents would occur with intact awareness and responsiveness. Sleep onset insomnia was present. There was no history of associated low or elevated mood, anhedonia, disproportionate physical fatigue, somatic preoccupation or dissociative episodes. Past psychiatric history revealed nothing significant. She was not known to be diabetic, hypertensive, hypothyroid or obese. There was no history of head injury, seizures or stroke either. She had never taken any substance of abuse. She was taken to psychiatrists as her family members thought she might be having some psychiatric illness. She was suspected to have psychosis, unspecified and was given trials of quetiapine up to 100 mg and later olanzapine up to 25 mg. Both these treatments improved her sleep only but no improvement was observed in the uncontrollable laughter episodes. On presentation, she was neither sad nor overtly cheerful, though expressed her worry and guilt about the inappropriate laughter episodes and social disgrace. No other thought or perceptual abnormality was noted. She had good insight into her symptoms. On neurological examination, speech was normal, jaw jerk and palmomental reflex were absent. Blood sugar, thyroid panel, lipids and electrolytes came out to be normal. We admitted her for diagnostic evaluation. Neurology and otorhinolaryngology consultation-liaison were sought. MRI Brain was suggested by neurology which came out to be normal. Based on the clinical presentation, examination and investigation findings we considered a diagnosis of Pseudo-bulbar affect of unknown etiology. Due to the unavailability of a Dextromethorphan/quinidine combination, we started her on Dextromethorphan 20 mg and Fluoxetine 40 mg. She tolerated the treatment without any side-effects. Over the next couple of days, she did not report much improvement and was discharged on the same treatment. She adhered to treatment and on follow-up visit one month later, she reported significant improvement in laughter spells, which occurred only once during that period. She had started attending social gatherings again without any issues. From the second follow up Dextromethorphan was gradually tapered and stopped; Fluoxetine has been continued. She is maintaining well on current treatment. We are regularly following her up in liaison with the Neurology team as over due course of time some underlying neurological cause may become evident. PBA is a disorder which is poorly recognized, variably characterized, and causes significant distress and dysfunction for patients and their families. Patients are often ascribed mental illnesses like schizophrenia or mania in many of these cases of PBA leading to unnecessary treatment.[8] Further, the drug side effect burden adds to the misery of the patients. Our patient had consulted several psychiatrists, who treated her with antipsychotics without much improvement in her symptoms. We could not find any underlying neurological condition despite a neurological workup but she responded well with treatment with SSRI and Dextromethorphan. The neurobiology of PBA is still unclear; most likely to be of multifactorial causation. Disruption of the cortico-limbic-subcortico-thalamic-pontocerebellar network, which is involved in the regulation and expression of emotion, has been hypothesized.[9] In many cases, no neurological association is found even after a thorough workup. A patient-rated instrument, Center for Neurologic Study-Lability Scale (CNS-LS) is used commonly to rate the severity of PBA.[10] It is validated for use in patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS).[11] The Pathological Laughing and Crying Scale (PLACS) is another patient-rated instrument validated to rate the severity of PBA in post-stroke patients.[12] PBA is a clinical diagnosis. While these scales are not used to diagnose PBA, these are used to rate the severity and improvement with treatment. Treatment with SSRI and Dextromethorphan/quinidine has shown promising results in cases of PBA.[13,14] Our case emphasizes the need to have clinical suspicion in such cases presenting with unexplained mood outbursts before categorizing them as specific psychiatric illnesses. Detailed neurological evaluation needs to be undertaken in such cases. Timely recognition of PBA is essential for an effective treatment.

In our work we have come to view feelings as indicators of general intrapsychic adaptation. On this basis, \"giving-up\" indicates not only an unpleasant feeling but includes a loss of self-esteem, a disruption in object relationships, a decrease in motivation, and an expectation that such a state may be enduring.

While it may be generally true that physical injury produces pain and that pain occurs as a result of injury, this is by no means always the case. There are many syndromes for which a somatic explanation is not easily available, and the source of the disorder can be attributed either to an abnormality in the way in which normal sensory inputs are processed or to psychological factors. Similarly, people may meet with injury but fail to experience pain as a consequence. This will sometimes happen if the damage occurs suddenly in a compelling situation, such as in battle or on the sportsfield, where attention and emotions are directed elsewhere. It is difficult, therefore, to determine in a priori terms when pain should and should not be experienced, and we must rely primarily upon the individual's own self-report to indicate whether it is present or absent and the intensity of his feelings. Given a similar degree of pain, however, any two people will react to this in different ways.",

      "abstract": "Pain may be defined as an unpleasant sensation which is focussed upon the body, and is often but not always associated with tissue damage. While it may be generally true that physical injury produces pain and that pain occurs as a result of injury, this is by no means always the case. There are many syndromes for which a somatic explanation is not easily available, and the source of the disorder can be attributed either to an abnormality in the way in which normal sensory inputs are processed or to psychological factors. Similarly, people may meet with injury but fail to experience pain as a consequence. This will sometimes happen if the damage occurs suddenly in a compelling situation, such as in battle or on the sportsfield, where attention and emotions are directed elsewhere. It is difficult, therefore, to determine in a priori terms when pain should and should not be experienced, and we must rely primarily upon the individual's own self-report to indicate whether it is present or absent and the intensity of his feelings. Given a similar degree of pain, however, any two people will react to this in different ways.",

      "title": "MALINGERING OF ORGANIC ILLNESS OR MENTAL DISORDER",
      "abstract": "of “simulation” covers dissimulation or deception, as well as faking, but the type of simulation we are concerned with here is normally defined as malingering, which refers to the conscious and deliberate invention of a physical or mental disorder, or the attribution of an existing incapacity to an accident or illness which was not actually its cause, in order to derive some personal benefit. The DSM-IV defines malingering as “the intentional feigning or exaggeration of physical or psychological symptoms, motivated by external incentives such as avoidance of work or military service, receipt of financial compensation, evasion of criminal prosecution, or procurement of prescription drugs. Under certain circumstances, malingering may constitute adaptive behaviour: for example, feigning illness while in captivity as a prisoner of war” (American Psychiatric Association, 1995, p. 698). The concept is considered more closely by Resnick (1997), who distinguishes between pure malingering, simulation of a non-existent disorder; partial malingering, the conscious exaggeration of present symptoms or of a now-cured disorder; and false imputation, the erroneous attribution of real symptoms to a particular cause, due to non-deliberate self-deceit or a wrong interpretation of the situation. Gorman (1982) also distinguished between the act and the state of malingering, insofar as the act implies wilfulness, an assertive attitude of desire and purpose, while the state, from a legal point of view, would be inherent to the person, due to their social condition or possible limitations. On the other hand, the question arises as to whether malingering can, in itself, be the reflection of some mental disorder. This is fairly clearly the case in the so-called factitious disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 1994), in which the person intentionally feigns physical or psychological symptoms, with the aim of taking on the sick role, or in histrionic personality disorder, due to lack of control over one’s manipulative behaviour; however, the conscious exaggeration of physical or mental complaints in order to achieve a financial, professional or similar objective may also be a neurotic behaviour, since nobody “in their right mind” would normally go to such extremes, nor choose such tortuous and painful routes, in the pursuit of potential benefits. Nevertheless, the law does not make such distinctions, and considers certain behaviours to involve clear intention on the part of the person carrying them out (Gorman, 1982). The incidence of malingering after an accident is not well known, being estimated at between 1% and 50% of cases (Henderson, 1986; Miller & Catlidge, 1972), depending on whether the source of information is the claimant’s lawyer or the insurance company. An influential factor here concerns the financial and employment conditions, since it has been observed that such malingering increases when redundancies are immiMALINGERING OF ORGANIC ILLNESS OR MENTAL DISORDER",

The classical characteristics of psychosis are impaired reality testing, hallucinations, delusions, and illusions. While factitious disorder and malingering are usually acknowledged as contrived psychiatric conditions for acquisition of interior or exterior profits, respectively, another alternative, also, exists that though is not manufactured individually, is enforced peripherally. Such cases, which are usually referred by the judge’s ruling, for evaluation and treatment, are more important than comparable simulated or genuine mental conditions, because incorrect diagnosis, or careless, cagily, and guarded validation of preliminary diagnosis that has been issued in the authorized or emergency department, can seriously endanger the individual’s civil rights, while it should not be overlooked that incorrect diagnosis is a kind of malpractice that may harm an individual awfully. In the present article the clinical picture of the said situation, in addition to some case histories, and recommendable hints for differential diagnosis between different types of psychoses, has been discussed.",

The study of disease is called pathology. Disease can be described as a medical condition associated with particular symptoms and signs. It can be caused by external factors like pathogens, or caused by internal malfunctions mainly the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity such as allergies and autoimmunity. Diseases are broadly classified to any abnormal condition that causes pain, dysfunction, distress, or death to the person affected with similar problems. It includes injuries, disabilities, disorders, syndromes, infections, isolated symptoms, deviant behaviours, and atypical variations of structure and its function and for others these may be considered as distinguishable categories. Diseases can affect people not only physically and mentally, as living with a disease will alter the affected person's thinking ability. Death caused by disease are often natural.

      "abstract": "There is often difficulty differentiating between psychosomatic, somatopsychic, multisystem illness, and different degrees of medical uncertainty. Uncommon, complex, and multisystem diseases are commonly misdiagnosed. Two case histories are described, and relevant terms differentiating psychosomatic, somatopsychic, and multisystem illnesses are identified, reviewed, and discussed. Adequate differentiation requires an understanding of the mind/body connection, which includes knowledge of general medicine, psychiatry, and the systems linking the body and the brain. A psychiatric diagnosis cannot be given solely based upon the absence of physical, laboratory, or pathological findings. Medically unexplained symptoms, somatoform disorder, and compensation neurosis are outdated and/or inaccurate terms. The terms subjective, nonspecific, and vague can be used inaccurately. Conversion disorders, functional disorders, psychogenic illness, factitious disorder imposed upon another (Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy), somatic symptom disorder, psychogenic seizures, psychogenic pain, psychogenic fatigue, and delusional parasitosis can be over-diagnosed. Bodily distress disorder and bodily distress syndrome are scientifically unsupported and inaccurate. Many “all in your head” conditions may be related to the microbiome and the immune system. Better education concerning the interface between medicine and psychiatry and the associated diagnostic nomenclature as well as utilizing clinical judgment and thorough assessment, exercising humility, and maintaining our roots in traditional medicine will help to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient trust.",

Symptoms of grief include physical and psychological changes including body aches, anxiety, and emotional pain. Grief has been conceptualized both as a series of stages or phases and as a period of meaning‐making. Furthermore, a variety of factors related to characteristics of the griever, the nature of the loss, and available support may influence grief processes and health outcomes. When grief becomes particularly distressing or prolonged, individuals can experience complicated grief, which is tied to more negative grief outcomes. Individuals with stronger support networks may experience improved health effects during bereavement.",

Mada / Madonmada has shown similarity with various psychiatric conditions such as “acute stress disorder,” “posttraumatic stress disorder,” “brief psychotic disorder,” and “adjustment disorder.” The present study provides insights for clinical implementation of “ Mada / Madonmada ” in the diagnosis and management of “trauma- and stressor-related disorders” in terms of Ayurveda . It is astonishing that thousands of years before, “ Acharya Bhela ” has documented the conditions such as trauma- and stressor-related disorders in the form of Mada or Madonmada .",

Somatic Symptom Disorder is differentiated from Illness Anxiety Disorder by virtue of the presence of a substantial somatic symptom(s).

      "title": "Dissociative Disorders",
      "abstract": "Commonly encountered in people with a variety of psychiatric diagnoses (and in many people without a diagnosis), dissociative symptoms can affect consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation, and behavior. Dissociative experiences are common, affecting perhaps half the population at some point. Although they are common, symptoms can be vaguely experienced and poorly recalled, so they are often overlooked by clinicians. Many or most dissociative episodes are fleeting or do not cause significant distress or dysfunction, and therefore do not warrant a specific DSM-5 diagnosis. Nevertheless, identification of dissociative experiences can help make sense of sometimes-confusing symptoms. DSM-5 describes three specific dissociative disorders—dissociative identity disorder, dissociative amnesia, and depersonalization/derealization disorder—as well as two more general categories of dissociative disorder—other specified and unspecified. All are frequently associated with physical, emotional, and/or sexual trauma and abuse, and it is not at random that the DSM-5 chapter on dissociative disorders is located immediately after the chapter that focuses on trauma- and stressor-related disorders. Dissociative identity disorder (DID) refers to the presence of two or more distinct personality states. Formerly known as \"multiple personality disorder,\" DID involves a discontinuity in the sense of self and the sense of agency, perception, cognition, and/or sensory-motor functioning. DID also involves memory gaps that transcend ordinary forgetting. Some cultural groups may view DID as \"possession\" by spiritual beings external to the person, but the disturbance should not be diagnosed as pathological if it conforms to broadly accepted cultural or religious practices. Furthermore, DID is generally not applicable to children who have imaginary playmates or who are otherwise engaging in normal imaginative play. As is often the case with all dissociative disorders, people with DID tend to present with other psychiatric issues, including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, self-injury, posttraumatic stress disorder, and non-epileptic seizures. Patients may conceal or not be aware of memory gaps and other discontinuities, which further complicates the psychiatric evaluation. In contrast to DID, which involves organization of different personalities via dissociative processes, other dissociative diagnoses are perhaps more common and less controversial. Dissociative amnesia involves an inability to recall important autobiographical information that is generally related to a specific stressor or trauma. It can be associated with nonepileptic seizures or other functional neurological symptoms (e.g., DSM-5-TR functional neurological symptom disorder [conversion disorder]). DSM-5 removed dissociative fugue as a separate disorder and included it as a specifier for dissociative amnesia. Fugue states are notable for the inability to recall important autobiographical memories (e.g., personal identity) and can include wandering away from home while maintaining an ability to function adequately. A detached and unreal sense of oneself (depersonalization) or the outside world (derealization) is relatively common, with a reported lifetime population prevalence of 50%. To meet criteria for depersonalization/derealization disorder, however, the symptoms must be persistent (generally lasting at least 1 month) and/or recurrent. Reality testing should be spared. As with other DSM-5 diagnoses, impairment and/or distress is also required, so occasional \"spacing out\" is not necessarily a disorder. DSM-5 provides a diagnostic option—\"other specified dissociative disorder\"—for presentations that do not meet full criteria for DID, dissociative amnesia, or depersonalization/derealization disorder. For example, the diagnosis \"other specified dissociative disorder (identity disturbance due to prolonged and intense coercive persuasion)\" can be given when an individual has dissociative effects following an intense experience such as brainwashing, long-term political imprisonment, or indoctrination into a cult. Acute dissociative reactions to stressful events can have a variety of dissociative manifestations when viewed cross-sectionally but are notable for their brevity; they can clear within days. If they persist for more than 1 month, the individual likely warrants a different diagnosis (e.g., depersonalization/derealization disorder).",

      "title": "Poor insight and psychosis",
      "abstract": "A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don't know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the metarepresentation theory. This theory includes the awareness of ones' goals, which leads to disorders of willed action, the awareness of intention, which leads to movement disorders, and the awareness of intentions of others, which leads to paranoid delusions. The theory of metarepresentation implies mainly output mechanisms, like the frontal cortex, while the input mechanism implies posterior brain systems, including the parietal lobe. There are many similarities between the disturbances of awareness seen in schizophrenia and those seen as a result of known neurological impairment. Neuropsychological models of impaired insight typically attribute the disturbance to any of a variety of core deficits in the processing of information. In this respect, lack of insight is on conceptual par with alogia, apraxia or aphasia in reflecting disturbed cognitive processing. In this direction, research have implicated the role of self-monitoring in disorders of awareness and many of the core symptoms of schizophrenia, and has been suggested that these symptoms are the result of a disturbance of a medial frontal system involving anterior hippocampus, cingulated gyrus, supplementary motor area, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Poor insight seems to be something more than a symptom or an epi-phenomenon and its mechanism may constitute a core factor into the psychosis process. Also, poor insight would be involves a common mechanism for many other mental disorders or even it would be an independent and trans-diagnostic factor into the human personality, probably like the dimension of psychotism.",

There are two broadly different mechanisms. The most obvious has a psychological or cognitive mechanism. Thus, the illness may provide the life event or chronic difficulty that triggers a depressive episode in a vulnerable Individual. Secondly more specific associations appear to exist between depression and particular physical disorders. These may turn out to be of particular etiological interest. The best examples are probably stroke and cardiovascular disease. Finally major depression, but especially minor depression, dysthymia, and depressive symptoms merge with other manifestations of human distress with which patients present to their doctors, Such somatic presentations test the conventional distinction between physical and mental disorder, and are a perennial source of controversy.",

      "title": "PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS",
      "abstract": "The incidence of psychiatric disorders in multiple sclerosis is higher than is generally recognized. The majority of multiple sclerosis patients show emotional instability, denial, personality disintegration and, in the late stages, deterioration. The emotional instability is manifested by irritability, anxiety and depression, as well as euphoria, even to the extent of a manic or depressive psychosis. Denial is manifested by querulousness and projection of frustration and hostility onto other people, or by unrealistic optimism. Personality disintegration is manifested by subjectivity, lability, inappropriateness and poor coordination of emotional reactions with the rest of the personality and the reality of the situation. The organic interruption of subcortical pathways by demyelinization produces variable loss of emotional control and disorganization of the total personality. This threat to personality functioning produces the compensatory psychological defense mechanisms of denial and projection. Emotional instability may precede the onset of neurologic findings, and the final diagnosis may be obscure for months or years. Although emotional stress does not cause multiple sclerosis, it can precipitate exacerbations and have a deleterious effect on the course of the disease. Because there is no definitive treatment, psychotherapy is an important, if not the most important, part of the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Psychiatrists are, therefore, especially qualified to treat patients with multiple sclerosis.",

      "abstract": "Objectives: Although fatigue is experienced by everyone, its definition and classification remains under debate. Methods: A review of the previously published data on fatigue. Results: Fatigue is influenced by age, gender, physical condition, type of food, latency to last meal, mental status, psychological conditions, personality type, life experience, and the health status of an individual. Fatigue may not only be a symptom but also a measurable and quantifiable dimension, also known as fatigability. Additionally, it may be classified as a condition occurring at rest or under exercise or stress, as physiologic reaction or pathologic condition, as spontaneous phenomenon or triggerable state, as resistant or irresistant to preconditioning, training, or attitude, as prominent or collateral experience, and as accessible or inaccessible to any type of treatment or intervention. Fatigue may be the sole symptom of a disease or one among others. It may be also classified as acute or chronic. Quantification of fatigability is achievable by fatigue scores, force measurement, electromyography, or other means. Fatigue and fatigability need to be delineated from conditions such as sleepiness, apathy, exhaustion, exercise intolerance, lack of vigor, weakness, inertia, or tiredness. Among neurological disorders, the prevalence of fatigue is particularly increased in multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson disease, traumatic brain injury, stroke, and bleeding and also in neuromuscular disorders. Fatigue may be influenced by training, mental preconditioning, or drugs. Conclusions: Fatigue needs to be recognized as an important condition that is not only a symptom but may also be quantified and can be modified by various measures depending on the underlying cause.",

Freud elucidated the dynamic relationships in an impressive way; he described all that can be called neurotic in hysteria.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a trauma and stress related disorder that may develop after exposure to an event or ordeal in which death, severe physical harm or violence occurred or was threatened.Traumatic events that may trigger PTSD include violent personal assaults, natural or unnatural disasters, accidents, or military combat.(1) People with PTSD continue to have intense, disturbing thoughts and feelings related to their experience that last long after the traumatic event has ended.They may relive the event through flashbacks or nightmares; they may feel sadness, fear or anger; and they may feel detached or estranged from other people.People with PTSD may avoid situations or people that remind them of the traumatic event, and they may have strong negative reactions to something as ordinary as a loud noise or an accidental touch.Enduring personality change after catastrophic experience, also known as EPCACE, is characterized by personality changes after a significant event or events.This condition may be preceded by PTSD.Symptoms may include a distrustful attitude, social isolation, or feeling a sense of threat.(2) Diagnosis Enduring personality change after catastrophic experience is not present in DSM V, unlike ICD X, where it is listed under diagnosis F 62.0.AIM: Aim of this research was to examine prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity and to analyze sociodemographic characteristics in patients with PTSD and enduring personality change after catastrophic experience.",

      "abstract": "The nature of the physical symptoms may imply greater depth of psychopathology, a more pervasive precipitating trauma, and/or more deeply embedded symptoms by the time the patient is seen by the psychiatrist. The psychological factors, accompanying symptoms, and treatment approaches vary widely, depending upon the patient's emotional characteristics and the specific physical disorder specified on Axis III. W. P. Ross, J. R. Schultz, and P. Edelstein described cases in which incomplete early treatment of psychologically significant stressors and the symptoms precipitated led to both medical and psychological problems in the future. An initial behavior analysis to establish a correlation between psychological factors and somatic illness should be exhaustive. Modifying patterns of communication and relationships, altering behavioral patterns, broadening the patient's perception of external and internal situations, and use of biofeedback or other conditioning techniques may be helpful for specific goals.",

      "abstract": "Psychische Schaeden als Unfallfolgen fuehren oft zum Rechtsstreit. Die Ursachen liegen darin, dass psychiatrische Diagnosen auf Verhaltensbeobachtung und Beschwerdeschilderung gruenden, sie sind deswegen mitunter kaum zu objektivieren. Wegen den Schwierigkeiten in der Diagnosestellung ist fuer die Beurteilung von Schaedigungsfolgen weniger die Diagnose, als vielmehr der gesicherte Nachweis konkreter Funktionsstoerungen geeignet. Bei der Untersuchung ist der Gutachter weitgehend auf die Mitwirkung des Untersuchten angewiesen. Eingeschraenkte Kooperativitaet ist daher ein Problem erstrangiger Bedeutung. Aus einer Diagnose folgt nicht, dass ein bestimmtes Ausmass an Beeintraechtigung vorliegt. Deshalb ist es unumgaenglich, die Beeintraechtigungen als Befund konkret nachzuweisen, zu bezeichnen und ihre Auswirkungen auf den Einzelfall darzulegen. Psychische Folgeschaeden von Unfaellen setzen einen psychischen Erstschadensbefund voraus. Deren Vorliegen kann aus den Berichten der Erstbehandler, aus den Polizeiberichten oder aus Augenzeugenaussagen hervorgehen. Probleme liegen hier in der Abgrenzung der normalen psychischen Betroffenheit nach einem Schadensereignis. Unerlaesslich ist eine Pruefung der zeitlichen Abfolge (Folge nach der Ursache), also ob aehnliche Befunde bereits vor dem Unfall bestanden haben. Bei den Stoerungsbildern dissoziative Bewegungsstoerungen und somative Stoerungen koennen durch den Untersucher keine krankhaften Befunde, bei der traumatischen Belastungsstoerung nur spaerliche Befunde erhoben werden.

The primary disorders listed in DSM-5 include disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), premenstrual dysphoric disorder, substance/medication-induced depressive disorder, depressive disorder due to another medical condition, other specified depressive disorder, and unspecified depressive disorder. The various aspects of the disorder are presented, with a case application that highlights diagnostic assessment, treatment planning, and evidence-based treatment strategy.

Psychiatric illness offers a special challenge in that few psychiatric diagnoses have associated physical pathology but are diagnosed purely on subjective report. This leaves those with psychiatric illness potentially open to the accusation their illnesses are merely feigned. Theoretically, malingering is distinguished from psychiatric illness by the absence of psychopathology, the identification of ‘secondary gain’, and a conscious intent to deceive in order to obtain the gain. However, psychopathology is hypothetical, secondary gain is non-specific, and the determination of the extent that intent is conscious probably impossible.",

This last disease is driven by one becoming stigmatized, and at times a self-stigmatic process in the patient himself/herself, which tends to isolate a patient in his/her closest surroundings and to make him/her a recluse inside his/her house which leads to a suspension of social relationships.",

      "abstract": "Similar to the adult patient, a child or adolescent may actively feign or produce artificial symptoms (synonymous: Munchausen syndrome). The more frequent case is that the child suffers from being an object of symptom fabrication induced by a close person caring for the child, regularly the mother (Munchausen syndrome by proxy). This review focuses on psychopathological aspects of the clinically more relevant factitious disorder by proxy. Typical behaviour and personality characteristics are presented that can be taken as clinical warning signs. Doctor-mother-interaction is affectively challenging due to conflicting tasks imposed on the physician. Complementary to pediatric exclusion of genuine disease, psychopathological assessment is required to exclude other sources of deviant illness behaviour. Factious disorder shares particular features (active violation of the child, false report of history, aggravated symptom presentation and increased doctor-hopping, difficulties in conforming maternal report in biomedical data) with other psychopathological entities (child abuse, simulation, dissociative disorders, somatoform disorders including hypochondria, variants of maternal overprotection and infantilization, psychosis or delusion in the mother). Criteria for differentiation are presented. Three concepts on the psychopathological etiology of factitious disorder by proxy are relevant: In some cases, it may be conceived as secondary manifestation of a primary psychopathological entity or personality disorder. Learning theory emphasises operant rewards received from vicarious sick role. Attachment theory provides possible explanations concerning the traumatic impact on the child, early sources of psychopathology in the fabricating mother and risks for intergenerational transmission of factitious disorders.",

      "title": "What is the place for placebo in the management of psychogenic disease?",
      "abstract": "‘Placebo’ was used to describe fake substances or rituals used by medieval physicians to ‘please’, or assuage discomfort, in patients for whom no cure was available. This placatory perception of placebos led many to regard them as obsolete, permissible only as a comparator agent in clinical trials. Yet, placebo use by healthcare workers is relatively common,1 mainly to distinguish between organic and functional disease, identify malingerers, establish the psychological origin of a condition (to both physician and patient alike) and placate patients who insist on potentially harmful measures when the physician believes that no treatment is indicated.2\r\n\r\nPsychogenic disorders are somatic complaints for which there is no apparent physiologic cause.3 Features consistent with psychogenic conditions include: (1) presence of associated psychiatric disorders; (2) lack of concern (la belle indifference) or an exaggerated emotional response; (3) disease manifesting only when observed, and not when alone or thought to be unobserved; (4) bizarre or inconsistent signs; (5) presence of emotional or situational triggers; (6) multiple inexplicable physical symptoms; (7) failure to respond to therapy; (8) presence of a medical background; and (9) disease is triggered or ameliorated by placebo.4,5\r\n\r\nManagement of psychogenic disorders is difficult, as these patients often have an underlying organic disease.4 Prognosis for functional recovery is generally poor, and successful management requires a multi-disciplinary approach featuring the psychiatrist in a pivotal role. Empathy and a nonjudgemental manner should be used, and it is often helpful to invoke a neurobiological explanation of the symptoms in order to foster trust, acceptance, understanding and recovery.6\r\n\r\nShould placebos be used in managing psychogenic disease? In its favour are the potential salutary effects and absence of side effects, coupled with the low success rate of psychotherapy and potential adverse effects of psychopharmacotherapy. On the other hand, many are uncomfortable with the ethics of administering an inert substance purporting to be ‘active’, on the basis that it smacks of deception.\r\n\r\nPlacebos have opposing roles in clinical and research settings. A meta-analysis concluded that giving placebo equals ‘no treatment’;7 but there is physiologic evidence demonstrating the power of the placebo effect, which refers to perceived health benefits from prescription of medically inert substances.7 Studies in depressed patients have demonstrated similar metabolic responses to placebo and fluoxetine,7 just as positron emission tomographic (PET) studies in parkinsonian patients have shown robust dopamine release in response to placebo.7 It can be seen how the placebo effect can confound in clinical trials. In fact, the perceived benefits from sham surgery in surgical trials in osteoarthritis8 and surgery for Parkinson's disease,9 have resulted in the move to include a sham surgery control arm in surgical trials.9\r\n\r\nThus, in clinical practice, the physician prescribes a placebo in the hope that it will produce a therapeutic effect: such an effect is anathema to research. Ethicists have coined the term, ‘knowledge framing’, to describe desirable treatment effects arising from proper presentation of information to patients during the clinical encounter, distinct from the placebo (unwanted) effect in clinical trials.10\r\n\r\nWhilst debate rages about whether it is permissible to harness the placebo effect to treat psychogenic disease, few would condone placebo use to treat organic diseases for which appropriate therapy is available. Purists maintain that any practice involving deceit of patients is inappropriate, and that they must be informed of the inert nature of the placebo when it is administered.7 Unfortunately, complete disclosure is liable to decrease the utility of the placebo as treatment or diagnostic test (in which placebo is administered to trigger or halt psychogenic disease). Disallowing use of placebo because it is considered to be unethical would remove from the physician's armamentarium an important tool to diagnose and potentially treat psychogenic disease. As a result, such patients would be susceptible to the adverse effects of medications which would otherwise prove unnecessary.\r\n\r\nOne of the criticisms levied against placebo therapy is that it reflects a paternalistic attitude—that of an omniscient doctor who is the best judge of what is right for the patient, making decisions for the patient without need for patient consultation or agreement. It is feared that an erroneous judgement on the part of the physician would lead to his withholding appropriate treatment for the patient who is adjudged psychogenic or less serious.7 This scenario is, unfortunately, not as far fetched as one would hope. Disorders such as cervical dystonia and writer's cramp, now accepted as organic diseases, were once thought to be hysterical in origin.4\r\n\r\nWith the development of the field of medical ethics, we have evolved from the principles of paternalism and beneficence to embracing respect for patient autonomy, i.e. the right or freedom of individuals to make decisions on their own behalf.11 As doctors, we must be mindful of the dictum, primum non nocere, and strive to do right for our patients. Several questions remain: is the patient afflicted with psychogenic disease compos mentis? If not, can a relative or guardian make the decision to proceed with the placebo test or placebo therapy? It is likely that, however beneficent the intent, it can be argued that knowingly deceiving a patient by declaring placebo to be an active drug is an unethical act. It would be far better, perhaps, to practise knowledge framing and provide a neurobiological explanation, describing the placebo as a harmless agent, whose administration is meant to bring about improvement in the disorder.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, there is a place for placebo therapy, as long as: its use is transparent and the patient's autonomy and right-to-know is respected; it builds on and respects the patient-doctor relationship; it tolerates and even encourages the patient's right-to-choice, whilst developing an appropriate therapeutic concept for the patient; and it is engendered by care and concern for the patient.7 Thus, we would submit that the placebo is useful as a diagnostic test to distinguish between psychogenic and organic disease. Upon exclusion of organic pathology and confirmation of diagnosis, a trial of placebo therapy may avoid the need for harmful psychopharmacotherapy, though it may instead be used as an adjunct to psychiatric counselling and drug treatment. Of course, we would not recommend the placebo as standard therapy for all psychogenic disease, but would argue for acceptance of its place in the physician's pharmacopoeia.",

Historically, an arbitrary distinction has been made between \"organic\" conditions, associated with a presumably clear pathological basis, and \"functional\" conditions, or psychiatric disorders that lacked obvious disease processes. Delirium, however, is a disorder of cognitive dysfunction that lacks a well-understood pathophysiology despite unequivocal association with multiple and various medical conditions. More generally, delirium and dementia are frequently complicated by psychopathology (for example, delusions or changes in mood) traditionally associated with so-called functional disorders (schizophrenia and affective disorders, respectively). The organic/functional distinction obscured the propensity of medical conditions (e.g., thyroid dysfunction) to present with psychiatric symptoms that resolved after effective treatment of the nonpsychiatric condition. The nosological conventions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (1) allow recognition of syndromes of disseminated cognitive dysfunction, such as delirium and dementia, as well as the psychopathology that is the product of various and multiple medical conditions without obscuring the need to consider these entities in the differential diagnosis of \"functional\" symptomatology. Regardless of the evolution of diagnostic convention, the illnesses described in this chapter can present to the psychiatrist as a \"mental\" condition or present to other medical specialists as \"medical\" conditions.",

Vi kalder dette fænomen somatisering, medicinsk uforklarede symptomer, funktionelle symptomer eller lidelser, helbredsangst eller hypokondri og meget andet. Der hersker en udtalt begrebsmæssig og terminologisk forvirring på området. I denne artikel gives en kort gennemgang af enkelte, relevante begreber og centrale problemstillinger på området. Desuden beskrives en ny inddeling af tilstande, der præsenterer sig med funktionelle fysiske symptomer, dvs. fysiske symptomer, der ikke kan tilskrives nogen kendt ortodokst defineret somatisk lidelse. Endeligt præsenteres en mere moderne forståelse af somatiseringsbegrebet, og mulige årsagsforklaringer på funktionelle tilstande gennemgås.",

      "abstract": "Self-harm, suicide attempts, disordered eating, addiction, and other forms of “acting out” are associated with the trauma of surviving violence. While these behaviours are pathologized as symptoms of mental illness, they can be understood, instead, as strategies of resistance against violence. When violence is ignored or normalized, the “acting out” associated with trauma can be a means of sounding an alarm that something is very wrong. This “acting out” can be understood as an embodied form of testimony. When direct resistance to violence, such as fighting back or escaping, is thwarted or impossible, traumatic “acting out” can be a way to draw attention to and resist violence. Psychiatry, instead of answering the call of trauma by addressing the underlying violence, works to silence that call. Through incarceration, sexual violence, enforced isolation, restricted motion, threats, coercive drugging, gaslighting, and other abusive tactics, psychiatry works to undermine the embodied testimony of trauma by producing compliance. The source of the problem is shifted from the original violence and located instead in the body of the traumatized person. Successful treatment is understood as the reduction or elimination of the very “symptoms” which are in reality acts of resistance to violence. Therefore, successful treatment essentially means submission. The carceral space of psychiatry continues the work of producing compliance even after the patient has left its enclosures, extending the space of the psych ward into the everyday lives of psychiatric survivors.",

Self-injurious behavior or compulsion refers to any voluntary action resulting in self-damage. Compulsive disorders are characterized by repetitive, persistent, or sustained behaviors in excess of what is required for normal function, especially if severe enough to interfere with normal function. Cutaneous compulsions (psychodermatoses) often have an underlying organic disease or trigger. Diagnosis and treatment include identifying the underlying trigger, treating secondary dermatoses, and modifying behavior to prevent recurrence; medications are a helpful adjunct if anxiety interferes with normal activities or learning. Dermatoses may be initiated by a pathology, with subsequent self-injury causing persistence or worsening of lesions. Basic work-up to rule out medical causes of self-injurious behavior include evaluation for pain or pruritus, including musculoskeletal disease, neurologic disease, and/or primary dermatologic disease.",

However in the case of serious chronic or disabling illnesses or those occurring at a delicate stage in psychological development, the repercussions may assume social practical, affective and existential dimensions. In its human dimension, illness represents a double existential breakdown, severing links with environment and body that typify a healthy man's existence. This breakdown gives rise to a certain number of painful feelings, mainly of anxiety in acute illness, mainly depressive in chronic illnes, in which the collapse of self-esteem and the compromised self-image appear to be definitive. Such feelings, partly connected directly to the illness and partly caused by the conflicts arising from that condition, in their turn activate a series of mechanisms and defensive behaviour patterns which explain certain incomprehensible attitudes often noted by doctors in their patients and which often hinder treatment.",

Brief psychotic disorder is an acute but transient disorder with the onset of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior At least one of these symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications. The disturbance in behavior cannot be better accounted for by schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorder with psychotic features, or be a direct result of a drug, medication, or medical condition like thyrotoxicosis, sarcoidosis, or syphilis.",

Hypothesized barriers to clinical identification of emotional injury OCD include the atypically pleasant presentation of characteristic affirming compulsions. Patient self-identification is hypothesized to be diminished by the nature of overt and mental compulsions; for instance, agreeing with others and self-criticism. Recommendations are provided for differential diagnoses with social anxiety and codependency, as well as specific contraindications for common psychotherapeutic approaches. Hypothesized comorbid pathology are presented as opportunities for initial identification of cases.

L'apparition des symptomes ulcereux, les rechutes dans la maladie, a un moment precis de l'histoire du malade ne sont pas aleatoires. Elles correspondent souvent a la survenue d'evenements nouveaux, vecus comme traumatisants. Le deuil, les separations. . . , autant de situations stressantes induisant un malaise que le malade ne peut surmonter. Notons aussi cette problematique relationnelle, avec tout ce qu'elle connote comme ambivalence et tiraillement chez le malade qui n'arrive pas a trouver un compromis, lui permettant de surmonter ses conflits sans crainte de la perte ou de la rupture. La decharge emotionnelle etant barree, l'agressivite si elle existe, demeure retournee sur le malade lui-meme. Le malaise familial que vivent les patients se laisse voir a travers leurs difficultes relationnelles avec l'entourage et la situation embarassante dans laquelle ils se trouvent, sans aucune mediation possible par le langage concernant leurs problemes. Le discours parental culpabilisant fait vivre au patient un sentiment de rejet mal tolere. Il s'ajoute a cela la menace et la malediction qui suscitent l'angoisse. L'angoisse est aussi particulierement aigue devant la mort ou l'atteinte de la personne. Elle s'exprime dans la somatisation, faute de pouvoir etre symbolisee, elaboree dans la relation a l'autre. Le patient semble se retrancher a l'interieur de son propre corps ou moi, sans contact possible avec l'autre trop menacant et il est comme coupe de l'interieur. Il joue sa vie a travers la maladie, faute de pouvoir assumer la marque de l'autre en lui (le manque en lui-meme).",

He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

      "title": "Fibromyalgia or pseudo fibromyalgia? - We have to get it right",
      "abstract": "Chronic pain disorders like fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, repetitive strain injury and myofascial pain syndromes are no more considered as ‘waste basket diagnosis’, especially because of better biological understanding of these disorders including their immunological and genetic links.1-3 Patients truly suffering from these illnesses, therefore, need to be recognised correctly. Missing these peculiar illnesses and thereby messing them up by misdiagnosing as more serious ailments like Rheumatoid arthritis, other arthritic conditions, connective tissue diseases, psychiatric illnesses or malingering are expensive errors. An equally expensive error is labelling these close mimics and other pseudo fibromyalgia states as fibromyalgia. In both the scenarios, implications can be clinical (progression of an undiagnosed illness), pharmacological (toxicity of an unwarranted drug therapy) economic, emotional, social or even legal. Unfortunately, these errors are made by General practitioners, Physicians, orthopedicians, Psychiatrists and by Rheumatologists alike.4 Syndromic approach to diagnosis of illnesses relies upon physical signs and investigations to a large extent. In pain disorders like fibromyalgia, however, the vague, ‘out of proportion’ tenderness on minor pressure or even a gentle touch may be the only other notable feature apart from the widespread aches complained by the patient. There is no ‘tell-tale’ sign elicitable by inspection, palpation, percussion or auscultation for this spectrum of illnesses. Laboratory investigations always draw a blank. Chronic pain disorders, therefore, cannot be diagnosed by this conventional approach.5 Although chronic wide spread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance and mental fogging are some of the hallmarks of these illnesses, familiarity with classification criteria is a prerequisite to identify a good number of them. There are patients, however, with these illnesses that do not fulfill any criteria. Neurochemical misbalances, rather than anatomical lesions are more likely to cause these disorders; nor are they straightforward psychiatric illnesses, in spite of many reports of mind-body link in these conditions.6, 7 While rheumatology clinics in the western and developed world are flooded with such patients and rheumatologists in those parts of the world are more familiar with these illnesses, developing world is less familiar with these maladies. Now that the epidemic seems to be reaching the less developed world, many unanswered questions need to be addressed on this subject. Is it globalization that is bringing it to the developing world, where people earlier could tolerate small aches and pains better? Is it much less common amongst the underprivileged section of the society? Do lifestyle, dietary factors and other socioeconomic factors have some influence on pain threshold, if not on causation of these new world diseases? Painful disorders with anatomical lesions like inflammatory arthropathies, connective tissue diseases and osteoarthritis may also cause vicious cycle of ‘pain begetting more pain’, which may be termed as secondary fibromyalgia.8 On the contrary and paradoxically enough, there is a paradigm shift in the understanding of pain disorders; it is now believed widely that pain itself can cause localised inflammation in a significant proportion of cases and thereby induces this novel mechanism to perpetuate the vicious cycle of pain.9 Whether this has a therapeutic implication is arguable, but breaking this cycle is important in arresting the pain process. Mimics of fibromyalgia comprise a wide spectrum. On the one end, there are highly treatable low grade metabolic disorders like hypothyroidism and vitamin D deficiency causing chronic widespread pain. These relatively common disorders need to be excluded or diagnosed and treated, as the case may be, in a chronic pain scenario.10 On the other end of this spectrum, there are more serious organic pathologies like enthesopathic pain of spondyloarthropathies and at times, out of proportion pain and tenderness of leukemic arthropathies, especially in children presenting as vague aches and pains. Attending physician need to be sensitized to avoid misdiagnosing these conditions as fibromyalgia. Last, but not the least, undiagnosed cases of psychiatric illnesses including depression and malin-gering for social, emotional or economic gains can also present as ‘pseudofibromyalgia’.11, 12 The Chinese study in this issue by Rong MU et al. has revealed poor awareness and deficiency in diagnostic skills amongst doctors including rheumatologists and is a must- read article for all. Some of the points discussed in the preceding paragraphs are realised in this paper. Many rheumatologists who considered themselves non-believers of this vague entity in the recent past, have now turned into believers in view of emerging evidences cited above. No rheumatologist can afford to make a mistake today in diagnosing or excluding these modern day illnesses.",

      "abstract": "Psychological traumas may occur during childhood in the form of physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, and/or emotional neglect. Trauma may be experienced when a person experiences serious loss or his/her life is under grave threat. If such traumatic event is neither dealt effectively nor resolved completely, it may predispose such a person to development of mental health issues such as drug dependence including alcohol dependence syndrome (ADS). Persons who experience or suffer from childhood psychological trauma tend to consume alcohol in order to cope with their trauma related experiences. Hence, generally, onset of alcohol dependence is preceded by the occurrence of childhood psychological trauma(s). Childhood psychological trauma especially emotional abuse acts as a risk factor for the development of alexithymia in later life among persons with alcohol dependence. Alexithymia is a state of emotional dysregulation, which is characterized by the triad of difficulty in identifying one's own feelings, difficulty in distinguishing between the physical sensation and emotional arousal, and difficulty in explaining one's own feelings to others, which is known as externally oriented style of thinking. Alexithymia is itself a risk factor for the development of ADS. Thus, both childhood psychological trauma(s) and alexithymia play a significant role in the development of ADS. Findings of the present study showed that childhood psychological trauma(s), alexithymia, and ADS are interconnected. The present study findings conclude that significant relationship exists between childhood psychological traumas, alexithymia, and ADS.",

      "title": "The social dangerousness and medico-legal risks of schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Psychic activity relies on the physiological processes occurring in the brain. When disruptive factors, such as alcohol consumption or hallucinogenic substances intervene, the product of nervous activity, known as the psyche, becomes disturbed, resulting in perception, thought, and behavioral disorders. The psyche can be considered a fascinating mechanism oscillating between extremes: it can be both objective and subjective; both material and ideal. Additionally, the psyche manifests itself both normally and pathologically. Regarding the ways the psyche manifests, distinct categories can be identified. Appropriate behavior exhibited by individuals defines the normal psyche, while the pathological psyche exhibits unusual behavioral disorders often deemed immoral. The term \"normality\" is ambiguous and encompasses several meanings:It can refer to a person's discernment in psychiatric expert evaluations for judicial purposes; It can be associated broadly with individual health; It represents physical, mental, and social well-being; Psychiatrically, it is defined by the absence of mental illness. Medico-legal psychiatric examinations play a crucial role in justice, providing data to assess the responsibility of individuals who have committed criminal acts. To promote ethical principles and lawful conduct, preventive and intervention measures must be devised for cases involving antisocial defiance and social maladaptation. The pathological psyche is characterized by biological and/or psycho-behavioral changes that cause distress, disability, or a high risk of such outcomes (according to the American Psychiatric Association, 1994).",

      "title": "Emotional deficiency and psychopathy",
      "abstract": "Aside from an antisocial life-style, the concept of psychopathy is based on character features which can be described in terms of specific patterns of interpersonal, behavioral, and, in particular, affective characteristics. Concluding from studies which have dealt with the affective domain in psychopaths, emotional deficiency may predispose to violence in several ways. (1) Poor conditioning implicates a failure to review the harmful consequences of one's actions leading to a deficit of avoidance behavior. (2) Emotional detachment prevents experiencing feelings, which naturally inhibit the acting out of violent impulses. (3) Emotional deficiency is closely associated with a general underarousal, leading to sensation seeking. Current data suggest that there may be a close association between difficulties in emotional processing and poor prefrontal functioning. From a psychosocial perspective, psychopaths were shown to have been exposed to severe familial and societal difficulties. Whether biological or environmental factors dominate in the etiology of this personality disorder, psychopathy does not per se justify the assumption of decreased legal responsibility.

      "abstract": "The intensity of pain perceived following physiological insult is unique to that individual. Pain, by IASP definition, is a subjective and psychological symptom. Circumstances, personality and psychiatric illness may amplify (and less commonly mute) volunteered pain scores. Most pain is organically initiated and then psychologically contaminated. The psychological and psychiatric factors influencing pain scores will be considered. Patients with a propensity to somatise may elaborate and/or maintain ‘organic’ pain. This occurs ‘unconsciously’ (without awareness). This process deceives the patient (and often also the doctor). Intentional amplification of pain and the construction of pain behaviours for care‐eliciting purpose (factitious disorder) or personal gain (malingering) deceives others. Though there are clinical clues to feigned pains able to be obtained from the history and signs such as those proposed by Waddell, it is notoriously difficult to differentiate partial malingering, conversion or somatoform pain and the pain signature of the particular patient. If the intent of symptom formation and its continuance is psychological, medicine has a diagnostic role. If the intent is for personal greed or is criminal, the diagnosis rests upon legal issues.",

This chapter describes each theory's basic concepts and assumptions, theoretical limitations and advantages, and implications for treating or preventing mental illness. According to stress theory, when events and strains accumulate in people's lives, they can overwhelm people's psychosocial resources and abilities to cope and then generate symptoms of psychological disorder. Labeling theory picks up at this point and suggests that frequent, severe, or highly visible symptoms or symptoms exhibited by those with little social prestige or power, can launch a victimizing process. Societal reactions to symptoms may result in the person's receiving a formal psychiatric diagnosis, becoming hospitalized, and, ultimately, accepting a mental patient identity.",

The forms of delusion range from mis-attribution of identity related to self, other, as well as parts of the body. Although rare, these syndromes are encountered in a number of different forms by medical and psychiatric personnel, as well as other types of mental health workers. This is especially true since many of the syndromes have organic etiology and are treated via medical rather than psychological intervention. Nevertheless, delusional mis-identification syndromes often co-exist with psychiatric issues which can be helped by concurrent psychological treatment. Given that identity is central to human beings and their cultures, it is not surprising that delusional mis-identification is represented in a number of cultural beliefs. Some cultural expressions of delusional mis-identification may function as coping mechanisms for anxiety over loss of identity or the trauma of infant mortality.",

Die Ursachen liegen darin, dass psychiatrische Diagnosen auf Verhaltensbeobachtung und Beschwerdeschilderung gruenden, sie sind deswegen mitunter kaum zu objektivieren. Wegen den Schwierigkeiten in der Diagnosestellung ist fuer die Beurteilung von Schaedigungsfolgen weniger die Diagnose, als vielmehr der gesicherte Nachweis konkreter Funktionsstoerungen geeignet. Bei der Untersuchung ist der Gutachter weitgehend auf die Mitwirkung des Untersuchten angewiesen. Eingeschraenkte Kooperativitaet ist daher ein Problem erstrangiger Bedeutung. Aus einer Diagnose folgt nicht, dass ein bestimmtes Ausmass an Beeintraechtigung vorliegt. Deshalb ist es unumgaenglich, die Beeintraechtigungen als Befund konkret nachzuweisen, zu bezeichnen und ihre Auswirkungen auf den Einzelfall darzulegen. Psychische Folgeschaeden von Unfaellen setzen einen psychischen Erstschadensbefund voraus. Deren Vorliegen kann aus den Berichten der Erstbehandler, aus den Polizeiberichten oder aus Augenzeugenaussagen hervorgehen. Probleme liegen hier in der Abgrenzung der normalen psychischen Betroffenheit nach einem Schadensereignis.

      "title": "Somatisation as a manifestation of emotional disturbance in children",
      "abstract": "Somatisation is a phenomenon consisting in signalling complaints originating “from the body” (pain, discomfort, disturbances of physiological functions), whose cause is not explained on the basis of physical examination and additional examinations, and whose basis is usually an unconscious emotional factor. The most common somatic manifestations of negative emotions include abdominal pain, headache, palpitations or stabbing sensation in the chest, dizziness, shortness of breath, cough, squeezing sensation in the throat, numbness of limbs, as well as diarrhoea, vomiting or fainting. Although the described type of disorder occurs particularly often in people burdened with other mental problems, such as anxiety, depression or personality disorders, nowadays it is observed more and more often in children not showing any psychogenic abnormalities so far. A significant influence on the development of such symptoms has the environment of upbringing, from which the developing person draws behavioural patterns. In addition, the entire general social context with all its conditions, both positive and negative, is important. In the case of children, due to the lack of possibility of regular and constructive self-observation, developed abstract thinking and conscious, consistent verbalisation of inner experiences by the patient, the process of diagnosis and therapy of such disorders often requires diagnostic hospitalisation, multi-specialist consultations, long-term treatment in the outpatient mode, as well as at least partial modification of environmental relations, including the educational process. The fundamental issue remains the protection of mental health in the form of preventive measures aimed at creating existential conditions that have a positive impact on the mental development of children, which is particularly true of relations between generations.",

Ziel der Arbeit Der vorliegende Beitrag gibt einen Überblick über die Systematik psychischer Faktoren in Entstehung bzw.

Ergebnisse Psychische Beeinträchtigungen/Störungen können als Reaktion auf chronischen Pruritus auftreten, z. B. als Anpassungsstörungen, depressive Störungen, Angststörungen. Psychische Faktoren können auch in Entstehung und Verlauf eines chronischen Pruritus eine Rolle spielen, entweder im Zusammenspiel mit organischen Ursachen oder bei deren Fehlen als somatoformer Pruritus oder Pruritus bei coenästhetischer Schizophrenie. Ferner können selbstinduzierte Kratzartefakte mit oder ohne Pruritus im Rahmen von Störungen der Impulskontrolle, Zwangsstörungen oder Artefaktstörungen auftreten. Auch eine primär unabhängige Komorbidität mit einer sonstigen psychischen oder psychosomatischen Störung kann das Management des Pruritus erschweren und den Krankheitsverlauf beeinflussen. Es werden Hinweise zur Diagnostik der genannten Faktoren gegeben. Diskussion Die Diagnostik psychischer Einflussfaktoren und psychischer Aspekte des chronischen Pruritus ist komplex. Das wichtigste diagnostische Werkzeug ist die gründliche Anamneseerhebung auch bezüglich psychischer Aspekte. Zusätzlich können psychometrische Instrumente zum Einsatz kommen, die das ärztliche Gespräch jedoch nicht ersetzen.",

The classic form, primary delusional infestation, develops without any known cause or underling illness and meets criteria for a persistent delusional disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision)) or delusional disorder somatic type (DSM-5 ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fifth edition)). Approximately 60% of patients, however, have secondary forms of delusional infestation2 that occur in the context of substance misuse (such as cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis), dopaminergic medications, antibiotics, or during physical or psychiatric illnesses (such as delirium, dementia, depression, schizophrenia, stroke, and other medical conditions that affect the brain or cause pruritus).1 2\n\nThe neurobiology of delusional infestation is not fully understood.

The second, affective one, was marked by vital fear and anxiety. The third one involved common sense disorders and was characterized by vital bodily sensations. Vital depersonalization had all the principal signs of depersonalization. However, it differed from the allo-, somato- and autotypes of depersonalization in disorders of the vital level: similarity to physical sensations, pain and vagueness.

Their proximity is an indicator of the closeness of the classification of the two disorders. Dissociation is often part of the response to trauma. Transient symptoms of depersonalization or derealization lasting a few moments to a few hours are commonly experienced by most people at some point in their lives. The DSM-5 criteria for dissociative identity disorder requires the presence of two or more distinct personality states that is observed or self-reported and that results in disruption or discontinuity in the sense of self, and is accompanied by changes in affect, behavior, cognition, perception, consciousness, memory, or sensory-motor functioning. Dissociative amnesia involves the inability to recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, and often follows a traumatic or stressful life event.",

It occurs when there is persistent psychological maltreatment, leading to an adverse effect on the child. Abuse can happen in many environments, but frequently within the home. It can be active, for example rejection or exploitation, or passive, including emotional unavailability or negative interactions. Signs of emotional abuse can be subtle and age-dependent. Children may present with physical manifestations of stress, such as secondary enuresis or self-harm, or strange behaviours including aggression or submissiveness. They may be referred because of developmental delay or anxiety. Recognition and management of emotional abuse is vital to prevent long-term sequelae. This may include removal of the child from the harmful environment, or structured interventions, including parent or family behavioural schemes or social care input, or psychotherapy sessions.",

Specifically, major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric condition in which diagnostic criteria require five or more depressive symptoms, one of which must include either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure. Other depressive symptoms include significant weight loss, sleep changes (i.e., insomnia or hypersomnia), psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, diminished ability to think or concentrate, and recurrent thoughts of death. MDD is also distinguished from normal symptoms of sadness by criteria for symptom severity and duration: symptoms of depression must have been present during the same two-week period, be present all or most of the time, and represent a change from a previous level of functioning.",

      "title": "Agresivni bolesnik – učestalost i načini zbrinjavanja",
      "abstract": "Aggressiveness is a threatening behavior that results in mental, physical or material harm. It can be directed towards oneself, towards other persons or towards objects / things. Aggression can be expressed physically, verbally or even by neglect. Aggression in individuals depends on various risk factors and factors that influence the dose of aggression and therefore aggressive escalation. As in society and in the population, so do aggressive individuals find themselves in psychiatric wards. There are various psychic conditions that lead to an aggressive act. Schizophrenic patients can act aggressively as well as people who are in an alcohol overdose or people who have been overdosed on opioid substances. Any patient who tries to injure himself, another person, or who tries to cause great material damage shall endeavor to be taken care of by non-punitive or coercive methods. Deescalation procedures based on communication with the patient and using communication skills through which the patient seeks to calm down with words and the atmosphere during communication are cited as non-striking methods. Coercive methods are only used when non-coercive methods have failed. Forcing methods include pharmacological therapy, isolation and physical restraint. Pharmacological therapy involves the appeasement of the patient by administering therapy or medication. Isolation is the process of separating an aggressive patient from other patients from the ward into a specially arranged room where he or she resides until the physician estimates that the patient can return to the room where he or she resides with other patients. Physical restraint is the last phase of coercive methods, it involves the humane physical restraint of the patient with the aim of calming the patient and ceasing to be aggressive. The extremities, head and chest are fixed. The patient is unbound only when the physician determines by psychophysical assessment that the patient no longer needs to be fixed. Education is a very important process in such cases. Educating staff eliminates their possible fear or insecurity and increases the security of all people in the department where aggressive escalation can occur.",

Does mental disorder denote any diagnosable condition listed in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders? Is a mental disorder a disturbance wherein the functional criteria of the appropriate insanity law appear to be met? Or does insanity law define mental disorder apart from functional criteria of insanity? The answer to the last question is that some insanity laws attempt to define or qualify mental disorder, but many do not. Unclarities in the law leave room for unnecessary disagreements between expert witnesses even before the functional criteria for insanity are to be addressed. The potential for confusion is compounded when the defendant's disturbance is ambiguous, amphibious, or both. Schizotypal personality disorder is offered as an example of such a disturbance, and inferences are discussed.",

A number of risk factors have been identified, including psychopathological conditions such as eating disorders or other addictions. It is possible to detect this addiction and assess its intensity using multidimensional questionnaires, even the clinical relevance and thresholds of which are still debated. Despite the absence of validated treatments, motivational approaches and cognitive-behavioural therapies can be useful, combined with nutritional management if necessary, as well as management of concomitant disorders.",

Estrictamente hablando, la simulación no es un trastorno mental sino un problema que puede ser objeto de atención clínica. Sin embargo, se presume erróneamente que la simulación podría darse solamente en contextos forenses, lo que dificulta su identificación en ámbitos clínicos. La “psicosis instrumental” es una variante de simulación consistente en el fingimiento de síntomas por parte de un individuo con diagnóstico subyacente de una psicosis primaria y que simula sus síntomas en momentos de estabilidad clínica. Se presentan dos casos de personas con diagnóstico primario de esquizofrenia que pueden ser considerados también como aparentes casos de psicosis instrumental. No existen reportes previos de este trastorno en nuestro país, aunque presumiblemente su número no debe ser exiguo. Se revisa también la literatura pertinente a este interesante fenómeno que, más alláde su naturaleza psicopatológica, parece reflejar conductas de una definida índole psicosocial.",

      "title": "Functional gastrointestinal disorders",
      "abstract": "When clinicians label a child as having a functional disorder there is often a pejorative connotation that the symptoms are psychological, imagined, or faked. These symptoms range from chronic abdominal pain to recurrent headaches to fatigue. We say the complaints are functional because we are unable to demonstrate any structural or biochemical abnormality causing them. The degree to which we go searching for these abnormalities varies from case to case and often depends oh our own clinical experience, insecurities, and demands of the patient's family. Labeling a child as having a functional complaint can put a tremendous burden on the child and family, because if this concept is presented improperly (as implied above), it can suggest that it is their fault there are symptoms arid that if they “got their act together” the symptoms would melt away. Functional gastrointestinal disorders are defined as conditions in which a variable combination of chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms are present in the absence of demonstrable disease. There may indeed be physiologic abnormalities underlying the symptoms, but at the present time we are unable to detect them. We make a diagnosis based on symptoms, not on demonstrable abnormalities in physical examination or laboratory tests. A number of common pediatric diagnoses fall into this category, including infant regurgitation, chronic nonspecific diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, non-ulcer dyspepsia, infant dyschezia, and functional constipation. This paper presents a brief review of our current understanding of each diagnosis and gives suggestions for management. Curr Open Pediatr 1999, 11375–378 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a syndrome of primarily psychomotor disturbances associated with typical abnormalities of muscle tone. It is characterized by the co-occurrence of several symptoms of decreased, increased, or abnormal psychomotor activity. Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, not an independent nosological entity. Historically associated mainly with schizophrenia (e.g., catatonic subtype), ICD-11, similarly to DSM-5, now recognizes catatonia under a separate classification category, apart from psychotic disorders. In addition to schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, it can occur in the context of other mental disorders, such as mood disorders, or neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or immediately after intoxication or withdrawal from psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine, cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of some psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Moreover, catatonia can occur as a direct pathophysiological consequence of various nonpsychiatric medical conditions, e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, neoplasms head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, or encephalitis. Due to the fact that catatonia was mostly associated witch schizophrenia, many cases were not diagnosed and thus did not receive indicated treatment. There are no specific “anti-catatonic” drugs, first-line treatment are benzodiazepines and ECT, in addition to the symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recognition of catatonia as an independent category in ICD-11 can improve medical care for catatonic patients in clinical practice. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

In a cohort of 821 consecutive patients admitted to an acute stroke unit, 13% were incorrectly diagnosed as stroke [1]. In another cohort of 411 patients, it was estimated that 19% of patients presenting to the emergency department with stroke-like symptoms ultimately have other diagnoses such as a postictal state, metabolic disturbances, and systemic infections [2]. Regardless of the actual percentage, it is clear that not all cases of acute stroke-like symptoms are true strokes and other mimics should be considered. One such mimic is factitious disorder. \r\nFactitious disorder is a psychiatric condition in which afflicted individuals exaggerate symptoms and even endorse medical illness, or psychological trauma in order to draw attention or sympathy to themselves. The DSM-IV criteria for this disorder are: 1) Intentional production or feigning of physical or psychological signs or symptoms; 2) The motivation for the behavior is to assume the sick role; and 3)\r\nExternal incentives for the behavior such as economic gain or avoiding legal responsibility as seen in malingering, are absent [3].\r\nHere, we present a case of a patient who was diagnosed with factitious disorder after he presented to two different institutions with acute stroke-like symptoms and received tissue plasminogen activator\r\n(t-PA) twice within the span of 3 weeks.",

      "title": "Euthymic suffering and wisdom psychology",
      "abstract": "In Fava and Guidi's paper1, euthymia is defined by \"lack of mood disturbances that can be subsumed under diagnostic rubrics\" , \"positive affects\" and \"psychological well-being\" . So, good mood is euthymic. But, what about bad mood and suffering which can also not be subsumed under diagnostic rubrics? Life is no rose garden. All human beings experience illness, failure, conflicts with others, problems with children or spouse, financial troubles, or legal disputes. It would be a mental disturbance to feel happy under these circumstances. Is euthymia limited to positive affects or happy hours, or should it include all forms of \"normal\" mood? That not all hardship and negative feelings automatically qualify as disorder is confirmed by the ICD-10, which provides separate codes (Z codes) for negative life situations such as loss of work, social exclusion, or burnout. If people feel unhappy when burdened by negative life events, this is no mental disorder, but \"healthy suffering\" . It is of great importance not to medicalize such everyday problems2. In clinical practice, there are many people who contact medical experts because of healthy suffering. They need a professional evaluation together with some advice. We need diagnostic criteria for healthy bad mood. Such criteria include situational adequacy of the type and intensity of the emotional reaction, self-appraisal, controllability, compliance with individual and social norms, lack of specific psychopathological signs and symptoms3. Healthy persons with normal bad mood display consistency in their behavior and values, show environmental mastery, self-acceptance, positive relations with others, flexibility, and resilience to go on with daily duties4. So, healthy suffering and bad mood should be included in the concept of euthymia. How can interventions deal with such a broadened concept of euthymia? There are basically four different approaches to foster euthymia. The first one is to get rid of bad mood by improving well-being through the increase of pleasant activities and experiences5. \"Regeneration therapy\"6 engages people in positive and self-care exercises, from board games to cultural and social activities, relaxation and make oneself up. Positive effects of these interventions were shown in regard to depressed mood or distress intolerance and the ability to work. The bottom line is that, if you are under stress, you should do something positive for yourself or coddle yourself. The second approach also aims to counteract bad mood, this time by teaching how to generate positive emotions directly. \"Euthymia therapy\"7 teaches the art of enjoyment and experiencing of pleasures. \"Well-being therapy\"1 teaches people to focus on constituents of positive mood by self-observation, change of dysfunctional cognitions, and promotion of activities. Studies on these interventions showed positive effects in depressed or psychosomatic patients transdiagnostically. The bottom line is to improve the capacity of the individual to generate positive emotions. A different type of approach is represented by \"mindfulness and acceptance\" based therapies8. Their primary goal is not to get rid of negative emotions and cognitions, but instead to change the individuals' relationship to their emotional state, their experiences, and the living context. This is done by encouraging awareness and acceptance of unpleasant feelings through mindfulness practice and cognitive defusion. Commitment and behavior change processes are based on contact with the present moment. Bad mood is accepted and may still be present after treatment. This approach implicitly has a broader concept of euthymia, including bad and positive mood alike. The bottom line is to accept and arrange oneself with something that cannot be changed. Another approach, which goes in the same direction, is \"wisdom therapy\"9. Life span psychology describes wisdom as a psychological capacity, given to all persons, which is essential in coping with severe, irreversible or unsolvable problems, but also in dealing with daily dilemmas, such as the decision whether to stay at home with a sick child or to go to work. Similar to other psychological capacities, there are about a dozen sub-dimensions, such as recognition of reality (factual and procedural knowledge, contextualism, relativization of problems and aspirations), mastery of emotions (perception and acceptance of emotions, serenity), acceptance of personal limitations (self-relativization, self-distance), clarification and self-assurance of goals and values (value relativism, forgiveness and acceptance of the past, uncertainty tolerance, long-term perspective), and interactional competencies (change of perspective, empathy). \"Wisdom therapy\" provides strategies to translate these sub-dimensions into treatment. There is evidence that it works in patients with severe adjustment disorders9. The goal of the intervention is to learn how to deal with bad and good times alike. Euthymia can be defined as a state of wisdom, in which persons feel at ease with themselves and the world, their past, the present and the future, in good and bad times, and do not lose heart and courage in the face of adversities and hardship. The concept of euthymia should reflect the daily existence of human beings. Happiness is limited to very few moments in life. Demands, hardship, burdens fill the rest of time. Back pain, heavy work or driving a car in combusted streets do not produce happiness. But there is nevertheless euthymia. The problem of mental illness is that people are overburdened and impaired by daily hassles, while healthy persons have resilience and can deal with bad times. We should not create the misunderstanding that happiness is the goal to be pursued by our interventions. This can lead to disappointment. Instead, mastery of exceptional and daily burdens and demands, and how nevertheless to \"feel OK\" (not happy but euthymic), should be the aim.",

      "title": "Impairment Tutorial: Personality Disorders in Disability Arena",
      "abstract": "Personality disorders are conditions that can complicate impairment and disability assessment. It is important that the evaluating physician recognize these disorders. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV)1 defines ten specific personality disorders in addition to an eleventh condition, Personality Disorder NOS, which allows for combined features of the various personality disorders as well as personality conditions which are not specifically listed. The ten listed personality disorders are divided into three clusters.Personality disorders represent enduring patterns of inner experience and behavior that deviate markedly from those expected by the individual—s culture. These inflexible and pervasive patterns reflect problems with cognition, affectivity, interpersonal functioning and impulse control, and lead to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. By their very nature, personality disorders are often unrecognized by those who suffer from them, who tend to blame others for their problems. There may be comorbidity with various conditions, such as pain disorder, depression, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder and substance abuse. Personality disorders may be undiagnosed by healthcare providers, which can be particularly troublesome when disability benefits are involved.These personality disorders are occasionally present in people involved in litigation. Of this group, Paranoid Personality Disorder, in which a person suspects, without sufficient basis, that others are exploitative, harmful, or deceitful, is probably the most common in the legal arena. Such people tend to bear grudges, read hidden meaning into benign remarks, and to believe that their reputations are under attack. The other Cluster A personality disorders result in significant social detachment or isolation and are less likely to be present in plaintiffs or workers—compensation claimants.These personality disorders are more prevalent in the legal arena, perhaps because people suffering from these conditions feel comfortable with and may seek to be the focus of attention. Of this group, probably the most prevalent disorder in the legal disability arena is borderline personality. Such people may suffer from frantic efforts to avoid perceived abandonment, patterns of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships, an identity disturbance, and impulsivity. They may exhibit suicidal behavior, gestures, and threats, affective instability, chronic feelings of emptiness, intense displays of anger, transient dissociative symptoms, and stress-related paranoid ideation. Histrionic individuals have a pattern of excessive emotionality and attention seeking behavior. Narcissistic individuals have a pattern of grandiosity, a need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others. Antisocial individuals have long-term disregard for the rights of others. In my experience, legal issues involving individuals with cluster B personality disorders often involve determination of causation of the person—s problems, an assessment of claims of harassment, and an assessment of the person—s fitness for employment.These disorders also are encountered in legal situations. Obsessive-compulsive personality disordered individuals who may have functioned at a high professional level, such as in the legal and medical professions, may be seeking disability benefits through private or group disability insurance plans. Dependent personality disordered patients encounter difficulty making everyday decisions; they tend to let others assume responsibility, have trouble with self-assertion, and have excessive need for nurturance and support. Such individuals—psychological need to be cared for perpetuates a disabled posture with respect to family and medical caregivers. These underlying issues tend to reinforce chronic pain syndromes and perpetuate claims for disability benefits, leading to potential diagnostic dilemmas concerning the cause of ongoing problems.The following case vignettes, which are composites of various case histories, help to illustrate these points.A thirty-five year old sawmill worker suffered a partial index and ring finger amputation in his non-dominant hand. He had suffered two prior significant accidents while working elsewhere in his twenties. In one of those accidents, he sustained a lumbar compression fracture when he fell from a platform; in the other, a mild traumatic brain injury when he was struck by falling pieces of lumber. After all of the injuries, there was a pattern of prolonged disability, chronic pain behavior, narcotics dependence, and increased explosive and threatening behavior.The injured worker gave a history of conflict with others since early adolescence. He had a history of mistrust, believing that others were cheating him and that his wife was unfaithful. Although greatly perturbed by his wife—s unsubstantiated infidelity, he was not at all concerned about the impact on his wife and children of his own infidelity. His accusations caused considerable turmoil at home. He had a long history of believing that he was being persecuted by his employers, family, police, neighbors, and acquaintances, lacking insight into the provocative nature of his own behavior. He thought that others tampered with his equipment at work and deliberately miscalculated his work output in order to cheat him, even though there was no supporting evidence. He had a history of recurrent fights, exacerbated by alcoholism and narcotics use, and of friction with the police.The evaluee suffered from Personality Disorder NOS with marked paranoid features, and this significantly colored his reaction to his traumatic amputation. His tendency to blame others for an accident that was due to his own misjudgment, his turbulent relationships at work, and his belief that he was being persecuted by the employer and coworkers severely impacted his ability to return to work and to be rehabilitated. His psychological problems were due to his underlying personality disorder, exacerbated by both substance abuse and the work injury. In the particular jurisdiction in which he was evaluated, the worsening of his psychological condition due to his work injury was deemed compensable by the workers—compensation hearing officer.A thirty-one year old woman was sexually harassed by a male supervisor in a factory where she was employed for seven months. The harassment began with occasional sexual comments, which at first seemed casual. When the remarks were not met with firm rejection, the supervisor escalated his behavior and made the employee feel very uncomfortable.At the time of the harassment, the employee was going through a divorce and a custody battle. Her husband, a cocaine dealer, had been released from prison one year previously. The evaluee had two prior failed marriages, both to jealous, abusive, controlling individuals. Her current husband seemed more interested in retribution for an affair that she had had when he was imprisoned than in working or providing for their two children.The employee had a long history of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships. She had a history since adolescence of mood swings with recurrent periods of anxiety, depression, and stress-related paranoid thinking. She had a pattern of self-abusive behavior, recurrently burning herself with matches and superficially cutting her forearms, abdomen, and legs with razor blades. The repetitive burning caused keloid formation on her forearms, which served to exacerbate her negative self-perception. She was perceived as flirtatious and often wore halter-tops and low-cut blouses to work, even in winter.The employee had a history of ongoing cocaine abuse and a past history of amphetamine addiction. She had a history of multiple failed relationships and impulsive behavior, but was socially engaging. She was perceived by others as a fun person when things were going well, but was quick to react with rage and feel abandoned. At such times, she contemplated suicide, and had a history of two brief psychiatric hospitalizations for overdoses. She had been in outpatient psychotherapy off and on since her teens, with four different therapists, and had been prescribed various benzodiazepines (which she abused) and antidepressants.In this case, the person—s psychological difficulties were due to a borderline personality disorder and substance abuse. The job-related sexual harassment was inappropriate and uncomfortable, but was not determined to be the cause of her psychological difficulties.",

The interplay between internal and external world can be depicted through the various skin reactions in regard to psychological or physiological stimuli. Psychocutaneous illness could be exclusively psychological or stress related or due to strong psychogenic factors. As per biopsychosocial model, it could be primary, multifactorial, or secondary to disfigurement. Whichever is the condition, invariably stress is a major contributing factor in prognosis and onset of disorders of the skin. Self-explanation, myth, stigma, and diminished self-confidence often lead to depression and suicidality followed by active avoidance of the workplace, in turn, causing significant disability in the individual. The conflict between self-image and perceived image frequently causes fear of rejection leading to social anxiety, reduced self-confidence, interpersonal communication, and impaired sexual intimacy with a partner. Maladaptive sets of coping strategies such as alexithymia, shame proneness, avoidance, concealment, and escape are very common among the sufferers which impair the attachment with family and friends. Children are the extreme sufferers as they develop inferiority, low self-esteem, loss of body image, and social withdrawal leading to rejection from parents and faulty development of attachment pattern. Hence, disorders of the skin can lead to impaired coping, impaired compliance, limitations in quality of life, negative body image, and stigmatization which invariably cause psychological comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, phobia, and somatoform and adjustment disorders. Hence, there is a direct relationship between skin, mind, and society which we are going to explore in a detailed fashion to understand its impact on the psyche and the society.",

      "title": "Clinical practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders in children and adolescents",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Dissociative or conversion disorders (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision [ICD-10]; hereafter referred to as dissociative disorders) are characterized by disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, sensations, and control of body movements. The symptoms of this disorder are not due to substance use and are not limited to pain or sexual symptoms, and the gain is primarily psychological and not monetary or legal. In these disorders, it is presumed that the ability to exercise a conscious and selective control over the symptoms is impaired, to a degree that can vary from day to day or even from hour to hour. However, it must be added that it is usually very difficult to assess the extent to which some of the loss of function might be under voluntary control. The diagnosis is made by the presence of specific clinical features, no evidence of a physical disorder that might explain the symptoms, and evidence for psychological causation in the form of clear association in time with stressful life events and problems or disturbed interpersonal relationships. Dissociative disorder can be of different types, as shown in Table 1.Table 1: International Classification of Disease-10 category of dissociative 10 categories of dissociative (conversion) disordersThese guidelines are an update to previous IPS guidelines on dissociative disorders (2008) in child or adolescent (hereafter child unless specified). These are broad guidelines which will help in systematic assessment and management of a child with dissociative disorder. ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS The assessment of dissociative disorders involves a detailed psychiatric and developmental history. An assessment should be made of the child's temperament, schooling, and peer relationships. The family functioning should be explored. A comprehensive medical, neurological, and mental status examination should be done. An assessment of psychosocial circumstances and problems should be done, especially to find which ones are temporally associated with the onset of dissociative symptoms. One should obtain psychiatric history from all the possible sources including the teachers, if possible. Furthermore, assessment should be made of the perception of the child and parents about the dissociative symptoms. An attempt should be made regarding the presence of physical and psychological symptoms in the other family members or the neighbors which may act as a model. The key points in the assessment of pediatric dissociative disorders are shown in Table 2.Table 2: Key points in the assessmentRULING-OUT PHYSICAL AND OTHER PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS As mentioned above, an initial comprehensive medical and neurological assessment is crucial in any child where a possibility of a dissociative disorder is being kept. In this regard, the treating psychiatrist should always consider seeking appropriate consultations. Relevant physical and psychological investigations must be done [Table 3]. An assessment of educational achievement of the child with regard to the child's potential and the level of education provided should be done, which is often indicated. The possibility of dissociative symptoms superimposed on neurological or medical disorders or other psychiatric disorders should always be carefully considered.Table 3: Investigations for ruling out physical or psychiatric disordersIf dissociative symptoms appear for the first time in a preschool child, a strong suspicion of an underlying physical or psychiatric disorder should be kept in mind because dissociative disorders are very rare in this age group. DIAGNOSIS OF DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER SHOULD NOT BE MERELY BASED ON THE ABSENCE OF OBJECTIVE SIGNS OF PHYSICAL DISORDER Although it is very important to exclude an underlying or associated physical disorder, as well as other primary psychiatric disorders that may explain the dissociative symptoms, the diagnosis of dissociative disorder should not be based merely on the absence of objective signs of a physical or psychiatric disorder. It is imperative to remember that the absence of physical findings applies universally to an earliest stage in the development of all diseases. Moreover, physical findings that appear nonrelevant at first may assume significance later. The diagnosis of dissociative disorder is not just of exclusion. The clinician should always keep in mind the overall biopsychosocial context of the child and the symptoms. When the diagnosis of a dissociative disorder is made with too much certainty without proper assessment, other physical or psychiatric disorders are often missed. When the diagnosis is too tentative, multiple and irrational medical evaluations may be conducted, and iatrogenic reinforcement of the symptoms and harm is possible. Pseudoseizures or nonepileptic seizures are a common presentation of dissociative disorders in children which must be differentiated from true epileptic seizures [Table 4].Table 4: Differences between dissociative convulsion and epileptic seizurePSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS OR STRESSORS Psychological distress overt or covert is an essential causative factor for dissociative disorders. A list of common stressors in pediatric dissociation is shown in Table 5. Stressors are not mutually exclusive.Table 5: Psychosocial factorsAttempts should be made to systematically identify the child's psychosocial environment, stressors, and coping abilities to handle stressful life situations. An attempt should also be made to find the secondary gains due to dissociative disorder. A view that stressors are \"unconscious\" creates a barrier in the physician's mind about looking for stressors. Studies in children with dissociative disorders have shown that stressors are generally present in day-to-day life of the patients and are known both to the patient and the family members. However, they may not reveal them for certain reasons. It is important for the clinician to evaluate the child for the stressors from a developmental perspective. It may not be possible to find stressor in the initial interviews. By repeated, careful and sensitive interviewing stressors can be elicited. Stressors in children and adolescents may include day-to-day problems such as difficulty in school or in family relationships, fights with other children, scolding and punishment by the teachers or family members, some frightening experiences, and educational difficulties. The child may find oneself in some kind of unwanted or disliked situation such as marriage, job or studies, bullying, and sometimes abuse and neglect. The stressor could also be an unaddressed physical illness or deformity. Assessing in detail about the onset of symptoms may give clue to the possible stressor, for example, becoming unconscious at school in English period. At times, stressors may not be severe enough to be noticed by the family members of the patient. Moreover, the family members may not be able to correlate the stressor with the onset of dissociative symptoms. In such cases, stressors should be assessed systematically, and the severity and temporal correlation of stressors with the onset of symptoms should be clearly delineated. One may use multiaxial ICD-10 Axis V for systematic assessment of stressors in children. The ICD-10 specifies that there should be convincing associations in time between the onset of symptoms of the disorder and \"stressful (life) events, problems, or needs.\" However, Indian studies point out that stressors are found in only 62%–82% of cases of dissociative disorder. Unless all the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of dissociative disorder including temporally related psychosocial stressors are met, a confident diagnosis should not be made. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND COMORBIDITIES Dissociative symptoms could be the presenting symptoms of underlying undetected psychiatric disorders such as separation anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, school phobia, depression, and at times, impending psychosis. Then, dissociative disorder may also have comorbid oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual disability, especially in boys. Therefore, it is important to screen for all age-appropriate psychiatric disorders in the child to avoid missing an underlying primary or a comorbid diagnosis. Dissociative disorders should be differentiated from factitious disorder and malingering. In latter two situations, the symptoms are intentionally produced to a assume sick role. The gain is psychological in factitious disorder. In factitious disorder by proxy, the parent (s) induce illness in the child for their own psychological gains. In malingering, the symptoms are feigned to obtain an incentive like money or some other material gain or to avoid a disliked responsibility or punishment. Apparent fabrication of symptoms or gross inconsistencies in history should raise possibility of malingering or factitious disorder. FALSE-POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS Rates of misdiagnosis are around 4%. False-positive diagnosis is likely if importance is given only to the symptoms and not to the underlying physical or psychiatric morbidity and psychosocial circumstances. One must assess the case with open mind. One should review the past medical records carefully, and if required, further assessments should be done. Some of the diagnostic difficulties are mentioned in Table 6.Table 6: Physical differential diagnosisIt is also likely that these false-positive diagnoses are made more often in females, psychiatrically disordered children, patients presenting plausible psychogenic explanations for their illnesses, and patients with unusual movement disorders or epilepsy. POSITIVE SIGNS Various \"positive signs\" of dissociative disorders have been described in the literature such as tunnel vision, discrete anesthetic patches, astasia-abasia, positive Hoover's test, preserved cough in hysterical aphonia, and hemianesthesia sharply separated at the midline. These signs indicate normally preserved physiological functions underlying the superficial appearance of incapacity. In addition to the above \"positive signs,\" hysterofrenic areas (areas on body, which when pressed, abort the hysterical episode, usually convulsive in nature) and hysterogenic areas (areas on body, e.g., a hyperesthetic spot, which when pressed can induce a hysterical episode) have also been mentioned. It must be kept in mind that dissociative disorders can be easily misdiagnosed or overdiagnosed if these \"positive signs\" are taken to be pathognomonic of the disorder. Studies indicate that these positive signs can also be seen in neurological patients. Gould et al. looked for the positive signs of hysteria in 30 consecutive neurological admissions (25 of which had acute strokes in adults). These \"signs\" were la belle indifference, nonanatomic sensory loss, midline split of pain or vibratory sensations, changing boundaries for hypoalgesia, giveaway weakness, and history of hypochondriasis. All 30 patients showed at least one out of seven \"signs,\" most exhibited more than one \"signs,\" and one patient had all seven \"signs.\" TREATMENT It is imperative to treat dissociative disorders promptly to prevent habituation and future disability. The longer the symptoms remain, the more aggressive the treatment should be. The treatment usually consists of two parts: (a) early treatment directed toward symptom removal and (b) long-term treatment directed toward the resolution of stressors and prevention of further episodes. Dissociative disorders are seen very less internationally. Therefore, there are no practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders. The proposed treatment guidelines are based mainly on Indian work in this area. Table 7 gives the key points of treatment.Table 7: TreatmentPRINCIPLES OF ACUTE MANAGEMENT Rapport and therapeutic alliance The cornerstone of successful therapy is establishment of therapeutic rapport and alliance with the child. It is also very important to have good doctor–parent relationship because the parents have to become an ally in treatment of the child. Parental influences on the child are significant even in the hospital setup. Unless the parents understand the clinician's point of view, it may not be possible to alter their overprotective and overindulgent attitude and behavior toward the child. One should listen to the concerns of the family carefully and try to understand their perception of the child's symptoms. PSYCHOSOCIAL EXPLANATION OF DISSOCIATIVE SYMPTOMS First of all, the diagnostic assessment must be done in an impressive manner, and the parents should be involved in the assessment process. It would be useful to explain to them why a particular assessment is being done and what the results are expected to show. When the results of this diagnostic assessment are obtained, their significance should also be explained to the parents. After reliably ruling out physical or other psychiatric illness as the cause of dissociative symptoms, the child and the family should be strongly assured that there is nothing physically seriously wrong with the child and the symptoms are psychogenic and that the child will make a complete recovery [Table 8]. When physical or psychiatric disorders are ruled out and the possibility of the dissociative symptoms being psychogenic is put forward, it is usually very vehemently rejected by the parents. That there could be anything psychologically wrong with their \"severely ill\" child, their parenting or with their family functioning, is totally unacceptable to the parents. Any suggestion of this possibility is met with resentment, anger, and sometimes open hostility. Therefore, any confrontation about the nature of the symptoms should be avoided at all costs, and all the members of the treating team should adopt the same nonconfrontational, calm approach toward the disorder the child and family. When the treatment team's point of view is understood and accepted by the family, only then it would be possible for them to cooperate in psychosocial assessments.Table 8: Key points in psychoeducationADDRESSING THE PSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS Once the causes are known, then attempts should be made to solve the \"problem.\" The problem should be discussed with the child and the family. In case of adolescents, if the problem has been revealed to doctor or the ward staff in confidence, then consent of the adolescent should be taken to discuss it with the family. The physician should not force his opinion on the child or the family. Problems of family relationships should be discussed, and family should be told that the child is being adversely affected by the family problems and their resolution will improve the child. At times, family therapy may be required. It is also important to open up the channels of communication between the child and his family. Throughout the treatment, attention should be focused on the child and his functioning rather than on the symptoms. This helps in speedy recovery. In most of the patients, reassurance and suggestions of recovery coupled with attention to the patient's psychosocial needs lead to a rapid recovery [Table 9].Table 9: Behavioral management of childrenSYMPTOM SUBSTITUTION As the dissociative symptoms begin to subside, the child may sometimes manifest other new dissociative symptoms in their place. Occasionally, distress may be expressed by deliberate self-harm, demanding, and histrionic behavior or the child may develop depressive symptoms. In such a situation, consistent limit setting may be essential for continuation of psychological treatment. Regularity of follow-up visits is important so that the patient does not need to \"produce\" a symptom to visit the therapist. Finally, the physician should not feel pressurized to cure the child very quickly. He should retain his calm and be prepared to face the hostility and aggression of the family and coercion for not using medication and quickly improving the child. SECONDARY GAINS Reduction in secondary gains is not advisable very early in the treatment and without adequate explanations to the family because of three reasons.First, the physician himself may not be certain about the origin of the symptoms. Second, the family may perceive reduction in secondary gain as neglect of the child. Furthermore, initially, the family may not have full confidence in the physician and the hospital's ability to take total care of their child. Later on, the family should be offered adequate explanations regarding secondary gains. Reduction in secondary gains in a child should be coupled with an alternative, healthy, socially acceptable, and age-appropriate role or activities for the child in which he or she can be trained and rewarded for doing something positive. ABREACTION AND AVERSION THERAPY Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior has often been employed in resistant cases, for example, using liquor ammonia, aversive faradic stimulation, pressure over trochlear notch, tragus of ear or over the sternum, and closing the nose and mouth. Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior is not advised as it may harm the patient and has a pejorative connotation equivalent to punishment. It may provide only temporary benefits, if any. Abreaction is bringing to conscious awareness, thoughts, affects, and memories for the first time, with or without the use of drugs. This may be achieved by hypnosis, free association, or drugs. Abreaction may further foster dissociative states. Moreover, some patients treated with this technique may perceive the therapist as sanctioning the dissociative states; hence, it is not recommended. MEDICATION Medication may be used only for concomitant anxiety, depression, or behavioral problems and not for the dissociative symptoms. The family should be tactfully made to understand that medications are neither required nor approved for dissociative symptoms. Otherwise, the family may perceive that doctor is unable to diagnose the child's problem and treat it. The use of medication will unnecessary expose the child to the side effects. In addition, the family may not give enough attention to psychological treatment thinking that medication will cure the dissociative symptoms. However, at times, there are families who persistently demand medication despite repeated explanations. In such situations, one may consider using a placebo to retain the child in treatment and overcome resentment or hostility of the family. NEED FOR HOSPITALIZATION Hospitalization is required when there is doubt in the diagnosis, severe symptoms are present, the family is very distressed, or the symptoms are recalcitrant and resistant to outpatient treatment. DUAL DIAGNOSIS If the dissociative symptoms are present with the physical disorder, then the physical disorder should be treated first. When the physical disorder is stabilized, then the dissociative symptoms if still present should be managed as per the guidelines. TREATMENT OF CHRONIC DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER Chronic cases are more difficult to treat, and the management should always begin with a rational comprehensive evaluation and clear explanation to the child and the family about the findings. Psychoeducation of the family about the nature of the disorder and its course and outcome is necessary. Similar things should also be explained to the child taking into account his ability to understand and accept the information. The family should be explained that although the symptoms are real and impairing, a serious physical disorder is not causing them and there is hope of full recovery. Psychotherapy may be useful but contraindicated in a patient who is resistant to it or gets worse when it is initiated. COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY Family-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps the affected child to become aware of, examine, and if appropriate revise the way they think, respond, and behave rationally to their symptoms. The aim of CBT is to maximize functioning and reduce the dissociative symptoms. Gradually, onus of treatment should be shifted from the physician to the child and the family. The following are the principles of CBT in chronic dissociative states: Give positive explanations for symptoms Persuade the child that change is possible, he or she is not \"damaged,\" and they do have the potential to recover Discuss the treatment rationale with the patient and the key family members Encourage engagement in daily routine activities Teach relaxation and distraction away from unpleasant thoughts and the symptoms Encourage the patient to rationally reconsider unhelpful and negative thoughts Negotiate a phased return to work and studies Joint activities with family in symptom-free periods. Evidence exists at systematic review level that CBT is effective for a wide range of functional somatic symptoms. Its use has also been described (although not properly tested) in patients with nonepileptic attacks, dissociative motor symptoms, and severe and multiple functional symptoms.

Pasien sangat yakin akan keparahan gejalanya.. Perlu dilakukannya pendekatan lebih pada pangobatan waham somatik, dapat diberikan antipsikotik dan SSRI. Kesan klinis menunjukkan bahwa prognosis gangguan waham buruk. Pada beberapa pasien, pengobatan dapat dikurangi atau dihentikan tanpa efek buruk, sementara pada pasien lain waham kambuh dengan cepat setelah penghentian, dan pengobatan harus dipertahankan untuk waktu yang lama.",

      "title": "Moral Injury, Trance and Possession State or a Schizophrenic Illness. a Case report",
      "abstract": "Aims Moral Injury is a strong cognitive and emotional response occurring upon witnessing, participating in, or failing to prevent an act that goes against one's ethical code. This has been linked with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Depression, Suicidality, and Anxiety, amongst others. Data on its association with Schizophrenia are however lacking. Trance and Possession Disorders defined by the ICD-10 refers to a group of disorders involving temporary loss of both the sense of personal identity and full awareness of the surrounding with individuals acting in some cases as if taken over by another personality, spirit, deity, or force with reports of such states occurring in primary psychotic disorder. This case presentation describes a 22-year-old male whose first episode of schizophrenia was preceded by moral injury Methods A 22-year-old male Nigerian with a strong conservative Christian religious upbringing and a history of receiving a prophecy against having intercourse with women. He started showing symptoms of a mental illness a month after attaining coitarche with a lady. This presentation was characterized by irrelevant speech, intrusive flashbacks and unusual beliefs (excessive guilt, ill health). 7 months after, he was presented to the hospital with above symptoms and disorganized behavior characterized by beliefs of being possessed by four different people, shouting in different voice textures, throwing himself on the floor. We kept in view a diagnosis of schizophrenia and placed him on oral Olanzapine 5mg nocte following which he made significant improvement within 2 weeks with no memory of the event. Results Different factors can be considered in the aetiopathogenesis and presentation of symptoms in this patient. According to Williamson V. et. al; An Individual's experience of moral injury may lead to feelings of shame or guilt which was present in this patient (delusion of guilt). The pathogenic effect of culture and religion(e.g through prophecy against intercourse with women) may account for this illness. Moreso, pathoplastic and pathoreactive effects of culture could be said to have contributed significantly to the presentation of a psychotic disorder with trance and possession state as a reaction to moral injury. Conclusion Moral Injury, not previously considered to be associated with primary psychotic disorder may not only possibly precipitate a primary psychotic disorder but also show cultural/religious differences in phenomenology. Further studies are therefore required to explore these associations.",

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can develop following exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence, and includes symptoms across four clusters: intrusions (e.g., unwanted and intrusive memories or images), avoidance (e.g., avoidance of people, places, or things that serve as reminders of the trauma), alterations in cognitions or mood (e.g., anhedonia, numbness, exaggerated negative beliefs about oneself, others or the world), and arousal (e.g., hypervigilance, irritable/angry behavior). PTSD is associated with family and relational distress; social, educational, and occupational impairment; comorbid psychiatric and physical conditions; and high economic costs and medical utilization. Effective treatments include cognitive behavioral therapies (e.g., exposure-based therapies) and pharmacotherapy (e.g., paroxetine and sertraline).",

      "abstract": "Study of the life settings in which patients fall ill reveals that illness is commonly preceded by a period of psychological disturbance, during which the individual feels unable to cope. This has been designated the giving-up—given-up complex and has the following five psychologic characteristics: a feeling of giving up, experienced as helplessness or hopelessness; a depreciated image of the self; a sense of loss of gratification from relationships or roles in life; a feeling of disruption of the sense of continuity between past, present, and future; and a reactivation of memories of earlier periods of giving-up. It is proposed that this state reflects the temporary failure of mental coping mechanisms with a consequent activation of neurally regulated biological emergency patterns. Changes in body economy so evoked may alter the organism's capability to deal with concurrent pathogenic processes, permitting disease to develop. As such, the giving-up—given-up complex is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for disease development, merely a contributing factor.",

      "abstract": "Advances in neuroscience and pharmacology have led to improvements in the cognitive performance of people with neurological disease and other forms of cognitive decline. These same methods may also afford cognitive enhancement in people of otherwise normal cognitive abilities. 'Cosmetic', or supranormal, cognitive enhancement offers opportunities to enrich our social or financial status, our interactions with others, and the common wealth of our community. It is common to focus on the potential benefits of cognitive enhancement, while being less than clear about the possible drawbacks. Here I examine the harms or side-effects associated with a range of cognitive enhancement interventions. I propose a taxonomy of harms in cognitive enhancement, with harms classified as (neuro)biological, ethical, or societal. Biological harms are those that directly affect the person's biological functioning, such as when a drug affects a person's mood or autonomic function. Ethical harms are those that touch on issues such as fairness and cheating, or on erosion of autonomy and coercion. Societal harms are harms that affect whole populations, and which are normally the province of governments, such as the use of enhancement in military contexts. This taxonomy of harms will help to focus the debate around the use and regulation of cognitive enhancement. In particular it will help to clarify the appropriate network of stakeholders who should take an interest in each potential harm, and in minimising the impact of these harms.",

      "abstract": "Delicate diagnosis':avoiding harms in difficult, disputed, and desired diagnoses Life & TimesMedical diagnoses can be subject to ambiguity, flux, subjectivity, and inherent uncertainty.This is particularly true in primary care, where many reported symptoms do not conform to a clear diagnosis.Thresholds around normality are often unclear.Symptoms are commonly experienced and described as an 'iceberg'.Over a third of otherwise well people without a chronic condition have felt tired or run down, or had a headache in the previous 2 weeks, and over a quarter have had back or joint pain.Distinguishing conditions that would benefit from diagnosis and earlier intervention from those that are temporary, self-limiting, and prone to harmful medicalisation, remains challenging.While overdiagnosis is a diagnosis of a condition that, if unrecognised, would not cause symptoms or harm, contested diagnoses are symptoms given a diagnosis, but where the diagnosis, as an explanation for them, is controversial.Opponents consider contested diagnoses 'wrong' not because of an error in history taking, clinical examination, or interpretation of a test result (which would risk misdiagnosis), but because the diagnosis itself, for example, chronic Lyme disease or multiple chemical sensitivity, is invalid.Contested diagnosis is bordered by 'pseudoscience', for example, adrenal fatigue, leaky gut syndrome, and chronic candidiasis, which attempt to explain symptoms with 'science' that is demonstrably incorrect.Many contested diagnoses relate to symptoms that are not clear-cut, meaning that some people are given a diagnosis that does not confer benefit.Others are primarily unexplained 'yet'.For example, Gulf War syndrome was treated as a contested illness but is now recognised as caused by exposure to sarin gas.Other recognised conditions are prone to a variety of influences such that diagnosis risks causing harm, through a variable mixture of misdiagnosis, overdiagnosis, pseudoscience, or overtreatment.A framework for considering some conditions as 'delicate diagnoses' may help to recognise and reduce the harms of medicine in these circumstances.",

      "abstract": "Depression is often accompanied by a wide variety of somatic symptoms even when there is no evidence of any organic disorder that can cause such symptoms. Though the underlying mechanism still remains unclear, there are two assumptions explaining the associations between somatic symptoms and depression. One is that depression itself causes several somatic symptoms. That is, people with depression may express their mental conflicts in various somatic symptoms. This hypothesis could apply especially to those who have a vague feeling of stigma or prejudice against mental disorders, and who are reluctant to frankly express their mental symptoms. From another point of view, this might mean that some chronic somatic symptoms are magnified due to the person’s depressive state. Another possible hypothesis is that those who have had chronic somatic symptoms of unknown origin, in other words, functional somatic symptoms, are likely to be depressed since they cannot always receive effective medical treatment for such symptoms.",

The socio-professional factors are often much more influential than the physical factors. The overwhelming element of treatment is physical exercise.

When episodes of depersonalization are recurrent or persistent and lead to distress or dysfunction, the diagnosis of depersonalization disorder is made. Certain similarities in phenomenology, comorbidity, neurochemistry, and treatment response suggest a relationship to the obsessive-compulsive spectrum. However, depersonalization is a very poorly studied condition, and any conclusions must be viewed tentatively. Self-injurious behaviors are defined as intentionally self-inflicted bodily injuries without lethal intent. Basic categories are briefly described. Subsequently, the phenomenology and biology of both impulsive and compulsive self-injurious behaviors, and their relationship to the obsessive-compulsive spectrum, are discussed.",

      "abstract": "As a symptom state, nearly all humans have personal experience with the feeling of social anxiety. For most individuals, the feeling state is transitory, or limited to relatively circumscribed developmental periods. For others, social anxiety is a chronic condition resulting in significant functional impairment. Social anxiety disorder is defined in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) as a \"marked and persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others\" (1). In order to qualify for a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder, children must demonstrate capacity for age-appropriate social relationships. Pervasive developmental disorder must be considered as an alternative diagnosis for children who demonstrate deficits in social relatedness even with family members and others with whom they have extended contact. Further, diagnosis of social anxiety disorder requires that the child experience anxietyrelated symptoms in the presence of other children, not merely in interaction with adult authority figures. Reticence only in the presence of adults, while potentially disconcerting, falls within the normative scope of shyness and is not necessarily grounds for intervention.",

Although the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM–5) does not list malingering in its diagnostic section and therefore does not identify it as a formal mental disorder, malingering and verified mental illness commonly coexist. Some subtypes of feigning behaviors, such as partial or pure malingering, dissimulation, and false imputation, can be suspected when patients have marked discrepancies between reported stressors and objective findings. The article discusses these three theoretical concepts with their possible clinical aspects, illustrating each phenomenon by clinical case with self-reported and/or observed psychotic symptoms. We summarized relevant findings and provided a review of clinical considerations that physicians can use to aid in the evaluation of psychotic symptoms in the context of those three concepts.",

The individual who initially experiences these delusional thoughts is referred to as the primary case, while the subsequent transmission of these beliefs to another person designates them as the secondary case. Typically, this phenomenon arises within close interpersonal relationships, such as familial or intimate partnerships. The primary case is typically diagnosed with a psychotic disorder, while the secondary case, lacking any previous psychiatric history, develops similar delusions as a consequence of close contact with the primary case. It is important to note that the specific shared delusional beliefs can exhibit considerable variability, contingent upon the nature of the primary case's delusions and their influence on the secondary case. Common types of shared delusions encompass persecutory, grandiose, erotomanic, somatic, jealous, and religious misbeliefs. Moreover, it is imperative to recognize that the particular delusional content observed in cases of Folie à Deux can be subject to significant variation, potentially influenced by cultural, interpersonal, and environmental factors.",

For example, trauma is known to precipitate seizures, headache, or focal neurological deficits in previously asymptomatic individuals. Similarly, psychological stress seems to be a factor in the development of some peptic ulcers, anxiety disorders, and other psychiatric states. In addition, trauma and/or stress have been suspected to have links to many other medical disorders. It is perhaps not surprising, therefore, that both physical trauma and psychological stress have been posited to be causal factors in either the onset or exacerbation of multiple sclerosis (MS). Indeed, this notion has been a conspicuous part of the lore of this illness dating back to its earliest clinical descriptions.",

The term ‘atypical pain’ is most unsatisfactory, as it really means nothing to any observer except to the person who originally coined the phrase for pain which seemed to be an atypical variant of some other recognized condition.

      "abstract": "The word depression is being used to describe both a symptom and an illness.The symptom is the experience of gloom, despondency, sadness, grief; the feeling of being run down, dispirited, miserable, melancholic, in the dumps, or of being low.The richness of our language in synonyms for depression may be taken as an indication of its frequency.It is an emotional experience, though sometimes it is described as an empti- ness or flatness, seemingly a loss rather than a lowering of affect.Depression, like anxiety, is a universal experience, and we regard it as abnormal only if it appears without reason or if it seems excessive in its degree or duration in relation to the pro- vocation.Not surprisingly such a common feeling may be associated with any psychiatric syndrome; the depressive dis- orders are those in which the depressed affect appears to be the primary phenomenon or at any rate one of the more prominent of the clinical features.Broadly there are two depressive entities-endogenous depres- sion, which is a variant of manic-depressive illness, and neurotic depression.In practice the differentiation of these two condi- tions is often difficult, but this is not surprising when we recall that any primary psychiatric disturbance may be associated with secondary or reactive features, and of these depression is one of the more common.A convenient though over-simplified view that attempts to quantify this relationship suggests that in any individual case we can regard the patient a. showing say-to give an example-40% endogenous and 60% reactive or neurotic depression.If so, one should not forget that irre- spective of the magnitude of the figures it is the endogenous component that is important, for the remainder is a reaction to it.Successful treatment of the endogenous component is likely to lead to total recovery, whereas treatment directed only at the reactive component can hardly be more than partly successful.The term \" atypical depression \" has been applied to some of these cases.It is only in the last 10 or 15 years we have come to appre- ciate how common is depressive illness.Watts' estimated that in general practice one could expect that of every 1,000 patients 12 would present as revw cases each year.Older figures, largely hospital derived and therefore making little allowance for milder cases, suggest that the incidence of endogenous depression alone is 1% in males and 2% in females.It would be unwise to suggest that depressive illness has become more common in the last 10 years ; the much larger number of cases seen reflects the fact that we have learned to recognize its milder forms. Endogenous DepressionLet us take endogenous depression first.Though less common and less likely to be overlooked, the more severe cases will be described first.The onset is usually gradual, the patient often looks ill, his skin may be sallow and dry, the hair lustreless, and",

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder that is characterized by a disintegration of the process of thinking, of emotional responsiveness, and of contact with reality. Early in the twentieth century, schizophrenia was known as dementia praecox (premature dementia), because of the disintegration or fragmenting of mental functions typically observed in people with the disorder. The term schizophrenia itself means “fragmented mind,” referring to the schisms between thought, emotion, and behavior that characterize the disease. It is not the same as “split personality,” which is an altogether different illness now known as dissociative identity disorder. People with schizophrenia do not alternate between “good” and “bad” personalities.",

      "abstract": "Summary Depression is still underestimated, despite its high incidence, and its impact on subjective quality of life. To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Most health care professionals who diagnose and treat mental disorders use the diagnostic criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition–Text Revised ( DSM-IV-TR ), which uses a multiaxial system to ensure a comprehensive assessment and evaluation of the patient's presenting symptoms, general medical condition, psychosocial and environmental problems, and level of function. The five axes are mental disorders; personality and mental disorders; general medical conditions; psychosocial and environmental problems, and global assessment of functioning (GAF) scale. Psychosocial and environmental problems may affect diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of mental disorders; the problems or stressors can contribute to the development of a mental disorder or can be the result of a mental disorder. The multiaxial assessment process should result in the following; documentation of the primary and any secondary mental and behavioral disorders; definition of physical disorders that may be present and indication if they are related to or influence the mental and behavioral disorders; identification of environmental stressors that may affect, contribute to, complicate, or exacerbate the mental and behavioral disorder; and a rating of the person's psychological, social, and occupational functioning. A table shows the GAF scale (ratings by deciles from 1 to 100; higher numbers indicate fewer problems) and does not include impairments that result from physical or environmental limitations.",

      "title": "Medically unexplained symptoms",
      "abstract": "The term medically unexplained symptoms refers to physical symptoms for which there is either no or insufficient evidence of any underlying conventional disease/disorder process. There is a wide spectrum of severity ranging from essentially normal experience (e.g. an occasional headache) to symptoms which result in severe and long-standing disability. Where symptoms group together in clusters suggestive of a link to a particular bodily system, they have been termed functional somatic syndromes. The term somatoform disorders refers to a specific set of formal psychiatric diagnoses involving conditions which predominantly present with physical symptoms or a worry about physical disease. Only people at the more severe end of the medically unexplained symptoms spectrum meet criteria for one of the somatoform disorders and there is considerable dissatisfaction with the current psychiatric classification system for these conditions, which is discussed later in this chapter. Functional somatic syndromes By the time most people with medically unexplained symptoms are referred to a liaison psychiatrist, they are likely to have picked up a label of one or more of the functional somatic syndromes (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, fibromyalgia). Many different functional syndromes have been described over the past 30 years according to different symptom clusters (Table 6.1). There is considerable overlap in symptoms between different functional conditions and somatoform disorders, yet most of these syndromes are studied as if they are discrete conditions within particular medical specialties, with a focus on the specific set of somatic symptoms, which are specialty specific. There is still uncertainty as to the degree of overlap of these conditions and the relative common factors they may share. In one study, Fink et al (2007) studied 978 patients admitted to hospital from primary care and a medical and neurological department who scored highly on somatic screening measures. They found that patients complained of a median of five functional somatic symptoms (women six and men four). Principal component analysis identified three symptom groups explaining 37% of the variance: cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal. Further analysis showed that the symptom groups were not discrete and patients were likely to report symptoms from different groups, suggesting that the groups were different manifestations of a common latent phenomenon: bodily distress.",

      "abstract": "У статті розглядається питання необхідності дослідження особистісної саморегуляції в дітей із порушеннями інтелектуального розвитку. Ситуація в країні сприяє збільшенню травматичних стресів, які можуть мати серйозні наслідки для дітей із порушеннями психофізичного розвитку. Ці події порушують базове відчуття безпеки особистості дитини та можуть призвести до розвитку різних психічних проблем. Травматичний стрес може викликати травматичний стресовий синдром (ТСС) або посттравматичний стресовий розлад (ПТСР), які характеризуються різними симптомами, такими як повторні спогади про травматичну подію, проблеми зі сном, харчові розлади, депресія тощо. У дітей із порушеннями психофізичного розвитку ці симптоми можуть бути особливо вираженими та можуть потребувати специфічної та індивідуалізованої підтримки. Крім того, травматичні стреси можуть сприяти розвитку інших невротичних і психічних розладів, таких як тривожність, депресія, різноманітні фобії тощо. Ці розлади можуть значно ускладнити життя дитини й вимагати комплексного підходу до їх корекції та підтримки. Однією з важливих характеристик особистості дитини з порушенням інтелектуального розвитку є незрілість її емоційної сфери. Тому важливо вчасно виявляти та вирішувати проблеми, пов’язані з травматичним стресом, у дітей з порушеннями психофізичного розвитку. Саморегуляція вважається ключовою якістю особистості й важливим фактором гармонійних міжособистісних відносин у дітей із такими порушеннями як самих із собою, так і з оточуючим світом. Саморегуляція сприяє подоланню різноманітних перешкод, що заважають повноцінному включенню дитини в реальне життя, а також дозволяє розкрити її психологічний потенціал.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Dementia is characterized by an insidious and progressive loss of memory, disorientation, cognitive decline in other domains, and affective flattening. It is often accompanied by neuropsychological deficits such as aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or disturbances in executive functioning including planning, organizing, and sequencing of events in a logical fashion. Behavioural symptoms such as withdrawal, depression, delusions, motor restlessness, wander-ing, or aggression may complicate dementia, particularly in advanced stages of the disorder. These behavioural symptoms may occur, in part, secondary to loss of orientation and memory, with loss of autobiographic memory perhaps being most devastating. A patient, for example, who is impaired in retrieving past social interactions from autobiographical memory or recalling other relevant personal information may be more likely to respond with increasing irritability or anxiety in situations that are actually or perceived unfamiliar. Such a patient may perhaps choose a ‘safety first’ strategy or remain captured in indecisiveness, which could manifest in ruminating thinking and stereotyped behaviour, or displacement activities expressing motivational conflict and ambivalence. In any event, the combination of memory loss with other cognitive disturbances certainly leads to a profound deterioration of social competence. It is also noteworthy that, in addition to the problems the patients have themselves, which they generally deny except in the earliest stages of the disorder (anosognosia), dementia creates a substantial burden on patients’ spouses, children and other carers.",

It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma. Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

      "title": "Consanguinity and Mental Disorder",
      "abstract": "One difficulty which hinders the advance of psychiatry is that the facts of a mental disorder are not easy to describe and to record accurately. Many of the descriptive words used, such as “depression”, “confusion”, are taken from common speech and carry with them vague meanings. Out of sympathy with the sufferer, we tend to read our own emotions into the clinical picture. Moreover, because a disorder of thought and behaviour is a disorder of adaptation to living, the description of a mental disease involves not only the recording of the symptoms, but also a description of the circumstances and life-setting in which they occur. Another difficulty lies in the great variation in the clinical pictures of mental disorder. These vary so much that a diagnostic label such as affective psychosis or schizophrenia does not convey, and indeed is not intended to convey, an idea of a specific disease. These difficulties are somewhat more marked in the investigation of mental disorder in contrast to the investigation of mental defect. The statement that a patient is a Mongol or a cerebral diplegic conveys the idea of a fairly definite clinical syndrome, whereas a statement that a person suffers from schizophrenia calls up a much less clear mental picture. It seems that the only way out of this difficulty is to give a short statement of the clinical facts about each psychotic whom one discusses.",

      "abstract": "The problem of the determination of the degree of culpability of an individual who has committed an anti-social act is sometimes associated with great difficulties. A variety of factors may enter into the solution of this problem. An illegal act may be committed accidentally or unexpectedly and independently of the individual's will. It may be committed under an unavoidable necessity, such as in cases of protection of ones self or ones family. It may be committed under the influence of extreme passion or anger, when consciousness becomes blurred and cerebral inhibition is obliterated. It may be committed by insane individuals whose delusional ideas, accompanied or not by hallucinatory images, develop morbid impulses or deliberate and well planned criminal tendencies. Finally, illegal acts may be committed by individuals who, though not insane in the strict sense of the word, are nevertheless different from normal individuals by their power of reasoning, by their sentiments, tastes, sympathies, etc. To this class belongs the large category of psychopathic individuals, and also the mental defectives. The discussion of the underlying psychological moments of each of these groups of individuals is comprised in an extensive literature. We will be concerned exclusively with the medico-legal relation of the latter group alone. In order to ascertain the degree of legal responsibility of mental defectives, it is necessary first to emphasize the characteristic clinical features of mental deficiency. In considering all varieties of deviation from normal in the psychic sphere we find a long scale beginning with mental monstrosities and ending with slight mental feebleness. When the intellectual powers are involved in their entirety we deal with idiocy. When the arrest of mental development is only incomplete and is, therefore, compatible with the existence of some intellectual manifestations, we deal with imbecility. There are also individuals in whom only certain powers are likely to reach a degree of development; in whom there is no general, but only partial defect of intellectual powers. For example, one will show a meager power of intellectual acquisition, in another the power of judgment is defective; another is incapable of acquiring ele-",

      "abstract": "Patients presenting with bodily symptoms and complaints that are not sufficiently explained by organic pathology or well known pathophysiological mechanisms present a major challenge to any health delivery system. From a perspective of psychiatric classification these medically unexplained somatic symptoms may be diagnosed as primary psychiatric disorders such as depressive and anxiety disorders on the one hand, as somatoform disorders on the other. Among medical specialties a separate diagnostic approach is taken to conceptualize functional somatic syndromes. Unfortunately, both diagnostic systems do not conform to each other very well. The concept of somatoform disorders as outlined in DSM-III to DSM-IV-TR and in ICD-10 refers to a group of heterogeneous disorders with prominent somatic symptoms or special body-focussed anxieties, or convictions of illness. These disorders seem to indicate medical conditions that cannot, however, fully be explained either in terms of medical diagnostics or of other primary psychiatric disorders. There is one major conceptual assumption that postulates a decisive impact of psychosocial stress on the origin, onset and/or course of these somatic symptoms and complaints. And there is one major path of diagnostic steps to be taken, i.e. just to count the number of medically unexplained somatic symptoms, to determine their reference to any main organ system, to prove that they are not self-induced, to put special stress on prevailing pain symptoms and to separately assess dominant health anxieties or illness convictions. Since introduction of the diagnostic concept of somatoform disorders there have been arising many critical issues regarding the soundness of this diagnostic category. These issues, among other things, refer to a problematic mind-body dichotomy overemphasizing psychosocial and psychological factors and neglecting major neurobiological processes, to the impracticable criterion of “medically unexplained”, to the demand of conceptual clarity and coherence of this diagnostic category, to the rather trivial diagnostic procedure of just counting the number of medically unexplained somatic symptoms whereas not assessing typical dimensions of illness behaviour in a corresponding way, to the major overlap between subgroups of somatoform disorders on the one hand and factitious disorders, anxiety disorders and depressive disorders on the other, to a principal focus on the epidemiologically rare condition of somatisation disorder as core disorder thereby undervaluing much more prevalent subthreshold conditions, to the difficult communication of the whole diagnostic group to medical colleagues dealing with the same problems by using a different conceptual approach, however. These critical issues surrounding the concept of somatoform disorder will be reflected in respect of some major revisions projected in future diagnostic classification systems of DSM-V and ICD-11.",

It is a challenge for psychiatrists and other physicians to accurately diagnose and treat the patient.

The psychological need to have a physical complaint is the psychiatric disorder for this group of patients. At the other end of this physical–psychiatric continuum are patients, without obvious physical discomfort to suggest a medical condition, who may be misdiagnosed as having a psychiatric disorder because their presentation is atypical, or their complaints are primarily in the domain of how they feel or how they think. Physicians' understanding of the role of culture and cultural biases toward mental illness and of the physical components of mood and anxiety disorders results in a consideration of a psychiatric diagnosis. This process occurs even in the absence of the patient's complaint of psychological symptoms. Instances in which patients' physical complaints are parts of mood and anxiety disorders may cause diagnostic confusion for physicians who consider only medical diagnoses. When it comes to the diagnostic consideration of a psychiatric versus a medical condition we know that it is not either/or but it often is both.",

Concepts of health and illness are influenced by, among other things, physical, psychological, and social processes, and are dynamic and subject to change. Mental health problems arise from diverse sets of circumstances and from widely varying contexts. Often a problem can be detected through changes in a child’s emotional state (increasing anxiety or distress) or through changes in behaviour towards other people or property. Features of a problem that facilitate the assessment and understanding of what is happening include the intensity and seriousness of the problem, its frequency of occurrence, its duration over time, and its effects on the child and those close to the child. When mental health problems become severe, persistent, or associated with other problems, they may be referred to as a ‘disorder’. A mental disorder is, therefore, a mental health problem that has become severe or persistent, and seriously disrupts normal functioning.",

The diagnosis of child abuse is difficult to make, as there exist no pathognomic criteria of maltreatment, and denial is usual in the perpetrators when they are identified.",

They may be mainly physical, and the patient may present with one or more of a bewildering number of somatic complaints, often blaming those for his change in mood (Watts, 1957). Pain is a common and diagnostically puzzling presenting symptom of depression and other psychiatric disorders (Walters, 1961). It may take the form of generalized or poorly localized aches and pains, often associated with a feeling of tension, or it may be sharply delimited (Critchley, 1935). This form of localized pain may so dominate the symptomatology that the patient is referred by his general practitioner to a variety of specialists, who may perform a series of special investigations or even exploratory operations. Clearly, every effort must be made to exclude organic disease, even if positive signs of psychiatric illness are recognized, as an organic disease can obviously co-exist with a psychiatric one. In spite of thorough investigation, there will remain a proportion of patients in whom no lesion can be found to account for their symptoms.",

      "title": "Agenda for specialty section in addiction medicine",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Addictive behavior is any activity or behavior that has become the major focus of a person's life to the exclusion of other activities, or that has begun to harm the individual or others physically, mentally, or socially. Addictive behavior increases the risk of disease and/or associated personal and social problems. They are often experienced subjectively as \"loss of control\", that is, the behavior continues to occur despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use. Addiction implies psychological dependence, physical dependence, and a set of withdrawal symptoms if the substance is unavailable.[1] There are many common characteristics among the various addictive behaviors. First, the individual becomes obsessed (constantly thinks) of the object, activity, or substance and will seek it out, often to the detriment of work or interpersonal relationships. The person will compulsively engage in the activity even if he does not want to. Upon cessation of the activity, withdrawal symptoms of irritability, craving, and restlessness will often occur. The person does not appear to have control as to when, how long, or how much he will continue the behavior. He often denies problems resulting from his engagement in the behavior even though others can see the negative effects of it. Further, individuals with addictive behaviors will usually have low self esteem.[2] BURDEN OF PROBLEM Substance-related disorders have become matters of global concern because of impact on individual health, familial and social consequences, criminal and legal problems, and the effects on national productivity and economy. All the problems from use to dependence and from the most innocuous substance like tea/coffee to the most hard substances, contribute to the cost that the human society or a particular nation has to bear. In India, although alcohol use in ancient times and cannabis/affim (opium) in more recent times have been known and reported for some time, substance use problems have been recognized to have a significant importance as a public health problem only very recently. They are of particular concern among slum dwellers, transport workers, and youth.[3] Tobacco is the substance most easily accessible worldwide as well as in India. About one-fifth of the Indian population abuse tobacco, about 70% of this in the smoking form.[4] Passive smoking is a significant health hazard. There are 700,000 deaths per year due to smoking and 800,000–900,000 deaths per year due to all forms of tobacco use in India. Many of the deaths (>50%) are occurring below 70 years.[5] An estimated 34–42% of adult Indian population reports having used alcohol in their lifetime; 5–7% has been estimated to be abuser of alcohol; and 10–20 million persons have been estimated to be in need of treatment for dependence. A survey in India revealed that medical professionals had a higher rate of use and heavy use than general population.[5] Nearly 20–30% of admissions and consultations are due to alcohol-related problems in different healthcare settings but are under-recognized by primary care physicians.[6] With respect to heroin, India has now changed from being a transit country to a user country. General population surveys in India show opioid abuse rate as high as 24.8%. Another great concern especially with injectable opioids is spread of AIDS. Further, cannabis abuse in general population in India is 33% and abuse of tranquilizers is as high as 54%.[3] Remediation at central level: 'The Drug Deaddiction Program' was started in 1987–88 with the establishment of five deaddiction centers in central institutions, viz. AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi; Lady Harding Medical College and Hospital; New Delhi; JIPMER, Pondicherry; and PGI, Chandigarh. The center at NIMHANS, Bangalore was established later as the sixth center. More recently, in 1999, a separate deaddiction center with inpatient setup was started in Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is mainly involved in providing treatment services to the addicts, whereas the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with other aspects of the problem like awareness creation, counseling, and rehabilitation. From 1992–93, the scope of the scheme was enlarged to include assistance to State Governments/Union Territories for developing deaddiction centers in identified medical colleges/district-level hospitals. WHAT WORKS IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS? Treatment of substance-use disorders typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Techniques for medically assisted detoxification are widespread and effective. The following are the different strategies that are found useful in management of substance dependence.[7] i) Home versus inpatient detoxification Published reports have consistently failed to find any difference in outcome between long and short inpatient detoxification programs. Clients can usually complete home detoxification in 5–9 days. In ideal circumstances they are visited twice daily for the first three days and medication is supervised by a relative. Clients are breathalyzed and medication withheld if they have consumed significant amounts of alcohol. ii) Brief interventions Brief interventions are short, focused discussions (often of less than 15 minutes) that can reduce alcohol consumption in some individuals with hazardous drinking. They are designed to promote awareness of the negative effects of drinking and to motivate change. Brief interventions were shown to be moderately effective in the nontreatment-seeking groups, especially for those with less-severe alcohol problems. iii) Abstinence versus controlled use This is a great debate. The goal of controlled (moderate or nonproblem) drinking usually includes some limit on alcohol consumption (e.g., 4 units/day) provided that drinking does not lead to signs of dependence, intoxication, or social, legal and health problems. This runs contrary to the abstinence-based philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous. Controlled drinking may be an option for young, socially stable drinkers with short, less-severe drinking histories. An individual's belief that controlled drinking is an achievable goal is also a good prognostic factor. Most authors agree that controlled drinking should not be recommended for people with heavy dependence. Controlled drinking is an attractive option for public health strategies aimed at nondependent problem drinking. This principle can also be tried for other substances. iv) Alcoholic Anonymous Based on Minnesota model, they involve the recognition that alcoholism is a relapsing illness that requires complete abstinence. Clients acknowledge the problems due to their alcoholism and are encouraged to attend 90 meetings in 90 days. Participants may engage the support of a sponsor who is an AA member who has been sober for at least one year. Similarly, there is narcotic anonymous for opioid addicts and nicotine anonymous for nicotine dependents. The evidence suggests that this twelve-step approach is at least as effective as most structured psychotherapies but not superior to any alternative treatments. v) Psychological therapies Motivational enhancement therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy Social skills training Community reinforcement approach Social behavior and network therapy Contingency management Cue exposure vi) Therapeutic community It requires prolonged residence (often 12–18 months) and it is extremely expensive. Most studies of therapeutic communities are conducted without control groups and the lack of randomization probably leads to selection bias in favor of more motivated patients. vii) Drug treatments Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. Other drugs which have been used for the same are topiramate, citrated calcium carbimide, SSRIs, tiapiride, nalmefene, metronidazole, and ondansetron. The oldest among these is disulfiram, being used from 1950s. Naltrexone was launched in India in 1998 and acamprosate in 2002. However, none has been proved to be significantly better than the other agents. In other words, all are equally effective.[5] Bupropion has been said to be the first line drug for nicotine craving. Another first line agent is nicotine itself, in the form of gum, inhaler, lozenge, patch, and nasal spray. Clonidine and nortriptyline are said to be the second line drugs. But the success rate with each of these drugs is marginal.[8] Sustained release bupropion is also considered to be effective as anticraving agent in cannabis dependence. Nefazodone also significantly reduces cannabis withdrawal related anxiety and muscle pain, while having no effect on dysphoria. The embryonic work on CB1 selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists such as SR141716 (rimonabant) has demonstrated that it successfully blocks the acute psychological and physiological effects of smoked cannabis in experienced human consumers and is well tolerated. There has been even less work on the use of cannabis agonists. However, this is a promising area for future research as a number of oral and inhaled THC preparations are being developed for medical cannabis trials.[9] Maintenance treatment is increasingly emphasized as the main therapy of opioid dependency. Abstinence-oriented therapy is nevertheless an important alternative, mainly psychological, and has considerable advantages for those benefitting from this strategy. Methadone or buprenorphine in tapering doses are used for detoxification along with α2 adrenergic agonists like clonidine or lofexidine. Time-limited agonist therapy is a specific approach using agonist stabilization as the basis for therapeutic interventions preceding tapering off of the maintenance therapy. The preventive effect of naltrexone and other antagonists is well known but the attrition rate is very high. It is also feasible for addicts to be introduced to naltrexone by detoxification under anesthesia or sedation.[10] ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY As elaborated above, substance use is affecting a disproportionately large section of people of India. The prevalence is more than that of all severe mental disorders combined. When it comes to health problems, it should not be gauged merely by its prevalence, but by the health burden and social cost that it wreaks on the society. Psychiatric comorbidities like mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders are also very commonly associated with substance dependence. Thus drug addiction is a titanic problem that needs special clinical attention. Today we are equipped with an arena of treatment strategies, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. What we need is just an improvisation in its implementation. Treatment can be better systematized when addiction medicine is upgraded as a specialty. The specialty section on addiction medicine needs to fulfill the following aims and objectives.[6] Promote and advance the bio-psycho-social contributions to the science and practice of addiction medicine in all its different manifestations. Promote the improvement of the health of persons directly or indirectly impacted by substance-related problems. Promote prevention, control, treatment, and relief of all substance-related problems, as well as conditions which constitute high risk for potential drug-related problems. This involves encouraging and enabling the members of the society to explore and pursue 'evidence based' treatment strategies and prevention methods. This includes liaison with other stake holders, including but not limited to government agencies overseeing health, social justice and welfare, and finance and human development; nongovernmental agencies involved in direct care of persons with substance abuse. Promote other medical specialties and primary healthcare providers. This also requires sharing the expertise of members of the society and other professionals involved in diverse fields such as school mental health, community based rehabilitation, epidemiology, drug trials, maintaining disease registries, to mention a few. Actively engage in advocacy in order to influence policy making and legislation, keeping in mind that substance-use disorders and their consequences constitute a grave public health disorder which imposes an unacceptably severe burden on the health and well being of the people of India. Formulate and recommend standards of treatment and rehabilitation of persons or populations affected directly or indirectly by substance-use disorders. In addition, it will be necessary to obtain recommendations for syllabi and commission resources for the education and training of medical and nonmedical personnel involved in the field. Safeguard the interest of psychiatrists and fellow professionals engaged in the practice of addiction medicine in India. Promote research in the field of addiction science with a focus on translating the benefits of research to the bedside and propagate the use of evidence-based interventions in the daily delivery of mental healthcare. FUNCTIONING OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY SECTION The following are some of the activities that are being suggested as functions of specialty section of addiction medicine:[6] A web portal, linked to the web page of the Indian Psychiatric Society, which will initially host information of relevance to the practice of addiction medicine in India, with direct and indirect links to published or unpublished scientific papers, databases, treatment protocols, available treatment agencies, online resources, etc; and later e-learning sites for online education and training. Coordinating Continuing Medical Education (CME) pertaining to the aspect of the science and practice of addiction medicine, with special emphasis on underserved areas like the northeastern states, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc. Enabling and commissioning position papers on the impact of substance abuse in India, with a view to influence public policy. Engaging with relevant organizations to promote demand-reduction strategies, such as the police to prevent drinking and driving, primary health providers, and emergency rooms for early detection and brief intervention Pursuing the aim of working to safeguard vulnerable populations, for example, inoculating children and adolescents through skills training and sensitizing physicians and pharmacists to prevent over the counter drug abuse. Examining the possibility of creating a national registry, using standardized data-entry protocols. CONCLUSION Substance-use disorders form more than 20% of the case load of psychiatric practitioners. However, practitioners have an attitude of therapeutic nihilism toward the addicted patient. This may be due to various reasons like lack of education about alcohol and substance abuse, attitude of hostility or aversion toward alcoholics, inability or discomfort to deal with the associated psychosocial issues, and learned pessimism about treatment – especially based on experience treating late stage alcoholics. However for effective outcome, early identification and treatment should be the goal. This is possible with more sophistication in the science of addiction medicine. Thus, evolving of a specialty section of addiction medicine is the need of the day.",

Some are psychoform (e.g., one dissociative agent hearing another dissociative agent speak), others are somatoform, or sensory and motor (e.g., being analgesic while another dissociative agent is in pain). Somatoform and psychoform dissociative symptoms often occur together. Somatoform dissociative symptoms are characteristic of dissociative disorders and proportional to their complexity. The disorders include ICD-10's Dissociative Disorders of Movement and Sensation, inadequately renamed in ICD-11 Dissociative Neurological Symptom Disorder. Sensory and motor dissociative disorders are categorized in DSM-5 as Conversion Disorder. This is confusing, because the symptoms involve dissociation, not conversion of something mental into something physical. PTSD, which can be seen as a simple dissociative disorder, is associated with marked somatoform dissociation. Adverse events, particularly chronic interpersonal abuse and neglect, and the motivational conflicts this adversity typically implies, constitute an important causal factor of somatoform dissociation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Human consciousness, the awareness of oneself and one’s environment, is an artificial construction. In a normal state of consciousness, the brain seamlessly integrates sensory perceptions, emotional states, current thoughts, and past memories. The essential feature of the various dissociative disorders is that these elements have become disrupted, dissociated, from each other. The distinctions between the different types of dissociative disorders are based on which particular aspect of subjective experience has become dissociated from the others. Dissociative amnesia is characterized by dissociation of memory. The affected individual demonstrates an inability to recall important biographical information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature. The memory deficit is too extensive to be explained by ordinary forget-fulness. Dissociative fugue is characterized by an even greater dissociation of memory, such that the individual dissociates not only key historical information but also his own sense of identity. Affected individuals may engage in sudden, unexpected travel away from their homes or customary places of work, accompanied by an inability to recall their past, confusion about their personal identity, or the assumption of a new identity.",

Dissociation is often defined as partial or total disconnection between memories of the past, awareness of identity and of immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements, often resulting from traumatic experiences, intolerable problems, or disturbed relationships. Etiopatogenezis of dissociative disorders have not exactly known yet. The process of dissociation is independently associated with several distressing conditions such as psychiatric diagnoses, somatization, current psychological distress, and past sexual and physical victimization. The disturbance may have a sudden or gradual onset and may be temporary or chronic in its course. Dissociation has a negative impact on treatment oucome. Additionaly, dissociative patients may have an insecure attachment pattern negatively affecting the therapeutic relationship. Conceptually, the course of treatment is to improve coping, maintain reality, and establish normal integrative functions. Goals: 1. improve thought processes; 2. maintain a sense of reality; 3. improve coping skills; 4. develop stress management abilities; 5. increase identity integration. The treatment is possible with psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy or both. We will introduce the CBT approach. Participants will learn: • pharmacological possibilities in the treatment of dissociative disorders; • CBT model of dissociative disorders; • motivational interviewing with dissociative patient; • how to develope therapeutic relationship with dissociative patient; • conceptualization of dissociative disorder with the patient; • Socratic questioning; • working with cognitive, emotional and behavioral avoidance; • exposure technique with dissociative problems; • problem solving.

      "abstract": "The presence of physical symptoms that do not correlate with a disease process are often frustrating to healthcare professionals, are difficult to diagnose and may consume an inordinate proportion of healthcare resources. However, proper and complete physical and psychological assessment and treatment is becoming increasingly possible and essential. Physical illness may occur concomitantly and sometimes as a result of psychological distress, which has displayed itself in a diagnosed mental illness. In other cases physical symptoms may be caused by unconscious dynamics, and the process becomes the primary presenting mental concern. In other cases the physical illness is part of a conscious process and motivated by the hope of gain. Differentiation between physical symptoms of unconscious and conscious origin is important in selecting the correct response. A manager must first of all be alert for physical symptoms that appear to be consciously motivated, as in a disorder called \"malingering.\" The essential feature of malingering is the intentional production of false or grossly exaggerated physical or psychological symptoms, motivated by external incentives such as avoiding work or obtaining financial compensation. Managers may inadvertently encourage malingering in the workplace by inappropriate responses to employees who present a physical complaint that is consciously motivated for gain. When the manager can recognize this phenomenon as malingering, appropriate managerial intervention can cause this behavior to be controlled and even eliminated and thus enhance productivity.",

      "title": "A Case of Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder",
      "abstract": "Aims: Background: Depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR), classified under ICD–11 code 6B66, involves persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Depersonalization refers to a sense of detachment from one’s thoughts, emotions, or body, whereas derealization involves perceiving the external world as unreal or distorted. These symptoms cause significant distress or impairment, are not attributable to other mental disorders, substance use, or medical conditions, and occur while reality testing remains intact. Methods: Case Report. An 18-year-old female A-level student presented with a two-year history of frequent episodes in which her surroundings, including people and familiar environments, felt unreal. These episodes varied in duration and were highly distressing, particularly during emotional extremes such as heightened happiness or stress. Symptoms were most pronounced in the evenings or when she was unoccupied, leading to emotional breakdowns. Despite these experiences, she remained aware of her own reality, with disturbances centred on external perceptions. Her symptoms began following a nine-month psychiatric hospitalization. Prior to admission, she experienced unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, and in the absence of an identifiable physical cause, she was diagnosed with conversion disorder. The hospitalization was distressing due to frequent invasive procedures, a perceived sense of blame for her condition, and feelings of entrapment. She subsequently developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of medical settings. However, DPDR symptoms persisted outside of PTSD-related re-experiencing episodes, causing ongoing distress and impairment. Results: Discussion: This case highlights the complex interplay between DPDR and PTSD, particularly following medical trauma. While dissociative symptoms frequently occur in PTSD, ICD–11 differentiates DPDR as a distinct disorder when symptoms persist beyond re-experiencing episodes. In this case, the patient’s prolonged hospitalization, combined with perceived invalidation and invasive interventions, likely contributed to the development of DPDR as a maladaptive dissociative response. The exacerbation of symptoms during emotional extremes aligns with research indicating that dissociation may function as an affect regulation mechanism. Trauma-related dissociation has been linked to disruptions in emotional processing, potentially interfering with adaptive coping strategies. This underscores the importance of targeted psychological interventions to reduce distress and improve functional outcomes. Conclusion: A trauma-informed, multidisciplinary approach is essential in managing this patient’s complex presentation. Psychological interventions such as EMDR or trauma-focused CBT should be integrated with ongoing medical care to address both dissociative symptoms and physical health concerns. Collaborative management between psychiatric and medical teams will be crucial in promoting long-term recovery, enhancing her psychological resilience, and improving overall quality of life.",

The diagnosis is a delusional disorder where the patient experiences a fixed, false belief that they have an infection with a parasite, worms, mites, bacteria, fungus other types of living organisms. Patients are resistant and difficult to reason with to alter their thinking about their belief in the delusion. The initial literature to describe the disease appeared in 1948. There are two forms of delusions of parasitosis: primary and secondary. The primary form of the illness is a psychiatric disorder where the delusions of parasitic infection are the only symptom present. The secondary variety is when the delusions of parasitosis occur alongside another psychiatric disorder such as schizophrenia or secondary to drug abuse or medical illness.",

It would be absurd to contend that such harm is somehow intrinsically less serious than physical injury; indeed, over many years, medical research has pointed to the artificiality of characterising it as lacking physical manifestations. Its destructive potential is brought into sharper focus as mental attributes become ever more integral to everyday functioning. Yet, to this day, neither popular nor judicial opinion is noticeably receptive to a cause of action based on proof of a “recognised psychiatric disorder”, which is still often trivialised by the label “nervous shock”. This negative attitude is most apparent when claimants are not, or are not regarded as, the direct victims of someone else's conduct. The very notion of compensating people whose suffering derives from their reaction to the injuring of others often evokes surprise, indignation and disdain.",

We know pain exists, but we may be unable to find its cause. If we do find the cause, there may be no correlation between the extent of disease and the degree of patient suffering. A condition that causes excruciating pain in one person may be completely tolerable to another. Even if the cause is removed, suffering may continue. Pain is entirely subjective, but we know it exists when we see the distressed patient. We cannot see the pain, but we recognize its presence in facial expression, verbal description, body language, and objective clinical signs (eg, pallor, rapid pulse, sweating, and others).

      "abstract": "Abstract The symptoms of depression include persistent low mood, feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, and anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure. Mood is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic, social, environmental, and other factors, such as substance abuse. Depression is further characterized by dysfunctional attitudes and negative automatic thoughts or ruminations. Psychiatric diagnostic criteria distinguish patients who experience only depressive episodes (unipolar depression or major depressive disorder, MDD) from patients who experience depressive episodes but also manic ones (bipolar disorder, BD). The symptoms of mania, on the other hand, include euphoria, over-activity, distractibility, socially inappropriate behaviour, increased appetite, and impaired insight. Thus, the emotional states of patients with depression and mania can be considered to represent two polar extremes on a mood spectrum. The states manifested in depression and mania are pathological in that they are extreme, disrupt quality of life, and are persistent and often recurrent. This chapter examines not only depression in MDD, but contrasts it with the, at times similar but at times diametrically opposed, symptoms of other disorders, such as BD, to achieve better insight. It also examines resilience in healthy individuals, i.e., how can mood remain normal despite factors such as adverse life events. Research on resilience has focused on determining the protective factors that allow some individuals to have more positive outcomes, despite being exposed to a variety of stressors.",

      "abstract": "Neglect of a person at any age is a global complex social problem which can lead to grave medical consequences. It has been present throughout human evolution and manifests variably in different culture and countries. Neglect is not a simple outcome of the breach of caregiver or care provider and care receiver equation. There is overlap in definitions of neglect, abuse and maltreatment. The terms are often used interchangeably. The practitioner should be aware of local definitions and the context in which they are used. The clinical or pathologic assessment of neglect in any setting may be considered incomplete unless it also makes some reference and identifies the causes perceived to contribute to it. Neglect is frequently associated with vulnerabilities such as poor physical and mental health or intellectual (learning) disability. It may also be associated with social status and related to criminal activity, such as trafficking and modern-day slavery. Where pre-existing disease or illness are present, neglect may contribute to a fatal outcome by exacerbating those conditions. The victims of neglect commonly encountered in healthcare settings generally represent extremes of age. They may present with acute traumatic condition or exacerbation of a long-standing illness or complications of trauma. A thorough clinical or pathologic assessment of such patients must be supplemented by a careful analysis of circumstances. As \"neglect\" can apply to all sectors of modern society, solutions for it require the concern and cooperation of communities and professions such as policy making, education, health, law, economics and social work, all of which have the primary responsibility for reporting, assessing and making decisions to maintain appropriate standards of life.",

      "abstract": "A drug can be defined as a substance other than food which may affect the constitution or function of a living thing through its chemical properties. In this sense, it may be possible to place organic solvents like bond, gas or thinner and narcotics like marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine or heroine under the category of drugs. These drugs are characteristic of having positive medicinal as well as side effects upon human being including but not limited to excitement, hallucinatory image, auditory hallucination, relaxation, sleeping, anorexia, nerve stability, schizophrenia, anaesthesia, brain damage, narcissism, etc. Abuse of drugs, however, would result in direct and indirect impact upon the society, family and industry as a whole by ruining of families, unemployment, loss of manpower, and catastrophic damage of physical and mental health of all people. Strong cling to drugs could also cause devastation of personality by abandoning relationship with family members and friends and even jobs, hobbies and culture and would eventually make addicts unsociable. Furthermore, abuse of drugs could be a cause for more serious phenomenon of social pathology such as drastic increase of inhuman violent crimes, crimes without specific motives, frequent burglary and theft to raise the money to buy drugs with. In contrast with the global trend to enforce the regulations for drug-related crimes, the Korean judiciary authorities keep on dealing leniently with offenders, especially when they are first timers, by only charging the fine not exceeding 50 million Won. To put use of drugs under control, it seems more effective to install and operate facilities which are dedicated to providing supports for drug addicts to get free from the cycle of crimes and return to the society. In sum, it would be extremely important to study the measures needed to prevent occurrence of drug-related crimes because the issue of addiction can not　rely on legal punishments alone. The legal system that imposes heavy penalty upon drug-related crimes may be effective to a certain extent in terms of crime prevention but has limit in itself. It is therefore most imperative to respond in a more active way to prevention of drug-related crimes by introducing the educational programs for drug addiction, by training experts who can treat drug addicts, not to speak of working out preventive measures from the perspective of criminal legislation and socio-cultural aspects as well.",

Crucially, there is no explanatory physical cause that can be demonstrated. The man or woman so afflicted reports that they cannot raise their arm, or cannot see; yet physical investigations prove negative and, when sedated or observed unobtrusively over time, symptomatic inconsistencies arise. However, despite these, the diagnostic systems applied are quite specific that the patient experiencing and exhibiting such symptoms and signs is not responsible for their production, i.e. they are not ‘feigning’. Hence, the physician is called upon to judge what the patient is thinking and not doing, i.e. to perceive that they are really trying to move or see and are not pretending to be impaired. This is a complex task and the use of language in this area suggests considerable uncertainty among physicians as to what it is they are diagnosing.",

Within ICD 10, SAD is in the group of disorders that occur only in childhood but the proposition of ICD 11 classifies SAD as a part of anxiety disorders, similarly to DSM 5. Although there are studies of the prevalence and most significant psychopathological phenomena that characterize SAD, there is still a distinctive lack of knowledge about this disorder like: its prevalence in the general and clinical population, its relation with other psychiatric disorders, or what is an effective therapeutic approaches to treating adults with this disorder. Some outstanding questions remain and there are no clear answers so far regarding the differentiation of \"normality\" and pathology related to the SAD, like: (1) is a strong relationship between family members the consequence of specific cultural and social patterns or a pathological pattern that indicates SAD?, or (2) are the pain and suffering resulting from separation from loved ones after wars, natural or other disasters \"normal\"/common/expected or are they psychopathological manifestations of SAD?, etc. In order to clearly identify SAD as an unambiguous psychopathological category, it is necessary to answer these questions in detail.",

As the experts 7 certified specialists (psychiatrists, psychologists and others) were involved.

Mainly non-specific phenomenon - persecutory delusions. Thus were obtained 14 estimates for each item on a 100-point scale. Dispersion of majority ranges was too high to get significant differences. But 6 from 7 experts significantly (p<0.05) and 1 tendentionally (p<0.01) rated 3 symptoms (autism, conversion and paralogia) as relatively more complex as compared with 7 more simplex phenomena (anxiety, confusion, euphoria, excitement, neurasthenia, phobia and sadness) by U-Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney criteria. established ranges of psychopathological phenomena's complexity reveal non-linear relations to etiology but in some cases they can be useful instrument of differential diagnostics of mental disorders.",

A number of clinical syndromes are described and their differential diagnosis considered. The clinical picture will usually change as the child grows older. Laboratory investigations including EEG. are not helpful. At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal. Certainty about individual identity and what lies outside and inside the ego is essential for normal relationships. Awareness of the changing clinical features of childhood schizophrenia and careful examination for basic problems in identity and distinction of internal and external reality will help in arriving at a diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Neglect is the failure to report, respond, or orient to novel or meaningful stimuli presented to the side opposite a brain lesion, when this failure cannot be attributed to either sensory or motor defects (Heilman, 1979). Neglect may be spatial or personal. Spatial neglect may occur in three reference frames: body centered, environmentally centered, and object centered. One may be inattentive to stimuli in space or on the person (attentional or sensory neglect) and one may fail to act in a portion of space, in a spatial direction, or to use a portion of one’s body (intentional or motor neglect). Many specific disorders have been described, distinguished by their presumed underlying mechanisms, the distribution of the abnormal behavior, and the means of eliciting the behavior. Different behavioral manifestations may occur at different times, and in some patients certain manifestations are never seen. The major behavioral manifestations that we will discuss in this chapter include (1) inattention or sensory neglect, (2) extinction to simultaneous stimuli, (3) motor neglect, (4) spatial neglect, (5) personal neglect, (6) allesthesia and allokinesia, and (7) anosognosia (unawareness of illness). The first section of this chapter will define specific disorders and describe clinical tests that may be used to assess them.",

The incapacity of a\nperson can only be declared by court order, where its (total or partial) scope has to\nbe established, on a reviewable basis, since it has no res judicata effi cacy, as the incapable\ndependent�s physical or mental conditions may vary. There could also be cases of\ninvoluntary internment in the event of the consumption of toxic substances giving rise\nto a mental disorder, which requires prior judicial authorization, except in the event of\ninvolving emergency situations.

Other aspects of personality are best understood as traits, rather than “disorders,” or as symptomatic changes that are acute and occur lower in the hierarchy of diagnosis than mood or psychotic states, and are caused by the latter. The common report of purported comorbidity is seen as an overestimation, with personality changes often being part of other conditions.

The interaction of pharmacological agents with certain affects or emotions may be synergistic or antagonistic. 3. A patient reacts to his disease, to his treatment, and to his physician with manifest psychological, cultural, and—for want of a better term—physiological regression. Where the regression is not manifest there are obvious pathological efforts of the patient to obscure it. 4. By means of iatrogenically induced regression it is possible to bring about new affects or mood states. 5. The bodily functions which are psycho-physiologically excited or inhibited by the regression or the defenses against it either increase or oppose the pathophysiology of the disease.",

The site of noncerebral trauma has been described by the Abbreviated Injury Scale as head or neck, face, chest, abdomen or pelvic contents, extremities or pelvic girdle, external. Neurobehavioral and adaptive dysfunctions after an accident are diverse and complex. There are characteristic sensorimotor and cognitive symptoms, for example, dizziness, visual and balance symptoms.

As the pathology becomes more and more complicated, the psychosocial stresses, mood disturbance, and physiological dysfunction become more significant. Thus, the pathology falls into a vicious circle. Patients with FSS have common problems or characteristics, and have several overlapped diagnoses.

      "title": "What Is Personality Disorder?",
      "abstract": "What Is Personality Disorder? Hanna Pickard (bio) The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 689) defines personality disorder (PD) as: A. An enduring pattern of experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of an individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas: 1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events); 2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response); 3. Interpersonal functioning; and 4. Impulse control. B. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations. C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood. E. The enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder. F. The enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., head trauma). Unlike schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other Axis I conditions, PD is not conventionally understood as an illness or disease. Rather, as the name implies, it is a disorder of the personality: an ‘enduring pattern of experience and behavior.’ Metaphorically speaking, it is a condition that is internal to the kind of person someone is, a part of who they are. It is not an external condition that befalls them. Very roughly, personality is the set of characteristics or traits that make us the kind of person we are: the ways we are inclined to think, feel, and act in response to particular circumstances, as well as more generally. All of us have one. PD occurs when the set of characteristics or traits that make a person the kind of person they are causes severe psychological distress and impairment in social, occupational, or other important contexts: the ways a person is inclined to think, feel, and act do them harm, directly or via the effects they have on relationships, work, and life more generally conceived. Diagnosis of a PD requires that these characteristics or traits be long-standing, pervasive, difficult to control or change, and markedly different from cultural expectations. Equally, the distress and impairment caused must be sufficiently extreme to warrant clinical attention: the person needs clinical care and help. Nonetheless, all of us possess characteristics or traits that sometimes incline us to think, feel, and act in ways that cause us distress and adversely affect our social, occupational, or other functioning. PD lies on a continuum with normal human personality. The broad category of PD is currently divided into three subcategories or ‘clusters.’ Cluster A comprises paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal PD. These are more colloquially known as the odd [End Page 181] and eccentric or ‘mad’ PDs. Cluster B comprises narcissistic, borderline, histrionic, and antisocial PD. These are more colloquially known as the dramatic, emotional, and erratic or ‘bad’ PDs. Cluster C comprises obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, and dependent PD. These are more colloquially known as the anxious and fearful or ‘sad’ PDs. A person cannot be diagnosed with any particular PD unless there is clinically significant distress and impairment. But, given that this condition is met, which kind of PD they have depends on what kind of personality they have–on the nature of the problematic pattern of experience and behavior. Stepping back and considering the wider context, the picture painted of PD is bleak. PD is associated with genetic factors (Jang and Vernon 2001) and also environmental conditions (Paris 2001). These include dysfunctional families, where there is breakdown, death, institutional care, and parental psychopathology; traumatic childhood experiences, with high levels of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse or neglect; and social stressors, such as war, poverty, and migration. There are high levels of comorbidity among PDs, and between PDs and psychotic disorders, eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse (Moran 2002). Finally, there is also a strong association between PD and violence and crime, self-harm, and suicide (Moran 2002). As this picture...",

      "abstract": "If an hysterical patient went to a physician in the late nineteenth century, chances were the diagnostic focus would be on the somatic symptomatology.The patient exhibiting hysterical blindness or paralysis was treated by an ophthalmologist or neurologist, who looked for pathological evidence of disease, deterioration, or damage.These procedures signaled a triumph over an earlier view that perceived hysteria as a largely female complaint in which a woman's uterus detached itself and floated about throughout her body.l With the work of Charcot, Janet, and especially Freud, hysteria came to be appreciated as an anxiety reaction whose pathological locus was emotional, not physiological, and was therefore not restricted to women.Today popular wisdom recognizes that certain cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal, and neurological symptoms originate with severe psychological stress.Nevertheless, the attraction persists for accepting the manifest sign or symptom as the most accurate measure of mental and physical health.There is an obvious need to grapple with manifest behavior.But in some instances the more accurate interpretation of behavior is to be found in latent material.The word \"hysteria\" in ordinary usage denotes the loss of self-control and a diminished if not total incapacity for rational and logical thinking.Hysterical individuals therefore represent chaos, disorder, and a loss of reality testing.Yet the hysterical individual may also represent a complicated organization in which the overt symptoms of emotional collapse serve to conceal personality deficits and conflicts.Where the outward impression presented by the hysterical individual may seem disorderly, it may also signify a series of psychologically defensive maneuvers designed to maintain a distorted but nevertheless cohesive internal sense of order.In history the crowd has often been likened to the hysterical individual.In his celebrated nineteenth-century study, Gustave Le Bon included the following in his convictions about crowd behavior: \"It will be remarked that among the special characteristics of crowds there Mazon_3241.",

The presentations of substance-induced dissociative states may resemble those of functional dissociative disorders, or organic and psychogenic dissociative factors may coexist and be intertwined or indistinguishable. Organic dissociative states are distinct from intoxication, amnestic disorder, frank delirium, or other organic mental disorders as specified in DSM-III and DSM-III-R, yet these diagnostic manuals have no inclusive category or coherent nosological approach to dissociative states not strictly psychogenic in etiology. Substance-induced and other organic dissociative disorders can have clinical, medicolegal, and neuropsychological significance.

They have higher rates of medical and psychiatric comorbidity when compared to the general population and face considerable healthcare disparity. Challenging behavior such as physical or verbal aggression is the most common reason why this population interfaces with the mental healthcare system. Understanding and correctly diagnosing the underlying etiology of challenging behaviors requires comprehensive evaluations along with awareness of the key variables that contribute to the occurrence of these behaviors. The differential diagnosis of challenging behavior is wide and includes mental illness, medical illness, pain, side effects from medications, behavioral phenotype of underlying syndrome, behavioral/functional, deficit of skills, and/or developmentally appropriate behavior. This review contains 1 figure, 6 tables and 83 references Key words: behavioral phenotype, challenging behaviors, etiology, intellectual disability, mental retardation, mental illness, psychiatric disorders",

There may be injuries including bruising and fractures, signs of dehydration and malnutrition, presence of decubitus ulcers, poor hygiene in the context of unsanitary living conditions. Underlying psychiatric conditions affecting decision making capacity may be implicated. Normal aging process of organ systems and increased geriatric comorbidities render them vulnerable to accidental injuries and delayed management of treatable medical conditions in an isolated home environment. During medicolegal investigation, it is essential to identify features that differentiate from genuine elder maltreatment. Diogenes Syndrome is an extreme form of fatal self-neglect for individuals in social isolation with hoarding of rubbish or household items. This presents considerable forensic difficulties because of the mysterious circumstances, a lack of medical history, suspicious findings on the body including purging of putrefactive fluids and injuries following falls or post-mortem animal predation in a chaotic scene.",

The diagnosis is made on the history of a traumatic event which the patient perceives as a loss, rather than on symptoms alone. Diagnosis is important because the bodily symptoms are commonly used as a reason for coming to the doctor, because care of the patient demands recognition of all aspects of his illness, and because rational treatment depends on it. Treatment involves several roles of the doctor and his explicit or implicit use of some psychotherapeutic techniques in his medical practice. Four case histories illustrate these principles.",

When sufficiently intense and prolonged, the extreme physiological arousal pattern to stimulation that comprises emotional behavior produces pathological changes in physiological functioning and anatomic structure, which are psychophysiological and psychosomatic disorders. New stimuli may become associated with established autonomic reaction patterns that are emotional behavior; also particular autonomic reactions may be strengthened through differential reinforcement. Thus, emotional stimuli and emotional response patterns may be learned. When the emotional reaction patterns are sufficiently frequent or prolonged and sufficiently intense in the person socially prepared to react and physically predisposed (i.e., vulnerable via genetically determined or later acquired biological weakness), changes of such magnitude may occur in physiological functioning or anatomical structure as to be incompatible with continued life. Voodoo death corresponds to that formulation of psychosomatic death.",

Whether \"idiopathic\" or \"essential\" or \"cryptogenic\" epilepsy is a symptom, a symptom-complex or a disease entity is of little consequence. Those workers who would argue this point invariably introduce some special designation for the syndrome which is usually understood to be a disease entity.<sup>1</sup>My definition follows: Idiopathic epilepsy is a chronic, usually progressive, inherited disorder of the brain, characterized by periodically recurring convulsions (major seizures), lapses (minor seizures, petit mal or petit mal variant attacks) or behavior disturbances (psychomotor episodes) which occur in a person with no other demonstrable, relevant neurologic disease and with no recognized pathologic lesion except the cerebral dysrhythmia elicited by means of the electroencephalograph. The attacks are usually precipitated by some sort of metabolic disturbance,",

Mental illness commonly presents with deficiencies in reasoning, perception, and functioning, facets that have the propensity to cause maladaptive behavior patterns that lead to criminal, delinquent, or abnormal behavior.

      "title": "What attitude towards a patient with somatoform disorder?",
      "abstract": "The diagnosis of a somatic symptom disorder must be based on both a negative approach - eliminating another psychiatric or non-psychiatric disorder that would better explain the symptoms - and a positive one, which is, based on the search for characteristic thoughts, emotions or behaviours as well as biological or psychological factors that may promote, trigger or sustain the disorder. Additional tests and specialized medical consultations should not be prescribed solely to reassure the patient; they may actually worsen the condition. The management will move away from the outdated notion of \"medically unexplained symptoms\" to rely on: the acknowledgment of the painful, debilitating and involuntary nature of the symptoms; the proposal of a positive diagnosis acceptable by the patient and an explanatory model compatible with his or her representations, aimed at putting an end to dysfunctional health care utilization; the proposal of therapeutic objectives aimed at functional rather than symptomatic recovery; the negotiation of pharmacological (selective or mixed serotonin reuptake inhibitor if necessary) and non-pharmacological interventions, especially when it comes to limiting the factors that sustain the disorder; the coordination of the various healthcare professionals.Le diagnostic de trouble somatoforme doit reposer sur une démarche tout autant négative – éliminer un autre trouble psychiatrique ou non psychiatrique qui expliquerait mieux les symptômes – que positive, c’est-à-dire fondée sur la recherche de pensées, d’émotions ou de comportements caractéristiques et de facteurs biologiques ou psychologiques pouvant favoriser, déclencher ou pérenniser le trouble. Examens complémentaires et avis médicaux spécialisés ne doivent pas avoir pour seul but de rassurer le patient ; ils peuvent en effet s’avérer iatrogènes. La prise en charge doit se détourner de la notion désuète de « symptômes médicalement inexpliqués » pour s’appuyer sur : la reconnaissance du caractère pénible, invalidant et non volontaire des symptômes ; la proposition d’un diagnostic positif acceptable et d’un modèle explicatif compatible avec les représentations du patient, visant à mettre un terme à l’errance diagnostique ; la proposition d’objectifs thérapeutiques visant un rétablissement fonctionnel plus que symptomatique ; la négociation des moyens pharmacologiques (inhibiteur sélectif ou mixte de recapture de la sérotonine si nécessaire) et non pharmacologiques, en particulier la lutte contre les facteurs d’entretien du trouble ; la coordination des soins entre les divers intervenants",

Als solcher wird Rückenschmerz definiert, der ohne identifizierbare anatomische und/oder neurophysiologische Faktoren auftritt. Davon abzugrenzen sind Rückenschmerzen bei Irritationen der Nervenwurzeln und anderen spinalen neurologischen Prozessen wie beispielsweise Tumorleiden oder entzündliche Prozesse. Als spezifische Rückenschmerzursachen können Faktoren identifiziert werden, wie Bandscheibenherniation, Spondylolisthesis, Spinalstenosen, Instabilität der Wirbelsäule, Wirbelfrakturen, Wirbeltumore, Infektionen oder entzündliche Erkrankungen. Patienten mit einer neurologisch identifizierbaren Lumboischialgie mit klarer radikulärer Ausbreitung gehören zur Gruppe der Patienten mit spezifischen Rückenschmerzen. Gemäß aktueller epidemiologischer Daten sind jedoch nur maximal 150/0 der Patienten mit Rückenschmerzen in diese bekannten spezifischen Ursachengruppen einzuordnen, der übergroße Teil von rund 850/0 der Rückenschmerzpatienten leidet an unspezifischen Rückenschmerzen.",

      "title": "Depresija kao javnozdravstveni problem",
      "abstract": "Depression is a disease, a mood disorder which influences emotions, cognitive function and actions of an individual. It is the 4th leading health problem worldwide. More than 350 million people in the world suffer from depression. Depression causes persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest, possibly leading to numerous emotional problems and to deterioration of physical health. The most common symptoms of depression are feelings of grief or a depressive state, outbursts of anger over minor issues, a loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities or an inability to experience pleasure from them, changes in appetite – weight loss or weight gain, sleeping disorders – insomnia or hypersomnia, lack of energy or an increased feeling of fatigue, aimless actions or sluggish movements and speech, a feeling of worthlessness or a misplaced feeling of guilt, problems reasoning or focusing properly, thoughts of death or suicide, physical pain without a clear cause. It is a known fact that it is normal to feel depressed sometimes. However, it is very important to recognize these feelings in due time. Depression is a serious public health issue because of its high morbidity and mortality rates. Fifteen percent of individuals suffering from depression commit suicide. It is important for affected individuals to seek help from a health care professional in order to rule out different causes of depression, establish an accurate differential diagnosis and provide safe and efficient treatment.\r\n The aim of this study was to establish to what extent the participants are familiar with symptoms of depression and to see to what extent they perceive them in their own emotional experience. The study population consisted of 242 individuals, 179 (74%) female and 63 (26%) male. At the completion of the study we concluded that the majority of participants are familiar with depression as a disease. One third of participants (32%) experienced symptoms of depression at some point of their life. Worldwide statistical data show that the percentage of individuals suffering from depression in the Republic of Croatia is 5,1% for men and 6,2% for women. It is quite clear that this percentage is substantially higher among individuals who participated in the study poll. Numerous studies have shown that depression is a disease with an increasing incidence rate. It is expected that depression will become the second most frequent disease in the coming years.",

K EY W ORDSMisophonia,Emotion,Misophonia Activation Scale,Trigger Level Response 0 Person with misophonia hears a known trigger sound but feels no discomfort.1 Person with misophonia is aware of the presence of a known trigger person but feels no, or minimal, anticipatory anxiety. 2 Known trigger sound elicits minimal psychic discomfort, irritation or annoyance.No symptoms of panic or fight or flight response.3 Person with misophonia feels increasing levels of psychic discomfort but does not engage in any physical response.Sufferer may be hyper-vigilant to audio-visual stimuli.4 Person with misophonia engages in a minimal physical response -nonconfrontational coping behaviors, such as asking the trigger person to stop making the noise, discreetly covering one ear, or by calmly moving away from the noise.No panic or fight or flight symptoms exhibited.5 Person with misophonia adopts more confrontational coping mechanisms, such as overtly covering their ears, mimicking the trigger person, engaging in other echolalias, or displaying overt irritation.6Person with misophonia experiences substantial psychic discomfort.Symptoms of panic, and a fight or flight response, begin to engage.7Person with misophonia experiences substantial psychic discomfort.Increasing use (louder, more frequent) use of confrontational coping mechanisms.There may be unwanted sexual arousal.Sufferer may re-imagine the trigger sound and visual cues over and over again, sometimes for weeks, months or even years after the event.8Person with misophonia experiences substantial psychic discomfort.Some violence ideation.9Panic/rage reaction in full swing.Conscious decision not to use violence on trigger person.Actual flight from vicinity of noise and/or use of physical violence on an inanimate object.Panic, anger or severe irritation may be manifest in sufferer's demeanour.10Actual use of physical violence on a person or animal (i.e., a household pet).Violence may be inflicted on self (self-harming). ONLINE SURVEYOn July 8th, 2013, a group of people who suffer from misophonia, self-identified as a \"group of amateur researchers,\" compiled a survey of just over 120 questions with the hope of generating a data base of information.The survey was publicized to misophonia communities on at least three social media group sites, yahoo groups (Selective Sound Sensitivity Yahoo group), reddit (r/misophonia on reddit), and tumblr (misophoniasupport.tumblr.com).As an online survey with no log-in or opt-in requirements, it was an open survey available to the general public.Thus, for the following analysis, it is assumed that the people who answered the survey are misophonia sufferers.

      "title": "[Emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology].",
      "abstract": "Trauma comes as a result of the subject's exposure to extremely negative and stressful events, such as natural or human-provoked catastrophes, wars, serious injuries, violent deaths, tortures, terrorist attacks, rapes and other sexual crimes. A child's exposure to traumatic circumstances of this level during the crucial period of self-structuring creates rather difficult conditions for its development. Moreover, if the child does not have the opportunity to elaborate and analyze all these stressful conditions and put them into words, serious consequences, both psychological and somatic, may occur in adult life. Specific factors and child characteristics, namely, the age, the developmental stage within which the trauma occurs, its type (physical or sexual abuse, neglect or traumatic social events), frequency, duration and intensity, have been proved to seriously affect the trauma's consequences. The immediate emotional impact of trauma may include isolation, fear, feeling of weakness or loss of the sense of confidence. Moreover, mood disorders such as depression and withdrawal, negative effects on cognitive ability, language development and academic performance, difficulties in creating a secure link and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also observed. The long-term consequences for the individual's mental health can be expressed through the following: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combined or not with depression and anxiety disorder, mood disorders, personality disorders, poor control of impulsions, dissociation disorder, psychotic disorder. Finally, apart from the dramatic impact of trauma on the person itself, there is also a high social cost to be paid as a result of the individual's poor adjustment and dysfunction in the community. Early support and intervention in the child's environment may significantly minimize the negative effects of trauma. Beyond the expression of genes, good maternal care as well as psychological support, lead to normal DNA methylation and brain development. Supporting the family and break the silence that frequently covers the traumatic events and feelings, will give the opportunity for the elaboration of all these aspects which could capture and imprison the subject in a dramatic circle of psychopathology. Moreover, the effectiveness of early interventions and child psychotherapy is now a common ground, so we have to use all our clinical instruments (dialogue, symbolic play, drawing, storytelling) in order to help the child and have the best possible result. Finally, concerning clinical practice, the emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology is so frequent that mental health experts should take it into serious account while developing an appropriate clinical treatment for such patients.",

      "abstract": "Several characteristics help distinguish MPI in the workplace from illness outbreaks due to physical causes: no laboratory or physical findings confirming an specific organic cause evidence of specific physical or psychological stressors victims are mostly women and those of lower socioeconomic status in the workplace hyperventilation-type symptoms are prominent apparent transmission by audiovisual cues rapid spread of the illness followed by rapid remission of symptoms, unless symptoms are fixed by physicians and litigation benign morbidity If a physical or chemical cause of the illness is not obvious and if episodes recur, the illness remains a mystery and the workplace becomes a breeding ground for anxiety, confusion, fear, and rumor. Economic pressures to resume normal operations are counteracted by fears that an environmental contaminant still exists. Once all physical explanations have been ruled out, investigators may turn to psychological explanations and focus on mass hysteria, but that explanation is primarily based on the absence of physical evidence rather than the presence of agreed-upon psychosocial conditions. Some reports suggest that the diagnosis of MPI is really an excuse for not conducting an adequate evaluation of low-level environmental contaminants. The disability in some workers is prolonged and points to non-work-related factors that may be contributing. Were it not for the unverifiable physical complaints and the workers' insistence that the symptoms are the result of physical disease and their concern about the complaints and their reactions to dismissal of their complaints, we would not consider these patients to have a mental disorder. These individuals are reinforced in their beliefs by some physicians and attorneys, and resultant litigation tends to fix their symptoms. In fact, a \"conspiracy theory\" evolves when there are enough convinced people--and enough people trying to dissuade them. Group phenomena reinforce their beliefs and make renouncement tantamount to betrayal. The mass psychogenic illness or psychiatric epidemic that occurs in the workplace offers an opportunity not only to study the elements of a biopsychosocial system, but also offers opportunities for medical anthropological studies that relate the causes and courses of specific episodes of MPI to the cultures of the individuals who develop symptoms and the cultures of the area in which the epidemic occurs.",

      "title": "Let's Focus on Frailty",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Frailty may be a clinical condition during which a person's vulnerability to acquiring dependency and/or mortality increases after they are subjected to a stressor.[1] Frailty is most regularly characterized as an aging-related disorder of physiological decline, characterized by marked vulnerability to unfavorable health outcomes, such as comorbidities, polypharmacy, the loss of independence, increasing hospitalizations, and mortality, improving the care for the most vulnerable subset of patients by frailty awareness and associated risks for adverse health outcomes. The physical frailty is \"A medical syndrome with multiple causes and contributors that are characterized by diminished strength, endurance, and reduced physiologic function that increases an individual's vulnerability for developing increased dependency and/or death.\"[2] Frail people usually have three or more than five symptoms such as unintentional weight loss (10 or more pounds within the past year), muscle loss and weakness, fatigue, reduced walking speed, and reduced levels of physical activity. WHAT ARE CONSEQUENCES OF FRAILTY? Frailty is viewed as a geriatric disorder with various causes and contributors portrayed by reduced strength, perseverance and diminished physiologic capacity, and increasing a person's weakness for developing disability.[1] As one of the fundamental causes of functional decrease in the elderly, sarcopenia has a high clinical effect, influencing the status and recuperation of an individual's mobility, independence, and quality of life conveys an increased danger for chronic frailty which results in falls, disability, hospitalization, and mortality.[3] WHAT ARE the RISK FACTORS FOR FRAILTY? The elements related with frailty, especially sociodemographic factors such as age, gender, and educational level, just as actual factors, for example, body weight and activities of daily living.[4] Malnutrition, inactivity, and comorbidities have a high antagonistic effect in older people and are risk factors for sarcopenia and physical frailty. The loss of muscle mass, strength, and function, called sarcopenia, is a key factor in the development of physical frailty. WHAT IS ORAL FRAILTY? Oral frailty is characterized as a progression of phenomena and cycles that lead to changes in different oral conditions (number of teeth, oral cleanliness, oral capacities, and so forth) related with aging, and accompanied by diminished interest in oral health, decreased physical and mental reserve capacity, and an expansion in oral frailty prompting to eating dysfunction; the general impact is of deteriorating physical and mental capacity.[5] HOW TO ASSESS THE ORAL FRAILTY? Oral assessments comprised of 16 measures including five dental status, eight oral functions, and three subjective difficulties. The 16 measures were as follows: dental status – number of natural teeth and functioning teeth, community periodontal index, tongue thickness as a marker of oral nutrient status, and turbidity of mouth-rinsed water as a marker of oral hygiene. Oral functions – maximum occlusal force, chewing ability as a marker of general masticatory performance, maximum tongue pressure, repetitive saliva-swallowing test (RSST), articulatory oral motor skill for \"pa, ta, ka\" and experience of dry mouth measured-oral wettability. Subjective assessments – difficulties in eating and swallowing, and using the questionnaire chewing ability, RSST, xerostomia. Oral frailty – the accumulation of a slightly poor status of oral conditions and function, strongly predicts physical frailty, dysphagia, malnutrition, need for long-term care, and mortality. IS ORAL FRAILTY LINKED TO PHYSICAL FRAILTY? A hypothesis for the connection between poor oral health and frailty is that poor diet intervenes the impact of poor oral health (like loss of teeth, dental agony, or potentially biting issues), prompting to frailty.[6] Poor eating routine and nutritional risk have for some time been involved in the etiology and progression of frailty by affecting useful functional reserves and strength and leading to loss of energy, functional decline, morbidity, and subsequent frailty. Oral frailty was essentially connected with physical frailty by 66.6% and sarcopenia by 72.7%. Poor oral condition in hospitalized patients can be attributed to factors such as age, physical dependency, psychological decline, malnutrition, low skeletal muscle mass and strength, and multimorbidity.[7] WHAT ARE the POLICY IMPLICATIONS? The proof from frailty studies has not yet been completely converted into clinical practice and medical care strategy making. As of now, in any case, there is no viable treatment for frailty and the best intervention is not yet known. In view of presently available proof, the multicomponent exercise, which incorporates resistance training, appears to be promising.[8] The current challenges in frailty research incorporate the absence of a worldwide standard meaning of frailty, further comprehension of interventions to reverse frailty, the best planning for intervention, and education/training of health-care professionals. Population-based evaluation for frailty could be costly and resource intensive, and as of now, there is no obvious proof for expected advantage, cost-adequacy, or improved results. Research and development efforts aimed toward building up and spreading best practice in frailty should not lack strategic consideration regarding older people with early (pre-) frailty that passes up on a chance to address a few requests on health and social care services. Another significant space of delicacy research is schooling and preparing The medical services experts including doctors, attendants, and other medical workers need to comprehend essential standards of care for frail older adults and to have the option to distinguish frailty and give therapy/interventions. There is an increasing interest in frailty in other medical fields than the geriatrics One model is that frailty has recently been pursued as a potential risk assessment measure for older surgical patients and has demonstrated to be promising in anticipating postoperative intricacies, for example, mortality or length of emergency clinic stay. Finally, frailty research may have evolved without considering the patient perspective Frailty can be considered as a profoundly adverse term and being marked as frail may influence contrarily the weakest people differently. The individuals who were marked as \"old and fragile\" by others were bound to be related with a loss of interest in friendly and proactive tasks, poor physical health, and increased disparagement. The future innovative work endeavors need to recognize the risks of naming older individuals in defaming ways and stay away from turning into the new cloak of ageism and an instrument for segregation.[8] Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

Evidence of cerebral dysfunction may show up in one or more areas, such as sensory or motor function, intellectual functioning, emotional control, manifestation of seizure phenomena, and others.

      "title": "Impaired Mental Proprioception in Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Psychiatrists recognize that schizophrenia is a disorder in which the highest mental functions, such as thought, language, emotions, conation, and cognition, are drastically disrupted. However, the most serious impairment in schizophrenia is a global malfunction in self-integration and personal identity that includes a deficit in self-recognition. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] This distorted sense of leads persons with schizophrenia to fail to recognize what is or is not part of their own mind, which can produce clinical symptoms of schizophrenia, including bizarre delusions, hallucinations, thought disorder, social deficits, and information processing. (1) Just as intact physical proprioception enables a healthy person to be continuously aware of where his body and its parts are located in space, allowing sensory-motor integration, mental proprioception enables one to be fully aware of his identity and self-boundaries, and that his thoughts and actions are generated from within his own sphere of consciousness, not from an external source. In schizophrenia, the coherent sense of is shattered and fragmented, a frightening experience patients describe after emerging from psychosis. (2) A person affected by schizophrenia feels lost, as if his no longer belong[s] to him. He feels alienated from his real self and refers to himself in the third person. He feels disconnected, disintegrated, and diminished, with a sense of emptiness, a painful void of existence, of being disembodied with no clear demarcation between and others. (2) Not surprisingly, false beliefs (delusions) and perceptual aberrations (hallucinations) emerge from a fragmented sense of self. Patients fail to recognize that their actions, thoughts, or feelings are initiated from within the self, leading to delusions of passivity and being controlled by an outside force. One's impulses are misperceived as being imposed by an alien. One's thoughts, fantasies, and memories become external hallucinations instead of internal recollections. It is not surprising that depersonalization and derealization are common in schizophrenia and in the prodrome stage. Phencyclidine and ketamine, which can produce schizophrenia-like psychoses, are known to trigger dissociative phenomena and a loss of a coherent sense of self. What causes the disintegration of the mind (self) in schizophrenia? The leading neurobiologic explanation is well-documented white matter pathology. (3) Numerous studies have demonstrated that the myelinated axons and fibers that connect various brain regions are abnormal in patients with schizophrenia. The evidence for the breakdown of white matter--and, consequently, brain connectedness and integration--includes several lines of evidence, such as: a) in vivo neuroimaging studies using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) that show abnormal water mobility in the myelin; b) genetic aberrations in myelin genes; c) postmortem evidence of reduced oligodendrocytes, the glial cells that manufacture myelin; and d) biochemical markers such as the calcium-binding protein S100B, which is released by compromised glial cells. (3) Therefore, it is reasonable to think that the disruption of the sense of and its proprioception may be due to the extensive disconnectivity of brain regions caused by myelin pathology. (4) However, grey matter abnormality also may play a role in loss of mental proprioceptive functions, which causes a failure to properly recognize one's self. The inferior parietal cortex, which controls body image, concept of self, sensory integration, and executive function, has been reported to be structurally impaired in patients with schizophrenia. …",

      "abstract": "Unlike acute pain that warns us of injury or disease, chronic or persistent pain serves no adaptive purpose. Though there is no agreed on definition of chronic pain, it is commonly referred to as pain that is without biological value, lasting longer than the typical healing time, not responsive to treatments based on specific remedies, and of a duration greater than 6 months. Chronic pain that is severe and intractable has detrimental consequences, including psychological distress, job loss, social isolation, and, not surprisingly, it is highly comorbid with depression and anxiety. Historically, pain without an apparent anatomical or neurophysiological origin was labelled as psychopathological. This approach is damaging to the patient and provider alike. It pollutes the therapeutic relationship by introducing an element of mutual distrust as well as implicit, if not explicit, blame. It is demoralizing to the patient who feels at fault, disbelieved, and alone. Moreover, many medically unexplained pains are now understood to involve an interplay between peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms that have gone awry. The new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, somatic symptom disorder overpsychologizes people with chronic pain; it has low sensitivity and specificity, and it contributes to misdiagnosis, as well as unnecessary stigma. Adjustment disorder remains the most appropriate, accurate, and acceptable diagnosis for people who are overly concerned about their pain.",

      "abstract": "Dystonia is a movement disorder characterised by sustained muscle contractions, repetitive twisting movements, and abnormal postures of the trunk, neck, face, or arms and legs. 1 Classifi cation of this condition may be based on topography, age at onset, cause, or by the presence of genetic markers. 1 When unaccompanied by other neurologic abnormalities, and in the absence of known causes (except some genetic mutations), the dystonia is said to be \"primary\".Focal dystonia is that which affects a single region, e.g.cervical dystonia, blepharospasm or laryngeal dystonia.Dystonia may also be classifi ed according to phenomenology.Hence, abnormal posturing that occurs during voluntary activity is called \"action dystonia\", the eponym \"task-specifi c\" being appended when action dystonia is triggered by specifi c actions. 1 Case ReportA previously well 37-year-old man presented to our clinic with the complaint that, for the preceding 6 months, he \"made faces\" when eating large mouthfuls of food, but not otherwise.The movements, which were likened to the \"face made when confronted with a noxious odour\", were consistent and reproducible, occurring only when he chewed large mouthfuls of food, but not when he chewed small mouthfuls of food, talked, sang or performed other tasks.They caused the patient severe distress and social embarrassment, and were upsetting to his wife, who initially misinterpreted his facial expression as indicating lack of appreciation of her cooking.He had no previous history of psychiatric illness or head injury, had no history of facial palsy, and had never ingested antipsychotic agents.There was no family history of movement disorders.The abnormal movements were not preceded by an urge to move, and their performance did not provide relief.He did not describe any sensory tricks which ameliorated the movements, and had no brady-or hypokinesia, rest tremors or stiffness to suggest a parkinsonian syndrome.Clinical examination was normal, except for overactivity of the procerus, corrugator and nasalis muscles, causing him to produce the \"bad smell facies\" when he chewed on a large mouthful of food.These abnormal movements were not otherwise seen, even when he drank or chewed",

      "abstract": "Drowsiness is one of the cardinal symptoms of motion sickness; therefore, a symptom-complex centering around \"drowsiness\" has been identified which, for convenience, has been termed the sopite syndrome. Generally, the symptoms characterizing this syndrome are interwoven with other symptoms but under two circumstances the sopite syndrome comprises the main or sole overt manifestation of motion sickness. One circumstance is that in which the intensity of the eliciting stimuli is closely matched to a person's susceptibility, and the sopite syndrome is evoked either before other symptoms of motion sickness appear or in their absence. The second circumstance occurs during prolonged exposure in a motion environment when adaptation results in the disappearance of motion sickness symptoms, except for responses characterizing the sopite syndrome. Typical symptoms of the syndrome are: 1) yawning, 2) drowsiness, 3) disinclination for work, either physical or mental, and 4) lack of participation in group activities. Phenomena derived from an analysis of the symptomatology of the sopite syndrome are qualitatively similar but may differ quantitatively from abstractions derived in other motion sickness responses. One example is the sometimes unique time course of the sopite syndrome. This implies that the immediate eliciting mechanisms not only differ from those involved in evoking other symptoms, but, also, that they must represent first order responses. Diagnosis is difficult unless the syndrome under discussion is kept in mind. Prevention poses a greater problem than treatment.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Paranoia has at various times been considered a symptom of psychosis, a distinct disorder, a type of personality disorder, and a personality trait. However defined, the core features are interpersonal vulnerability, mistrust, and the anticipation of harm from malevolent others which, in its most severe form, can be considered delusional. There have been persisting debates about whether delusional paranoia reflects a qualitatively distinct mental state, as indicated by some phenomenological studies, or lies on a continuum with ordinary suspiciousness. Little is known about the genetics of paranoia, but there is substantial evidence that it is associated with specific social challenges such as disrupted early attachment relationships, living in deprived circumstances, and experiences of victimization. Considerable progress has also been made in developing psychological models which identify the cognitive (jumping to conclusions and bias against disconfirmatory information) and emotional factors (low self-esteem and insecure attachment styles) that contribute to paranoid beliefs.",

      "title": "Pain Is An Uncomfortable Sensation",
      "abstract": "Pain is an uncomfortable sensation that indicates that the body is damaged or threatened with injury. Pain starts at special pain receptors that are found all over the body. These pain receptors transmit messages as electrical impulses along nerves to the spinal cord and then upward to the brain. Sometimes the signal when it reaches the spinal cord elicits a reflex response. When this happens, the signal is immediately sent back by the motor nerve to the site of pain, encouraging the muscles to tighten. An example of a reflex reaction is an immediate withdrawal reaction after something very hot is inadvertently touched. The pain signal is also transmitted to the brain. Only when the brain processes the signal and perceives it as pain does the person become aware of it. Pain felt in some areas of the body does not have to indicate exactly where the problem is, because the pain can be transferred to another area. Transmitted pain occurs because signals from several areas of the body often go to the spinal cord and brain through the same nerve pathways. The ability to endure pain varies with mood, personality, and conditions. Pain can change greatly with age. As people get older, they complain less about pain, perhaps because changes in the body reduce the sensation of pain. On the other hand, older people may simply be more stoic than younger people.",

Er is echter nog veel onduidelijkheid over de sterkte van het verband tussen psychische aandoeningen en de soort en ernst van deze functionele beperkingen. In dit proefschrift wordt dit verband nader onderzocht in de bevolking. De belangrijkste bevindingen kunnen als volgt worden omschreven: (1) Psychische aandoeningen gaan gepaard met andere functionele beperkingen dan lichamelijke aandoeningen, maar ze beperken het functioneren minstens even ernstig. (2) Lichamelijke en psychische aandoeningen komen vaak samen voor bij dezelfde persoon en dit leidt tot veel ziekteverzuim. (3) Het ziekteverzuim dat samenhangt met depressie wordt vooral veroorzaakt door concentratieproblemen en gevoelens van schaamte. (4) Na herstel van een depressie herstelt het functioneren ook in de meerderheid van gevallen. Bij mensen die na hun depressieve episode niet volledig herstellen in hun functioneren komen vaker ook een angststoornis, verslaving, of lichamelijke aandoening voor en deze mensen ervaren minder steun uit hun sociale netwerk dan mensen die wel volledig herstellen. Hoewel er nog onduidelijkheid blijft bestaan over welke factoren een positieve en negatieve invloed hebben op functioneren, blijkt uit dit proefschrift duidelijk dat niet iedere aandoening bij iedereen tot evenveel functionele beperkingen leidt. Behandelingen die niet direct leiden tot een afname in de ernst en het aantal psychische symptomen, maar wel zorgen voor verbeteringen in het functioneren, zouden dan ook niet als zonder succes moeten worden beschouwd.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Dystonia is a neurological syndrome with sustained muscle contractions producing an abnormal posture, and is usually secondary to central nervous system dysfunction. Dystonia is often classifi ed by etiology, which may be primary (sporadic or familial) or secondary. Secondary causes of dystonia have accompanying neurological defi cits or an identifi able structural or metabolic lesion. Etiological classifi cation of dystonia has undergone extensive modifi cations as genetic underpinnings for some forms of dystonia have been newly identifi ed [chap. 3]. Secondary dystonia may be further classifi ed into symptomatic dystonia and the dystonia-plus syndromes. Symptomatic dystonia is due to an identifi able brain disease, an obvious brain or peripheral insult, or a hereditary or sporadic degeneration of the brain. The dystonia-plus syndromes (1) have accompanying neurological signs and/or clinical and laboratory fi ndings suggestive of neurochemical disorders, without evidence of an underlying neurodegenerative process (Box 17.1).",

      "title": "Gambling Dual Disorder: A Dual Disorder and Clinical Neuroscience Perspective",
      "abstract": "Several behaviors, including compulsive gambling, have been considered non-substance-related addictive disorders. Categorical mental disorders (e.g., DSM-5) are usually accompanied by very different symptomatic expressions (affective, behavioral, cognitive, substance abuse, personality traits). When these mental disorders occur with addictive disorders, either concomitantly or sequentially over the life span, this clinical condition is called a dual disorder. Gambling disorder (GD) has been associated with other categorical psychiatric diagnoses: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, social anxiety, schizophrenia, substance use disorder, antisocial personality disorder; and dimensional symptoms including higher impulsivity, poorer emotional wellbeing, cognitive distortion, psychosis, deficient self-regulation, suicide, poorer family environment, and greater mental distress. We are calling this clinical condition Gambling Dual Disorder. From a clinical perspective, it is clear that Gambling Dual Disorder is not the exception but rather the expectation, and this holds true not just for GD, but also for other mental disorders including other addictions. Mental disorders are viewed as biological disorders that involve brain circuits that implicate specific domains of cognition, emotion, and behavior. This narrative review presents the state of the art with respect to GD in order to address current matters from a dual disorder, precision psychiatry, and clinical neuroscience perspective, rather than the more subjective approach of symptomatology and clinical presentation. This review also presents Gambling Dual Disorder as a brain and neurodevelopmental disorder, including from the perspectives of evolutionary psychiatry, genetics, impulsivity as an endophenotype, the self-medication hypothesis, and sexual biological differences. The wide vision of the disease advances a paradigm shift, highlighting how GD and dual disorders should be conceptualized, diagnosed, and treated. Rethinking GD as part of a dual disorder is crucial for its appropriate conceptualization from the perspective of clinical neuroscience and precision psychiatry.",

Both phenomenon can be due to medication or drug, or to an altered mental status. Visual hallucinations can be formed (objects, people) or unformed (light, geometric figures). They can be generated either by a lesion on the antechiasmatic pathway, by a seizure phenomenon, by a migrainous phenomenon, or by a release phenomenon secondary to visual differentiation. Investigations will be directed towards a retinopathy, an optic neuropathy, a chiasmal or retrochiasmal lesion, or a bilateral antechiasmal lesion (Charles Bonnet syndrome). Visual illusions include meta-morphopsias, micro- macropsias, polyopia, palinopsia (visual perseveration), achromatopsia, Pulfrich phenomenon, or subjective vertical deviation. Illusions can be due to lesions of the retina, the optic nerve, the visual cortex (primary or associative), or the graviceptive pathways.As most patients do not spontaneously mention their symptoms, history taking is essential. The first step is to rule out medication or an altered mental status as the possible cause of these symptoms.

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

PTSD is an anxiety disorder developed in a person experiencing, wit‐ nessing, or learning about an extreme physically or psychologically distressing event, asso‐ ciated with unprecedented violence [11, 12]. Traumatic events that can trigger PTSD include massacres, mass murder scenes, international, civil, political, ethnic and religious wars, gen‐ ocides, natural and man-made disasters, criminal assaults, serious accidents, terrorist at‐ tacks, incarceration, trafficking, rape and other types of sexual assaults [12-17], life threatening illness and the sudden death of a loved one, serious medical illness, injury, sur‐ gery, hostage, kidnapping, difficult labors, etc [18-20]. Individuals who experience a trauma of this nature may develop symptoms that fall into three distinct clusters: re-experiencing phenomenon; avoidance and numbing; and autonomic hyperarousal. Symptoms usually be‐ gin within the first 3 months after the traumatic event and last for many years, although there may be a delay of months, or even years, before symptoms appear. PTSD patients are characterized by severe emotional state, sharp reduction in adaptive and information receiv‐ ing abilities. They usually remain out of society, become drug addicted, alcoholic and often commit suicide [21-24]. Degrees of risk to develop PTSD from different traumatic events are presented in table 1.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric nosology is widely criticized, but solutions are proving elusive. Planned revisions of diagnostic criteria will not resolve heterogeneity, comorbidity, fuzzy boundaries between normal and pathological, and lack of specific biomarkers. Concern about these difficulties reflects a narrow model that assumes most mental disorders should be defined by their etiologies. A more genuinely medical model uses understanding of normal function to categorize pathologies. For instance, understanding the function of a cough guides the search for problems causing it, and decisions about when it is expressed abnormally. Understanding the functions of emotions is a foundation missing from decisions about emotional disorders. The broader medical model used by the rest of medicine also recognizes syndromes defined by failures of functional systems or failures of feedback control. Such medical syndromes are similar to many mental diagnoses in their multiple causes, blurry boundaries, and nonspecific biomarkers. Dissatisfaction with psychiatric nosology may best be alleviated, not by new diagnostic criteria and categories, but by more realistic acknowledgment of the untidy landscape of mental and other medical disorders.",

This case report represents a 22-year-old patient with no prior criminal history who experienced episodes of decreased consciousness, altered identity, and involuntary movements. These episodes were perceived as being controlled by an external force and culminated in a tragic event leading the patient to kill her children. After ruling out other potential causes like psychotic disorders, organic factors, and substance abuse, a diagnosis of dissociative trance disorder was considered.

Threatened egotism appears to be a major, pervasive cause: Self-defeating responses are especially common when people feel that others may perceive them less favorably than the people desire. Self-regulation failure is also a common element in most self-defeating behavior. Emotional distress is often a precipitating factor. Several causal processes, including foolish risk taking and escapist responses, link emotional distress to self-defeat.",

Development of effective management strategies is hindered by confusing terminology.Research investigating treatments often use \"agitation\" or \"behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD)\" as an outcome measure without differentiating the context in which these behaviors occurred.Actually, a recent review of 85 measures, used for assessing behavioral symptoms of dementia, found that \"no measures identify risk factors for behaviors or enable an evaluation of the context in which behaviors occur\". 1 At the same time, it is recognized that there is a need for identification of context in which behavior occurred for effective management as is described in the DICE approach. 2,3e most important context in which behavior occurs is presence or absence of another person.This context can distinguish two main types of behaviors: agitation and rejection of care. 4Agitation can be defined as \"behaviors that communicate to others [who observe the patient] that the patient is experiencing and unpleasant state of excitement and which remain after interventions to reduce internal or external stimuli have been carried out\". 5i.e., medical conditions, pain, medication side-effects, environmental factors, hunger or thirst, and others.Symptoms of agitation include general restlessness, repetitive mannerisms, pacing, trying to get to a different place, handling inappropriately, hiding things, inappropriate dressing and undressing and repetitive sentences. 6Agitation occurs when the person with dementia does not interact with others, i.e., is solitary.Rejection of care occurs in most cases when a caregiver tries to provide care for a person who does not understand the need for it, or misperceives the action as threatening, and resists caregiver's actions. 7If the caregiver insists to provide care, the person with dementia may defend himself/herself from unwanted attention, may become combative and develop reactive aggression.This reactive aggression can be defined as \"the repertoire of behaviors with which persons with dementia withstand of oppose the efforts of a caregiver\". 8and includes hitting, pushing, scratching, grabbing things or people, kicking and biting, screaming, cursing, temper outbursts, and making strange noises. 9",

One of the important developments in the modern understanding of DDs is the establishment of a clearer link between trauma and dissociation. Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is the most popular, widely discussed, and recognized of the DDs. Pathological possession has been included as a symptom of DID in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). Dissociative amnesia represents the classical functional disorder of episodic memory. Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (DPDRD) involves lack of integration of one or more components of perception and characterizes by \"the presence of recurrent or persistent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both\". The symptoms of depersonalization and/or derealization frequently co-occur in a variety of other psychiatric disorders, primarily in patients with anxiety disorders.",

They can be classified in some ways, of which we highlight those in terms of its localization or etiology. Psychogenic dystonia is an exclusion diagnosis, which is infradiagnosed due to the difficulty to specify the disorder. We proposed a review over its use in usual clinical practice, in relation to the symptoms, difficulties of diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Development: The inconsistency of symptoms and incongruity with the classical symptomatology, and so the poor therapeutic answer to usual treatments set out to the diagnosis. Its psychiatric comorbility with anxiety, depression, somatizations, conversion symptomatology or personality traits would support the diagnosis; but its presence is not strictly necessary. Psychiatric characteristics are sometimes seen trough the basis of movement disorder of neurological origin. Symptoms of depression or anxiety are related with a better prognosis, while cronification, insidious onset, the diagnosis of hypocondria, the factitious disorder or the simulation are related with poor prognosis. It's recommended a combined pharmacologic-psycotherapic treatment. Recent studies with antidepressants have shown encouraging results. Conclusions: It's very important to make a correct differential diagnosis that allows to approach to the disorder to avoid iatrogenia o unnecessary invasive tests.",

Im Gegensatz zu Erschöpfungszuständen bei Gesunden ist diese Form der Fatigue dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass sie über längere Zeiträume andauern kann, in keinem angemessenen Verhältnis zu vorangehenden Aktivitäten steht und sich durch Erholungsphasen nicht zurückbildet. Diese Form der Müdigkeit wird als ein multidimensionales Problem beschrieben, das physische, emotionale und kognitive Aspekte umfasst und mit einem hohen subjektiven Leidensdruck verbunden ist. Je nach Ausprägung und Verlauf der Symptomatik führt Fatigue zu einer starken Beeinträchtigung der Lebensqualität und schränkt die Teilhabe und Alltagsbewältigung ein. Ebenso kommt es häufig zu Einschränkungen der Arbeits- und Erwerbsfähigkeit. Wenngleich die Ursachen der Fatigue immer noch nicht vollständig geklärt sind, ist die Fatigue in Zusammenhang mit körperlichen Erkrankungen vor dem Hintergrund eines multifaktoriellen biopsychosozialen Modells zu verstehen. Die Möglichkeiten der Diagnostik und eine Übersicht über verschiedene Verfahren zur Abklärung der Fatigue werden dargestellt. Ebenso werden die Herausforderungen für die medizinische Versorgung skizziert und Hinweise für den Umgang im klinischen Alltag gegeben.",

Psychological reaction to physical illness refers to a set of cognitive, emotional and behavioural responses which are triggered by the development of physical symptoms or a diagnosis of a physical condition by a healthcare professional. Experiencing and living with illness is a dynamic process and it takes time to assimilate new information, manage feelings and make appropriate adjustments to family and social circumstances. Chronic physical illness usually involves having to make a sequential series of psychological adjustments as the disease progresses.",

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM IV) (1), a delusion is a false belief based on incorrect inference about external reality that is firmly sustained despite what almost everyone else believes. Hallucination is a sensory perception that has the compelling sense of reality of a true perception, but that occurs without external stimulation of the relevant sensory organ. The person may or may not have insight in that he or she is having a hallucination. Psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions are the cardinal features of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorder, delusional disorder, and brief psychotic disorder. Psychotic symptoms may also occur during the course of delirium or dementias and may be due to a range of other general medical and neurological conditions, including PD.",

      "abstract": "The essential feature of functional somatic syndromes is the presence of symptoms without medical explanation. the syndromes have a high psychiatric co-morbidity, and stress and anxiety are assumed to play a role, at least in the maintenance of the complaints. Psychophysiological models traditionally attribute the symptoms to stress or anxiety-related disregulations in specific physiological mechanisms. In fact, however, there is no convincing empirical proof for such models. The idea of a direct coupling between self-reported symptoms and corresponding physiological disregulations thus seems hardly tenable. Therefore, we propose a reformulation of the potential role of stress physiology in diagnosing functional somatic symptoms. Physiological measures should not be used anymore to demonstrate explanatory physiological disregulations. They should instead be used to provide additional information about the state of activity of the central fear network . This alternative approach is based on the fact that self-reported and physiological manifestations of an emotional state are only loosely coupled, making both aspects complementary indicators of the brain activity involved. Physiological measures may thus provide additional information (above self-report) regarding emotional states implicated in functional complaints. A suggested application of this approach is to define sub-groups of functional somatic patients on the basis of similarities in disregulated physiological stress-response profiles. This in future may contribute to the development of more specific diagnostic tools and better tailored treatments.",

It includes both the sensory input and any modulation by physiological, psychological and environmental factors. Not surprisingly there are no objective measures – there is no way to measure pain directly by sampling blood or urine or by performing neurophysiological tests. Measurement of pain must therefore rely on recording the patient’s report. The assumption is often made that because the measurement is subjective it must be of little value. The reality is that if the measurements are done properly, remarkably sensitive and consistent results can be obtained. There are contexts, however, when it is not possible to measure pain at all, or when reports are likely to be unreliable. These include impaired consciousness, young children, psychiatric pathology, severe anxiety, unwillingness to co-operate, and inability to understand the measurements. Such problems are deliberately avoided in trials.",

A hierarchy moving from feelings through emotions, moods, and affective state to temperament involves increasing complexity in terms of state of mind and usually to an increasing duration of that state. Delusion involves abnormal beliefs that arise in the context of disturbed judgements and an altered experience of reality. Depersonalisation and derealisation are assumed to arise from a disruption in the functions of consciousness to create amnesia, dissociative identity disorder and depersonalisation disorder.

It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

Alguns autors nomes inclouen elements fisics pel seu diagnostic, mentre que d'altres hi afegeixen aspectes cognitius, emocionals o socials. Malgrat aquesta diversitat una de les definicions operatives de fragilitat mes acceptats i utilitzats es el proposat per L. Fried que inclou cinc criteris: perdua inexplicable de pes, debilitat muscular, cansament/ poca resistencia, lentitud en la marxa i baix nivell d'activitat fisica. Tenir tres o mes dels 5 criteris es indicatiu de la fragilitat, alhora que 2 corresponen a un estat pre-fragil. La prevencio de la discapacitat es un gran repte al que s'enfronta la nostra societat que envelleix. Calen intervencions eficaces en poblacions d'alt risc com les persones grans fragils pero la identificacio, avaluacio i intervencio sobre aquesta poblacio encara no esta consensuada ni sistematitzada. En els ultims anys, l'activitat fisica i la malnutricio han estat identificats com a causes potencialment reversibles de la fragilitat. De fet l'activitat fisica ha demostrat ser eficac per millorar els diferents components de la sindrome de fragilitat com la sarcopenia, el deteriorament funcional, la inactivitat fisica, el rendiment cognitiu i la depressio. La combinacio amb una alta ingesta proteica podria millorar-ne els resultats. La identificacio d'una poblacio mes exposada a patir resultats adversos de salut com ara les persones grans fragils, podria ser important per poder establir estrategies de prevencio de la discapacitat durant l'envelliment.",

BDD is associated with poor quality of life and marked functional impairment, as well as high rates of suicidal ideation and behaviours. Although BDD is often under-recognized in clinical settings, both pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions are effective at reducing BDD symptoms and distress. This chapter presents information on the phenomenology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, epidemiology, pathogenesis, course, and treatment of BDD.",

The index case is presented for highlighting the pathological nature of fantasy friend phenomenon, role of psychological, social and cultural factors in its genesis and its course. Onset and persistence of this phenomenon throughout adolescence, its longer duration and non-recognition of its imaginary component by the patient indicates its pathological nature. The patient developed schizophrenia after experiencing this phenomenon for 12-13 years. It is concluded that pathological fantasy friend phenomenon may carry risk of schizophrenia if continued without any intervention for longer duration. Hence, there is a need to identify and intervene early in such kind of cases. The findings of this case report needs to be corroborated by other case reports or studies.",

Of course, this usage eliminates neither illnesses nor the subjective experience of being ill, but it has implications for forensic psychiatry and for the assessment of a person’s legal responsibility. Having schizophrenic delusions constitutes a categorically different state from having only wishful illusions or a vivid imagination. In the context of medicine and psychiatry, we certainly encounter stages that signal fundamental differences. These differences are easily detected when assessing psychotic disorders or similar states, but a lot of differences also arise when assessing perpetrators with personality disorders or simply antisocial behavior. Where, in these states, are the borders that demarcate full responsibility from substantially reduced social responsibility?",

The phenomenon of medically unexplained symptoms cannot simply be classified into one or a few diagnostic categories, but must be regarded as an expression of a basic mechanism by which people may respond to stressors as in the cases of depression and anxiety. Somatization disorder and related disorders must thus be considered to possess a spectrum of severity. In this chapter, the focus will be on the chronic and multisymptomatic forms.",

      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, and verbal and nonverbal communication as well as limited and repetitive behaviours. Although symptomatology of autism may be noticed around early months, diagnosis generally occurs around 24-36 months, however in some cases diagnosis may be delayed to adulthood [1]. Since behavioural symptoms and the degree of functional impairment are variable, the au‐ tistic disorder is described as a heterogenous symptom cluster of varying etiological and pathological basis [2]. Described as a multifactorial disorder created by interaction of neuro‐ logic, immunologic, environmental, and genetic factors, autistic disorder has no definite cause [3, 4]. In many cases in whom the etiology remains unclear are diagnosed as idiopath‐ ic autism or non-syndromic autism [5, 6]. Seventy percent of cases with idiopathic autism have basic symptoms without physical abnormalities whereas 30% have complex autism in which dysmorphic features are detected such as microcephaly and/or structural brain mal‐ formations [7]. Autism is associated with other syndromes such as Fragile X syndrome, Down Syndrome, and tuberosclerosis in 5-25% of the cases ([8, 9]. Although phenotypic het‐ erogeneity is the biggest challenge for research efforts directed to identify autism etiology [10], currently it is widely accepted that environmental and genetic factors play essential role in genesis of autistic disorder thanks to a recent advance in research techniques related to biological factors and widespread studies in this field [11, 12].",

These various levels of functioning cannot be separated from the environment. Socioenvironmental stressors, defined by Mechanic [4] as a discrepancy between demands presented to a person and his or her capacity to deal with them, influence the appearance of impairments, disabilities, and handicaps. Wing [5] lists three factors that can cause and exacerbate social disablement in cases of frequent relapse or chronic impairment: environmental overstimulation or understimulation, social disadvantage, and adverse personal reactions (secondary disablement) caused by acceptance by the handicapped person of limitations that are not actually necessary. It is clear that assessment and evaluation of impairments are important in avoiding understimulation and overstimulation and preventing or correcting adverse personal reactions. Although premorbid and environmental factors play an important role, we can expect the more severely impaired also to be the more severely disabled.

      "abstract": "The introduction of potent physical and pharmacological therapies for psychotic conditions has increased the need for accurate diagnosis, not only in terms of assigning a patient to the diagnostic category but of assessing the various trends which may result in a very mixed symptomatology. Therapy, be it physical, pharmacological, or psychotherapeutic directed against one or the other of these components may frequently intensify other symptomatology. A suitable combination of anti-depressant and anti-psychotic drugs plus the use of E.C.T. when indicated is necessary in the management of such cases. In the author's judgment this mixed symptomatology frequently results from the influence of personality trends and conflicts and particularly in these mixed states psychotherapeutic aid must also be included. In the words of Jules Masserman: “Even frankly psychotic behaviour patterns, whether depressive or schizoid, are not as sometimes inferred-merely shapeless fragments from a personality shattered by some hypothetical ‘mental disease’. On the contrary, the psychosis itself is an integrated syndrome which however socially deviant is adaptively operated at all levels from the physiologic to the most abstrusely symbolic.” (3)",

However, a narrow medicalized view of suffering, solely defined as physical discomfort, ignores or minimizes the broader significance of the suffering experienced by debilitated chronically ill adults. A fundamental form of that suffering is the loss of self in chronically ill persons who observe their former self-images crumbling away without the simultaneous development of equally valued new ones. As a result of their illnesses, these individuals suffer from (1) leading restricted lives, (2) experiencing social isolation, (3) being discredited and (4) burdening others. Each of these four scores of suffering is analysed in relation to its effects on the consciousness of the ill person.

Individuals with imposter syndrome incorrectly attribute their success to being lucky, attest their success to being a con artist with faux intelligence, or believe that they have perpetrated a ruse over other individuals.",

It is the manifestation of one or more physical symptoms accompanied by excessive thoughts, emotion, and/or behavior related to the symptom, which causes significant distress and/or dysfunction. These symptoms may or may not be explained by a medical condition. The two major changes to the DSM-IV criteria included eliminating the requirement that somatic symptoms be organically unexplained and adding the requirement that certain psychobehavioral features have to be present to justify the diagnosis. The new criteria also eliminated somatization disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, hypochondriasis, and pain disorder from the previous definitions. These revisions were intended to increase the relevance of SSD and its use in the primary care setting.",

Symptoms of depression are at least seen from three aspects, namely physical symptoms, psychic symptoms, and social symptoms. Some people have a negative stigma about individuals affected by mental disorders such as depression, some studies show data on affected individuals exposed to negative stigma, one of which was shown by McLean Hospital in 2020 which showed that 75% of individuals with mental disorders had been stigmatized by society. The stigma given by society related to people who have a mental disorder is very diverse, ranging from so-called insane, people who do not have reason, and so on, but the highlight in this study is the stigma from society against people affected by mental disorders is the stigma that those who experience depression or other mental disorders that they lack faith, lack of prayer, lack of belief in God, and various other stigmas, this is then exacerbated by \"religious figures\" who sometimes give the same stigma and do not provide solutions to what is being felt by people who are affected by mental disorders. The results showed that faith can be a factor that can improve the mental health of an individual.",

      "title": "Diagnosis 2.0 Are Mental Illnesses Diseases, Disorders, or Syndromes? A Major Challenge for the DSM-V Committees as They Revise the Diagnostic \"Bible\" of Psychiatric Disorders Is to Determine Whether Mental Illnesses Are Diseases, Disorders, or Syndromes",
      "abstract": "Here's how my version of Webster's dictionary defines these terms: * Disease: A particular distinctive process in the body with a specific cause and characteristic symptoms. * Disorder: Irregularity, disturbance, or interruption of normal functions. * Syndrome: A number of symptoms occurring together and characterizing a specific disease. Let's consider 4 facts that may be relevant for this decision. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Probably not 'diseases' No objective laboratory test can differentiate 1 psychiatric malady from another, and this lack of specificity casts doubt on the disease model. However, many documented perturbations of normal brain functions are consistent with a disorder paradigm. Symptom overlap The signs and symptoms of psychiatric ailments overlap considerably. Depression and anxiety share many symptoms and frequently co-occur. Bipolar mania and schizophrenia share psychotic features, cognitive deficits, agitation, suicidality, aggressive behavior, etc. The obsessions of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) resemble and sometimes morph into the fixed false beliefs (delusions) of psychosis, and OCD's compulsions often characterize the behaviors of other psychiatric disorders, such as anorexia or bulimia nervosa. Personality disorder features essentially are attenuated but enduring forms of Axis I conditions. Nearly all psychiatric illnesses have some degree of suicidality, insomnia, and addictive behavior. Posttraumatic stress disorder's symptoms recapitulate those of numerous diagnostic categories, such as anxiety, depression, psychosis, negative symptoms, mania, OCD, impulsive behavior, and personality changes. Common neurobiology Most diagnostic categories in psychiatry share some neurobiologic features, such as: * neurotransmitter pathways (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, or glutamate) * structural abnormalities on neuroimaging (cortical atrophy, ventriculomegaly, gray and/or white matter abnormalities) or * genetic predispositions. Medical and psychiatric comorbidities (migraine, chronic pain, diabetes, obesity, alcohol abuse, anxiety, eating disorders, and Axis II features) occur across all major psychiatric diagnoses. Nonspecific medications Psychotropics approved for treating 1 condition are frequently useful for others: * Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors initially were indicated for depression but soon were found to have efficacy for panic attacks, social phobia, OCD, bulimia, impulse dyscontrol, and fibromyalgia. …",

      "title": "Animal well-being. II. Stress and distress.",
      "abstract": "The concepts of stress and distress are integral parts of consideration of animal well-being. Generally, stress refers to a state of threatened homeostasis, but precise clinical definitions, causes, and biological measurements have been controversial and confusing. Numerous factors associated with needs, life in captivity, threatening events, or aversive stimuli may threaten homeostasis. An animal's well-being or quality of life is an individual's internal somatic and mental state that is affected by what it knows or perceives; its feelings and motivational state; the responses to internal or external stimuli or environments; interacting variables; and phylogeny and ontogeny. Threats to homeostasis activate a complex pattern of behavioral changes and responses in the central and autonomic nervous and endocrine systems. Some responses can be considered normal adaptive and coping activities, satisfactorily handling the threats and therefore contributing to well-being. Other responses may be considered abnormal, maladaptive, and affective disorders. A persistent threat may lead to prolonged hyperactivity of the neuroendocrine system, which impairs rather than contributes to well-being. Except for extremes, differentiation between normal and abnormal internal states is frequently unclear. Individual adapting and coping styles may be more important than the stimuli in determining the varied responses. In animals, perception of a stimulus or life event is as important as the actual situation or environment. As caregivers, humans may know that an event or situation is no threat, but the animal usually does not function with the same information base as humans. A principal component in controlling an animal's response to an external event is determining how the animal perceives a situation. Mental and biological well-being is more likely to exist in animals if they are familiar with their environment, including social groups, and if they can predict or anticipate changes in the environment.",

However, patients might also simulate conditions that arouse revulsion or rejection and still meet full diagnostic criteria for factitious disorder.

      "title": "Insight across mental disorders: A multifaceted metacognitive phenomenon",
      "abstract": "There is now general agreement that lack of insight is not merely a fundamental aspect of delusions and hallucinations, or just a symptom of psychotic disorders but rather a multi-dimensional construct. Several different components of insight have been proposed and empirically examined during the last three decades, such as the ability to recognize that one has a mental illness, the capacity to relabel unusual mental events as pathological, the specific attribution of one's symptoms to having a mental illness, awareness of illness' consequences, and compliance with treatment.1 Insight impairment is an important prognostic factor in schizophrenia, impacting negatively on medication adherence, treatment outcome, and social functioning.2 Although largely investigated in schizophrenia and other psychoses, insight impairments are observed in many, if not all, mental disorders. Varying levels of awareness of mental illness and/or of specific symptoms are expected in patients with bipolar disorders, Alzheimer disease and other neurocognitive disorders, obsessive-compulsive (OCD) and related disorders.1,3 While in DSM-5 an \"insight\" specifier was incorporated for OCD, body dysmorphic and hoarding disorder, patients' insight has been found ranging from good to absent in other disorders, such as depressive disorders,4 eating disorders,5 and even specific6 and social7 phobias. Moreover, impaired insight is a common reason that many people with clinical depression or anxiety disorders never seek appropriate treatment and most of the people with addictions and personality disorders fail to recognize and address their problems even when the consequences are devastating: personal suffering, broken relationships, and physical health problems. Depending on the disorder and reflecting different conceptual approaches, many different terms are used to describe lack of insight, such as poor self-awareness, denial, anosognosia (mainly in neurological deficits, e.g. hemiplegia), ego-syntonic symptoms, or even self-deception. At any rate, as an aspect of self-knowledge, insight has psychological (defense mechanisms, coping strategies), social and cultural facets. On the other hand, the attitudes and behaviours towards one's illness are products of inference processes and therefore can be influenced by cognitive dysfunctions. Previous research in schizophrenia showed correlations between neurocognitive functions and insight measures but the strength of this association is rather weak.8 Social cognition may be a crucial cognitive determinant of impaired insight in schizophrenia. The correct attitude toward morbid change in oneself relies on the capacity to reflect upon self from the perspective of the other (i.e., \"to see ourselves as others see us\"). This capacity is clearly linked to the ability to understand mental states (e.g., beliefs, knowledge, and intentions) of others, that is, theory of mind or mentalizing. Recent research has shown that mentalizing deficits may substantially contribute to insight impairment in schizophrenia.9 This effect could be further examined in the broader context of patient's failures in metacognition, i.e. the general ability to think about thinking, and their relationships with insight impairment in schizophrenia. Mentalizing and introspection are closely related developmentally and it is yet unclear which one is the primary ability: we are able to understand others and then apply this understanding to ourselves or we are able to reflect on ourselves and then apply this reflection to others. A recent line of research in schizophrenia is based on the distinction introduced by Beck et al10 between clinical insight (i.e., awareness of illness) and cognitive insight, which describes a metacognitive ability, specifically patients' flexibility towards their beliefs, judgements and experiences. The self-report Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS) examines two subcomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what mycomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what my problems are\"), and self-reflectiveness, assessing willingness to accept external feedback and recognition of dysfunctionalreasoning style (e.g. \"Some of the ideas I was certain were true turned out to be false\"). Cognitive insight in thisform describes two related but distinct aspects of metacognition in patients with psychosis, differentially associated withclinical insight, symptoms, treatment outcomes, and functioning.11 Another method for assessment of similar metacognitiveskills also used in schizophrenia is a scale (Metacognition Assessment Scale - Abbreviated, MAS-A) that is administeredthrough a specific interview and examines the capacities of self-reflectivity, understanding of the other individuals'mental states, and using metacognitive knowledge to respond to psychosocial challenges. Lysaker and colleaguesfound recently that metacognitive deficits assessed with MAS-A predict impaired insight in schizophrenia independentof symptoms.12 It is questionable whether BCIS and other methods used so far to assess self-reflection in psychoses arevalid and useful for patients with non-psychotic disorders.11 However, the metacognitive conceptualization of insightmight contribute to a new research framework for insight impairments across mental disorders. According to this approach, poor insight is in part a failure of self-reflection, i.e. the process by which we synthesizeand comprehend ideas about ourselves. This may be due to general deficits in metacognitive abilities (self-reflectivity,mentalizing) or may represent limited, domain-specific, or transient dysfunctions in metacognitive processes. Insight hasto be thought of as a relational concept, that is insight into something: insight into illness, current syndrome, specificsymptoms, pathological personality traits, social difficulties etc.1,3 In an integrated model of insight across mental disorders,aspects of metacognition interacting with multiple other (clinical, neurocognitive, emotional, and social) factorsdetermine patient's ability to correctly process information into self-awareness. The identification of these factors andtheir interactions may be a fruitful field in the research of insight.",

In the context of a factitious disorder, depression can be both a feigned disease and an associated comorbidity. We performed a systematic review to provide an overview of the relationship between factitious disorder and depression, describe the prevalence of depression in factitious disorder, and identify factors that can contribute to the development of depression in patients suffering from factitious disorder.",

      "abstract": "Introducción El sueño es un estado natural y fisiológico rítmico, aparece por la melatonina activada por la oscuridad, esto disminuye la conciencia, inmovilidad, relajación muscular. También está enlazado a la salud integral, un desorden en su patrón o calidad conduce al cambio en el estado de ánimo; el insomnio es el más prevalente y se define como “dificultad persistente en el inicio del sueño que ocurre a pesar de adecuadas oportunidades para el mismo” De la misma forma, los problemas de menoscabo de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión en la población, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, perdida de interés o placer acompañados de sentimientos de culpa o autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. De la misma manera define la ansiedad como “la anticipación temerosa de peligro inminente acompañada de un sentimiento intenso en cualquier región geográfica corporal, implicando un presentimiento de que algo grave le va a pasar”. Los problemas de deterioro de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, culpabilidad, autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. Conforme NANDA Esta investigación tiene como objetivo analizar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en los estudiantes de enfermería de la facultad Ciencias de la Salud de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato. Objetivos Determinar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en os estudiantes de enfermería según NANDA Método La presente investigación es de carácter cuantitativo, no experimental, descriptivo y transversal. Utiliza la recolección de datos con la aplicación de la encuesta del Índice de Calidad de Sueño de Pittsburg sobre la calidad de sueño en su versión en español contando con un alfa de Cronbach del 0.84 garantizando su fiabilidad, es así que la encuesta cuenta con 19 preguntas autoevaluadas y 5 preguntas evaluadas por el acompañante de habitación del paciente si está disponible, en donde los componentes son: calidad subjetiva del sueño, latencia del sueño, duración del sueño, eficiencia del sueño, alteraciones del sueño, uso de medicamentos para dormir y disfunción diurna. La puntuación de cada componente es de 0 al 3, donde 0 es muy bueno y 3 muy malo, solo las preguntas auto aplicadas están incluidas en este puntaje aplicándose en 78 estudiantes de enfermería y su posterior análisis en Excel e IBM SPSS 25. Principales resultados Al enfocarnos en los siete componentes del índice de calidad de sueño de Pittsburg: 1. Calidad subjetiva del sueño: 42,3% de los sujetos de estudio tienen una mala calidad subjetiva del sueño. 2. Latencia de sueño: 41% presentó sensación de dificultad para dormir por lo menos una vez a la semana. 3. Duración del dormir: 6 a 7 horas en un 33,3% es la duración promedio del sueño de la mayoría de los sujetos de estudio es 4. Eficiencia de sueño: 59% de los estudiantes de enfermería tienen una eficiencia del sueño mayor al 85%. 5. Perturbaciones del sueño: 61,5% tiene perturbaciones en el sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana. 6. Uso de medicamentos para dormir: 82,1% de los refieren que no ha tomado medicina para dormir en ninguna ocasión en el último mes. 7. Disfunción diurna: 44,9% de los sujetos de estudio ha tenido disfunción diurna del sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana mientras. Conclusiones En la presente investigación se concluye que los estudiantes de enfermería del ciclo académico octubre 2022 – marzo 2023 de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato presentan deterioro en el patrón del sueño con pocas horas de descanso, interrupción entre el mismo y acompañado de somnolencia; trayendo como consecuencias un leve problema en su energía para realizar actividades cotidianas. A su vez los participantes tienen una dificultad para dormir, problemática que podría acogerse a la automedicación, dado que en el presente estudio si se obtuvo resultados de toma de medicación para dormir y más en personas divorciadas y del género masculino, pudiendo así causar fármaco dependencia en un futuro o el inicio de automedicación de los estudiantes de enfermería.",

However, Self-consciousness is multifaceted: it includes awareness of the body, perceptions, one's own history, identity, and one's own projects. Self-consciousness is linked to consciousness of others i.e. to social cognition supported by identification of others, but also by comprehension of facial expression of emotions, comprehension and expression of emotional prosody, pragmatic abilities, ability to infer other's people's mental states, thoughts, and feelings (theory of mind and empathy), knowledge of social norms and rules, social reasoning. The subtypes of dementias (and namely Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia) affect heterogeneously the different aspects of the self-and other-consciousness. Further studies are needed for a better knowledge of the complex relationship between Self-consciousness, social cognition, decision making and neuropsychiatric symptoms and behavioral disturbances occurring in demented patients.",

      "title": "Psyche, personality and gut functions",
      "abstract": "Abstract Psychological factors are widely held to be important for the orderly function of the gastrointestinal tract as well as for the development and course of disorders affecting the gut. Evidence supporting these assumptions is scarce, although it has become clear that intestinal functions are influenced by the state of central nervous activation, i.e. by satiation, relaxation and sleep as well as hunger, tension and rage. Freud assumed that the accumulation of an unabreacted quota of affect induced defence or repression and a conversion of emotion into bodily symptoms. Subsequently, disorders such as globus sensation, diffuse oesophageal spasm and ‘cardiospasm’ were viewed as conversion symptoms. Other concepts claimed an aetiological role of specific conflicts, certain affective states and ‘inappropriate perpetuations of organ reactions adaptive to, or protective against, some stress in human life’. However, these and other psychosomatic concepts could not be verified. Conversely, an illness exacerbation may precipitate a disruption in a patient's adjustment to his/her environment and interfere with his/her ability to fight the disease. Psychotherapeutic interventions may help patients to cope with their illness and its consequences and possibly alter the course of disease. Psychosocial factors may determine a patient's reactions to, and handling of, a disease and thus should not escape the physician's attention.",

      "abstract": "Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with acute and possible damage. It has a protective role because it protects the body from damage and helps to maintain organ function, the organism as a whole. Pain is one of the world's health problems, the most common causes of pain are injury, surgery, malignancy, and hormonal disorders. Delineation of pain is to: physical, mental and physical psychogenic caused. Physical pain is a symptom for which patients most often asked for medical help, the pain is a warning mechanism to inform that there is a tissue injury or dysfunction of individual organs. Mental pain and suffering often called. It is a state of deep sadness often associated with fear, anxiety and other negative emotions that occur after someone, for the individual, irreparable and significant loss. The relationship between pain and injury is not simple, that is possible: injury without pain, without injury, pain disproportionate to the severity of injury, pain after healing of injuries. Injuries without pain - some people are born without sensitivity to pain. This very rare genetic disorder is known as analgesia. Pain without injury - common in so-called. psychogenic pain where the pain occurs after mental tension and where there are no organic damage. Pain disproportionate the difficulty of injury- may occur in insignificant physical processes that do not have great physical significance for the total health of the individual, and cause very severe pain. The pain after healing injury - very common after injuring nerves and known examples of such pain are phantom pain and causalgia. Causalgia is very severe pain, burning type that occurs because of injury of damage causing their peripheral sensory nerves. Phantom pain is common in people who are missing the lower part of the body (leg, hand, and breast). Patients feel pain in a body part that they amputated therefore no longer exists, and so clearly perceived the pain that they feel that the body is still there. In addition to causing health, physical and mental difficulties, pain significantly affects the economic situation of the individual and society at large, so big attention should be paid to its prevention and cure. The doctor's obligation is to disclose the cause of pain and mitigate / eliminate pain. Access to treatment of chronic pain, sometimes acute, is multidisciplinary and should be administered pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments (physical therapy, TENS, ultrasound, laser, exercise, heat and cold), and sometimes pain treatment methods (acupuncture, chiropractic and other) . While there has been great progress in the treatment of chronic pain, many patients are still suffering because of poor pain assessment and treatment.",

Kelainan fundamental dari gangguan jiwa kelompok ini adalah adanya perubahan yang nyata pada suasana perasaan (mood) atau afek menuju ke arah depresi yang ditandai dengan kemurungan, kelesuan, ketidakgairahan hidup, perasaan tidak berguna, dan putus asa. Seorang wanita usia 24 tahun datang ke poliklinik Rumah Sakit Jiwa Provinsi Lampung dengan keluhan utama merasa sedih yang berlebihan sejak tiga minggu yang lalu setelah dirinya didiagnosis menderita kista folikuler oleh dokter spesialis kandungan. Pasien telah mendapatkan penjelasan bahwa kista tersebut dapat sembuh sendiri apabila pasien memiliki anak lagi, namun pasien tetap merasa khawatir dan tidak bisa melawan rasa sedihnya ketika mengingat kondisinya tersebut. Pasien juga menjadi malas bekerja dan beraktivitas, lebih sering di rumah, dan mengalami gangguan tidur, sakit kepala, serta pegal-pegal pada tubuhnya. Pada pemeriksaan fisik tidak didapatkan kelainan klinis sedangkan pada pemeriksaan psikiatri didapatkan gangguan berupa mood hipotimia dengan afek yang sempit dan serasi, tidak didapatkan gangguan isi pikir dan tidak didapatkan gangguan persepsi. Pasien didiagnosis dengan aksis I: (F.32.11) episode depresif sedang dengan gejala somatik, aksis II: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis III: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis IV: masalah dengan psikososial, dan aksis V: Global Assestment of Functioning (GAF) score 70-61 (pada saat pemeriksaan). Pasien mendapatkan terapi psikofarmaka dengan obat antidepresan golongan Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) Fluoxetin 1x10 mg dan obat antiansietas golongan benzoiazepine Merlopam 2x5 mg yang dikombinasikan dengan psikoterapi suportif Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). Kombinasi pemberian obat tersebut memiliki efek samping yang minimal dan tingkat keberhasilan yang lebih baik. Episode depresif pada pasien ini disebabkan oleh kekhawatiran pasien yang berlebihan terhadap penyakit kista folikel yang dideritanya.

      "abstract": "Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is a disorder that develops in the context of a brain injury or underlying neurological dysfunction. It is characterized as an affective disorder of emotional expression. PBA manifests as frequent uncontrollable outbursts of laughing or crying, incongruent with the individual's internal emotional state. It can be challenging for clinicians to differentiate PBA from mood disorders, contributing to its high rate of misdiagnosis. This lack of recognition leads to ineffective and insufficient treatment, impacting patients' quality of life. The current article provides an overview of PBA, including its history, prevalence, pathophysiology, diagnostic criteria, clinical implications, and treatment.

MHP isclassified as a somatic type of delusional disorder in DSM-IV and is defined as an erroneous conviction of bodily disease, abnormality or alteration. It includes delusional beliefs about bodily sensations or functions; such as feeling malodorous, being infected by parasites, having dysmorphic features, or that a certain organ is no longer functioning. MHP has been divided into 4 main categories: Delusions of infestation (including parasitosis); delusions of dysmorphophobia, such as of misshapenness, personal ugliness, or exaggerated size of body parts (this seems closest to that of body dysmorphic disorder); delusions of foul body odours or halitosis or delusional bromosis (also known as olfactory reference syndrome); and a miscellaneous group.",

      "abstract": "• Summary: Somatoform disorders and functional somatic syndromes are defined as the presence of physical symptoms in the absence of sufficient tissue or organ damage to account for the degree of pain or dysfunction. Many people who suffer from these disorders have a history of childhood abuse. Because these individuals may also have a number of other difficulties in living, social workers encounter such clients in diverse fields of practice. Clients who fall into the category of adult survivors of abuse with a somatoform disorder may experience certain interventions by doctors, therapists, and other helping professionals (including social workers) as repeating interactions they had with their abusers. • Findings: Adult survivors of abuse who have a somatoform disorder often have parallel experiences in terms of their abuse and their somatic symptoms: important others communicate that the abuse and the symptoms are not real, are the client’s fault, and/or that the client is over-reacting to the abuse and symptoms. Furthermore, adult survivors of abuse may experience helping professionals as distinctly non-nurturing and as engaging in distancing behaviours. These interactions may stand in the way of helping members of this population, or even add to the client’s distress. There are specific practices in which the social worker may engage to help avoid these kinds of relations. • Applications: Social workers in a number of fields of practice may be alerted to dynamics common among adult survivors of abuse with a somatoform disorder. In the event that a client falls into this category, the informed social worker can avoid recapitulating abuse dynamics as well as help clients understand their diagnosis and why interactions with helping professionals may have been upsetting.",

      "abstract": "Injury means, in our courts, physical one. The Supreme Court of Korea has sometimes tried to take into account of mental and emotional injuries in determining whether the defendant has imposed `bodily injuries` on the victim. However, it still hesitates to announce that mental injury is a part of bodily injuries. To the contrary, the United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines state that: “bodily injury” means injury involving extreme physical pain or the protracted impairment of a function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty; or requiring medical intervention such as surgery, hospitalization, or physical rehabilitation. Impairment of a function of mental faculty will be counted on finding criminal liability under the guidelines. Too many victims are suffering from mental and emotional injuries after the criminal accident. Typical symptoms are including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder but the victims are not qualified for the compensation from the government. Furthermore, the criminal courts do not care about what has visibly happened on the brains of criminal victims. They are often ignoring recent developments in the neuro-science, which clearly shows that mental defects are resulted from the criminal act on the victims. We need to re-define what is injury. Imposing mental illness on victim must be punished on a charge of injuring. It will help the criminal victims recover from the post-traumatic symptoms and get back to their daily lifes.",

      "abstract": "Traumata, by definition, refer to exterior events that expose a person to experiences of overwhelming threat and catastrophe and elicit feelings of death anxiety, panic, horror, helplessness, loss of personal control, and intractability. Most affected persons respond with at least some distressing symptoms of trauma-related memory intrusions, autonomic hyperarousal, dissociation, and depression in the acute aftermath. Fortunately, the majority of traumatized individuals succeed in coping with this major stress quite well during the following weeks and months unless the process of recovery is hampered by additional adverse psychosocial circumstances, psychological disposition or biological vulnerability. In a subgroup of persons a transition to acute and posttraumatic stress disorder or other major psychiatric disorders, e.g. depressive, anxiety, substance-related disorders may be observed. Posttraumatic stress disorders very often run a chronic course of illness enduring for many years or even life-long. The typical course of illness in PTSD is characterized not only by major psychiatric comorbidities contributing to a dramatically reduced health-related quality of life, to many deficits of psychosocial adaptation and a heightened suicide risk. It is also associated with a lot of major somatic health problems both in acute and long-term stages. The main focus here is on this special dimension of physical comorbidities in posttraumatic disorders. Empirical evidence underscores that trauma exposure, and in particular PTSD is significantly associated with major physical health problems in addition to well-known PTSD-related psychological, behavioural, and psychosocial impairments. Both self-report-based and objective assessments emphasized significantly increased rates of somatoform/functional syndromes and physical comorbidities, premature all-cause and specific mortality rates, heightened medical utilization behaviours, major socioeconomic costs, and reduced health-related quality of life in the aftermath of trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorders, thus defining a major challenge to any medical care system. Complex psycho-behavioural-somatic and somato-psycho-behavioural models are needed to better understand both acute and long-term effects of a perpetuating stress system on physical health.",

Attention to categorical entities such a major depression or anxiety disorders will alert the clinician to comorbid psychiatric disorders that respond to traditional psychiatric treatments. Finally, by assessing the domains of illness behaviors such as disease conviction, beliefs in organic versus psychological causes, and denial, the clinician can document and then confront abnormal cognitive schema that revolve around somatic concerns that are a proxy for psychosocial difficulties.",

When there are evidences of associated functional disturbances in other organ systems or in the patient as a whole, or characteristic clinical syndromes are present, and there is lack of symptomatic or objective evidence of organic disease on careful examination, the diagnosis of functional gastrointestinal disorder is likely. Treatment of functional gastrointestinal disturbances rests fundamentally on the art of medicine in the treatment of the patient and not on the science of medicine in the treatment of a disease. The essential steps in successful treatment include convincing the patient of the diagnosis, improving and relieving symptoms and avoiding or adequately controlling recurrences.Psychotherapy is a keystone in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Not often, however, are the services of a psychiatrist necessary. Given, as needed, mild sedatives, certain forms of specific treatment in specific conditions, general measures and good hygiene and sympathetic understanding, the patient may be expected to recover or improve.",

In particular in younger children, an uncomfortable situation, a psychological problem or an emotional distress is rarely expressed directly but usually through physical symptoms.

      "abstract": "Historically, poor insight and self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia have typically been understood as stemming from psychological defenses or adaptive coping strategies. Perhaps both psychological process and neuropsychological deficit account for the phenomenon of poor insight. Different models of insight exist for different broad categories of mental disorders, like psychotic, neurotic, and neurological, but investigators have increasingly turned their attention to poor insight, as an important feature in schizophrenia. A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don’t know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the meta- representation theory.",

Capgras syndrome is a 'falsely believes' that a close relative or friend has been replaced by doubles or imposters. Whereas the out of body experience -false perception- the subject feels that his/her “self”, or is located outside the physical body and somewhat elevated, from this elevated extra personal location that subject experiences seeing his body and the world. In addition, something's happening to the patient; he experiences an inability to recognize his face in mirror (autoprosopagnosia). All this occurred to an 18-year-old patient who left the hospital one week later post head injury, brought to my office with his father six weeks ago after complete recovering from subdural hematoma in the right frontoparietal lobes, post motorcycle accident.",

      "title": "The nature of emotional abnormalities in schizophrenia: Evidence from patients and high-risk individuals",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that affects about one out of 100 people with symptoms generally emerging in early adulthood. According to the DSM-IV, schizophrenia is characterized by psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behavior or speech and negative symptoms such as flattening of affect. Psychotic symptoms such as hallucination and delusions are regarded as particularly characteristic for schizophrenia, although they may also occur in other psychiatric disorders. Besides these psychotic symptoms, which are often treatable with antipsychotic medication, people with schizophrenia experience negative symptoms (social withdrawal, affective flattening, apathy, alogia) and cognitive disturbances, e.g. memory dysfunction, attention problems, and emotional dysfunction. It are mainly these latter problems that cause that the majority of people with schizophrenia are unable to built up a social network, career and romantic relationships, making it one of the most invalidating psychiatric disease. Currently, the prevalent idea is that emotion processing is generally deficient in schizophrenia. Thus, the emphasis is solely on reductions or impairments. However, some studies suggest that schizophrenia is associated with a reduced ability to perceive and express emotions, with at the same time intact or even heightened emotional experience. This disjunction between emotional processes in schizophrenia was investigated in more detail. Second, this thesis dealt with investigating the presence of emotional abnormalities in individuals high on the schizophrenia spectrum continuum. Emotional abnormalities in people at high-risk for schizophrenia are hypothesized, because emotional abnormalities appear to be a core feature of schizophrenia and would therefore be expected to be present to a certain degree in high-risk individuals. Finally, we investigated the influence of social-emotional aspects on other cognitive functions, such as decision-making, in patients with schizophrenia and individuals at high-risk for schizophrenia. The most important findings are that emotional abnormalities appear to be central to schizophrenia and are also present in individuals with a liability for schizophrenia-like traits or an increased genetic risk. This suggests that emotional abnormalities can be regarded as a vulnerability marker for schizophrenia. However, these emotional abnormalities do not reflect an overall reduction in all aspect of emotion processing, i.e. perception, expression, experience and psychophysiology. Instead, schizophrenia patients and individuals at high risk report normal or higher levels of emotional experience, whereas the expression of emotions appears deficient. With respect to the perception of emotion, results depend on the type of processing that occurs, i.e. automatic, incidental processing or controlled, elaborative processing of affective information. These findings suggest a disjunction between deficits in elaborative processing of emotions on the one hand, and normal or increased emotional reactivity on the other hand. Moreover, deficits in the perception and expression of emotions appear to be consistently related to negative symptoms, such as blunted affect and social emotional withdrawal. In addition, positive symptoms might be related to an increased subjective emotional arousal. The finding of a particular pattern of emotional abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia and individuals at high risk for schizophrenia could give clues about the underlying brain pathology and ultimately the development of treatment strategies that selectively target those brain systems.",

Psychoanalytic observation of psychosomatic patients (and others as well) reveals that the inability to name, recognize, contain or work through one's affective states is frequently one manifestation of defensive structures of a psychotic kind (more radical than denial which deals with certain neurotic anxieties). Such massive defense has been created as a bulwark against various dangers, such as (1) psychotic anxieties (fear of mental or physical fragmentation; loss of identity-feeling; danger of uncontrollable, explosive action); (2) profound perturbation concerning the narcissistic self-image and its fluctuations, and (3) pathological formation of the ego-ideal structure concerning affective experience. All of these may contribute to the creation of alexithymic defects.",

Multimodal treatment approaches implementing family and social supports, psychoeducation, and cognitive behavioral techniques have the strongest evidence base.

Pain is a subjective experience that cannot be measured or “objectively” verified by other individuals. Reactions to pain, however, can be registered by others. Pain in the orofacial area may have several etiological explanations. Since the functional pattern of the area is multi‐faceted, persisting pain in the area most likely has a multi‐factorial background, and also a variety of effects. Treatment should be made considering delicate diagnostical distinctions. A thorough clinical examination contains lots of treatment components. This paper discusses some psychological factors in the diagnosis and treatment of orofacial pain.",

This chapter also discusses how to differentiate BDD from normal appearance concerns and from problematic preoccupation with obvious physical defects. BDD is commonly misdiagnosed as another mental disorder. Sometimes misdiagnosis occurs because patients are too embarrassed and ashamed to reveal their appearance concerns; in such cases, BDD symptoms that are more readily observable (such as social anxiety) may be assigned an incorrect diagnosis while BDD goes undetected. In other cases, BDD symptoms are recognized but are misdiagnosed as another disorder. BDD must be differentiated from other conditions so appropriate treatment can be instituted.",

However, the physiotherapist often detects physical signs in these patients: changes in posture, holding breath, tense and hard musculature, and poor balance. The findings are dependent on what is being sought. The view of the body as ambiguous, as something a person has and is, can shed light on the way life has left its traces in the body, such as changes in posture and poor balance. In this article it will be argued that combining a physiotherapeutic, a phenomenological, and a biological perspective can make chronic muscular pain more comprehensible. Chronic muscular pain can be perceived not as a sign representing a symbol of underlying factors but rather as a sign understood as an expression of the bodily state.",

      "abstract": "O presente estudo teve como objetivo fornecer informações sobre a fisiopatologia, manifestações clínicas e os impactos físicos, sociais e emocionais que influenciam na qualidade de vida de idosos portadores doença de Parkinson. A doença de Parkinson é considerada uma enfermidade neurodegenerativa crônica e progressiva que limita a independência nas atividades funcionais e na qualidade de vida dos pacientes podendo causar uma série de desafios. Apresenta sintomatologia complicada, com disfunções de ordem motora, como fortes tremores de mãos, pés e corpo, rigidez muscular, alterações posturais, desequilíbrio, incontinência urinária, alterações na fala, entre outros. É caracterizada, também, por manifestações não motoras, como as sensitiva-sensoriais, autonômicas, afetivas, cognitivas, comportamentais e do sono, que poderão causar incapacidades e contribuir com a dependência do portador. A qualidade de vida atua como um indicador nos conceitos clínicos de doenças específicas por meio da avaliação do impacto físico e psicossocial que algumas enfermidades podem gerar, possibilitando assim um melhor conhecimento do paciente e de sua adaptação a determinada condição. Devido à possibilidade de incapacidade produzida pelos sintomas da doença, é fundamental a adoção de estratégias para melhorar a qualidade de vida dos portadores, como adoção de recursos terapêuticos complementares.

Two forms of this syndrome have been identified on the basis of etiopathological mechanisms of the syndrome, namely organic twilight states and psychogenic or affectogenic twilight states.

The following elements of this circle are explained: Physical (symptoms, signs, findings), beliefs (thoughts, cognitive processes and cognitive schemas), feelings (emotions), behaviour (all we say and do) and the so-called X-factor, which represents everything we do not know. The model might help us in our relationship to the patients, and can be used both in connection with known somatic disease and with conditions with a multifactorial genesis, like somatoform disorders.",

      "title": "Basal Ganglia Disease And Depression",
      "abstract": "Abstract Diseases of the basal ganglia are quintessential neuropsychiatric disorders, characterized by abnormal movements, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric symptoms and signs. Depression is common in these illnesses and may occur at presentation or during the course of the illness. Individuals may present to the psychiatrist before seeing a neurologist. Depression is an important target for research, as it affords a unique perspective on the pathophysiology of basal ganglia diseases as well as an alternative method of understanding the biology of mood disorders. Traditionally, basal ganglia diseases are diagnosed and treated by neurologists, who define their onset by specific motor manifestations. Psychiatric symptomatology has been considered peripheral to the understanding of the motor disorders that define basal ganglia diseases. There is growing evidence for the contrary view that mood and affect are integrally related to the evolution of these diseases. For example, in diseases such as Huntington’s disease or Wilson’s disease, where the genetic mutation has been identified, it is possible to identify presymptomatic individuals, prior to the development of motor signs, who are unaware of their genetic status, and determine whether cognitive or psychiatric manifestations occur more often in gene-positive than in genenegative individuals. Another way to examine the role of psychiatric impairment is to study individuals in the general population who have undergone psychiatric assessments and to determine if individuals with a history of affective disorder are more likely to develop specific basal ganglia diseases (e.g., Parkinson’s disease) than individuals without mood disorders. This chapter includes a review of the epidemiology, prevalence, and correlates of depression in basal ganglia diseases and their treatment.",

An anxiety state is characterized by subjective feelings of tension, apprehension, nervousness and worry, and by activation (arousal) and discharge of the autonomic nervous system. Calmness and serenity indicate the absence of anxiety; tension, apprehension and nervousness accompany moderate levels of anxiety; intense feelings of fear, fright and panic are indicative of very high levels of anxiety.

      "title": "Disability and mental illness are different entities and should be assessed separately",
      "abstract": "The acceptance of the conceptual position presented by Üstün and Kennedy is of great importance for psychiatry and for medicine as a whole. Disability — whether defined as a functional impairment in terms of the DSM-IV or as a limitation of an individual's activities as is done in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) 1 — must be assessed separately and not as a part of the individual's mental illness. It would be wrong to make the diagnosis dependent on the presence or absence of disability. Disability is produced by mental disorder, but it also depends on simultaneously present comorbid diseases or impairments. The latter is becoming a consideration of growing importance. A significant proportion of people with mental illness also suffer from physical illnesses and it is therefore difficult if not impossible to assess to what an extent the disability is caused by the mental disorder and to what extent it is produced by the comorbid conditions. Disability must refer to the person who suffers from a disease (or diseases), lives in a particular setting, receives a particular treatment and has personality traits that define the way in which he or she will live with a disease. Assets that a person with a disease might have — be it an artistic gift or access to wealth — will also affect the occurrence and severity of disability. The realization that the disability is linked to the person and not to the disease is of significance in developing rehabilitation services, in assessing the levels of support that society will offer to the disabled person and in determining what treatment can be offered if a disease occurs. Psychopathological findings define diagnosis but must be complemented by other assessments if they are to help in the estimation of \"caseness\" relevant to the provision of services or the estimation of needs for them. \"Caseness\" will be defined taking into account the psycho-pathological findings, the disability and the distress that the individual presents and relates to his or her medical/psychiatric condition. Persons with a particular psychiatric diagnosis can become \"cases\" for the mental health services when their disability is more pronounced (e.g., because of changes of the environment) or when their distress is enhanced (e.g., by learning about the prognosis of their condition). In clinical work and for research purposes, the assessment of the presence of a disorder, of disability and of distress must be accompanied by an estimate of their severity. The severity of the disease is usually assessed with reference to the numbers and the frequency of occurrence of symptoms, the severity of disability by the type and number of activities in which the individual cannot take part, and the severity of distress on the basis of analogy with states that the distressed individual and the diagnostician both know and have experienced. Severity can be measured as a dimension or as a feature that divides into several operationally defined categories. The same is true for disability and for distress, but not for the psychopathological symptoms, which must have features that make them recognizable as being qualitatively different from normal functioning. Severity of distress and severity of disability are usually correlated with the severity of the clinical syndrome, but this is not always the case. Distress might be linked to the vision of the future rather than to the level of disability or the severity of the clinical condition. The possibility that a black wart might be a melanoma will cause great distress although there are no limitations of activity and no certainty that the wart contains cells that are malignant or that it will be growing rapidly. The severity of disability might be linked to the severity of the clinical picture, but this is also not so for most of the time a person has a disease — with the exception of the most severe states of the disorder, for example in profound dementia or in a coma. People with a variety of psychopathological symptoms are often living in their community, with little or no limitation of their activity. The usefulness of the framework presented above for research purposes depends on the possibility of measuring syndromes, disability, distress and their severity in reliable and valid ways. The development of instruments that will help researchers to do this is clearly a major challenge for the ICD and the DSM committees. The usefulness of the same framework for clinical practice will depend on making the need for these measurements explicit and on training practitioners in making the necessary assessments. Practitioners have used the four dimensions mentioned above in dealing with people who came to ask for their help ever since medicine has been invented. A study of the way in which clinicians are operating may give precious information about their methods of assessment, which, when combined with results of research using valid and reliable assessment instruments, might allow the creation of training programmes that will make the classification of diseases accepted and used as a basis for research and for practice.",

The threshold for perceiving the internal body state as abnormal varies and depends particularly on psychological influences. As a result, a symptom can either reflect pathology, whether serious or not, or be generated wholly psychologically. Intuition allowing discrimination between these possibilities is central to the physician9s art. Particular difficulty arises in differentiating between those psychologically generated symptoms which are produced unconsciously, often as a result of anxiety or depression, and those that constitute deliberate deception. Such malingering has the unstated intent of accessing a secondary gain, such as welfare benefit. The art of diagnosis includes estimation of whether symptoms resonate with known pathophysiological processes, using history-taking as a story which unfolds logically towards a diagnosis, assessing how a patient reacts to their symptoms compared to neutral matters, detecting exaggeration or falsification, and documenting evidence of psychologically generated abnormalities during examination. Scientific ability is only one of the attributes of a good diagnostician; equally important are abilities to notice things, to weigh up human nature and to recognise dilemmas.

Mais, nous pouvons être confrontés à d’authentiques symptômes psychiatriques, ce qui va conduire à la notion de deuil pathologique. La liste des symptômes psychiatriques est encore mal connue des non-spécialistes : – de la réaction dépressive à l’épisode dépressif sévère avec idées de suicide, voire un suicide tenté, plus rarement abouti ; – de la phase d’hyperactivité à l’authentique épisode maniaque ; – du trouble fonctionnel à la maladie psychosomatique, voire à la conversion hystérique ; – de la manifestation anxieuse passagère à la grande crise d’angoisse, voire au trouble anxieux généralisé ; – des manifestations phobiques, des conduites à risque, des addictions ou des automutilations. Tous ces symptômes auront des expressions différentes selon l’âge : par exemple, des manifestations d’opposition ou de phobie scolaire chez l’enfant ou l’adolescent ou bien une dépression d’allure démentielle chez la personne âgée. Lorsque des symptômes psychiatriques sont présents, la conduite à tenir qui sera adoptée sera d’évaluer ces troubles (parfois avec des échelles) et surtout de les relier à la dynamique du chemin de deuil.

Ein starker Wunsch oder eine Art Zwang zu spielen bzw. zu wetten. 2. Verminderte Kontrollfähigkeit bezüglich des Beginns, der Beendigung und der Dauer des Spielens bzw. Wettens. 3. Auftreten eines Entzugssyndroms bei Beendigung oder Reduktion des Spielens bzw. Wettens, nachgewiesen durch suchtspezifische Entzugssymptome oder durch die Aufnahme der gleichen oder einer nahe verwandten Tätigkeit, um Entzugssymptome zu mildern oder zu vermeiden. 4. Nachweis einer Toleranz. um die ursprünglich durch niedrige Dosen erreichten Wirkungen des Spielens bzw. Wettens hervorzurufen, sind zunehmend höhere Dosen erforderlich (ein Beispiel hierfür sind die steigenden „Tagesdosen“ von Spielern, die bei Konsumenten ohne Toleranzentwicklung schon zu einem Aufhören wegen schwerer Beeinträchtigungen, wie z.B. psycho-soziale, finanzielle oder Beziehungsprobleme, führen würden). 5. Vernachlässigung von Interessen zugunsten des Spielens, erhöhter Zeitaufwand, um zu spielen bzw. zu wetten, bzw. entsprechende finanzielle Mittel zu beschaffen, oder sich von den Folgen zu erholen. 6. Anhaltendes Spielen bzw. Wetten trotz Nachweises eindeutiger schädlicher Folgen, wie z.B. finanzieller Schädigung durch exzessives Spielen.",

      "abstract": "Exposure to overwhelming stress often determines how people subsequently organize their perceptions of themselves and of others. Traumatic experiences at different developmental levels have different effects on cognitive, affective and biological self-organization. Acute or chronic exposure to trauma may be expressed as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), dissociative disorders, somatic disturbances and alterations in perception of self and others. These disorders involve (a) the involuntary repetitive re-living of the trauma in thoughts, images, somatic states or behaviors, (b) attempts to avoid dealing with reminders of the past, (c) problems with the modulation of physiological responses to subsequent stress, and (d) a loss of capacity to engage in love and work with pleasure and satisfaction. The display of extremes of emotional distress, or of bizarre or disorganized behaviors, easily obscures the fact that current problems may have their origins in past trauma. The recognition that many psychiatric patients organize much of their lives around repetitive patterns of re-living and warding off traumatic memories, reminders and affective states, may help clinicians understand their symptoms as misguided attempts to regain a sense of control and safety, rather than as bizarre behaviors that need to be merely controlled. Since safe attachments appear to be the primary way in which children learn to regulate internal state changes, the negotiation of interpersonal safety needs to be the first focus of treatment. Since the labeling and categorization of emotional states is one of the principal areas of functioning that is disrupted by developmental trauma, treatment needs to include learning how to use words to understand and interpret feelings in general and stressful events, in particular. Since distrust and lack of social safety are critical parts of developmental trauma, structure and predictability are essential. Identifying specific trauma-based perceptions and expectations and learning how to negotiate the fulfillment of one's emotional needs are critical aspects of effective treatment.",

The complications of occupational exposure to neurotoxins and putative neurotoxins are also covered in so far as they relate to the fitness of an exposed employee to continue working. In addition to a few well-known and common conditions, many uncommon but distinct neurological disorders may present at work or affect work capacity. Fitness for work in these disorders will be determined by the person’s functional abilities, any co-morbid illness, the efficacy or side effects of the treatment, and psychological and social factors, rather than by the precise diagnosis. This will also need to be put into the context of the job in question, as the basic requirements for a manual labouring job may be completely different from something more intellectually demanding. Indeed, even an apparently precise diagnostic label such as multiple sclerosis can encompass a complete spectrum of disability, from someone who is entirely asymptomatic to another who is totally incapacitated. Furthermore, reports by general practitioners, neurologists, or neurosurgeons may describe the symptoms, signs, and investigations in detail, but without analysing functional abilities. These colleagues may also fail to appreciate the workplace hazards, the responsibilities of the employer, or what scope exists for adaptations to the job or workplace.",

You do not need to perform a detailed neurological exam to make the diagnosis. The neurological exam is usually unremarkable except for immediately after the concussion. No exam findings “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. A collateral source is key to obtaining a reliable history. The impairment in brain function occurs immediately after the event. The impairment is worst immediately after the event, then gradually improves. There is no other obvious explanation for the impairment.",

      "abstract": "Unlike acute pain that warns us of injury or disease, chronic or persistent pain serves no adaptive purpose. Though there is no agreed on definition of chronic pain, it is commonly referred to as pain that is without biological value, lasting longer than the typical healing time, not responsive to treatments based on specific remedies, and of a duration greater than 6 months. Chronic pain that is severe and intractable has detrimental consequences, including psychological distress, job loss, social isolation, and, not surprisingly, it is highly comorbid with depression and anxiety. Historically, pain without an apparent anatomical or neurophysiological origin was labelled as psychopathological. This approach is damaging to the patient and provider alike. It pollutes the therapeutic relationship by introducing an element of mutual distrust as well as implicit, if not explicit, blame. It is demoralizing to the patient who feels at fault, disbelieved, and alone. Moreover, many medically unexplained pains are now understood to involve an interplay between peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms that have gone awry. The new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, somatic symptom disorder overpsychologizes people with chronic pain; it has low sensitivity and specificity, and it contributes to misdiagnosis, as well as unnecessary stigma. Adjustment disorder remains the most appropriate, accurate, and acceptable diagnosis for people who are overly concerned about their pain.",

Further, consciousness of actions (voluntariness) and consciousness of motives (intentionality) are not necessarily associated. Illness behavior can be learned and reinforced and is a potential confounder in the association between illness or injury and impairment or disability. Illness behavior is not an impairing condition according to the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), and a table in the article describes the characteristics of the symptom magnification syndrome and other related conditions. Three diagnoses—somatic symptom disorders, illness anxiety disorder, and conversion disorder—possibly are ratable using the AMA Guides . Unsupported and insupportable conclusions regarding symptom exaggeration represent substandard practice because of the importance of such conclusions to the disposition of patients who present for assessment of impairment or disability. Similarly, failure to note and account for illness behavior and symptom exaggeration also represent substandard practice because the goal in impairment ratings is to note and account for all evidence related to the impairment, including the extent of illness behaviors.",

The following disorders can be distinguished: --psychogenic amnesia: partial or complete loss of memory --psychogenic trance: temporary loss of habitual identity with more or less full awareness of surroundings --psychogenic fugue: apparently purposeful journey away from home with psychogenic amnesia --psychogenic stupor: profound diminuation or absence of voluntary movement and no responsiveness to external stimuli.",

The kind of disease which those alcoholics who support the disease concept have in mind is something which would describe a condition preceding their drinking, something constitutional, that is to say, present from their earliest days, and therefore likely to be in the nature of a biochemical or psychological abnormality.

It produces severe detrimental effects on patients’ daily functioning and social and occupational life like other mental illnesses. Severe distress and traumatic life circumstances are identified as the main causes of this illness, which are converted into symptoms in individuals. Patients showed ignorance of his symptoms even though these were severe and distressful which was called La-belle indifference. However, it was not shown by many patients, so it was removed from the diagnostic criteria of this illness. Dissociative conversion disorder is associated with many other mental health conditions like anxiety disorder and depression.

      "title": "Psychogene Bewegungsstörungen - Klinische Präsentation",
      "abstract": "Psychogene Bewegungsstörungen machen bis zu 5% aller Bewegungsstörungen in spezialisierten Ambulanzen aus. Akuter Beginn der Erkrankung, variable Ausprägung der Symptomatik, Ablenkbarkeit und spezielle klinische Provokationsmanöver helfen bei der Diagnosestellung. So weisen ein akuter Beginn des Tremors oder aber auch eine spontane Remission, eine rasche Verschlechterung mit Ausbreitung auf den gesamten Körper mit anschließendem statischen Verlauf auf eine mögliche psychogene Ursache hin. Die Schilderung der Symptome durch den Patienten kann entweder von einer „belle indifférence“, d.h. mit einer abnormen Gleichgültigkeit gegenüber der Schwere der Erkrankung vorgetragen werden, die der Behinderung nicht angemessen erscheint. Der psychogene Tremor fällt durch die Variabilität in Amplitude und Frequenz auf, außerdem tritt er eher am Unterarm als an den Fingern auf, zeigt somit einen abnehmenden Gradienten von proximal nach distal. Manche Formen fallen auch durch eine bizarr anmutende Ausgestaltung oder eine an eine Tätigkeit erinnernde Form auf (Teigrührer-Tremor). Der Distraktionstest macht sich die Tatsache zunutze, dass die meisten organischen Bewegungsstörungen unter mentaler Anspannung eher zu- als abnehmen. Beim kontralateralen Aktivierungstest wird der Patient aufgefordert, eine Position einzunehmen, in der der Tremor am stärksten ausgeprägt ist. Dann soll er mit der nicht-tremorösen Hand auf einen vorher vereinbarten Punkt zeigen. Bei Bewegungsstart kommt es zu einem kurzfristigen Sistieren des Tremors auf der kontralateralen Seite. Dieses Sistieren tritt sowohl beim Parkinson-Tremor als auch beim essentiellen Tremor nicht auf. Beim Entrainment-Test fordert man den Patienten auf, einen Takt mit einer Hand zu klopfen, dessen Frequenz vorgegeben und variiert wird. Ein psychogener Tremor wird in der Regel aus dem Rhythmus gebracht werden, kurzfristig sistieren oder sich an den Klopf-Rhythmus anpassen.",

One of the most curious is misidentification of self in which the individual perceives himself or herself as another being while able to explain the loss of the original identity. Recognizing these phenomena may be helpful in accurate diagnosis, in considering such conditions as psychosis of whatever type, multiple personality disorder, and other amnesia and fugue states, and in understanding the person's psychopathology. Two cases are presented to illustrate a process that the authors have named the Riel Phenomenon, after the person who was a party to what is often recognized as the most famous case in Canadian history.",

      "abstract": "Interaction uneasiness of people with Parkinson’s disease .Human beings not only speak but also express their thoughts and emotions through facial expressions. People also relate to each other in interaction by watching each other’s facial expressions. The face of people with Parkinson’s disease gradually rigidifies as a consequence of a lack of dopamine production in the brain. This life story research with people with Parkinson’s disease shows that they appear to feel impeded in their interactions with others. In their stories, the informants show five signs of what Goffman labels as ‘interaction uneasiness’. Firstly, people with the disease themselves show difficulties with expressing their inner feelings and thoughts. Secondly, they perceive signs of uneasiness in others. Thirdly, they perceive uneasiness in their interactions. Fourthly, they perceive uneasiness in the eyes of third parties. And fifthly, they feel their face does not suit in the situation they are in. In the life stories indications of three conditions of this uneasiness have been found. The primary condition is difference in labelling, either caused by the lack of a label for the unusual face, or the fear that others might interpret their rigidified facial expressions wrongly. The secondary condition is a lack of culture: lack of culture for the uncommon and lack of knowledge of the culture of Parkinson’s disease. The third condition is the minimal legitimation work undertaken by people with the disease.As a consequence of the uneasiness in interaction, people with Parkinson’s disease are inclined to five different reactions: resistance, indifference, retreat from public interactional situations as well as feelings of exclusion and banishment. Parkinson’s disease thus appears to be a threat to customary social life for people with the disease.",

The hypochondriacal patient misunderstands and misinterprets personal bodily experience as indicative of serious disease, when in fact there is no serious pathology present. This raises a fundamental question: What, exactly, is the sensory experience of hypochondriacal individuals? Does their perceptual experience differ from that of non hypochondriacal patients; or alternatively, do they describe the same perceptual experience differently because they label and report bodily distress and sensation in more distressing and disturbing terms?",

In DSM system, such reactive disorders are listed as adjustment disorder, acute stress disorder, brief psychotic disorder with marked stressor and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, a growing number of individuals is suffering from a prolonged feeling of embitterment after exceptional negative life events and this condition could be diagnosed neither PTSD nor adjustment disorder nor depressive disorder in the context of DSM-IV diagnostic system. This clinical condition can be described as 'posttraumatic embitterment disorder' (PTED). PTED is a reactive disorder triggered by exceptional, though normal negative life events such as conflict in the workplace, unemployment, death of a relative, divorce, severe illness, or experience of loss or separation. The common feature of such events is that they are experienced as unjust, as a personal insult, accompanied by psychological violation of basic beliefs and values. The central psychopathological response pattern in PTED is a prolonged feeling of embitterment. In particular, the core emotion of embitterment can lead to the rejection of treatment. Therefore, wisdom therapy as a new treatment approach specifically designed for PTED has been developed. It is assumed that many patients suffering from PTED are often misunderstood and misdiagnosed. This review would help to introduce PTED into the clinical field in psychiatry.】",

      "title": "Schizotypy, schizotypic psychopathology and schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "The term schizotypy refers to a latent personality organization that putatively harbors the liability for schizophrenia and can give rise to a variety of schizophrenia-related phenotypic outcomes1, 2. This personality organization, which is determined by any number of as-yet-unknown schizophrenia-related genetic influences acting against a background of polygenic assets and liabilities as well as impacts from the environment (e.g., stressors, epigenetic inputs), can manifest itself variously at the phenotypic level, ranging from clinically diagnosable schizophrenia through pathological personality manifestations (e.g., schizotypal, paranoid, avoidant and schizoid personality disorders) to subtle, sub-clinical psychotic-like phenomenology (e.g., perceptual aberrations, magical ideation, referential thinking, interpersonal aversiveness). Schizotypy may also manifest itself in an imperceptible manner, undetectable by the unaided naked eye, through deviance on endophenotypes that have established valid relations with schizophrenia. Moreover, schizotypy as a latent construct (personality organization) is centrally embedded in a diathesis-stressor theoretical model that has considerable utility as an organizing framework for the study of schizophrenia, schizophrenia-related psychopathology (e.g., delusional disorder, psychosis not otherwise specified, schizotypal, paranoid and other related personality disorders) as well as putative schizophrenia endophenotypes, a view I have advocated for several decades3-6. Note, the term schizotypy is not restricted to describe only those clinical manifestations that are associated with schizotypal personality disorder2, 5, 6. Nor is the term reserved to indicate a methodological preference, e.g. for self-report psychometric assessments. Rather, schizotypy can be assessed using a variety of approaches such as interviews, psychometric inventories, familial risk and/or laboratory measures. Schizotypic persons may indeed display some of the phenomenology associated with schizotypal personality disorder, but they may also show other features6-8. There is a long history of describing clinical states bearing the imprint of schizotypy and an implicit connection to schizophrenia liability, including observations by Kraepelin, Bleuler, Rado, Meehl, Gottesman and myself. It has been argued that a clear demarcation in an underlying schizophrenia liability continuum (e.g., a pronounced threshold effect or discontinuity) is required to explain the emergence of schizotypic indicators in psychological functioning. An alternative position regarding schizotypy holds that it is a dimension of normal personality, not necessarily connected to schizophrenia liability, and representing something of a \"healthy\" personality factor. However, observers of schizophrenia and schizotypic psychopathology, in the main, do not view schizotypy as benign or reflective of healthy psychological adjustment. Non-psychotic schizotypic states (defined using clinical, laboratory and/or familial risk) have been associated with a wide range of findings, including sustained attention deficits, working memory deficits, smooth pursuit eye movement dysfunction, schizophrenia-related psychometric deviance on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), executive functioning deficits, dysfunctional anti-saccade performance, subtle formal thought disorder, clinical schizotypal and paranoid personality features, schizophrenia-related social cognition deficits, exteroceptive and proprioceptive somatosensory deficits, psychomotor abnormalities, and candidate polymorphisms (e.g., ZNF804A, Val158Met-COMT, neuregulin-1). That schizotypic persons manifest such a panorama of deficits, similar in nature albeit less in degree to those seen in schizophrenia, argues for a connection or common underlying construct for conditions defined phenotypically (i.e., schizotypic subjects vs. schizophrenia-affected subjects). An area of continued speculation concerns the underlying structure of schizotypy and the precise nature of the variation expressed in that latent construct. Considerable statistical evidence, using a variety of latent structure methods, points to the existence of possible underlying discontinuities or severe threshold effects in schizotypy, and work in this area continues. Such evidence stimulates the caveat, to wit, that the use of continuous measures to assess phenotypic manifestations of schizotypy does not ipso facto mean that the underlying (or latent) schizotypy construct is fully quantitative or uniformly graded by degree. The course and clinical outcome for those designated as harboring schizotypy remains an area of active inquiry. It is entirely conceivable that many individuals possessing schizotypy may traverse the life course escaping psychotic illness as well as other diagnosable schizotypic manifestations. The expectation that some people validly at risk for schizophrenia may never manifest the illness is well established in the reality of discordant monozygotic twins, in which one twin is affected by schizophrenia and the co-twin is not psychotic (perhaps not even diagnosable as having a non-psychotic, but detectable, clinical schizotypic condition like schizotypal or paranoid personality disorder). Individuals that achieve elevated scores on psychometric measures of schizotypy have been shown to be at increased risk for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-related psychoses later in life, as well as a variety of other related outcomes. Such individuals also display poorer psychosocial functioning, lower rates of marriage, increased use of psychiatric medications, and increased utilization of psychiatric services2. It is entirely conceivable that many individuals designated as \"prodromal\" for schizophrenia, but who do not convert to schizophrenia (which is 60-70% of such subjects), are in fact harboring schizotypy and will, even if not psychotic, show impairments across the life span, perhaps adopting an eccentric or odd manner of personality functioning. The schizotypy model has helped to adjust the boundaries of schizophrenia phenotype in the DSM-5 (e.g., schizotypal pathology is now included with schizophrenia). Furthermore, illuminating the nature of schizotypy may aid in unraveling the current puzzle of the very low conversion to schizophrenia rates seen in \"prodromal\" schizophrenia research9. Finally, I have argued that the schizotypy framework may be useful in understanding configurations (rather than simple additive summation) of genes relevant to schizophrenia variants2, an idea that is beginning to gain traction. There is no doubt that incorporation of schizotypy indicators into genomic studies of schizophrenia increase their statistical power. The advantages of a cleaner unit of analysis (the schizotype), free from the effects of medication, institutionalization and neurocognitive decline, are axiomatic. However, the understanding (and misunderstanding) of the schizotypy model as well as alternative approaches to the construct require vigilance, in order to ensure that the approach continues to yield the fruit that it can.

Symptoms of pain, weakness, paresthesia, or palsy; physical exam findings; electromyography; and nerve conduction studies are used to make the diagnosis.

Recent findings There is now solid evidence that essential tremor, however defined, is a syndrome with multiple causes. Summary A new tremor classification scheme is being developed by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Task Force on Tremor. In this scheme, tremor in the absence of other neurological signs is called isolated tremor, and tremor in combination with other signs is called combined tremor. Many isolated and combined tremor syndromes can be defined on the basis of commonly recurring or unique clinical symptoms and signs, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution) and tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition, associated features). Essential tremor, however defined, is simply a syndrome and not a specific disease. Essential tremor should be defined and used consistently, or this term should be abandoned. As essential tremor is an arbitrarily defined syndrome, it makes no sense to refer to other tremors as variants of essential tremor or essential tremor syndromes.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a mental disorder with a wide range of changes in mental functions, primarily affectivity, and is manifested by dysphoric mood and reductive changes in cognitive, conative and other psychic dynamisms, with the presence of psychosomatic disorders and suicidal thoughts.There is always a triad of symptoms involved: alteration of affectivity, anhedonia and low energy with fatigue, but in it’s clinical picture there are other symptoms, such as guilt and powerlessness, obsession with “ black thoughts “ with loss of self – confidence, with hopelessness, loss of apetite, and weight loss with insomnia or hypersomnia present and more frequent thoughts of death because of worthlessness in life.Severe depressive disorder is not a homogenous mental disorder but a complex of clinical fenomena with subtypes, it is a series of special syndromes or clinical forms arranged continuously from lower to highest intensity of psychopathological clinical signs with or without psychoticisam to a high degree of risk for suicide. Severe depression also occurs as a comorbid illness with other mental illnesses and usually gets a chronic course.The Report of the World Health Organization from 2015 can be concluded that the Republic of Northern Macedonia has not submitted data on the prevalence and incidence of Severe Depressive Disorder. The presented data on a global level indicate that in the world and in the Balkan 7.5 % of patients are treated in hospital.

      "title": "[Medically unexplained symptoms].",
      "abstract": "Patients with physical symptoms for which no medical explanation can be found are relatively common in general practice. Patients with medically unexplained symptoms are frequently frustrating to physicians both in primary and secondary care and utilize health sources disproportionately. They frequently attend both primary care units and hospitals and are usually not satisfied with the care they receive. Medically unexplained symptoms in patient populations are strongly associated with psychiatric pathology and with anxiety and depression in particular. They are also linked to personality pathology, childhood adversity, adult trauma or medically unexplained symptoms in childhood. The predictive value of alexithymia in determining these symptoms is controversial. Patients who have high negative affectivity or neuroticism tend to score high on measures of physical symptoms. These symptoms have a high degree of co-occurrence. The same person may meet the diagnostic criteria for several functional somatic syndromes simultaneously. The clinician should be aware of the cultural and social shaping of the bodily experience of these patients and hence acknowledge the somatic nature and reality of the symptoms. The clinician should make the person feel understood and establish a positive collaborative relationship. This would enable him/her to correct misconceptions about the disease and give a positive explanation of symptoms. Antidepressant therapy and cognitive-behavioural psychotherapy have been proved to be moderately effective in this group of patients. Because of the high disability that might be caused by these symptoms, psychiatrists and primary and secondary care physicians should pay careful attention to this clinical condition. These symptoms may also aid us in challenging the long-held idea of mind-body dualism which is inherent in Western biomedicine.",

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe and complex disorder precipitated by exposure to a psychologically distressing event. PTSD first appeared in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM-III) in 1980,1,,2 arising from studies of the Vietnam war, and of civilian victims of natural and man-made disasters.3,,4 However, the study of PTSD dates back more than 100 years. Before 1980, post-traumatic syndromes were recognized by different names, including railway spine, shell shock, traumatic (war) neurosis, concentration-camp syndrome, and rape-trauma syndrome.2,,3 The symptoms described in these syndromes overlap considerably with what we now recognize as PTSD. According to the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM-IV-TR),5 the essential feature of PTSD is the development of characteristic symptoms following exposure to an extreme traumatic stressor characterized by: direct personal experience of an event that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury, or other threat to one's physical integrity; or witnessing an event that involves death, injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of another person; or learning about unexpected or violent death, serious harm, or threat of death or injury experienced by a family member or other close associate. The person reacts to this event with fear and helplessness, and tries to avoid being reminded of it. Traumatic events include military combat, violent personal assault, being kidnapped, being taken hostage, terrorist attack, torture, incarceration, natural or man-made disasters, automobile accidents, or being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness. The principal symptoms of PTSD are the painful re-experiencing of the event, a pattern of avoidance and emotional numbing, and fairly constant hyperarousal.\n\nPost-traumatic reactions fall on a continuum, and many clinicians and researchers believe it is useful to conceptualize partial symptoms as well.2, …",

      "abstract": "Medically unexplained visual loss, or functional visual loss, or nonorganic visual loss (NOVL) denotes diminished visual acuity or field without discernible ocular or neurological pathology. Variously termed in the literature, it eludes organic diagnosis following a thorough examination. Symptoms range from mild blurriness to total blindness, sometimes presenting as tunnel vision or hemianopias. Diagnosis entails comprehensive eye evaluation to exclude organic causes like refractive error or cataracts. NOVL frequently correlates with psychological conditions like depression or anxiety, implicating psychological influence in its etiology. Thus, NOVL underscores the complex interplay between physical and psychological factors in visual impairment, necessitating holistic diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. This chapter elucidates the diagnostic and therapeutic paradigms pertaining to functional visual disorder (FVD) or nonorganic vision loss (NOVL), prevalent presentations posing diagnostic challenges across diverse medical disciplines. It delineates the historical evolution of terminology denoting patients manifesting vision loss incongruous with established neurological or ophthalmic pathologies, necessitating a collaborative, interprofessional approach. Diagnostic modalities, ranging from meticulous ocular assessments to comprehensive psychological evaluations, reflect the intricate etiological spectrum underlying NOVL. This exposition serves as a pivotal reference for healthcare professionals navigating the diagnostic intricacies and therapeutic imperatives intrinsic to NOVL, advocating for a holistic, patient-centric approach underscored by scientific rigor, and compassionate care.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The terms subjective and objective often appear in health care records, and one commonly hears about “subjective symptoms” and “objective complaints”—yet the former is redundant and the latter an oxymoron. Objectively verifiable pathology may explain a patient's symptoms, but complaints themselves are never objective but rather, by definition, subjective. The AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), Sixth Edition, defines the terminology: Subjective information is more open to interpretation, but objective data are factual, reproducible, and often measurable or quantifiable. Objective findings generally have much higher inter-examiner reliability than subjective findings. Symptoms and most findings on physical (particularly neuromusculoskeletal) examination are subjective. Diagnostic study results and a minority of physical findings are objective. Some physical findings, such as strength and range of motion measurements, are both subjective and objective. Repeat testing, assessment of plausibility, and use of confirmatory physical findings can be used to validate or “objectify” subjective findings (eg, by determining if a weakness is corroborated by other neurologic or physical findings, imaging study results, and/or electrodiagnostic testing). The use of objective, or at least less subjective, findings in impairment rating should improve interrater reliability. Thus, evaluating physicians should not regard subjective complaints and findings, and they should lend greater weight to objective findings.",

      "abstract": "The terms myofascial pain, fibromyalgia and fibrositis are critically examined. They constitute diagnostic labels for non-specific musculoskeletal aches and pains. Analysis of the evidence shows that none of these labels is substantiated by hard physical signs or by laboratory evidence of consistent pathological or biochemical abnormality. What is the objective evidence for disorder(s) of muscle, fascia or fibrous tissues, so clearly indicated by these diagnostic names? Alternative terms such as ‘regional pain syndrome’ or ‘chronic pain syndrome’ merely redefine the clinical problem without providing a mechanism or basis for diagnosis. Despite different diagnostic criteria, these conditions, along with chronic fatigue syndrome, have many demographic and clinical similarities, most notably tender trigger points. Indeed, the terms are often used interchangeably. There are few differences in the symptoms, physical findings, laboratory tests, functional status, psychosocial features and psychiatric disorders. This paper seeks not to deny the existence of aches and pains, but to critically examine the utility of these terms. The only claimed physical sign is the presence of tender trigger points over muscles or muscle attachments. Research suggests that tender points are a measure of general distress related to pain complaints but separately associated with fatigue and depression. They are present in some normal subjects and are variable in occurrence in time in the same individual. They reflect no demonstrable pathology. It is therefore argued that none of these commonly used diagnoses represent distinct disease entities. A possible but unproven alternative hypothesis is that such symptoms relate to neural pain with both peripheral and central components, and in some instances psychological or wilful embellishment.",

      "abstract": "Soggetti portatori di disabilitŕ presentano spesso disturbi endocrini e metabolici, primitivi o secondari alla menomazione psico-fisica. La disabilitŕ č spesso provocata da malattie geneticamente determinate, da traumi cranici o midollari con conseguenti alterazioni neurologiche, o da patologie infettive cerebrali con esiti significativi. Si comprende quindi facilmente la possibile associazione fra la disabilitŕ e disordini della funzione ipotalamica e ipofisaria, con quadri di ipopituitarismo di varia entitŕ. Ne conseguono manifestazioni cliniche, spesso subdole e non facilmente diagnosticabili, almeno nella fase iniziale, che, se non vengono riconosciute tempestivamente, possono avere conseguenze serie. Ad esempio un deficit di ormone della crescita o dell'ormone tiroideo o una carenza di cortisolo, in etŕ infantile possono dar luogo a gravi conseguenze patologiche. Un'altra patologia associata alla disabilitŕ č l'obesitŕ, sia ipotalamica che conseguente alla scarsa attivitŕ fisica. L'obesitŕ facilita lo sviluppo di diabete mellito, peraltro associato talora a malattie geneticamente determinate. Pertanto in una struttura residenziale per disabili č necessaria la consulenza di uno specialista endocrinologo al fine di riconoscere tempestivamente, sulla base di esami clinici e di laboratorio, eventuali patologie endocrine e metaboliche. Questo consente di intraprendere subito una terapia sostitutiva. L'assistenza sanitaria specialistica comprende l'attuazione di schemi di terapia adeguati, la compliance alla terapia, l'attuazione di idonei percorsi diagnostici e di follow-up. Grandi difficoltŕ si incontrano inevitabilmente nell'attuare programmi di attivitŕ fisica e di dieta al fine di limitare l'aumento ponderale. Un corretto intervento in questo campo richiede la collaborazione fra lo specialista e la strut- tura residenziale che assiste il disabile e percorsi di facilitazione per queste attivitŕ anche attraverso convenzioni stipulate ad hoc. Č fondamentale, infine, l'ottimizzazione di un'assistenza multidisciplinare ben integrata.",

      "title": "Spieglein, Spieglein an der Wand … Klinische Charakteristika der körperdysmorphen Störung",
      "abstract": "Hauptmerkmal der körperdysmorphen Störung (KDS) ist eine übermäßige Beschäftigung mit einem wahrgenommenen Makel oder Defekt im körperlichen Aussehen (z. B. ausdünnendes Haar, Falten, Größe oder Form der Nase), was zu signifikanten Beeinträchtigungen in sozialen oder beruflichen Lebensbereichen führt. Besteht eine leichte körperliche Anomalie, ist die Beschäftigung mit dem Defekt deutlich übertrieben und für andere Personen nicht nachvollziehbar. Assoziierte Merkmale der KDS sind unter anderem eine starke Angst vor negativer Bewertung aufgrund der äußeren Erscheinung sowie Vorstellungen, dass andere Personen negativ über den wahrgenommen Defekt sprechen. Ritualisierte Verhaltensweisen wie das Überprüfen des Aussehens in Spiegeln oder das Vergleichen mit anderen sind ebenso häufig vorzufinden. Studien zur Prävalenz in der Allgemeinbevölkerungen ergeben Schätzwerte von ca. 2 % mit einem ausgewogenen Geschlechterverhältnis. Für die Erklärung der KDS wurden bisher eine Reihe kognitiv-behavioraler Modelle entwickelt, die davon ausgehen, dass sowohl psychologische, biologische, soziokulturelle sowie Konditionierungsprozesse eine Rolle bei der Entstehung und Aufrechterhaltung der KDS spielen. In der Behandlung haben sich vor allem kognitiv-behaviorale Psychotherapieansätze und Psychopharmaka wie selektive Serotonin-Wiederaufnahmehemmer bewährt.",

The clinically recognized impairments of the symbolization process are primarily those of spoken language. Disorders of spoken language involve impaired phonation, speech sound articulation, fluency and rate, or symbolic representation, singly or in combination, associated or not with significant organic or physiological complications or emotional disturbance. The clinically significant organic or physiological conditions most often associated with speech problems are those related to hearing loss, cleft palate, laryngectomy, cerebral palsy or other types of neuromuscular impairment, brain damage including cerebrovascular accident with attendant aphasia and dysarthria, and retarded or limited development affecting language and speech. Associated emotional reactions are rather more likely to be effects than causes of the speech disorder, and are, in any event, interactive with it. The magnitude of the problem is suggested in part by current estimates of incidence. I recently had occasion",

      "abstract": "Stress is a term that is readily recognized by everyone but defines rigorous scientific definition. It is widely interpreted as the emotional and biologic responses to novel or threatening situations. In humans, however, the term \"distress\" seems to be preferable, more clearly defining the fact that is the response that is being referred to, rather than the stimulus. Distress has been postulated to be capable of precipitating an overt illness, as when it occurs coincidentally with an incipient infection or neoplasm. Moreover, it is able to provoke several disorders and symptoms in many tissues and organs, including the skin. In this paper the authors focus on the main characteristics of stress and emphasize the relevance of psychosomatic medicine that proposes the simultaneous examination of psyche and soma. Special consideration is given to a peculiar form of skin disease, psychogenic purpura, together with the stigmata of mystics that, in large part, seem to be conditioned or provoked (or provocable) by emotional stress or by psychic influences on cutaneous fibrinolytic activity.",

The disease is apparently inherited as a dominant trait; x-linkage cannot be excluded. The diagnosis was based on the following criteria; (1) attacks of stiffness precipitated by surprise or minor physical contact; difficulty in sudden movements but absence of signs of myotonia or myokymia; (2) presence of the electromyographic counterpart of the stiffness, continuous activity at rest with normal action potentials; (3) disappearance of the continuous electrical activity after diazepam. The symptoms were most marked in infancy, but ameliorated with time, becoming milder than in the average acquired case. The cause of this familial syndrome is presumably different from that or those of acquired, sporadic cases of stiff-man syndrome.",

They are conceptualized as the human psyche’s way of coping with intolerable circumstances—a means of escape to assure survival, no matter what the price. Depersonalization disorder (DPD) is classified by modern American psychiatry within the dissociative disorders, but its traumatic causes are more highly variable than those encountered in more severe dissociative disorders. Not only childhood trauma, but also later severe stress, frightening episodes of other mental illness, and even isolated drug use can precipitate the condition. In some cases of depersonalization disorder, there is even no apparent cause or trigger.",

Since it is usually accompanied by nervousness, anxiety and other negative emotions, return to health can be longer than necessary. Hence much attention is paid to medical interventions which allow pain relief or a total elimination thereof. In some circumstances, however, they may be inadequate, that is why other, extra-medical factors are being explored. Man is a psychosomatic being, consequently, no somatic changes can happen without the involvement of the psychological sphere. In the case of surgical procedures, methods of psychological preparation and patient support play an important role in recovery.",

Obsolete, because we are discovering changes in the tissues or in biochemical and immunological functions of the body in people with mental disorders, and because psychological complaints are frequent in all physical illnesses.

It is characterized by disturbances in perception, emotional regulation and thought processes, including symptoms like hallucinations and delusions, leading to a disconnection from reality. Patients often suffer when trying to meet the demands of ordinary life. Genetic predisposition plays a significant role in development of psychosis. Besides these, there are also environmental influences, which contribute as a trigger and later progression of psychotic disorders. These external determinants could possibly be managed in attempts to contain the problem of increased mental health conditions with the main psychotic component. This article reviews the literature reports of current environmental risk factors of psychosis.

The\r\n traumatic event for every man is sudden, unexpected, embarrassing, and in such events the\r\n person is never ready. Every hour, someone becomes a victim of violence, a victim of a\r\n psychological trauma, either directly or as a witness. Consequences such as sexual and / or\r\n psychological abuse, participation in war operations, murders, heavy traffic accidents, natural\r\n disasters, sudden deaths of close relatives can be expressed immediately or developed into\r\n posttraumatic stress disorder.

The quality of life and health is\r\n impaired. The person is no longer the same as before or before the trauma. It best recognizes and\r\n finds his family suffering the most. Psycho-radiotherapy is distanced and alienated from its\r\n family, can not function normally in a working and family environment, and what is\r\n characteristic not only of a person suffering from illness but also of members of his family is a\r\n feeling of helplessness that occurs.

Tidak seperti tipe skizofrenia lainnya (hebefrenik, paranoid, dan katatonik), skizofrenia simpleks sulit ditemukan dan ditentukan diagnosisnya. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) V menghapus diagnosis untuk skizofrenia simpleks, namun dalam Pedoman Penggolongan Diagnostik Gangguan Jiwa (PPDGJ) III dan International and Classification Diseases (ICD)-10 masih disertakan. Studi kasus ini membahas pasien yang didiagnosis skizofrenia simpleks dengan diagnosis pembandingnya episode depresif berat dengan gejala psikotik. Seorang laki-laki bernama AY, berusia 28 tahun, dan tidak tamat sekolah dasar tidak memiliki figur ayah. Klien AY pernah bekerja secara wajar serta menyukai lawan jenis. Kemunduran fungsi psikologis kemudian terjadi. Simtom negatif dari skizofrenia pada AY sangat menonjol, yaitu sedikit berbicara, afek datar, menarik diri dari pergaulan sosial, minat dan ambisi kurang, dan dorongan vitalitas rendah. AY memiliki ide atau pikiran-pikiran bahwa dirinya bersalah, berdosa, dan memandang sesuatu tampak kotor sehingga terdapat perilaku mencuci yang berulang-ulang. Hasil integrasi tes psikologi menjukkan tanda-tanda patologis, yaitu depresi, cemas berlebihan, dan gangguan afek. Dinamika psikologi AY menunjukkan beberapa pengalaman traumatik pada masa kecil yang direpres. Konflik yang berkembang dengan ibu sehingga menghasilkan kompleks antara ego alien dengan ego. Kata kunci: skizofrenia simpleks, simtom negatif, diagnosis, ego ABSTRACT Simple Schizophrenia is an unusual type of schizophrenia characterized by slow, progressive development of negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as inability to meet community demands, and overall performance degradation. Unlike other types of schizophrenia (hebephrenic, paranoid, and catatonic), simple schizophrenia is difficult to determine the diagnosis. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) V cleared the diagnosis for simple schizophrenia, but in the Mental Disorder Diagnostic Classification Guidelines (MDDCG) III and International and Classification Diseases (ICD) -10 are included. This case study discusses patients diagnosed with simple schizophrenia with a comparative diagnosis of severe depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms. A man named AY, aged 28 years, and did not finish primary school has no father figure. He has worked fairly and liked the woman. The decline of psychological function then occurs. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia in AY are very prominent, ie, little speech, flat affects, withdrawal from social intercourse, lack of interest and ambition, and low vitality drive. AY has ideas or thoughts that he is guilty, sinful, and looks at something so dirty that there is repetitive washing behavior. The integration result of psychological tests shows pathological signs, such as depression, anxiety, and affective disorders. The psychological dynamics of AY shows some traumatic experiences in childhood that are repressed. Conflict that develops with the mother so as to produce a complex between alien ego with ego.

In the majority of patients receiving palliative care, the aetiology of fatigue is multifactorial. The most common factors associated with fatigue include anorexia/cachexia, pain, anxiety, depression, shortness of breath, sleep disturbances, anaemia, and inflammation. Routine screening for fatigue is essential for optimal assessment of fatigue. Initial management should aim towards identification and treatment of the reversible/underlying causes However, if there are no reversible causes identified or if the fatigue is not responsive to specific treatments, symptomatic treatment should be considered.",

However, they may occur individually or together and it may be difficult to decide which is which. When a person describes his own experience as religious and another observes this as mental illness they are unlikely to be commenting on precisely the same phenomena. The first person is describing an internal experience whilst the latter is inferring from observed behaviour. It is important for psychiatrists and mental health professionals to recognize that there is a spiritual dimension for their patients (and for themselves), and for pastoral theologians to form a concept of mental illness. The approach of phenomenological psychopathology is useful in making the distinction.",

      "title": "Iloperidone (Fanapt): An FDA-Approved Treatment Option for Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a debilitating and chronic mental illness that affects approximately 24 million people of all ages around the world. The usual onset is between 15 and 35 years of age,1 and about 1% of all Americans are affected.2 Approximately 25% of all beds in psychiatric hospitals are occupied by patients with schizophrenia, and 50% of psychiatric hospital admissions are a result of schizophrenia.3,4 This mental illness can be characterized by the presentation of psychosis, cognitive impairment, social withdrawal, and apathy, all of which lead to impaired functioning in school, self-care, recreational activities, work, parenting, and interpersonal relationships. Among the psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia is considered to be the most disabling illness.5 Symptoms can broadly be classified into three groups: \r\n\r\n\r\npositive: unusual perceptions or thoughts such as hallucinations and delusions\r\n\r\n\r\nnegative: a decrease or loss in the ability to speak, to find pleasure in everyday life, to express emotions, or to initiate plans. These symptoms are often mistaken for depression or amotivation; hence they are more difficult to recognize.\r\n\r\n\r\ncognitive: difficulty in organizing or planning, with impairments in executive functioning, working memory, and attention. These are considered the most disabling of the symptoms because they affect the patient’s ability to maintain a normal life.6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo general classes of medications are used to treat schizophrenia: first-generation (conventional) antipsychotic agents and second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic agents.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly used first-generation antipsychotic drugs are chlorpromazine (Thorazine, GlaxoSmithKline), haloperidol (Haldol, Ortho-McNeil), perphenazine (Trilafon, Schering), and fluphenazine (Prolixin, Apothecon). Although efficacious, these medications are associated with a high risk of causing extrapyramidal symptoms, including rigidity, tremors, dystonia, and restlessness.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, the first of the atypical agents, clozapine (Clozaril, Novartis), was approved in the U.S. Although clozapine is considered to have extrapyramidal symptoms as a rare side effect, it carries five black box warnings, the most serious being agranulocytosis. Many other atypical agents are known for their metabolic side effects such as weight gain and an increased risk of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Other atypical antipsychotic medications include risperidone (Risperdal, Janssen), olanzapine (Zyprexa, Eli Lilly), quetiapine (Seroquel, AstraZeneca), ziprasidone (Geodon, Pfizer), aripiprazole (Abilify, Bristol-Myers Squibb/Otsuka), paliperidone (Invega, Janssen), and asenapine (Saphris, Schering-Plough).6\r\n\r\nIn May 2009, the FDA approved iloperidone (Fanapt, Vanda) as an atypical antipsychotic agent for the acute treatment of patients with schizophrenia. In clinical trials, it was shown to be efficacious and safe. In this article, we review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of iloperidone in alleviating both the positive and negative symptoms of this disabling disease.",

By reviewing various epidemiological studies, relationships among some chronic diseases and depression have been noted. The depression-disease order of appearance can de bi-directional. It seems that stress, depression and inflammation have the capacity to affect the balance of cykotines produced by the immunological system. Modulation of the immunological system by the central nervous system is controIled/mediada by a complex bi-directional network composed of signals among the central nervous system, the endocrine system and the immunological system. The most frequent diseases related to depression are chronic but some are acute: of the central nervous system, endocrines, infections. Chronic pain also seems related to this problem. Pain, fatigue or tiredness are considered symptoms of a hidden depression and others, physical as well as psychiatric, could be algias, parestesias, headaches, vertigo, or gastrointestinal, cardio-respiratory neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "abstract": "Out-of-body experiences (OBEs) are hallucinatory visual experiences that involve seeing the physical body placed in an external visual space. Many psychiatric disorders, brain dysfunctions, pharmacological agents, and altered psychological states are reportedly associated with these phenomena. OBEs have been linked to various brain lesions, particularly in the parietal and temporal regions, psychiatric disorders, severe emotional states like a near-death experience, substance use, migraine, and epilepsy, but very few have been reported in dissociative identity disorder. In this report, we present the case of a 15-year-old male patient who described a strange experience where he found himself to be floating outside his own body while he visualized his own body from a third-person perspective. On further evaluation, a diagnosis of dissociative identity disorder and dissociative fugue was formulated. The patient showed improvement after undergoing abreaction, hypnosis, and relaxation training along with supportive psychotherapy. Dissociative disorders occur due to an internal conflict between ego and self, when a person is unable to successfully repress a traumatic experience, or when a repressed memory or experience comes out of the cocooned barrier, leading to an altered state of perception and self-experience, which is described by the patient as OBE. This report presents a scarce differential in the context of psychiatric illness, which might be helpful in the formulation of approaches toward management in cases of such OBE, making it a strange yet intriguing addition to the literature.",

      "abstract": "In legal practice it is assumed that the ordinary man intends the natural consequences of his acts. When this responsibility is questioned as a result of some change in mental state, a clear cut and absolute statement of presence or absence of mental capacity seems to be expected. This is not necessarily a helpful approach or consistent with clinical observations. Where the individual is impaired due to alcohol, narcotics, barbituates and other drugs this limitation of mental capacity is rarely total. The situation is similar in states of fatigue, hunger or chronic illness, or even of emotional disturbance. The problem of impairment, even when only partial, is that a pattern of behaviour may emerge, due to disturbances in perception, judgment, and coordination which are grossly deviant from that of the individual in a sober state and do not represent his desire or intent in that state. The extent to which this person is addicted and the extent to which permanent brain damage exists also influence the degree of manifest disturbance when alcohol or drugs are used. These have pertinence in considering the culpability of persons accused of murder and other serious crimes, especially in attempting to determine appropriate sentence or disposal.",

      "title": "SINTOMAS DEPRESSIVOS EM ACADÊMICOS DE UMA UNIVERSIDADE PÚBLICA NO OESTE DO ESTADO DO PARÁ, RELATO DE EXPERIÊNCIA",
      "abstract": "Apresentacao : A depressao e um disturbio do afeto e/ou do humor, que e caracterizado por sintomas como, piora do sono, do apetite, da auto-estima, pela tristeza, sentimento de culpa, entre outros. O individuo depressivo tem dificuldade em descrever experiencias emocionais positivas, sendo pouco aberto a sentimentos otimistas. Alem disso, na depressao nao existe apenas queixa de tristeza, mas tambem ha mudancas de humor que culminam em crises frequentes de explosao de raiva, que levam ao desgaste da saude fisica e emocional, prejuizos no convivio social, na aprendizagem e ideias e/ou tentativas frequentes de suicidio. Esse transtorno e considerado uma pandemia e a terceira maior causa a nivel global de doencas. Sao inumeros os fatores que podem contribuir para o desenvolvimento da depressao, como por exemplo, o baixo suporte social, a presenca de eventos estressantes, pensamentos negativos, problemas financeiros, entre outros. Alguns dados encontrados nos universitarios nesta pesquisa, sao considerados elevados, no que tange ao processo depressivo, e ganham maior destaque ainda quando comparados com a populacao em geral. Isso e possivel, pois e nessa fase academica que se exige muito esforco do adolescente ou jovem adulto, onde o mesmo deve aprender a lidar com uma gama de responsabilidades que estarao presentes em sua vida futura, tanto como academico, quanto como profissional. Estes incluem a adaptacao de cumprimento de prazos e horarios, a distância dos pais e demais familiares, a falta de motivacao para os estudos, dentre outros conflitos internos e/ou externos. Diante dessas informacoes, o objetivo deste trabalho consiste em relatar a presenca de sinais e sintomas depressivos encontrados em academicos de uma instituicao de ensino superior em Santarem- PA, atraves de uma escuta qualificada. Desenvolvimento : Este estudo trata-se de um relato de experiencia acerca das vivencias durante uma acao em saude que ocorreu no dia 24 de abril de 2017 desenvolvida por academicos de enfermagem da Universidade do Estado do Para (UEPA) Campus XII-Santarem, a acao foi baseada na metodologia ativa da problematizacao segundo o Projeto Politico Pedagogico (PPP) do curso de enfermagem da UEPA para a Atividade Integrada em Saude que e um momento em que o academico de enfermagem integra todos os eixos da grade curricular do semestre, escolhendo assim um tema a ser abordado, assim como o publico, que foi composto de academicos dos cursos contemplados na universidade: enfermagem, musica, educacao fisica, medicina e fisioterapia. A tematica foi abordada atraves de acao educativa em saude, organizada pelos academicos do curso de enfermagem com diversos topicos como: alimentacao, avaliacao de risco para o desenvolvimento de doencas cronicas, avaliacao de medidas antropometricas e, nesta atividade, avaliacao da saude mental com a investigacao da existencia de sintomas depressivos. Durante a acao os academicos de enfermagem, em um primeiro momento, distribuiram folders contendo informacoes sobre a depressao e, posteriormente conversaram individualmente com cada academico que, de forma voluntaria, concordaram discutir sobre sintomas que, de acordo com o CID-10, poderiam estar sentindo. Durante a conversa os sintomas investigados foram: fadiga aumentada ou perda de energia fisica e mental, perda de interesse e prazer, classificados como sintomas fundamentais; apetite diminuido, atividade diminuida, auto-estima e autoconfianca diminuida, concentracao e atencao diminuida, sentimento de culpa e inutilidade, pensamentos e/ou atos lesivos ou suicidas, sono perturbado, visao pessimista do futuro, classificados como sintomas episodicos. Alem disso, a acao contou com a ajuda de um psicologo que atendeu os participantes que apresentaram sintomas graves da depressao. Os participantes que apresentaram maior necessidade foram orientados a buscar tratamento efetivo com intervencao de psicologo. Resultados : A maioria dos entrevistados mostraram-se bastante interessados no assunto e nao demonstravam muita timidez, apresentaram-se bem a vontade e com disposicao para dialogar, o que de certa forma surpreendeu a equipe, que esperava uma resistencia por parte dos academicos, com isso observou-se facilitacao do trabalho para a equipe dos entrevistadores. Apos a entrevista, os academicos de enfermagem, organizadores da acao, detectaram uma alta incidencia de sintomas fundamentais e episodicos em um numero significativos dos universitarios, o que pode ser considerado uma situacao preocupante. No decorrer da acao, muitos academicos participantes, relataram o quanto consideravam acoes desse genero, importantes na universidade, por sentirem-se sobrecarregados pelas atividades academicas, desorientados, desanimados e com pensamentos pessimistas. Podem ser classificados como poucas as acoes voltadas para os academicos, sobretudo, os academicos da area da saude, ja que eles sao os principais responsaveis por promoverem esse tipo de acoes e que acabam deixando de se cuidar, nao lembrando-se que tambem precisam de cuidado e atencao. Deste modo, e inegavel a grande satisfacao de poder contribuir de alguma forma para esta comunidade e acredita-se que, todos os academicos tiveram uma boa oportunidade de serem ouvidos de forma mais qualificada por um profissional apto a lhe dar orientacoes essenciais que visem a prevencao diagnostica, alem de recuperacao e promocao da saude mental. Consideracoes Finais : Apos a acao em saude, alguns academicos que se ausentaram no dia em que a acao ocorreu procuraram a equipe afim de, saberem se haveria outra acao semelhante, alegando que gostariam de serem ouvidos ou ate mesmo referindo interesse de um amigo (a) na consulta psicologica. Essa experiencia aponta para a necessidade de que academicos na area da saude devem cuidar da saude mental de forma frequente sem negligenciar as tensoes e o estresse advindos da propria universidade, antes de serem lancados no mercado de trabalho. Alem da necessidade de acompanhamento psicologico para os academicos nas proprias universidades, sejam elas publicas ou privadas, no decorrer da formacao afim de manter a saude mental e de prevenir, diagnosticar ou ainda tratar quadros depressivos e outras doencas mentais que podem comprometer seu rendimento academico e a sua saude geral, visando reduzir dados crescentes relacionados a sintomatologia da depressao em universitarios. Essa experiencia mostrou que mesmo em cursos da area da saude, a saude mental ainda e pouco debatida, precisando assim, de uma atencao tanto dos academicos com sua propria saude, como da instituicao de ensino, promovendo um espaco e profissionais capacitados que possam auxiliar enquanto o academico estiver em formacao.",

Some of the earliest physical signs—any one of which associated with a particular form of insanity will almost infallibly indicate the first stage of this special disorder—are the intermittent pulse, the irregular or contracted pupil, the quivering lip or embarrassed articulation. The second stage is marked by loss of power in the upper extremities, by a gait more or less unsteady, by diminished sensation in the cutaneous nerves, or by the loss of some of the special senses. In the third period the disease approaches its climax, in an entire want of motory power, and by an impairment of all the nervous functions so universal, that although organic life may, under careful treatment, be prolonged for a considerable time, the patient may be said to exist rather than to live. Epileptiform attacks may precede or accompany any one of these stages. They sometimes very distinctly mark out their boundaries, or the disorder may run its course without any recognised convulsive seizures.",

      "title": "PSYCHOLOGICAL FEATURES OF AUTO-AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR OF ADOLSCENTS",
      "abstract": "There are various external factors that cause feelings, favorable for the formation of suicidal behavior: misunderstanding, meaningful rejection by others, experienced abuse, loneliness, alienation; loss of parental love, love – the key negative emotions are jea-lousy, death, divorce, escape from the family of some of the parents – despair, insult, jealousy; contempt, amazed selfishness – insult, anger, hatred, aggression as a desire to revenge, etc. It has been established that approximately half of examples of suicidal youth behavior are associated with destructive family problems, with a negative attitude towards them.Interpersonal or intrapersonal conflict in the conditions of social, psychological, existential crisis on the background of mental disadaptation can acquire a suicidogenic character. In all cases, the crucial moment in the formation of manifestation of suicidal behavior is precisely a suicidogenic conflict. Adoption of a suicidal decision (regardless of the causes, conditions, forms of maladaptation) occurs only after the phase of personal re-development of suicidogenic conflict.In our study, the group of suicide risk is totally 27.2 %. Researchers from this risk group are less readers of books, play computer games, attend interest groups, but are more on the streets and do their home affairs. They have significantly more problems with their father, mother, brothers and sisters, and their peers. They are mostly dissatisfied with the degree of realization of material and spiritual needs in their family. In the vast majority of high school students of the risk group, there are high levels of anxiety and mental and physical exhaustion, the experience of loneliness, hopelessness, irrationality of existence.In a greater number of senior pupils-licetists a factor of high anxiety was the fear of not meeting the expectations of others. Analysis of the data of the questionnaires of high school students of the risk group allowed to highlight and describe the main variants of individual images of states that can lead to auto-aggressive behavior of young people. The most striking feature is the sense of guilt, which arises as a result of inadequate assessment of one’s own actions or intentions, numerous, often groundless, self-excuse, hyperbolization of their mistakes, impairment of achievements, reproach of conscientiousness, and the desire to get out of life.",

Ascribed and prescribed, mental illness diagnoses and experiences vary based on medicalized norms. Medicalization of mental illness occurs via three main authoritative professions: psychiatry, psychology, and clinical social work. The institution of medicine holds absolute authority over what is considered “natural” and “normal” in mental health and creates stigma. Disclosure has historically been discussed as a remedy but is limited according to social identities as well as determinants of health. Disclosure of mental illness as a disability can be problematic in workplaces. Experiences of sanism, or discrimination based on perceived level of sanity, are common.

The 1970s witnessed an \"epidemic\" of dissociative disorder, particularly DID, which may have reflected enthusiasm for the diagnosis more than its actual prevalence. Traditionally, the dissociative disorders have been attributed to trauma and other psychological stress, but the existing evidence favoring this hypothesis is plagued by poor methodology. Prospective studies of traumatized individuals reveal no convincing cases of amnesia not attributable to brain insult, injury, or disease. Treatment generally involves recovering and working through ostensibly repressed or dissociated memories of trauma; at present, there are few quantitative or controlled outcome studies. Experimental studies are few in number and have focused largely on state-dependent and implicit memory. Depersonalization disorder may be in line for the next \"epidemic\" of dissociation.",

Many factors influence patients psychosocial functioning; they can be grouped into illness related factors, context related factors and factors related to individual resources. Among illness related factors, negative symptoms and cognitive impairment are the most largely investigated domains. Evidence has been provided that negative symptoms are related to a poor psychosocial outcome; however, whether negative symptoms contribute to patients disability or represent its consequence is an open issue. Moreover, the study of relationships between negative symptoms and psychosocial functioning is further complicated by the overlap between the two domains in several assessment instruments and by the definition of negative symptoms as a unitary construct. Cognitive impairment has also been reported in association with poor psychosocial functioning. It is debated whether a global impairment in cognition is relevant to poor functioning in the real life, or deficit of specific cognitive domains (including social cognition) play the most important role, or whether specific cognitive deficits are actually responsible for the impairment of specific aspect of psychosocial functioning. The need for future treatments to target negative symptoms and cognitive impairment for their direct and indirect impact on psychosocial functioning will be highlighted.",

For the diagnosis and treatment assessment of the ratio of psychogenic and non-psychogenic influences is decisive. The basis is a detailed case-history, somatic examination, result of testing the effect exerted by local negative pressure on erection, intracavernous administration of vasoactive substances and possibly other examinations. From this ensues the range of provisions: regime, relations, psychological, psychotherapeutic (with emphasis on behavioural aspects), medicamentous (non-invasive and invasive), physical and surgical. The limited information of health workers and other people on this problem calls for intensive educational activities.",

A psychiatric nurse, a physician, and a psychotherapist are illustrative cases presented. These patients deny their emotional needs in deference to the needs of others. Needing to be needed (counterdependency), approval-seeking, being preoccupied with recognition from significant others, and the suppression of anger are ways in which this patient functions. Ultimately, this splitting-off defense manifests in feelings of deprivation, isolation, and depression. In addition, there are ongoing complaints of emotional and physical exhaustion. Early, middle, and later phases of the (analytic-oriented) treatment of these patients is demonstrated.",

Most illnesses, except the very trivial, require a period of adjustment and a re-appraisal of lifestyle, ability to work and engagement in leisure activities. Potentially fatal and rapidly progressive disease might be expected to result in more severe psychological reactions, but the evidence indicates that there is surprisingly little correlation between psychiatric morbidity and disease severity when this has been measured in a standardized manner. Metabolic changes accentuate the emotional response to illness. Effective communication is an essential element of good clinical practice. Conversely, poor communication is a source of frustration for patients, leading to uncertainty, resentment, anxiety and depression. Depression resulting from the emotional impact of an illness follows an appraisal of the implications that the illness has on relationships, lifestyle, work prospects, long-term disability and mortality.",

Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population.

      "abstract": "The article lays out a theoretical analysis of the problem with diagnosing apathy in today's research. Apathy is a state characterized by a simultaneous decrease in the behavioral, cognitive and emotional concomitants of goal-directed behavior due to loss of motivation [15]. Behavioral changes lie in a declining everyday problem-solving effectiveness at home or work. Cognitive changes result in reduced cognitive functioning and a lack of plans and life strategies. Emotional changes manifest in a decrease in affective response to events that previously elicited either a positive or negative emotional response. Diagnostic criteria, or the 'gold standard' for apathy, identify behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and social symptoms of apathy that cause clinically significant disorders in personal, social, professional, or other important areas of life. The differential diagnosis of apathy involves its clinical distinction from syndromes such as delirium, dementia, depression, abulia, akinesia, and demoralization. The review can be useful for psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and all practitioners who interact with people at risk of developing apathetic states.",

      "abstract": "Around the world, physical symptoms are the most common manifestation of psychological distress. This seeming contradiction presents a diagnostic challenge for health care professionals who are consulted to provide treatment and illness management. In many situations, it is difficult to clearly identify the psychological cause of physical symptoms, and, at times, it is equally difficult to exclude the possibility of an underlying biomedical process. This clinical challenge has led to the construction of the diagnostic category of somatoform disorders, a group of psychiatric disorders characterized by the presence of physical symptoms causing significant distress or functional impairment that cannot be fully explained by a general medical condition, substance use, or any other mental disorder. This category of disorders was established based on clinical utility and the need to exclude medical causes in health care settings rather than on a theoretical model of psychopathology or shared etiology. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR, American Psychiatric Association 2000, cited under Classification), the somatoform disorders include somatization disorder, hypochondriasis, body dysmorphic disorder, conversion disorder, pain disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, and somatoform disorder not otherwise specified. Some authors prefer other terminology, including use of the terms medically unexplained symptoms, emphasizing the uncertainty about diagnosis, or functional somatic syndromes, suggesting that symptoms are due to disturbances in the function of psychophysiological systems rather than structural or anatomical pathology.",

The early psychoanalytic formulations of Abraham<sup>1</sup>and Freud<sup>2</sup>of the depressive reaction long ago became identified with the notions of self-accusation, guilt, and selfdestruction, so that nearly every depressive reaction was viewed either as resulting from or including the turning of the original object-directed aggression against the self, or from the internalized aggression against the incorporated loved and hated object. In such depressed patients, the tendency to express aggression against others has been seen as either denied, suppressed, or repressed, and hostile feelings toward the significant other not admitted into awareness where they would arouse painful guilt feelings. One more recent psychoanalytic position<sup>3</sup>is that depression is associated with denial, or repression of aggression, aimed at preserving the original love object",

As a positive function of uncertainty, one can note a possible positive interpretation of the patient's disease.

      "abstract": "In this chapter, we cover aggression associated with psychiatric, neurological, and general medical conditions. The focus is on hostile behaviors that threaten or inflict harm. Definitions of aggression, violence, and related terms used in this chapter are in Table 6–1 . Although most aggression involves intent to harm, the definition we use does not require it because clinically important aggressive behavior can occur in the absence of demonstrable intent—such as in patients with cognitive disorders. We set aside behaviors that may be characterized as agitation, such as yelling, screaming, and other nonthreatening outbursts; oppositional and resisting behaviors; intrusiveness; and fidgeting, pacing, and other hyperkinetic actions. We also do not address community violence or criminality. Terms used in this chapter Aggression Hostile, threatening, and violent actions directed at person(s) or object(s), sometimes with no (or trivial) provocation Violence Overtly aggressive actions directed at person(s) or object(s) Domestic violence Behaviors directed against an intimate partner, ranging from verbal abuse to threats and intimidation to sexual assault and violence Agitation A state of pathologically intense emotional arousal and motor restlessness Disinhibition A state in which the individual's capacity for preemptive evaluation and restraint of behavioral responses is decreased or lost Impulsivity A state characterized by a proneness to act without thought or self-restraint; a habitual tendency toward \"hair-trigger\" actions Irritability A state of abnormally low tolerance in which the individual is easily provoked to anger and hostility Psychiatrists mainly encounter aggression and violence when patients present for treatment in acutely ill states. Aggression may present as a complication of delusional psychoses, dementia, delirium, intoxication, personality disorders, and even adjustment disorder. It may complicate nonpsychiatric illnesses because it can develop when patients feel disregarded, dissatisfied, frustrated, confused, frightened, disenfranchised, thwarted, or angered by perceived mistreatment. Aggression can be perpetrated by men or women and by individuals of any age (except early infancy). It is seen in all patient care settings—outpatient clinics, inpatient units, rehabilitation programs, residential and custodial care facilities, nursing homes, and emergency departments (EDs). Aggressive behavior can result in involuntary confinement (in hospitals and jails), disruption of clinical and custodial care environments, longer hospital stays, and physical injury to patients, their caregivers, and their health care providers. Family members, home health aides, and health professionals who are repeatedly exposed to aggression generally experience demoralization, which adversely affects the quality of care the patient receives. In this chapter, we focus on aggression and violence in the medically ill, beginning with the frequency, correlates, risk factors, and causes of aggressive and violent behaviors in diverse clinical settings, with reference to the host, agent, and environment causal model. We also discuss elder abuse and intimate partner violence, which are not necessarily manifestations of illness but are important causes and correlates of psychiatric and medical morbidity (we do not address child abuse). We review the evaluation, case formulation, and differential diagnosis of aggression and the management of aggressive behavior in the general hospital, including the ED.",

      "title": "Exercise Intolerance: How Do We Know and Test?",
      "abstract": "Exercise intolerance is defined as the reduced ability to perform activities involving movement of skeletal muscles due to symptoms of dyspnea or fatigue. Patients can be suffered during exercise or later. Dogs presented to veterinarians for perceived exercise intolerance may have decreased strength, speed, or stamina. Signs can sometimes be subtle, with suboptimal performance detected by the owner but it is difficult to detect by inexperienced observers. Alternatively, the signs may include profound exercise-induced weakness, episodes of collapse, or even death following exercise. Exercise intolerance can result from cardiovascular, orthopedic, respiratory, hematologic, metabolic/endocrine, neuromuscular, muscular and neurologic disorders. Therefore, a veterinarian has to utilize information received from history taking, physical examination, and some particular diagnostic tools/tests in order to find the etiology. A complete history investigating abnormalities of all body system is essential. It is important to clarify nature of clinical signs and to determine whether clinical signs are associated with physical activity. If possible, a veterinarian should observe the dog during an episode that the owner perceives as exercise intolerance directly or from a videotape. Clinical signs of coughing, dyspnea, collapse, or cyanosis may suggest cardiovascular, respiratory or neurologic dysfunction. Physical examination at rest should be performed since many dogs with exercise intolerance have abnormal physical examination findings at rest. Complete examination of respiratory, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and nervous system are advised. It is important to systematically rule out of each previously mentioned system. Cardiovascular disorder: Dogs with congestive heart failure (CHF) regardless the cause will eventually have exercise intolerance due to pumping failure and poor tissue perfusion. Consequently, tissues do not receive adequate oxygen and the muscles fatigue more easily. These dogs will typically display clinical evidence of cardiac failure at rest, including tachycardia, cough, weak femoral pulses, crackles on lung auscultation from pulmonary congestion or edema, and perhaps cyanosis and a murmur, arrhythmia, pulse deficits, and prolonged capillary refill time may be observed. Standard diagnostic methods for CVS disorder including auscultation, thoracic radiographs, ECG and Echocardiography should be all performed. Abnormal serum lactate may be found in dogs with muscle fatigue. The sixminute walk test (6-MWT) has been a gold standard method in human medicine to predict morbidity and mortality of patient with heart failure. The 6-MWT directly measures a patient’s ability to carry out daily activities instead of a patient’s ability to performed laboratory exercise such as on treadmill. The 6-MWT in dogs is also evidenced and demonstrated a significant decreased in the distance walked in 6 minutes when a dog has CHF. This method is simple and may be a valuable tool when assessing quality of life in CHF dogs. Respiratory disorder: Defects of the pharynx, larynx, trachea, airways, pulmonary parenchyma, or pleural space can impair a dog's ability to breathe normally. When these dogs exercise, they are unable to maintain tissue oxygenation resulting in weakness, exercise intolerance, or collapse. Cyanosis, abnormal lung sounds, abnormal upper airway sounds, or dyspnea may be recognized. Observation of breathing pattern and auscultation at rest, during and after exercise are helpful in identifying a problem within the respiratory tract. Thoracic radiographs should be done in all dogs with exercise intolerance. In addition, heartworm testing, laryngoscopy, tracheal wash for cytology and culture, thoracocentesis or bronchoscopy and arterial blood gas should be performed to evaluate the respiratory system as necessary to reach a diagnosis. Hematologic disorder: Regardless of any cause resulting in bleeding, dogs usually will not exhibit exercise intolerance due to anemia unless their hematocrit fall below 20%. Dogs may exhibit a sudden collapse or profound weakness rather than repeated episodes of inability to exercise. Chronic anemia can be tolerated but, if severe, can result in classic signs of exercise intolerance. Chronic anemia is most often seen in urinary bleeding, bone marrow disease or cancer. All dogs with exercise intolerance should be tested for a complete blood count. Abnormality of metabolic/endocrine system: Hypoglycemia is an important cause of weakness and exercise intolerance in dogs. Most often causes of hypoglycemia in dogs include tumors of pancreases, liver failure, sepsis, hypoadrenocorticism. Hypoglycemia should be documented by collecting a blood sample at the time of collapse. However, intense hypoglycemia is most likely to be verified after a 24or 48-hour fast. If hypoglycemia is confirmed, affected dogs should be tested for hypoadrenocorticism, liver dysfunction, and neoplasia. Thoracic radiographs and abdominal Proceedings of the 14 Chulalongkorn University Veterinary Conference CUVC 2015: Responsible for Lives April 20-22, 2015, Bangkok, Thailand 6 ultrasonography are recommended to confirm metastasis. Neuromuscular abnormalities: Myasthenia Gravis is an immune-mediated disorder in which selfantibodies attack acetylcholine receptors of skeletal muscle. The clinical signs of affected dogs include weakness of limbs muscle that become worsen when dogs exercise. Dogs with MG usually exhibit severe exercise intolerant, developing weakness and collapse even after walking only a few steps. Response to edrophonium chloride may help to establish a clinical diagnosis of myasthenia gravis while the results of confirmative antibody against are also required. Serum antibodies to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are detected in most dogs with MG. Orthopedic disorders: Pain from abnormalities of the bones or joints causes reluctance to exercise in affected dog. Besides reluctance to walk or exercise, other clinical signs include, fever, and lethargy. Lameness, joint swelling, and joint pain can be inconsistent, so best diagnosis is to perform arthrocentesis with cytology and bacterial culture. There are many etiologies of orthopedics disorder. Therefore, a veterinarian must differential diagnosis based on history and physical examination. For instance, hypertrophic osteodystrophy, or osteochondritis dissecans often found in young dogs. Whereas, aged dogs may have problems with ligamentous injuries or degenerative joint disease. Polyarthritis is another most common causes of joint pain and reluctance to exercise in dogs. Immunemediated nonerosive polyarthritis (IMPA) is the most common cause of polyarthritis in dogs. In conclusion, Diagnostic evaluation of dogs with exercise intolerance will vary based on determination historical features, physical exam findings at rest and also laboratory results. If there are no abnormalities at rest, a veterinarian may let dogs to perform exercise. It is important to further investigate the underlying problem systematically to rule out metabolic, orthopedic, respiratory and/or cardiac causes of exercise intolerance as well as muscular, neuromuscular and neurologic disorders. Once the cause of exercise intolerance has been identified, plans for treatment or management can be initiated. References 1. Boddy KN et al 2004. Am J Vet Res. 65(3): 311- 313. 2. Chan DL. 2008.

      "abstract": "Disease with Lewy bodies or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), particularly at the prodromal stage, is a complex disease to diagnose because of different clinical beginnings and variable paths in terms of clinical expression. Thus DLB can be entcountered in different input modes: mild cognitive impairment, depression, acute behavioral disorders, confusion and delirium, or sleep disorders. In the aim to better diagnose the disease, should be sought obviously to search for the key symptoms: fluctuations, hallucinations, extra-pyramidal syndrome, and REM sleep behavior disorder. These symptoms are more subtle at the prodromal stage (mild neurocognitive disorder) than at the major stage. Thus fluctuations can be cognitive, simply as attentionnal fluctuations, or of alertness, such as sleepiness or more frequent nap; the visual phenomena can begin by sensation of passage, sensation of presence, or illusions; the extra-pyramidal syndrome can be really subtle such as isolated amimia or rigidity detected only with Froment's manœuvre. The frequent accompagnying symptoms are autonomic symptoms such as rhinorrhea or constipation, or sensorial symptoms such as olfactory impairment. The clinician has to be aware of the frequent presence of geriatric syndroms, also at the prodromal stage and including: falls, orthostatic hypotension, syncopa, urinary troubles, depression, delirium (after surgery, during infection...). On neuropsychological tests, sub-cortical frontal syndrome is frequent, visual memory impairment, visuospatial impairment and visuo-constructive difficulties are also characteristics. On brain MRI, isolated diminished insula is to look for. CSF analysis is usually normal but sometimes with low Abeta-42. Dat-Scan and MIBG scintigraphy were not enough explored in this context. Thus, with every patient presenting a compatible input mode, the search for symptoms of DLB has to be systematic, in the aim to have an etiological diagnosis of prodromal DLB, to avoid adverse drug events (neuroleptics) and to optimize care for patients.",

A common denominator of these unspecific psychopathological symptoms is the patients' denial of their identity or the convinction that their identity or the identity of relatives has been altered. These delusional symptoms occur in the context of somatic and mental diseases, most frequently in schizophrenia and dementia. According to neuropsychological and neuroanatomical studies delusional misidentifications are facilitated by lesions of the temporo-limbic system leading to an impairment in the affective recognition and reality control. Patients suffering from delusional misidentifications have a higher risk of aggressive behaviour which emphasises their clinical relevance.",

Various health theories - biomedical, ability-based, biopsychosocial - are introduced and scrutinized from the point of view of enactivism and phenomenology. Health is ultimately argued to consist in a central world-disclosing aspect of what is called existential feelings, experienced by way of transparency and ease in carrying out important life projects. Health, in such a phenomenologically enacted understanding, is an important and in many cases necessary part of leading a good life. Illness, on the other hand, by such a phenomenological view, consist in finding oneself at mercy of unhomelike existential feelings, such as bodily pains, nausea, extreme unmotivated tiredness, depression, chronic anxiety and delusion, which make it harder and, in some cases, impossible to flourish. In illness suffering the lived body hurts, resists, or, in other ways, alienates the activities of the ill person.",

Patients complain of a chronic change in perceptions concerning their own self (depersonalization) or their surrounding (derealization) lasting months and often years. They perceive themselves and/or their environment as unreal; as if they are in a dream; as if they are detached from themselves and their surroundings by an invisible wall; or as if they are observers of the self without any connection to physical or mental processes. Often, patients are incorrectly treated with antipsychotics under a misdiagnosed psychotic illness, or the disorder remains unconsidered in differential diagnoses despite the patients' immense suffering. First-line treatment is psychotherapy with no current approved drug treatments. Psychoeducation and grounding exercises might be sufficient for mild cases without significant impairment of personality functioning. In patients with more distress and impairment of personality functioning, an affect-focused psychodynamic approach is helpful, which simultaneously deals with impaired affect-tolerance and the massive affect-phobia and detachment.",

La ceguera, diplopia o paralisis de la mirada son los signos neuroftalmologicos mas frecuentes en el trastorno conversivo. Describimos el caso de un nino con ptosis como manifestacion de un trastorno conversivo. Metodo y resultados: Varon de 9 anos en estudio por ptosis unilateral izquierda de inicio brusco, sin antecedentes medicos relevantes. En la exploracion se aprecia ptosis de ceja y palpebral izquierda, sin alteraciones de la motilidad ocular intrinseca ni extrinseca. Dado que la exploracion no se justifica por patologia de ningun par craneal, se sospecha ptosis miogenica y se solicita estudio. Las pruebas complementarias, tales como analitica autoinmune, test de estimulacion repetitiva, etc. fueron negativas. Tras descartar patologia organica y conocer situacion emocional inestable por separacion de sus padres, es valorado por el servicio de psiquiatria con diagnostico de trastorno conversivo. Conclusion: La ptosis es una rara manifestacion del trastorno conversivo, y aun mas en la infancia. Solo hemos encontrado dos casos descritos en la literatura. Es importante descartar patologia organica, diferenciar esta patologia de la simulacion y conocerla para incluirla en el diagnostico diferencial de la ptosis. EnglishPurpose: Conversion disorder is defined by DSM-IV as a deficit of sensory or motor function that cannot be explained by a medical condition and where psychological factors are judged to be associated with the deficit because symptoms are preceded by conflicts or other stressors. Blindness, diplopia or paralysis of the gaze are the most frequent neurophthalmological signs in the conversion disorder. We describe the case of a child with ptosis as a manifestation of a conversion disorder. Method and results: A 9-year-old male with abrupt left unilateral ptosis, without relevant medical history. On exploration, present left eyebrow and palpebral ptosis, without intrinsic or extrinsic ocular motility alterations. Since the examination is not justified by pathology of any cranial nerve pair, myogenic ptosis is suspected and study. Complementary tests were negative (autoimmune analytics, repetitive stimulation test, etc.). After ruling out organic pathology and knowing unstable emotional situation by separation from their parents, it is valued by the psychiatry service with a diagnosis of conversion disorder. Conclusion: Ptosis is a rare manifestation of the conversion disorder, and even more so in childhood. We have only found two cases in the literature. It is important to rule out organic pathology, differentiate this pathology from the simulation and know it to include in the differential diagnosis of ptosis.",

It may be triggered, among other things, by natural disasters, assault or critical illness. An individual may react with intense fear, a sense of horror and helplessness. This changed state is characterised by three types of symptoms: constantly re-living the experience, evasive behaviour and exaggerated responses. These symptoms last for more than a month and may be accompanied by depression, characterised by feeling low and having no motivation and a lack of interest in things for a period lasting more than two months (1,2).",

      "title": "An Evaluation of Psychobiologic Factors in the Re-Education Phase of the Kenny Treatment for Infantile Paralysis*",
      "abstract": "In addition to being studied as a function of the neuromuscular system, muscular activity should be studied also as a function of the total organism as embodied in the concept of the personality and its functions. “Mental alienation” is composed of a sensory factor (“loss of mental awareness”) and a motor factor (“mental alienation” in its narrower sense) and is therefore not one but two distinct though related symptoms. From the definitions and descriptions of “loss of mental awareness” and “mental alienation” given by Miss Kenny and her associates, it cannot be stated with certainty what roles structural, physiologic and psychobiologic changes play in their production. There are certain aspects of these symptoms which bear a resemblance to well recognized psychobiologic and psychopathologic reactions. “Loss of mental awareness” seems to correspond to psychosensory (proprioceptive) dissociation and “mental alienation” to psychomotor dissociation. Therefore it appears that these symptoms may be explained more satisfactorily on the basis of psychobiologic dissociation than on the basis of “physiologic block” as has been attempted by the group of physicians associated with Miss Kenny. “Muscular incoordination” also described by this group is a natural consequence of “loss of mental awareness” and “mental alienation” as well as of pain, spasm and actual paralysis and as such is one of several factors in the production of a series of personality adjustments which may stretch throughout the patient's active life. In the treatment of these symptoms Miss Kenny employs a number of well established psychotherapeutic principles. By means of the Kenny treatment it is to be expected that not only will the chronic physical crippling of infantile paralysis be curbed but that chronic changes in personality functioning also will be interrupted. Careful psychiatric study of case material will prove whether the above concept is essentially near the truth, and to what extent personality factors influence the elaboration and persistence of the symptoms “loss of mental awareness,” “mental alienation” and “muscular incoordination.” Once developed, these symptoms may in turn influence the personality functions of individuals to varying degrees. Finally, this syndrome comprising disturbances in the proprioceptive and motor functions of the personality is not peculiar to infantile paralysis. Rather, it appears to be the psychobiologic reaction to muscular immobilization due to any cause and has as its background not cellular pathology alone but the entire psychobiologic organization of the individual.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder defined by symptoms reflecting disturbances in cognitive, behavioral, and physiological functioning that develop in the wake of exposure to a psychologically traumatic event. According to the DSM‐IV‐TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), the diagnosis applies to individuals who develop a requisite number of symptoms after experiencing, witnessing, or being confronted with an event that involved perceived or threatened loss of life, serious injury, or loss of physical integrity and that evoked fear, helplessness, or horror (e.g., military combat, sexual or physical assault, serious accidents, and major disasters). DSM‐IV‐TR organizes the symptoms of PTSD under three clusters: (1) reexperiencing (e.g., intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, and psychophysiological reactivity to reminders of the trauma), (2) avoidance and emotional numbing (e.g., avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma and inability to experience a full range of emotions), and (3) hyperarousal (e.g., hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and sleep disruption). By definition, these symptoms must persist for more than 1 month after the trauma and produce clinically significant distress and/or impairment.",

A chronic illness has a lengthy duration, uncertain outcome, and unpredictable episodes, often with intrusive symptoms and intermittent or progressive disability. Having a chronic illness poses life problems such as following a medical regimen, managing ordinary responsibilities, and experiencing stigma and discrimination. A disease, in contrast, may remain silent for years without eliciting a diagnosis or causing noticeable symptoms and life disruptions. Experiencing chronic illness makes disease real. Sociological definitions of chronic illness start with the experience of disruption and impairment. Social definitions of disability start from the lack of societal accommodation to certain individuals’ needs, thereby disadvantaging them and discriminating against them. Such definitions of disability tend to presuppose that the people involved have static, visible conditions with predictable and sustained needs.",

      "title": "Abuse and Maltreatment: Their Effect on Headache",
      "abstract": "Research has shown that sexual, physical, and especially emotional abuse create a predisposition to headache. Individuals with migraine may have experienced abuse in early life. Childhood maltreatment is associated with an earlier onset of migraine and a tendency for episodic migraine eventually to become chronic. How Would You Define Abuse? Physical abuse includes slapping, hitting, kicking, striking, pinching or pushing another. Emotional abuse includes neglect, threats, harassment, controlling behavior, attempts to isolate, and bullying. Sexual abuse is any nonconsensual sexual activity. For children and adolescents, it also includes any sexual activity with an older individual, whether consensual or not. Tell your Physician About Your Abuse In assessing your health concerns and planning your course of care, it is beneficial for your health-care provider to know if you are currently being abused, feel in danger of being abused, or have been abused in the distant past. If the topic of abuse is not openly addressed, the consequences can include failure of medical treatment and a continued cycle of abuse and poor physical and emotional health. Is the History of Abuse Important Even if it Occurred as a Child? As it may be linked to many medical and psychological problems, early abuse is indeed important. Significant stress occurring early in life may lead to an exaggerated response to stress later in life. For some, stress is the most important trigger for migraine. Migraine may also be aggravated by the depression and anxiety that so often follow abuse. What If I Am Currently Being Abused? Your health-care providers can guide you to resources offering psychological support and, when needed, personal safety. A sampling of the resources available is listed in the following. If you are currently in danger, ask for help. Place these calls from a phone where you will safe from your abuser. If your children are being abused, inform your health-care team so that this can be reported to the authorities. How Can I Best Deal With My Abuse? If you attempt to “forget” about prior abuse or deny that it ever happened, you are not dealing with the problem, but rather ignoring it. Talking to a counselor, speaking to an abuse advocate, or calling an abuse hotline may help you deal cope more effectively. From a perspective of treating your headache, therapies that help with stress management may be beneficial. Are Resources Available?

      "abstract": "Kernaussagen Bei psychiatrischen Notfällen ist neben der potenziellen Gefahr für den betroffenen Patienten auch eine mögliche Gefährdung anderer Menschen zu beachten. Leitsymptome des psychiatrischen Notfalls sind Störungen des Bewusstseins, des Antriebs und der Stimmung. Ein psychiatrischer Notfall erfordert zum Ausschluss einer exogenen Ursache oder organischer Erkrankung neben der Erhebung eines differenzierten psychopathologischen Befundes obligatorisch eine körperliche Untersuchung und den Einsatz apparativer Untersuchungen. Psychiatrische Notfälle sind nach internistischen Notfällen die zweit- bis dritthäufigste Einsatzursache für einen Notarzt. Psychiatrische Störungen werden in Notaufnahmen nur zum geringen Teil erkannt und angemessen versorgt. Selbst bei gesicherter Suchtmitteleinnahme sollte nach weiteren Ursachen für die Symptomatik und nach begleitenden Verletzungen gesucht werden, damit Differenzialdiagnosen nicht übersehen werden. Für Erregungszustände und sich ankündigende Aggressivität gibt es charakteristische Prodromalsymptome. Sie können jedoch auch unvermutet und völlig unverhältnismäßig auftreten (Raptus). Über 10 % der Ärzte erleiden im Laufe ihres Berufslebens Verletzungen als Folge von Aggressivität durch Patienten. Bei Lebensbedrohung, blindwütigem Rasen oder im Erregungssturm ist das entschiedene, unmissverständliche und koordinierte Vorgehen von medizinischem Personal, Ordnungs- und Rettungskräften zur Verhinderung von Personenschäden aus zahlenmäßig hoher Überlegenheit unumgänglich. Mit der Durchführung eines Suizidversuchs ist Suizidalität in der Regel nicht erloschen. Eine Krisenintervention ist auf die unmittelbare Stabilisierung des Patienten ausgerichtet. Eine Krise wird in den seltensten Fällen durch die Krisenintervention gelöst. Die Kombination von Antipsychotika und Benzodiazepinen ist bei schweren Unruhe- und Erregungszuständen am effektivsten. Eine rasche Besserung bei ängstlichen Depressionen oder quälender innerer Unruhe kann durch Benzodiazepine (z. B. Lorazepam) erfolgen. Clomethiazol ist bei manifestem Vorliegen eines Alkoholentzugsdelirs nicht mehr gut wirksam.",

While it can indeed be a symptom accompanying other mental illnesses, it is also a full-blown disorder unto itself, recognized by every major diagnostic manual. Chapter 1 discusses the symptoms of depersonalization/derealization disorder through historical documentation and personal stories. The core symptoms, as outlined in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, include detachment from one’s whole self or from aspects of the self (such as feelings, thoughts, the body, and agency), as well as detachment from the outside world. Origins of the term “depersonalization” are discussed, and historical as well as current descriptions of symptoms are brought to life through personal quotes and stories. These substantiate depersonalization/derealization as an independent syndrome rather than simply a symptom of other disorders. This chapter sets the stage for a comprehensive exploration of this fascinating, multifaceted, and under-researched condition.",

Los pacientes que sufren trastorno de personalidad (TP) muestran un funcionamiento social e interpersonal significativamente peor, consumiendo recursos socio-sanitarios con unos pobres resultados. En los TP, la farmacoterapia se utiliza para tratar aspectos específicos, como son los síntomas cognitivos perceptuales, afectivos o los derivados de la impulsividad. Debido a que es un fenómeno polimórfico, se utilizan diferentes tipos de psicofármacos, como por ejemplo, antipsicóticos, antidepresivos o estabilizadores del ánimo. Ha habido pocos intentos sistemáticos de validar los actuales algoritmos de tratamiento de los trastornos de personalidad severos.

The colonmetrographic findings are instructive in this respect. Direct functional disturbance of various districts is also suggested, and the pathology of such forms in psychosomatically oriented patients is described. Such orientation takes the form of a ready translation of ideas into rather diffuse somatic changes that are partly aspecific, due to the predominance of response mechanisms that are more physiological than psychological. The picture is one of a primordial reaction to difficulties and problems, coupled with increased stress, sometimes to the points of vegetative or motor storms, in the expectation of help from outside, such help being represented in the past by intervention on the part of the mother.",

      "abstract": "A 37 year old woman presented to her general practitioner with a two month history of low mood, poor sleep, and irritability. She was initially treated for depression with sertraline. Her mood improved slightly over six weeks, but, because of continued insomnia and irritability, her medication was changed to citalopram, with no further improvement. Through regular review and the building of a trusting relationship with her doctor, the patient felt able to disclose that she was experiencing intrusive images of past domestic violence. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and referred for trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy; over 15 sessions, this led to a substantial reduction in her symptoms. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe, prolonged, and impairing psychological reaction to a distressing event. The precipitating incident must be “exceptionally threatening or catastrophic”1 and can range from interpersonal violence and combat to accidents and natural disasters; sexual violence is a particularly potent cause.2 Serious illnesses or medical interventions can also precipitate PTSD if the individual perceived their own or someone else’s health or life to be under threat. The individual repeatedly relives the event through intrusive imagery, bodily re-experiencing, nightmares, and flashbacks. Irritability, insomnia, and other symptoms related to increased arousal also occur. Sufferers usually have difficulty remembering aspects of the event and avoid reminders of it (see box of diagnostic criteria). Children may act out the traumatic event through repetitive play, drawings, and stories, and have frightening dreams without recognisable content.3 Adolescents with PTSD can show aggressive or withdrawn behaviour and can find it difficult to relate to their peers. #### Diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) classification of mental and behavioural disorders1)",

Non-verbal behaviour in depression resembles ancient strategies of vertebrates to signal submission. At the cognitive level, people with depression often engage in ruminating thoughts, often involving self-derogation or worthlessness. Depression may occur in situations when one’s social status is threatened or an actual fall in rank has taken place. This is often accompanied by a reduction of serotonin availability. Genes conferring risk for depression when coupled with adverse early experiences may even protect against depression when associated with supportive parenting, suggesting genetic plasticity. Aside from ethological considerations, depression may also be linked to a dysfunction of the immune system.",

Diagnosing Meige syndrome is challenging due to its similarities with various movement disorders and psychiatric conditions. Functional neurological disorder (FND) refers to a condition characterized by neurological symptoms that are inconsistent with recognized neurological or medical conditions. Symptoms may include motor or sensory disturbances such as weakness, tremors, paralysis, or seizures. Importantly, these symptoms cannot be fully explained by another medical condition or by the direct effects of a substance. Instead, they are believed to stem from psychological factors. This case demonstrates the diagnostic dilemma of Meige syndrome. It was initially misdiagnosed as a functional neurological disorder in a 42-year-old female. The difficulties in differentiating between these disorders highlight the necessity of a thorough evaluation and increased clinical suspicion in cases of movement disorders. For treatment outcomes to be optimized and to resolve patient distress, prompt and accurate diagnosis is essential.",

      "abstract": "Not all patients who experience hallucinations have a psychotic disorder. Many physical and psychiatric disorders can manifest with hallucinations, and some patients have > 1 disorder that could cause different types of hallucinations. To avoid providing unnecessary or ineffective treatments--and to ensure that patients receive proper care for nonpsychiatric conditions--it is important to accurately diagnose the disorder causing a patient's hallucinations. In this article we describe common features and psychiatnc and nonpsychiatric causes of auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, tactile, and somatic hallucinations. Awareness of typical presentations of hallucinations associated with specific disorders can help narrow the diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment. Auditory hallucinations Also known as paracusia, auditory hallucinations are perceptions of sounds without identifiable external stimuli. This type of hallucination has various causes (Table 1). (1) A frequent symptom of schizophrenia, auditory hallucinations can cause substantial distress and functional disability. (2) Approximately 60% to 90% of patients with schizophrenia and up to 80% of those with affective psychoses experience auditory hallucinations. (1) Table 1 Common causes of auditory hallucinations Peripheral lesions Middle ear disease Inner ear disease Auditory nerve disease CNS disorders Temporal lobe epilepsy Pontine lesions Stroke Arteriovenous malformations Syncope Toxic metabolic disturbances Alcoholic hallucinosis Delirium Hallucinogens Schizophrenia Mania Psychotic depression Dissociative identity disorder Posttraumatic stress disorder Source: Reference 1 Clinical Point Auditory perceptions of music have been associated with partial seizures Auditory hallucinations in psychosis usually are formed and complex. (3) A common manifestation is [greater than or equal to] 1 voices. A patient might experience 2 talking about him in the third person. The may be perceived as coming from inside or outside the patient's head. Some might hear their own thoughts spoken aloud. According to DSM-IV-TR, hearing voices is sufficient to diagnose schizophrenia if the hallucinations consist of a voice keeping up a running commentary on the person's behavior or [greater than or equal to] 2 conversing with each other. (4) Auditory hallucinations also are seen in mood disorders but tend to be milder than their psychosis-induced counterparts. Simple (unformed) auditory hallucinations--referred to as tinnitus--can be caused by disease of the middle ear (otosclerosis) or inner ear. These unformed hallucinations consist of buzzing or tones of varying pitch and timbre. (1) Partial seizures may cause auditory hallucinations. Perceptions of music have been associated with partial seizures. (5) Curie and colleagues found that 17% of 514 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy had auditory hallucinations as a component of their seizures. (6) These hallucinations typically are brief, stereotyped sensory impressions and, if formed, may be trivial sentences, previously heard phrases, or commands. Alcoholic hallucinosis is a hallucinatory syndrome caused by alcohol withdrawal. These hallucinations usually are vocal and typically consist of accusatory, threatening, and/or critical directed at the patient. (1) Patients with alcohol hallucinosis also may experience musical auditory hallucinations. (7), (8) CNS neoplasms can produce auditory hallucinations in 3% to 10% of patients. (9) Hemorrhages and arteriovenous malformations in the pontine tegmentum and lower midbrain have been associated with acute onset of auditory hallucinations. …",

An individual may either not be able to identify a ‘threat’, or they may realize that their reaction to a perceived threat is irrational or exaggerated.

They can emerge due to genetic factors or abnormalities in the brain or body acquired after birth, or because of faulty or incomplete physical experiences when learning more complex behavior. Many are first identified in infancy, but onset can occur over the lifespan. Some of these disorders are progressive in nature, whereas others are nonprogressive or static. Individuals diagnosed with these disorders display various motor, perceptual, intellectual, neuropsychological, and psychosocial impairments. The general intellectual functioning level of individuals with motor disorders is variable, with some functioning in the average range and others experiencing significant impairment. Psychological outcomes are also variable. Individuals diagnosed with neurodegenerative disorders frequently experience significant mental deterioration.",

      "abstract": "The term \"illness\" implies a medical disease model, namely that symptoms or syndromes indicate an underlying organic disease - in the case of psychiatry a disorder of the brain. But no brain markers could be identified until today, which would indicate a psychiatric illness or in particular a certain psychiatric illness. Furthermore organic causes of a mental disorder are an exclusion criterion for a diagnosis of a mental disorder. For all these reasons all international classifications systems use the term \"disorder\" instead of \"illness\". Beyond the question if mental disorders are disorders of the brain one might challenge the concept of psychiatric diagnoses at all. Most diagnostic thresholds are arbitrary or imposed on pragmatic grounds. For a categorical diagnosis to be scientifically valid, clear symptom boundaries should separate it from other conditions. But this is rarely the case concerning psychiatric diagnoses. In many respects a dimensional approach would be much more appropriate than a categorical view. A dimensional approach would reflect the fact that mental problems are part of the human condition, which turn into psychiatric disorders when the affected individual cannot perform his or her social roles any longer. The personal, social and environmental factors that determine mental health and mental illness may be clustered conceptually around themes like the development and maintenance of healthy communities and each person's ability to deal with the social world and manage his or her life. All this would be much more helpful than the conceptualisation of mental disorders as brain diseases.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Many neurologic symptoms may appear without organic lesions of the nervous system. Based on the underlying mechanisms, psychogenic (or functional) neurologic diseases are classified into three categories: conversion disorders, factitious disorders, and malingering. Abnormalities in patients with conversion disorders are involuntary, whereas patients with the other two conditions are voluntary. Malingering, in particular, might be purposeful for personal benefits such as financial reasons and escape from jail. Common phenotypes of psychogenic neurologic diseases are motor paralysis, sensory loss, constriction of visual field, and seizures (psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, PNES). Clinical features common to all kinds of psychogenic neurologic disorders include incongruity with ordinary neurologic symptoms, inconsistency (variability) of nature, degree and distribution in time, change due to distraction to other stimuli or other matters, and the presence of psychogenic factors in the social or family background.",

Psychosis is a combination of biological (genetic, neuroanatomical, neurophysiological), psychological and social factors in various proportions. Psychoses are classified according to their origin (etiology) and reasons (pathogenetic mechanisms of development) into endogenous (including endogenous psychoses include schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, some psychotic forms of affective disorders), organic, somatogenic, psychogenic (reactive, situational), intoxication, withdrawal and post-withdrawal. Most often, psychoses develop in the framework of so-called endogenous disorder. The concepts of psychosis and schizophrenia are often equated, which is incorrect as psychotic disorders can occur in a number of mental illnesses: Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia, chronic alcoholism, drug addiction, epilepsy, intellectual disabilities, etc. Other types of psychosis, such as infectious, somatic and intoxication psychoses are quite often find among patients in non-psychiatric practices.

It can be seen in the elderly, arthritis, drug interaction checker, fibromyalgia, living healthy, lupus osteoarthritis, pill identifier, rheumatoid arthritis, sports injuries, etc. Musculoskeletal disorders are among the most common problems in sport injuries resulting loss of mobility and physical independence. Homoeopathic treatment schedule considers disease as a dynamic unit and the derangement of the whole man, expressed through the particular organs of the body, i.e. the ‘whole man’ is primarily diseased and individual organs/parts are only secondarily affected. It distinguishes each entity suffering from various or same diseases as different from others, because individuals are inimitable by virtue of their particular and peculiar mental and physical states, and characteristics. Concisely, it lays emphasis on, the ‘person diagnosis’, instead of the ‘disease diagnosis’. Therefore,” every diseases has a cure” is the believe of homoeopathy. Under this flow of homeopathy principle, the aim of this article is to present some of the most frequent musculoskeletal disorders in sports Injuries and their homoeopathic treatment schedule .Sports is an essential part of each nation. There are many ways to classify sports injuries based on the time taken for the tissues to become injured, tissue type affected, severity of the injury, and type of the injury occurred in the individual. Therefore, different homeopathic treatments are required to tackle different category of injury especially the outcomes of sport activities.

There is a lack of useful biomarkers common to all people who meet criteria for a psychiatric diagnostic construct that differentiates them from the healthy population. This can also be the case for general medical conditions for both aetiology and differences in structure or process and sometimes lack of useful biomarkers but this occurs to a lesser extent. There are also occasions when medical conditions cause mental health problems directly. For this reason doctors will always be involved in mental health to some degree and will use diagnostic constructs to describe these conditions as they are familiar with diagnosis in their medical practice. There are examples of clear biological abnormalities that are often detected accidentally that do not require treatment. Medically unexplained or functional symptoms/syndromes are commonly seen in general medicine, although the term ‘medically unexplained’ is contentious. Many diagnostic constructs—medical or psychiatric—involve complex polygenetic interactions with the environment.",

This syndrome encompasses a spectrum of symptoms, including anxiety, panic attacks, and psychosomatic symptoms such as chest pain, headache, hysterical attacks, and many more with minimal positive investigations and other evaluations. Its prevalence is notably high among high-profile individuals such as politicians and bureaucrats in contexts marked by corruption, especially in India. The onset of symptoms typically occurs in response to arrest or legal proceedings, complicating clinical diagnosis due to the lack of identifiable organic causes. Distinguishing jail syndrome from genuine medical conditions such as acute coronary syndromes is crucial for effective management. The syndrome reflects a circumstantial diagnosis influenced by the psychological stress of legal consequences, necessitating a careful assessment of both psychological and physiological health. Large-scale studies, research, and data analysis are essential to validate jail syndrome as a recognized clinical diagnosis. Jail syndrome is a self-explanatory clinical diagnosis to convey the onset of symptomatology, etiopathology, and treatment strategy in a person involved in illicit activities with history of charges, imprisonment, or sentencing to jail. Most important is to rule out organic disease because many times organic causes such as acute coronary syndrome, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension (HT) are present. Very important is that large-scale data and their scientific analysis are required to confirm and recognize it as a definite clinical diagnosis of \"jail syndrome.\" No doubt the term jail syndrome is self-explanatory and conveys the message we want to convey.",

      "abstract": "Delusional disorder, the contemporary conceptualization of paranoia, is an uncommon condition characterized by the presence of one or more nonbizarre delusions and the relative absence of associated psychopathology. The delusions concern experiences that can conceivably occur in real life, such as being followed (persecutory type), having a disease (somatic type), being loved at a distance (erotomanic type), having an unfaithful sexual partner (jealous type), and possessing inflated worth, power, identity, or knowledge (grandiose type). The diagnosis requires at least 1 month's duration of the delusion; impact on functioning that is consistent with the delusion or its ramifications; generally normal appearance and behavior; and the exclusion of schizophrenia, mood disorder, substance-induced toxicity, and medical disease. Typically, patients are unaware of the psychiatric nature of the condition. They may present to internists, dermatologists, plastic surgeons, lawyers, or the police rather than to psychiatrists. Although the prevalence is low, delusional disorder is not rare. Age at onset is usually middle or late adulthood, and the course is variable. Familial transmission is suspected, and comorbidity (frequently mood disorders) may exist. Successful management is difficult and may include hospitalization, pharmacotherapy, and certain forms of psychotherapy.",

      "abstract": "I have described a group of patients who are seemingly successful in their professional and social lives, and who seek analysis ostensibly for professional reasons or for minor difficulties in their relationship. However, sooner or later they reveal phenomena which are strikingly similar to those observed in so-called autistic children. These autistic phenomena are characterized by an almost impenetrable encapsulation of part of the personality, mute and implacable resistance to change, and a lack of real emotional contact either with themselves or the analyst. Progress of the analysis reveals an underlying intense fear of pain, and of death, disintegration or breakdown. These anxieties occur as a reaction to real or feared separation, especially when commitment to analysis deepens. In the case I have described in detail the patient used various projective processes to deflect painful emotions either into other people, including the analyst, or into their own bodies. As a consequence the various objects or organs of the body swell up and became suffused with rage as a result of having to contain the unwanted feelings. This process leads in turn to intense persecutory fears and a heightened sensitivity to the analyst's tone of voice and facial expression. It would seem that the initial hypersensitivity of part of the personality is such as to lead it to anticipate danger to such an extent that it expels feelings even before they reach awareness. The sooner the analyst realizes the existence of this hidden part of the patient the less the danger of the analysis becoming an endless and meaningless intellectual dialogue and the greater the possibilities of the patient achieving a relatively stable equilibrium. Although the analyst has to live through a great deal of anxiety with the patient I feel that ultimately the results make it worth while.",

      "title": "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Older Men: If Only Time Healed All Wounds",
      "abstract": "Trauma has been noted as hidden variable in lives of older adults that affects psychological, social, physiological, and behavioral functioning. Understandings of trauma have evolved considerably in more than two decades of research since initial entry of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in 1980 publication of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III). Originally a diagnostic category for war trauma primarily studied in Vietnam veterans, PTSD has been applied to individuals of all ages who have suffered a wide variety of both combat- and noncombat-related traumas. Thus effects of trauma in older populations have been acknowledged, but thorough research remains to be done. Currently FTSD is defined in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV TR, 2000) as occurring after one experiences, witnesses, or confronts a traumatic event including actual or threatened death, serious injury, or a threat to bodily integrity of self or others that evokes fear, helplessness, or horror. Traumatic events include physical assault, natural or man-made disasters, combat, and captivity (Cook and O'Donnell, 2005). Symptoms of PTSD include re-experiencing (flashbacks or visceral responses), avoidance activities (such as drinking or drug use), and arousal or hypervigilance. FTSD is considered acute if symptoms last less than three months, and chronic if symptoms continue for more than three months. A BRIEF HISTORY OF PTSD The definition of PTSD has broadened since 1980, though diagnostic category is direct result of efforts of veterans of Vietnam War and psychologists to label and treat their experience (Scott, 1993). Combat-related FTSD was thought to be contemporary version of fatigue or shock, a psychological disintegration found to occur under stresses of combat. As carry as Civil War, some combatants reported to have had difficulty adjusting to stress of battle (Scott, 1993). The Surgeon General of Union Army described condition as nostalgia and recommended that such individuals should be retained in combat zone but reassigned to less stressful duties. However, nostalgia was not treated by psychiatric specialists until Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), and it was not until World War I that military began planning for psychiatric casualties as an integral part of their support operations (Bourne, 1970). During World War I, soldiers' breakdowns thought to be related to proximity of exploding shells and thus labeled shell shock. Mental impairment was linked to an organic cause-shell explosions causing a concussion of brain. This organic model was called into question, though, by cases of among who had not been near explosions (Showalter, 1985). Such cases summarily written offas outright cowardice or lack of moral fiber and considered (Bourne, 1970, p. II). During this war, treatments for shell shock and emotional shock differed dramatically. Those deemed emotionally shocked were kept near forward medical units and treated with painful electric shocks, threats of imprisonment and even execution while shell-shocked soldiers were evacuated to medical facilities further to rear (Bourne, 1970, p. 12). Treatment for emotional shock was perceived to be highly effective, with a majority of patients returning to combat, while shell-shocked patients had a lower rate of recovery, which was thought to be result of organic nature of their problems. Later systematic clinical tests concluded that there was not an organic component to shell shock (Showalter, 1985). Gradually, psychiatric community came to conclusion that the emotional stress of prolonged exposure to violent death was sufficient to produce a neurotic syndrome resembling hysteria in men (Herman, 1992, p. …",

      "abstract": "Madness has traditionally been seen as an illness of the mind, or even, more romantically, sickness of the soul. Contemporary biomedical approach views it as a brain disease caused by chemical imbalance of neurotransmitters. Its symptoms are also associated with mental activity such as perceptions, cognition, emotions and moods. Nevertheless, much of the impact of the so-called mental illness is voiced through the body. First of all, mental distress is often communicated in a myriad of bodily pains. Most common psychosomatic complaints include dizziness, headaches, backaches, skin problems, indigestion and fatigue. Then, many mentally ill have problems accepting and respecting their body functions, especially problematic are sexual needs, menstruation and eating. It is manifested either in fear of sexuality or, its opposite, compulsive promiscuity. A similar black-and- white attitude concerns food, which is either completely denied to the body in anorexia or abused in bulimic binging. The 'sick' attitude to the body parodies the paradoxes innate in Western culture, which splits the human being into binary opposites of flesh and soul. The aim of my chapter is to look at bodily manifestations of mental illness as recorded in women's madness narratives. I analyse the body image presented in them as well as the body-mind dichotomy the authors often experience. The texts I focus on include Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar, Elizabeth Wurtzel's Prozac Nation, Marya Hornbacher's Wasted and Kate Grenville's Lilian's Story.",

      "title": "Sensing metabolomics landscape unfold molecular connectivity between mental illness and drug abuse",
      "abstract": "Environmental threats to mental equity have recently gained much attention in the sphere of public and curative health due to their toll on the individual, families, the public, and their economic sphere. Mental health or soundness of mind is important at every stage of life from childhood and adolescence through adulthood to protect the brain from environmental stress. What makes mental health unlike genetic rare disorders is that there is no known single cause for this rising public health issue because it arises from multiple factors. These factors include early adverse life experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse either because of child abuse, sexual assault or seeing any form of violence, experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical conditions, such as cancer or diabetes, biological factors or chemical exposure resulting in hormonal imbalances in the brain, and to a large extent having feelings of loneliness or isolation leading to suicidal action. Furthermore, the increase in mental health and its accompanying conditions depend on environmental with or without behavioral changes due to genetic stability may be associated with drug, alcohol, or substance abuse which is associated with the brain reward circuit which may need to compromise the neural circuit over a wide range of stressors on the human body interacting with the sequential neuronal cell cascade. Although humoral networking is associated with socio-behavioral change, work through family, religious, organizational engagement, and community support play major roles in its solution and management, it is consensually accepted that defining key determinants underlying molecular network altering by epigenetic and genetic factors have promise in empowering future systematic health and personal care including surveillance, prevention, treatment, and monitoring process. In the modern global and urbanization era, emerging new biomedical technological advances such as epigenetic tools, genomics editing, human genomics study utilizing sequencing technology, and reverse genetic resources from worm to animal models have enabled us to take a closer look at mechanisms that could be involved in mental illness and drug abuse or addiction using a pattern of metabolomics and its connectivity reflecting the interplay between mental illness and drug abuse and/or addiction. This paper describes a molecular-driven surveillance platform as a part of the power of prevention to care of populational health which could be beneficial by predicting risk and unfolding the impact of daily lifestyle on human behavior such as food intake, alcohol intoxication, and its outcome likely the effect of metabolism on mental illness and drug abuse. Interaction between environmental cues to neural circuits which may interplay with metabolic networks as well as potential risk resulting in various forms of phenotypic complications and behavioral alteration might be detectable using multi-omics platforms.",

It is associated with chronic medical illness, disability, bodily disfigurement, fear of loss of dignity, social isolation, and--where there is a subjective sense of incompetence--feelings of greater dependency on others or the perception of being a burden. Because of the sense of impotence or helplessness, those with the syndrome predictably progress to a desire to die or to commit suicide. A treatment approach is described which has the potential to alleviate the distress caused by this syndrome. Overall, demoralization syndrome has satisfactory face, descriptive, predictive, construct, and divergent validity, suggesting its utility as a diagnostic category in palliative care.",

Describimos el caso de un nino con ptosis como manifestacion de un trastorno conversivo. Metodo y resultados: Varon de 9 anos en estudio por ptosis unilateral izquierda de inicio brusco, sin antecedentes medicos relevantes. En la exploracion se aprecia ptosis de ceja y palpebral izquierda, sin alteraciones de la motilidad ocular intrinseca ni extrinseca. Dado que la exploracion no se justifica por patologia de ningun par craneal, se sospecha ptosis miogenica y se solicita estudio. Las pruebas complementarias, tales como analitica autoinmune, test de estimulacion repetitiva, etc. fueron negativas. Tras descartar patologia organica y conocer situacion emocional inestable por separacion de sus padres, es valorado por el servicio de psiquiatria con diagnostico de trastorno conversivo. Conclusion: La ptosis es una rara manifestacion del trastorno conversivo, y aun mas en la infancia. Solo hemos encontrado dos casos descritos en la literatura. Es importante descartar patologia organica, diferenciar esta patologia de la simulacion y conocerla para incluirla en el diagnostico diferencial de la ptosis. EnglishIntroduction: The conversive disorder is a psychiatric illness in which a sensorial or motor deficit is not justified due to an organic damage, and where it is considered that psychological factors are associated with the function. The blindness, diplopia or palsy gaze are neurophthalmic signs more frequents in the conversive disorder. We describe the case of a child with ptosis as a conversive disorder manifestation. Conclusion: the ptosis is a rare conversive disorder manifestation, specially during childhood. We have only found two published cases in the literature. it is important to discard organic pathology, to identify this simulation pahotology to include it in the differential diagnosis of the ptosis.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric polypharmacy is defined as the use of two or more drugs in the treatment of a psychiatric condition. It is widely prevalent in clinical practice. The rationale for polypharmacy is not clear. Etiologic factors are patient demographics (age, gender, race, low socioeconomic status), personality disorder, psychiatric conditions (psychosis, schizophrenia, affective or mood disorders), comorbidities, severity of disease, treatment- refractoriness, prescribing practice, inpatient or outpatient setting, concern for reduction of extra-pyramidal and other sideeffects. Among children and adolescents' the polypharmacy correlates are age (13 -15 years), male gender, caucasian race, low socio-economic status, medicaid or public insurance, disability, and foster care or child custody outside of biological family. Pediatric polypharmacy is also associated with a diagnosis of behavioral disorder, autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, conduct disorder/ oppositional defiant disorder, personality disorder, violence, tics, psychosis, affective and mood disorder.

      "abstract": "Abstract A disease is a distinct abnormal state that significantly affects the functioning of all or part of an individual and is not caused by external harm. Diseases are frequently understood to be medical conditions that are connected with distinct indications and symptoms. According to a fairly wide categorization, diseases can also be categorised as follows –mental disorders, deficient diseases, genetic diseases, degenerative diseases, self-inflicted diseases, infectious diseases, non- infectious diseases, social diseases, physical diseases. Prevention of the diseases are of multiple instances. Primary prevention seeks to prevent illness or harm before it ever happens. Secondary prevention tries to lessen the effect of an illness or damage that has already happened. This is done through diagnosing and treating illness or injury as soon as feasible to stop or delay its course, supporting personal ways to avoid recurrence or reinjury, and implementing programmes to restore individuals to their previous health and function to prevent long-term difficulties. Tertiary prevention tries to lessen the impact of a continuing sickness or injury that has enduring repercussions. Diagnosis of the disease at the earlier stage is important for the treatment of the disease. Hence here in this study deep learnming algorithms such as VGG16, EfficientNetB4, ResNet, etc.., are utilized to diagnose various diseases such as Alzheimer, Brain tumors, Skin diseases, lung diseases, etc..,.Chest X-Rays, MRI scans, CT scans, skin lesions are used for the diagnosis of the mentioned diseases. Transfer learning algorithms VGG16, VGG19, ResNet, InceptionV3 and EfficientNetB4 are utilised to categorise various diseases. EfficientNetB4 with the learning rate annealing having obtained an accuracy of 94.04% on the test dataset. As a consequence, we observed that every network has unique particular skills on the Multi Disease dataset which includes the chest x-rays, MRI scans, etc.",

Specific areas of concern, either mental (Axis I) or physical (Axis III), would delineate the syndrome. Pathological Habit Disorder (PHD) points to treatment options where the syndrome is wholly or partly habit-driven. Whether the syndrome is habit-driven or not will remain a clinical judgement even though many conditions, previously thought immutable except by medication, are proving accessible to behavioural engineering. In the ICD system, PHD seems to fit in “Special Symptoms or Syndromes not elsewhere Classified”. It is demonstrably useful to have a diagnosis such as PHD and to incorporate it into the body of medical classification, recognizing current practices for dealing with unwelcome or damaging habits.",

      "abstract": "Serious physical illness naturally leads to emotional disturbance, particularly when the illness is disabling or life-threatening, so it is not surprising that stroke is associated with mood disorder, manifested as an increase either in general levels of distress or in the rate of clinically diagnosable states. In recent years, considerable interest has been expressed in the idea that there is more to it than that; that in fact affective disorder-and more specifically depressive disorder-is a specific complication of stroke. The quasi-diagnostic use of the term poststroke depression tends to reinforce belief in this notion of depression associated with stroke as being something special. If depression is indeed a specific complication of stroke, then we should expect to find evidence in one of three spheres. First, perhaps the basic clinical phenomena are different in stroke: there may be specific depressive syndromes not found in other physical disorders, on the rates of depressive disorder may be higher than those found in other illnesses of equivalent severity, or the natural history may be different for any depressive disorder that does exist. Second, whatever the appearance of depression may be, its etiology may be different in stroke. And third, it may be that depression associated with stroke has different characteristics in response to treatment that suggest it is not like depression associated with other physical illnesses.

In a society in which a fit body is normally considered to be a symptom of a healthy lifestyle and success, the assessment and treatment of a maladaptive and health-threatening pattern of exercise may be challenging for healthcare professionals. Furthermore, the lack of guidance and literature on the topic may represent an additional complication on the diagnostic and therapeutic pathway. Although EA is not included in the DSM-5, it is mandatory to inform clinicians about it, as well as other healthcare providers (e.g., psychotherapists, physiotherapists), in order to better identify early signs of such an addiction and prevent injuries or other serious effects on physical or mental health.

      "abstract": "Abstract The first part of this two-part series discusses psychological influences in delayed and failed recovery and resulting unnecessary work disability; the second part discusses theoretical and practical aspects of the issue, including evaluation and treatment. Delayed and failed recovery and unnecessary disability (DFRUD) refers to a lag in, or lack of, expected recovery from a medical condition and/or unnecessary resultant disability. Causation is complex, and we are not doing well at managing this group of workers using a biomedical model. The traditional biomedical model posits that disease or injury produces symptoms and signs that cause impairment and result in disability. This approach too strictly separates mental phenomena and bodily function (Cartesian dualism) and leads to scientific reductionism when actually six domains are active in worker disability: medical, personal, psychological, sociocultural, systematic (including compensation and insurance), and workplace elements. Medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS) should be understood as a disturbance of normal neurological and/or psychological processes underlying symptom production, perception, and experience and cannot be better explained by another physical or psychiatric illness. Within this system of evaluation, administrative and medical iatrogenicity are associated with unnecessary medical care and poor outcomes for individuals. In addition to determining industrial causality and apportionment, if evaluators accept some psychological factors, MUPS, and central sensitization, they must explain to what extent these are compensable. Part two of this article will discuss theoretical and practical approaches, including specific evaluation and treatment methods.",

It may be that the illness prevents them acquiring the skills needed to cope with such setbacks and disappointments. Poor coping skills and the social and economic marginalization that can accompany serious illness are a common double burden for our patients. For those with positive psychotic symptoms, suicidality can be driven by command hallucinations, acute paranoid delusions of impending doom, or by the dysphoria that accompanies many patients’ illness.",

      "abstract": "In addition to the well-known forms in which neurotic conflicts tend to be expressed, the psychiatrist of to-day is increasingly faced with psychopathological pictures in which no inhibitions of instinctual drives and no sense of guilt seem to be present. Apparently other defences are being employed against the tension arising from conflicts between superego, ego-ideal and ego. With the help of some clinical examples it is shown that unconscious guilt, need for punishment, and self-indiction may Iead to disturbances of behaviour which above all will destroy the person's object-relations. The psychic mechanisms underlying this kind of pathology are described.",

The term is misleading, for it suggests that this diathesis is confined solely to the mentally afflicted, and, further, its precise meaning is vague. A person is generally accused of possessing the neuro-insane diathesis if he presents a temperament which appreciably diverges from the mean of the sanguine and of the phlegmatic; if his actions are unduly strenuous or torpid, his expressions unwarrantably enthusiastic or lukewarm, his moods very variable or religiously constant; in brief, the neuro-insane diathesis may be resolved into a tendency to psychic or motor reaction disproportionate to the exciting stimulus. In common speech the person is emotional. But every person who is emotional is not an incipient lunatic. The faculty of conceiving undue enthusiasm, of persevering unfalteringly in ambition, in order to attain the acme of success in any sphere of life, demands an emotional power in excess of the normal. It is ridiculous thus to brand the best men of all nations as possessors of the neuro-insane diathesis. The term, with its plausible air of scientific accusation, is misleading and vague, and should be wholly discarded. All that psychiatrists wish to convey by it may be more accurately and more descriptively called the emotional diathesis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: - Fatigue can be defined as an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained exhaustion that makes it harder to carry out activities and function Fatigue describes a state of tiredness or exhaustion. Fatigue is an important symptom in academics due to its association with physical, psychological and social problems and the employee health, performance, safety and general workability continues to grow. Research has shown that fatigue may result from some health and work-related factors, particularly a poor health status, long work hours and extended-duration work shifts. INTRODUCTION: - Fatigue is a state of physical or mental weariness, often accompanied by a reduced capacity to perform tasks effectively. It is characterized by a sensation of tiredness, exhaustion, and a lack of energy, which can result from various factors, including prolonged physical or mental exertion, insufficient rest or sleep, illness, stress, and other physical or psychological conditions. The need for a study aimed to investigate the prevalence of fatigue in female academicians by using a reliable self-completion tool that can measure subjective condition, either in extreme clinical cases or in routine day-to-day functioning, has never been greater. METHODOLOGY: - An observational study was conducted in Ahmadabad city. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee. The Chalder Fatigue Scale was used to assess symptoms of fatigue. Questioner method was used to collect data. Each question was scored by female academicians. Sample size of hundred participants including the female academicians. RESULT: - The result was carried out by using Microsoft excel 2016. Out of hundred sample size 38% middle aged female academicians had fatigue. The mean age was 34.43 years. CONCLUSION: - This study concludes that there is need to reduce fatigue among the female academicians. Clinical implementation: - There is a need to plan a proper treatment protocol and advice for female academicians to reduce the fatigue. Key words: Chadler Fatigue Scale, Female Academicians, Fatigue.",

Cependant, certaines jeunes victimes voient leurs troubles persister et d’autres commencent a souffrir de symptomes prefigurant un syndrome psychotraumatique. D’autres encore vont inaugurer ou confirmer une psychopathologie nevrotique ou psychotique. – Generalement, chez les jeunes victimes, le syndrome post-traumatique apparait rapidement apres l’evenement critique.

      "title": "Body Dysmorphic Disorder",
      "abstract": "Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a common (lifetime prevalence of about 2%; Buhlmann et al. 2010) and often severe disorder whose core feature is preoccupation with one or more nonexistent or slight defects in one's physical appearance. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in psychosocial functioning, and it is not better explained by concerns with body fat or weight in an individual who meets diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder (American Psychiatric Association 2013) (see Box 22- ). Insight regarding the perceived flaws (e.g., \"I look ugly\") is usually absent or poor; most individuals are completely or mostly convinced that their view of their perceived deformities is accurate (Phillips et al. 2012). All persons with BDD, at some point during the illness, perform compulsive behaviors aimed at checking, fixing, hiding, or obtaining reassurance about the perceived appearance defects (Phillips et al. 2005a). BDD is characterized by poor psychosocial functioning and high rates of suicidality (Buhlmann et al. 2010; Phillips et al. 2005b, 2008; Veale et al. 1996a), yet BDD usually goes undiagnosed in clinical settings (Conroy et al. 2008; Grant et al. 2001). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Body Dysmorphic Disorder 300.7 F45.22 Preoccupation with one or more perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance that are not observable or appear slight to others. At some point during the course of the disorder, the individual has performed repetitive behaviors (e.g., mirror checking, excessive grooming, skin picking, reassurance seeking) or mental acts (e.g., comparing his or her appearance with that of others) in response to the appearance concerns. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The appearance preoccupation is not better explained by concerns with body fat or weight in an individual whose symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder. Specify if: With muscle dysmorphia: The individual is preoccupied with the idea that his or her body build is too small or insufficiently muscular. This specifier is used even if the individual is preoccupied with other body areas, which is often the case. Specify if: Indicate degree of insight regarding body dysmorphic disorder beliefs (e.g., \"I look ugly\" or \"I look deformed\"). With good or fair insight: The individual recognizes that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are definitely or probably not true or that they may or may not be true. With poor insight: The individual thinks that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are probably true. With absent insight/delusional beliefs: The individual is completely convinced that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are true. Believing that they look ugly or abnormal, many patients seek and receive cosmetic treatment. Studies from psychiatry settings have found that about two-thirds of patients with BDD receive surgery or dermatological, dental, or other cosmetic treatment for their perceived flaws (Crerand et al. 2005; Phillips et al. 2001a). In one study ( N = 250), only 7% of such treatments led to overall improvement in BDD (Phillips et al. 2001a), and in another study ( N = 200), only 4% of procedures improved overall BDD symptoms (Crerand et al. 2005). These outcome data are retrospective but concur with data from a small prospective study (Tignol et al. 2007). In a survey of cosmetic surgeons, 40% reported that a patient with BDD had threatened them legally or physically (Sarwer 2002). Such reports underscore the critical importance of diagnosing BDD and implementing psychiatric treatment. Before beginning treatment, it is important to lay essential groundwork, with the goal of engaging patients, establishing a therapeutic alliance, and instilling hope. Because most patients have poor or absent insight, they may doubt that they have BDD and that psychiatric treatment can help. Psychoeducation about BDD should be provided, including the fact that it is a common and treatable disorder. Patients may benefit from reading about BDD (e.g., Phillips 2009). Trying to convince or reassure patients with poor or absent insight that they look normal is usually ineffective (one cannot impose insight), and patients typically misinterpret comments about their appearance, even if positive or reassuring, in a negative way. On the other hand, it is important not to agree with patients' negative view of their appearance because this may be devastating to them. It is helpful to empathize with patients' feelings and to focus on the likelihood that psychiatric treatment will improve their distress, preoccupation, and functioning.",

      "title": "Understanding depression beyond the “mind‐body” dichotomy",
      "abstract": "In both the ICD-11 and the DSM-5, the core symptoms of depression are reported to be depressed mood (e.g., feeling sad, down or hopeless) and markedly diminished interest or pleasure in activities. However, in the ICD-10 diagnostic guidelines, a third core symptom was also identified: \"fatigue or low energy\". In two regions of the world (Latin America and East Asia), \"fatigue\" is the most commonly experienced depressive symptom1. In a third region (Southeast Asia), \"issues with the heart\" are the most commonly reported depressive symptoms, along with depressed mood1. Do people in these regions just \"somatize\" what is primarily a \"psychological\" experience? Do \"somatic\" symptoms just represent a \"mask\", as implied some decades ago by the concept of \"masked depression\"2? An alternative view may be that the core of the depressive syndrome, at least in part of the cases of this heterogeneous condition, is neither only \"psychic\" nor only \"somatic\", but consists of an actual \"depression\" of the individual's psychic/physical tone, energy, drive and/or response to rewarding stimuli (partially captured by the constructs of depressed mood, fatigue, and diminished interest or pleasure), along with an overwhelming feeling of psychic/physical pain (which has a complex and probably variable relationship to the cognitive component of the syndrome). The way these core phenomena are perceived, elaborated and verbalized by the affected person likely depends upon how that person generally functions and appraises her functioning (e.g., how rich and articulated her cognitive life is, or how much she is focused on her body and its functioning), upon the influence of the cultural environment in which she is immersed, and upon the pattern of predisposing and precipitating factors at work in that individual case. Feelings involving the heart (\"heavy heart\", \"heart pain\"; chest tightness, weakness or excessive tension; palpitations) do not appear in textbook descriptions of depression, but are more frequently experienced by depressed individuals than we use to believe1. Ordinary people sometimes refer to depression as \"broken heart\", and we tend to regard this as a metaphor. But, the acute \"broken heart syndrome\" – which has the same precipitating factors as depression and, similarly to the heart involvement in depression, is ascribed to a sympathetic overactivation – is now a recognized clinical entity3. An intrinsic cardiac nervous system (\"a brain in the heart\") has been recently described4, including a multitude of nervous ganglions consisting not only of neurons receiving sympathetic and parasympathetic input, but also of intracardiac interneurons which act as processors of information. Indeed, the heart conveys to the brain more information than the brain sends to the heart, and ascending fibres in the vagus nerve are more numerous than descending ones. Could the above dynamics be an under-recognized factor contributing to the frequent coexistence (\"comorbidity\") and complex interaction between depression and heart disease? That many patients with a diagnosis of depression do not respond adequately to two subsequent antidepressant medications (\"treatment resistance\") is not surprising. Clinical trials of both medications and psychotherapies for depression have aimed during the past few decades to document the \"equivalence\" of any new experimental intervention to an already consolidated one, while \"differences\" in the profiles of action of those interventions have usually not been a focus of attention. Consequently, antidepressants and evidence-based psychotherapies for depression are regarded by treatment guidelines as essentially all \"equivalent\" to each other. It is only recently that secondary analyses of large trial databases, conducted using innovative methodologies, have started to focus again on the \"differences\" between the various antidepressants, and between antidepressants and evidence-based psychotherapies, with respect to their profiles of action5, 6. On the other hand, it is not common in ordinary practice that a patient with a diagnosis of depression receives a detailed clinical characterization beyond that diagnosis, guiding the choice of treatment. It is therefore understandable that a person may receive two or more antidepressants that, although validated for depression tout court, are not among the most appropriate for her specific case, and consequently may not elicit an adequate response. Furthermore, medications do not work in a vacuum: a variety of \"aspecific\" factors (e.g., the therapeutic relationship, family dynamics, the socio-cultural context) may affect the outcome of an intrinsically efficacious intervention. The concept of \"pseudo-resistance\" does not adequately consider at the moment these factors (not to mention problems with the definition of what is an \"adequate response\" to an antidepressant, difficulties in ascertaining the adherence to the antidepressant regimens that have been used, and the basic incongruence of defining a case as \"treatment-resistant\" when one group of therapies currently regarded as first-line in the treatment of depression, i.e. psychotherapies, have not been tried). In this issue of the journal, two papers and a Forum deal, respectively, with the lived experience of depression7, with its multiple \"physical comorbidities\"8, and (in a critical vein) with \"treatment-resistant depression\" and its management9. I think these contributions should be welcome by the scientific community, by people with depression and their families, and by the public at large. A \"depression\" of the individual's psychic/physical tone, energy, drive and/or response to rewarding stimuli may be the outcome of repeated and inescapable adverse events, but also of a disruption of circadian rhythms, a non-psychiatric disease, or the use of certain medications. Or it may occur in the absence of any such evidence as far as the person is aware of, as often happens in bipolar disorder. Perhaps research should more actively focus on those core phenomena, building on the reports of experts by experience and exploring their biological correlates, without any prejudice about whether they are primarily or essentially psychic or physical in nature. The effects of the various antidepressant medications could perhaps be explored – beyond current stereotypes – in the same light (are they psychophysical \"tonics\"?; do they have energizing or disinhibiting properties?; do they affect reward responsiveness?; do they impact psychic/physical pain?), through a more in-depth and nuanced reconstruction of patients' experiences of \"response\" to those agents, and a more targeted investigation of their biological correlates. The same may apply to the effects of other interventions, from physical exercise and behavioural activation to neurostimulation techniques. Neuroscientific explorations of depression should probably look at the autonomic as well as the central nervous system (and at their interactions with the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems in addition to the immune and endocrine ones). Finally (or first of all), some more psychopathological sophistication should perhaps be added to the current conceptualization and description of \"depression\".",

Notwithstanding the variety of theories and the diversity of presentation of anxiety disorders, it would appear that cognitive dysfunction of one sort or another is a characteristic feature of anxiety in all its manifestations. Indeed, it is possible to argue that a cognitive impairment is the primary presenting feature of pathological anxiety, with the characteristic syndrome of somatic symptoms as secondary or necessary consequences of such cognitive disorder.",

      "abstract": "Against all assumptions, leisure and vacation appear to not be recuperative to the same extent for all people. The phenomenon of becoming ill on weekends and/or during vacation has been termed \"leisure sickness\". Attempts to understand this problem can be found in the current literature. Vacation for the wrong motivations or a mismatch between leisure activity and personality are some of the reasons. Other reports show associations between similar health-affecting patterns and personality traits or increased stress, but these factors have not been directly linked to leisure sickness before. Indeed, leisure sickness is not a specific defined illness yet but is more an accumulation of different symptoms that lead to indisposition. If leisure sickness is not only a phenomenon but is actually a real illness, it is seriously preventing people from the benefits of leisure time on the one hand and directly affects vacation experience with respect to destination, hotel and other tourism products on the other hand. Therefore, leisure sickness deserves further investigation.",

The False Memory Syndrome Foundation (FMSF) first coined the term in the 1990s in reaction to an abundance of cases during the previous two decades in which patients claimed to be victims of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) or satanic ritual. These recovered memory cases led to criminal prosecutions of alleged abusers, lawsuits against therapists by former clients and parents, and even legislative reform. The 2008 website of the FMSF supplies the following definition for the syndrome. [A] condition in which a person's identity and interpersonal relationships are centered around a memory of traumatic experience which is objectively false but in which the person strongly believes … [T]he syndrome may be diagnosed when the memory is so deeply ingrained that it orients the individual's entire personality and lifestyle, in turn disrupting all sorts of other adaptive behavior.",

A wide range of reactions, responses and emotions can be brought forth by such experiences. Reactions directly following the event can be characterized as shock. Such reactions might include a feeling that nothing is real, emotional apathy and confusion, as well as physical responses such as trembling, shivering or nausea. Children often react differently than adults. For this reason, adults do not always understand the connection between the child's behavior and the traumatic experience. For instance, depressed children are often active and restless, while depressed adults are sluggish and move at a slower speed.

      "title": "DIAGNOSIS OF FIBROMYALGIA IN HEALTH PRACTICE",
      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia is a chronic non inﬂammatory, non-autoimmune central aﬀerent processing disorder leading to a diﬀuse pain syndrome. It aﬀects individuals of diﬀerent age groups, sex and sociocultural background. It is estimated to aﬀect 2-5% of western population. The symptoms include widespread pain, fatigue, stiﬀness and sleep disturbance, cognitive problems and mood disorders (anxiety, depression or both) 1. The etiology of Fibromyalgia (FM) is unknown; however several factors may contribute to development as well as severity of symptoms of FM. Genetic polymorphisms have been reported in serotonin transporter and receptors, as well as in dopamine, beta2 adrenergic and glutamate receptor genes. 2 Middle aged women and young are more aﬀected. Sleep abnormalities, autonomic dysregulation, and psychological variables like perfectionist personality, negative beliefs, low self-esteem, depression and anxiety are the contributory factors.3 Physical examination and pathological investigations reveal no evidence of articular, osseous or soft tissue inﬂammation or degeneration. Patients may have tender points both above and below the waist. The previously followed criteria, depending on presence of tender points, are no more followed. In 2010, a new diagnostic criterion was adopted by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 4. It has three points: - 1. Widespread pain index (WPI)&gt;7 &amp; a symptom severity (SS) score &gt;5 or widespread pain index 3-6 &amp; (SS) score &gt;9. 2. Symptoms present for at least 3.No other disorder to explain In diﬀerential diagnosis, many diseases need to be ruled out making the diagnosis of FM. These are systemic lupus erythematosis, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteomalacia, rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatic hypothyroidism, chronic hepatitis, HIV, hemo- chromatosis, celiac disease, myasthenia gravis, hyperthyroidism, myopathies, Sjogren`s, adrenal insufficiency, lymphoma and chronic fatigue syndrome.5 Although the exact pathophysiology of FM is unknown, most of the researchers believe that the pathophysiology of FM is due to the central sensitization within the CNS, manifesting as amplified pain perception. The specific abnormalities that have been observed in the aﬀerent pain procession areas of the CNS in FM patients, who exhibit the following symptoms: increased excitability of dorsal horn nuclei due to abnormal windup; increased levels of substance P, nerve growth factor, glutamate and aspartate measured in CSF of patients with FM 6expanded receptive fields for central pain perception (central sensitization); MRI shows expanded fields in the insula, anterior cingulate cortex and somatosensory area.7 The abnormalities within the descending analgesia system are also observed i.e decreased levels of pain inhibitory neurotransmitters including nor epinephrine, serotonin, dopamine and suppression of normal activity of dopamine releasing neurons in limbic system.1 The management of FM is very challenging. It has many components i.e patient education, physical exercises, analgesia, treatment of associated condition like anxiety, depression, and mood disorders. Counseling about the disease and CBT are also helpful. Medication approved for the treatment of FM are: Serotonin-noreprenphine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs); Duloxetine ,venlaxafine, Milnacipran. Anticonvulsants; Pregabalin. Tri cyclic antidepressants: Amitriptyline, imipramine. Analgesia; Tramadol. Paracetamol and NSAIDS are not aﬀective for analgesia.8,9 The diagnosis of FM is quiet challenging in the developed world with good evaluation and referral system. In underdeveloped country with poor medical education and no referral system FM patients are the mostly go un-diagnosed and hence are under treated. It is high time to highlight the importance of diagnosis of FM by the general practitioner and other specialties doctors for proper management of these patients. The disease impact of FM is not less than any other chronic inﬂammatory disease like Rheumatoid Arthritis. On an average the FM patients visit doctor 3-4 times more often than the general population (17 versus 4 visits/year). The frequent visits of patients with FM, is one of the factors of increasing burden on health system as well as having socio-economic impact on patients.",

      "title": "States of consciousness: new insights and further questions",
      "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of a severe brain injury survivors are usually in coma, which is characterised as a state of unresponsiveness without any understanding or purposeful functions, although reflex responses can still be elicited. If the injury is severe enough but not fatal, the coma can persist for days or weeks, but it is nonetheless recognised to be a transient condition which evolves into other defined conscious states. Consciousness may be regained, but if not signs of a persistent vegetative state (also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) or a minimally conscious state develop. Both the latter are characterised by spontaneous or induced eye opening and sleep wake cycles, with additional responses such as apparent crying, laughing, or smiling. In the minimally conscious state there are also reproducible if inconsistent visual, verbal, or gestural responses to particular stimuli. In both these states, signs depend on relatively intact brain stem function, contrasting with the locked-in syndrome, a condition in which brain stem dysfunction prevents a conscious person from demonstrating their awareness.1, 2 Recognition of the two states of reduced consciousness has informed treatment and management decisions. Families and others who can see obvious signs of improvement, in that a person is no longer completely unresponsive or comatose, often expect further recovery. Standard advice is that in adults and children the potential for recovery from the persistent vegetative state, and the time to allow, depends on the cause: significant improvement can still occur up to 12 months after traumatic injury, but only up to 3 months after a non-traumatic injury, such as near-drowning. The potential for recovery from a minimally responsive state may be better, but it is not clear by how much, or if the time scales differ. One group reported that in the first 3 months there is a good chance of reasonable recovery but this falls sharply with longer durations, especially after non-traumatic injuries. In the latter groups survivors may continue to improve in terms of responsiveness but most remain severely disabled.1, 3, 4 However, problems remain. Detailed definitions of the clinical features of the two states differ.3 Distinguishing the two states is clinically difficult, although specific scales increase diagnostic precision.2 It seems logical to expect that in some patients with additional brain stem damage a state of reduced consciousness might co-exist with a degree of locked-in syndrome. In addition, from personal experience some patients do not show spontaneous eye opening or sleep-wake cycles despite other responses suggestive of a minimally conscious state. Such cases are not defined or studied in the medical literature. Finally over the last few years functional neuroimaging studies, mostly in adults, have shown that some patients have much more cortical responsiveness than clinically suspected, meaning that some thought to be in a persistent vegetative state may be at least minimally conscious.5 In one study 13 out of 41 patients classified by a standard scale as being in the vegetative state showed activity compatible with a minimally conscious state on neuroimaging between 3 weeks and 8 years after the injury. Twelve months later some clinical improvement in consciousness had occurred in most, usually to a minimally conscious state. One, assessed approximately 5 weeks after a traumatic injury, had recovered fully but the other survivors were still severely disabled.5 Ideally perhaps patients should now all be assessed by functional neuroimaging, but that may be impractical. The predictive value of more accessible modalities such as EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation are still being explored. For all these, it would be clinically helpful if outcome studies followed a standard format to report the state and how it was assessed at fixed times after the injury, such as 3 months and 6 months, and the prognosis at 12 months or thereafter, subdivided into traumatic and non-traumatic groups. In the meantime all patients in such states should be assumed to have some awareness some of the time, which means for example that there must be adequate analgesia for painful conditions or procedures, and that further discussion is needed on the relationship between responsiveness and awareness. In children these difficulties are even more marked. There is limited data on both the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and outcome, especially in the very young age groups.1 Clinical scales have not been validated in children. Some studies of functional imaging have included children or young people but do not always report their data separately. Patient and medical groups should lobby for standardized outcome studies in children, which should be large enough to provide useful data for smaller subgroups.",

      "abstract": "Mild head injury is a quiet disorder. It is common, typically bloodless and without call for significant medical intervention. It seems even more quiet because the noise it does make (its symptoms) is often attributed to other causes. Nevertheless the disruption in coping capacity and attendent breakdown in usual behavioral patterns causes more psychosocial and academic‐economic hardship than have begun to be appreciated. Cognitive mental changes such as impairment in attention, memory, and information processing even when mild and apparently transient can produce altered patterns of achievement and self confidence with long lived reverberations. Emotional irritability and lethargy also produce a chain of reactions likely to outlive the primary source of the disruption. Add to this decreased frustration tolerance, increased fatigability, lowered resilence to stress and uncertainty as to the origin of these difficulties and one has recipe for prolonged impairment. Place these ingredients into the person of a child, with all a child's limits on autonomy and verbal self report and the result is a myriad of reported and unreported social, academic and even familial disruptions exacerbated by the common clinical failure of identification of their correct underlying etiology.",

Crushing, cutting and burning generally have no algogenic effect in the viscera whereas mechanical stimulation, ischemia and chemical stimulation, separately or in combinations, may cause pain. With these characteristics, visceral pain differs from somatic pain. The characteristics of visceral pain, perception and transmission of painful visceral stimuli are explained, some common visceral pain syndromes are presented and sympathetic neurodestructive approaches as a treatment option are described in this review.",

      "abstract": "The clinical observations on alexithymia which were initiated by Sifneos and Nemiah in the earlier 1970s have given rise to a host of studies with implications beyond the psychosomatic field of enquiry. Is alexithymia a pathology of affect or a character neurosis; is it primary or secondary; genetic or developmental? Is it an adaptational deformation related to social class and low psychological sophistication, a life style or a cerebral deficit? Is it global and consistent (trait) or partial and temporary (state)? Is it part of the necessary and sufficient condition for the development of a psychosomatic symptom or is it a nonspecific autoplastic alteration? It is quite possible that alexithymia is one of several mediating processes between stress and disease along with genetic susceptibility, developmental variables, context and reaction to untoward life events, coping dispositions, psychosocial support and sociocultural factors. Therapeutic approaches would depend on whether we are dealing with a primary affectless condition or a secondary one. A differential diagnosis is essential since self-numbing following psychic trauma or a pathological grief, masked and atypical depression are treatable. Blocking of affect may have dire effects on the psychosomatic economy and on the capacity for intimacy. Muscular and psychological rigidity, weariness, ennui and anhedonia may be the only clues to the presence of alexithymia. Since we may be dealing with a spectrum disorder, there is no single treatment modality. There are no controlled studies on the use of psychotropic drugs and psychoanalytic-oriented and behavioral approaches have been shown to be of some benefit.",

By contrast, a pain which is chosen and controlled through personal discipline with the goal of pushing oneself to one’s limits (sport, body art, suspensions, getting a tattoo or a piercing, etc.) contains only a trifling element of suffering, even if it hurts. One merely has to accept a bearable level of discomfort. And the paradox is that, on occasion, recourse to pain is a means of combating suffering, as in the case of teenagers who self-harm.",

      "abstract": "Sensory-perceptual alteration can be defined as when there is a change in the pattern of sensory stimuli followed by an abnormal response to such stimuli. Such perceptions could be increased, decreased, or distorted with the patient's hearing, vision, touch sensation, smell, or kinesthetic responses to stimuli. Such changes in the pattern of responses to stimuli lead to changes in a patient’s behavior, sensory acuity, decision-making process, and problem-solving abilities. This can lead to irritability, restlessness, poor concentration, fluctuating mental status, changes in communication due to inattention, and lack of focus. Furthermore, sensory deprivation in isolated patients can lead to anxiety, depression, aggression, hallucinations, and psychotic reactions. Any alteration in a patient's normal environment can result in stress especially if such alteration is involuntary. Sensory overload occurs when an individual experiences a stimulus that they are unable to manage and process. Usually, the second stimulus is filtered out by selective perception or coping behavior. However, in certain environmental conditions such as the emergency department, or due to specific underlying illnesses such as dementia, sensory overload can occur due to inadequate filtering of stimuli.Sensory deprivation occurs when an individual receives a stimulus that is reduced or below the threshold of normal. Risk factors to such alterations can be broadly due to acute illnesses, patient factors related to chronic medical conditions, aging, or due to environmental or iatrogenic causes. This typically occurs when the patient is placed in isolation, such as changes in the environment due to hospital admission or admission to isolated wards. While in isolation, there can be a reduction in the quantity and quality of stimuli and restriction of social interaction. Other risk factors that can lead to increased or decreased alteration in the processing of stimuli can be due to hearing impairment, loss of vision, loss of smell or taste, aging, trauma, electrolyte imbalance, seizure disorder, mental health problems, and genetic causes.",

The essential feature of this syndrome is the decrease in self-esteem that follows the real or perceived loss of the ability to work productively. The decrease in self-esteem triggers anxiety, which may be so severe as to approach a panic state. The patient then becomes increasingly disabled or has increasing physical symptoms and enters a vicious cycle culminating in debility.

This alteration in emotional self-regulation implies greater disability than that attributed to the traditional dimensions -attention deficit and hyperactivity- with an evident impact on the development of personality.To review how the confluence of poor self-regulatory skills, emotion awareness and autonomy, and a particular temperament profile increase the risk of children diagnosed with ADHD for the development of a range of adjustment problems in childhood and adolescence.The typical temperamental profile of children with ADHD is characterised by high emotional reactivity and poor self-regulatory skills. The effects of the interaction of emotionality and temperament in ADHD can be either direct on the child himself or indirect on the environment, interactional by fitting or mismatch with environmental expectations, and transactional due to their dynamic relation with other characteristics in the child's environment.The confluence of poor self-regulation skills, emotion awareness and autonomy, and a temperament profile with a higher novelty seeking and lower persistence increase the risk of children diagnosed with ADHD for the development of a series of adjustment and adaptation problems in childhood and adolescence.Emocionalidad y temperamento en el trastorno por deficit de atencion con o sin hiperactividad.Introduccion.

      "abstract": "The term „burnout” does not denote a psychiatric category, but a psychological label for the experience of a long-lasting exhaustion and loss of interest. Burnout is not an explicitly recognized disorder in prominent classifications of diseases. It is rather a state of emotional exhaustion and reduced sense of personal accomplishment than a syndrome or a disease. It can be assessed, e.g., by The Maslach Burnout Inventory which uses a three dimensional description of exhaustion, cynicism, and inefficacy. Some authors argue for an “exhaustion only” model that sees exhaustion as the hallmark of „burnout“. Engagement, which is characterized by energy and efficacy, may be regarded as the opposite to burnout, which is characterized by exhaustion, cynicism and inefficacy. On the other hand, this condition is described in the ICD-10 as “Problems related to lifemanagement difficulty” (Z73, i.e., not among mental disorders but among Factors influencing health status and contact with health services, Z00-99). As this condition is also described in DSM-IV as “adjustment disorder”, the concept of „burnout” seems to be redundant and useful only out of medicine as a journalistic label for a reaction which can be classified otherwise.",

      "title": "Djinnati Syndrome in Baluchistan: The Role of Traumatic and Abuse Experiences on Individual Vulnerability",
      "abstract": "is a culture-bound syndrome in Baluchestan, Iran. Experts believe that dissociation theory is more suitable for providing a psychopathological description of this syndrome in this region. In addition, they highlight need for investigating its pathology, particularly role of factors such as traumatic and abuse experiences during childhood.\r\n\r\nAccording to 4th edition of diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-IV-TR) (1), the essential feature of dissociative disorders is a disruption in usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, or perception of environment. The disturbance may be sudden or gradual, transient or chronic. According to DSM-IV-TR, dissociative disorders include: dissociative identity disorder, depersonalization disorder, dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue and unspecified dissociative disorder. A dissociate disorder not otherwise specified (NOS) is a disorder that includes a dissociative symptom (i.e. disturbance in usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity or perception of environment), that does not meet criteria for any specific dissociative disorder.\r\n\r\nIn addition, according to DSM a dissociative state may be defined as a dissociative trance disorder that includes a possession or trance state. Dissociative trance disorder is a single or episodic disturbance in state of consciousness, identity, or memory that are indigenous to particular locations and cultures. Dissociative trance involves narrowing of awareness of immediate surroundings or stereotyped behaviors or movements that are experienced as being beyond one’s control. Possession trance involves replacement of customary sense of personal identity or a new identity, attributed to influence of a spirit, power, deity, or other person, and is associated with stereotyped “involuntary” movements or amnesia. It is probably most prevalent dissociative disorder in Asia. The dissociative or trance disorder is not a normal part of a broadly accepted collective cultural or religious practice.\r\n\r\nMany culture-related syndromes, such as amok, bebainan, latah, pibloktoq, ataque de nervios and possession, shin-byung, enchantment, lack of spirit, Zar and djinnati (2, 3), are considered as dissociative disorders. Culture-bound syndromes include a set of psychological phenomena that are of interest to psychologists and psychiatrists. The eclectic nature of this syndrome has made it difficult to have a precise definition. Thus, deciding on a specific definition has been controversial. According to DSM, term culture-bound syndrome denotes a locality-specific pattern and repetition of an aberrant behavior and troubling experience that may or may not be linked to a particular DSM-IV diagnostic category. Many of these patterns are indigenously considered to be illnesses, or at least afflictions that mostly have local names. Culture-bound syndromes do not one-by-one match routine diagnostic system diseases. Most of these syndromes were initially reported as an issue specific to a certain culture or a relevant set, or geographically-related to original culture (4).\r\n\r\nThe term Djinnati is a culture-bound syndrome, widely known by that name in Iranian and Pakistani Baluchestan (3, 5). Based on clinical observations, this syndrome was introduced by Bakhshani and Kianpoor in Baluchestan, Iran (6). A new study by Bakhshani et al. (3) on a rural population in Baluchestan showed total prevalence of 0.5% and 1.03% among rural population and women of that population, respectively. Common symptoms of this disorder include disruption in consciousness, memory and stereotyped behaviors such as laughing, crying, speaking incomprehensibly, which are attributed to a new identity known as Djinn. Attacks usually begin with pain, irritation and sometimes limb paralysis. In some groups, loss of speech and in some other cases, speaking in different languages and change in speaking rhythm and tone of voice have been reported. In addition, there was a partial and rarely complete amnesia during attack. Some patients were far beyond their physical strength. In addition, lack of control and harming themselves and others, during attack, have been reported; although, injuries were not serious. Sometimes during attack, The patients express some demands and possessor (Djinn) requests for satisfying these demands. Attacks usually last from 30 minutes to two hours (3). \r\n\r\nIt seems that traumatic and abuse experiences have an essential role in initiation and maintenance of dissociative disorders (7, 8). Results from Bakhshani et al. (3) study showed that 43% of patients experienced their first attack after a traumatic accident (5). After civil war of Mozambique, based on results of a study reported by Igreja et al. (9) on 941 subjects (255 males and 686 females), trauma and civil war resulted damages, which explain high prevalence of this disorder.\r\n\r\nCastillo (10), believes that biological and psychoanalytic perspectives are not capable of explaining spirit possession. Etiologically, he suggested that spirit possession, similar to multiple personality disorder (MPD), is a spontaneous trance reaction to severe and negative events in environment (particularly child abuse). On other hand, Naring and Nijenhuis observed a significant correlation between traumatic events and possession experiences (11). In addition, Naring and Nijenhuis (11) considered dissociative identity disorder to be a consequence of childhood abuse or other traumatic events, thus support post-trauma model. In this regard, a study by Pasquini et al. (12), showed a relationship between traumatic experience in childhood and development of dissociative disorders. Kaplan et al. (13) found that those with higher score in dissociative experience scale had been more sexually abused during their childhood. They have been reported to commit further suicide and aggressive behaviors (13).\r\n\r\nIn general, it can be concluded that traumatic experiences, specifically childhood maltreatment and abuse, are related to possession and dissociative experiences. Therefore, in future studies, it is required to investigate type of cultural beliefs abuse and other environmental factors with onset of clinical signs of Djinatti, and then develop and practice preventive and therapeutic approaches, based on findings.",

Other names such as somatisation and somatoform disorder are also being used but imply different definitions.1–3 Patients with medically unexplained symptoms do not fit into the existing framework of a biomedical model that tends to focus on the exclusion of physical disease. However, the exclusion of relevant physical disease may not in itself cure the patient. He or she may still feel ill and seek medical care. Medically unexplained symptoms therefore represent a clinical problem that must be taken seriously.1–4 General practice has a key role in the management of this clinical problem as at least 20-30% of primary care patients have medically unexplained symptoms.

It is important to accurately identify genuine cases of PTSD and, as part of the differential diagnosis, to rule out instances of false PTSD. False PTSD diagnoses can adversely affect treatment planning, resource management, and research. The subjective nature of stressors, stereotypic presentation of symptoms, wealth of resources detailing how to malinger PTSD, and the high stakes for individuals involved in criminal, civil, and disability evaluations create challenges for making an accurate diagnosis. This article presents a systematic approach to help clinicians and forensic evaluators distinguish genuine PTSD from false variants of the disorder. It describes the types of false PTSD to be considered as alternative diagnoses, including malingered PTSD (for external gain, such as receiving a disability pension or evading criminal consequences), factitious PTSD (for internal gain, such as assuming the victim or hero/veteran role), and misattributed PTSD (legitimate psychopathology misdiagnosed as PTSD). The authors describe clinical features and psychological testing that may be leveraged to aid in reaching a more valid diagnosis.",

Possible causes include pain, preoperative anxiety, type of surgical procedures, personal characteristics of the patient, and type of anesthetics, although no sole factor can explain the etiology of emergence agitation/delirium [4], in large part due to the greatest obstacle to understanding emergence agitation/delirium is the lack of a standardized tool to assess it.

      "title": "A Changing Landscape: Traumatic Brain Injury in Military Combat and Civilian Athletics",
      "abstract": "Combat scene, a wounded or dead hoplite lies on the ground, black-figured hydria, Cleimachos (potter), 560-550 BCE. Louvre, (Museum), Paris, France. Photo credit: Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY. Diagnosing concussion has posed a special challenge in current military conflicts, as some symptoms and clinical findings are similar to acute stress reaction and other conditions. The Department of Defense (DoD) currently defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as: a traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force that is indicated by new onset or worsening of at least one of the following clinical signs, immediately following the event: 1) any period of loss of a decreased level of consciousness (LOC), 2) any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury, 3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking, etc.), 4) neurological deficits (weakness, loss of balance, change in vision, praxis, paresis/plegia, sensory loss, aphasia, etc.) that may or may not be transient, or 5) the presence of an intracranial lesion (1). Diagnosing TBI currently depends on a thorough history and the patient's status at the time of injury, and there is currently no single objective test or diagnostic biomarker for concussion/mild TBI (mTBI). Advancing diagnostic efforts, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command is funding biomarker studies to identify the unique biological effects of TBI and leverage knowledge to develop more objective diagnostic tools to determine the severity of brain injury. TBI severity within the DoD are currently classified as mild/moderate/severe (1). Concussion/mTBI involves normal structural imaging, LOC for up to 30 min, alteration of consciousness up to 24 h, and post-traumatic amnesia up to 24 h. If a patient meets criteria in more than one category of severity, the provider assigns the higher severity level. Definition standardization remains a problem as concussion grading systems and definitions published by various organizations make comparing findings from various research studies extremely difficult. A collaborative effort among the DoD, Veterans Health Administration, Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Brain Trauma Foundation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is developing a medically useful definition and staging criteria for mTBI/concussion. We live in a sport-crazed society, and although injury is usually an accepted consequence of “playing the game,” there is a heightened awareness about sport concussions. Pick up a newspaper, or watch the evening news or “Sports Center,” and you're bound to read or hear something about sport concussions. The media are obsessed with this topic, particularly with the negative news that makes headlines and ultimately sells newspapers. Even so, there is good news to report, and progress is being made. Forty-nine states have passed concussion laws in the past 4 years, aimed at educating athletes, parents, and coaches about the symptoms of concussion and the dangers of continuing to play while still symptomatic. According to the CDC, Emergency Department diagnosis of youth sport concussions has increased by an estimated 60% over the past decade (2). Surprisingly, this is good news, as it speaks to the increased public awareness and better recognition of concussion, as opposed to an increase in actual concussions. Concussion remains a major military concern given the short- and long-term impacts to our service members; recent conflicts have sparked an increase in TBI research funding designed to accelerate medical innovation. There were 266,810 service members in the DoD from 2000 to 2012 who were diagnosed with TBI—81.7% of these injuries concussions (3). Although the risk for TBI is certainly higher in the combat environment, the majority of these injuries (83.4%) is actually nondeployment-associated (3). In parallel to sport-concussion awareness, military medicine has also taken significant policy steps to promote early identification and concussion treatment (4). In 2010, the DoD published a policy mandating that any deployed service member involved in a potentially concussive event (such as 50 m from a blast, vehicle collision or rollover, blow to the head, etc.) receive a medical evaluation using the Military Acute Concussion Evaluation; receive a minimum 24 h of downtime, even if he was not diagnosed with a concussion; and must be re-evaluated prior to returning to duty (5). Since then, the DoD has screened over 14,950 deployed service members for concussion and has staffed 11 Concussion Care Centers in Afghanistan that promote concussion recovery and medical oversight (internal DoD data; personal communication). The U.S. Army is implementing this concept worldwide to ensure one standard of concussion care, whether the injury occurs on the battlefield or in garrison. The Veterans Administration-DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines (6) were rated as the highest concussion-management guideline in a 2011 edition of Brain Injury (7). Beginning in 2009, the DoD has published numerous TBI clinical recommendations in collaboration with civilian experts in the areas of cognitive rehabilitation, driving assessment, postinjury neurocognitive testing in the deployed environment, management of neuroendocrine dysfunction, assessment and treatment of dizziness, and management of visual dysfunction (8), and an additional three clinical recommendations will be published this year to include graded return to activity, sleep disturbances, and use of neuroimaging. The tests for detecting concussion and tracking recovery are becoming more sensitive, especially when used in combination with other tools to create a multimodal approach to concussion assessment. Despite all that has been accomplished, caring for service members and athletes at risk for sustaining cerebral concussion has always been a challenging task and never more so than in today's litigious society. Concussion is different from other injuries, in that we still rely heavily on an athlete's or a service member's subjective reporting of symptoms for decisionmaking, and we lack the neuroimaging protocols that might allow us to identify the damage and understand its severity. The cause-and-effect relationships, or lack of same, between repetitive head trauma and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are the subject of significant debate. Several published case reports have described tau deposits in the brains of deceased contact-sport athletes, but most of the neuroscience community does not believe that controlled experimental research has yet identified a causal relationship linking repetitive head trauma in sports and CTE(9–12). Innovative neuroimaging techniques are on the horizon and will eventually permit tau and other proteins to be traced in vivo. This should allow for prospective investigations comparing head-impact exposure with tau accumulation, leading to earlier detection and interventions for these chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In the meantime, our responsibility is to safely care for our service members and athletes, to educate them about what is known and unknown regarding the long-term effects of repetitive head trauma, and to ensure that family members, coaches, and military unit leaders implement supportive recovery practices. Unfortunately, the large amount of misinformation on this topic sometimes results in hysteria rather than rational thinking. Concussions are like snowflakes: no two are alike, and no cookbook or calendar can specify exactly how they should be treated. Therefore, we need to go the extra mile. In many cases, it's a matter of counseling our service members and our athletes about the short- and long-term risks of not reporting symptoms, returning to play or duty while still experiencing symptoms, or not modifying risky behaviors that can predispose them to future concussions. We need individualized and sport-specific return-to-play progressions that ensure that service members and athletes are physically and cognitively prepared to return to activity. No checkbox system can be applied to every concussion, and as concussions are diverse and unique injuries that affect each athlete differently, we must learn how to treat them individually. Likewise, concussed service members and athletes are unique, and we must work to understand what makes them different. Sports medicine clinicians must play the important role of counselor to our athletes. Getting to know each athlete's mindset and reaction to injuries allows us to build trust and forge honest lines of communications, thus enabling us to develop an appropriate and individualized plan for managing concussion, which is just as vital as knowing how to interpret the results of a cognitive or balance test. Within a 6-month period, four major consensus or evidence-based documents focused on concussion management will have been released, including the new “Zurich International Guidelines” or the Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport: the 4th International Conference on Concussion in Sport (13–16). This, along with other manuscripts published or soon to be published by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, the American Academy of Neurology, and the National Athletic Trainers' Association, should all be mandatory reading for sports medicine clinicians, as they will define the standard of care for sports medicine clinicians for at least the next 4–5 years. These documents are well-prepared and will make significant contributions to the sports medicine community. The landscape is changing, and these evidence-based guidelines are leading us in a better direction. Although the neuroscience community has learned much about concussion in the last two decades, we admittedly have much more to investigate and to understand.",

      "title": "Somatization",
      "abstract": "Abstract Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are particularly common presentations in primary care settings. They lie on a severity spectrum, with significant overlaps with other functional somatic syndromes, psychiatric diagnoses like depression and anxiety, and general medical conditions. Typically, symptoms present with either no identifiable medical aetiology, or are disproportionate to the cause, with associated distress and preoccupations, health-related anxiety, and help-seeking behaviours. Cultural factors are known to shape shared mental representations about interpreting such symptom experiences and are therefore vital determinants of health and illness reporting. The nosology of MUS has been debated, deliberated, and transformed several times over the last century. Several models have been proposed to understand the pathogenesis of MUS based on the complex interaction of developmental, personality, cognitive–perceptual, cultural, and emotional processes within a bio-psycho-socio-cultural framework. Effective and sensitive communication of socio-culturally grounded and individualized illness formulations that link the individual’s belief systems, diagnosis, and treatment options are key to managing MUS. Medications are used to treat severe symptoms or comorbid psychiatric diagnoses. Psychotherapy that targets coping, help-seeking behaviours, and real-world functioning is also effective.",

      "title": "Causal Thinking for Objective Psychiatric Diagnostic Criteria: A Programmatic Approach in Therapeutic Context",
      "abstract": "Terms such as disorder, illness, disease, dysfunction, and deviance embody the preconceptions of historical development (Klein, 1999). That individuals become ill for no apparent reason, suffering from pain, dizziness, malaise, rash, wasting, etc., has been known since prehistoric days. The recognition of illness led to the social definition of the patient and the development of various treatment institutions (e.g., nursing, medicine, surgery, quacks, and faith healers). Illness is an involuntary affliction that justifies the sick, dependent role (Parsons, 1951). That is, because the sick have involuntarily impaired functioning, it is a reasonable social investment to exempt them (at least temporarily) from normal responsibilities. Illness implies that something has gone wrong. However, gaining exemption from civil or criminal responsibilities is often desired. Therefore, if no objective criteria are available, an illness claim can be viewed skeptically. By affirming involuntary affliction, diagnosis immunizes the patient against charges of exploitative parasitism. Therefore, illness may be considered a hybrid concept, with two components: (1) the necessary inference that something has actually, involuntarily, gone wrong (disease) and (2) the qualification that the result (illness) must be sufficiently major, according to current social values, to ratify the sickness exemption role. The latter component is related to the particular historical stage, cultural traditions, and values. This concept has been exemplified by the phrase ‘‘harmful dysfunction’’ (Wakefield, 1992). However, this does not mean that the illness concept is arbitrary since the inference that something has gone wrong is necessary. Beliefs as to just what has gone wrong (e.g., demon possession, bad air, bacterial infection) as well as the degree of manifested dysfunction that warrants the sick role reflect the somewhat independent levels of scientific and social development (for further reference, see Lewis, 1967). How can we affirm that something has gone wrong if there is no objective evidence? The common statistical definition of abnormality simply is ‘‘unusual.’’ Something is abnormal if it is rare. Although biological variability ensures that someone is at an extreme, there is a strong presumption that something has gone wrong if sufficiently extreme.",

Morse and colleagues' criteria (definition, characteristics, boundaries, preconditions, outcomes) were used to analyze related concepts (suffering, psychache, emotional pain, and psychic pain) that could contribute to a definition of psychological pain. The analysis indicated that psychological pain may best be defined as a lasting, unsustainable, and unpleasant feeling resulting from negative appraisal of an inability or deficiency of the self. This negative self-appraisal is typically brought on by loss of someone or something, or failure to achieve something that is intimately linked to core psychological needs.",

The grief reactions can be divided into stress-specific reactions (typical, chronic, inhibited, and delayed grief) and non-specific and mixed reactions (distorted grief). It is especially in the latter group the diagnostical difficulties show up. The reason is, that the symptomatology in these cases is very diffuse and the clinical picture may look like many other psychiatric diseases. A case with the clinical picture of depression caused by pathological grief is discussed in relationship to other kinds of depression. Regarding psychiatric patients it is often difficult to unveil the trauma/loss. In some patients there will be more than one loss, and the problem is to find out which one has caused the symptoms. Besides, sometimes the traumatic loss is unconscious. In order to unveil the trauma we have used a combined physio-psychotherapy, which in the uncovering phase is characterized by a therapeutic non-directive attitude, where the patient is grounded, relaxed, concentrated, and as close to himself as possible in order to facilitate thoughts, emotions, body sensations etc. to emerge. When you have identified the type of loss, the therapy follows the basic principles: The inhibited emotions must be expressed and painful situations must be repeated until the emotions are extinguished. During the therapy the psychiatric patient will be in danger of becoming psychotic or committing suicide, and often it has been necessary to apply psychopharmaca to accomplish the therapy, even if many authors warn against it. The difficulties of treating hospitalized patients with pathological grief are to my opinion counterbalanced by the advantages of the in-patient psychiatric department, where you have the possibility of using various kinds of professionals, whose combined methods of treatment may ensure a successful therapy.Key Words: Pathological griefpsychotherapy",

It is not considered a form of mental illness or psychopathology, although it can occur in the context of other mental illnesses. Even though it is easy to define, clinicians still find making the diagnosis very challenging. Although clinicians face malingered symptoms regularly in the emergency room and on the general psychiatric wards, they are most likely reluctant to diagnose it for fear of being sued or so as not to stigmatize the patient. Identifying a malingerer will help focus resources toward patients with genuine symptoms. However, there is the perception by the typical patient who exhibits symptoms suggestive of malingering that he or she is being called a liar. This review presents two case scenarios and discusses how clinicians can diagnose malingering as well as the tactical approach towards its management.",

There may also be a tendency for the nature of the illness to change over the years and the diagnosis may change accordingly.

      "title": "The subjective experience of negative symptoms : characteristics of emotional withdrawal",
      "abstract": "According to the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), negative symptoms are those personal characteristics that are thought to be reduced from normal functioning, while positive symptoms are aspects of functioning that exist as an excess or distortion of normal functioning. Negative symptoms are generally considered to be a core feature of people diagnosed with schizophrenia. However, negative symptoms are not always present in those diagnosed, and a diagnosis can be made with only negative or only positive symptoms, or with a combination of both.\r\n\r\nNegative symptoms include an observed loss of emotional expression (affective flattening), loss of motivation or self directedness (avolition), loss of speech (alogia), and also a loss of interests and pleasures (anhedonia). Positive symptoms include the perception of things that others do not perceive (hallucinations), and extraordinary explanations for ordinary events (delusions) (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Both negative and positive symptoms are derived from watching the patient and thus do not consider the patient’s subjective experience.\r\n\t\r\nHowever, aspects of negative symptoms, such as observed affective flattening are highly contended. Within conventional psychiatry, the absence of emotional expression is assumed to coincide with an absence of emotional experience. Contrasting research findings suggests that patients who were observed to score low on displayed emotional expression, scored high on self ratings of emotional experience. Patients were also observed to be significantly lower on emotional expression when compared with others (Aghevli, Blanchard, & Horan, 2003; Selton, van der Bosch, & Sijben, 1998). It appears that there is little correlation between emotional experience and emotional expression in patients, and that observer ratings cannot help us to understand the subjective experience of the negative symptoms.\r\n\r\nThis chapter will focus on research into the subjective experiences of negative symptoms. A framework for these experiences will be used from the qualitative research findings of the primary author (Le Lievre, 2010). In this study, the primary author found that subjective experiences of the negative symptoms belonged to one of the two phases of the illness experience; “transitioning into emotional shutdown” or “recovering from emotional shutdown”. \r\n\r\nThis chapter will use the six themes from the phase of “transitioning into emotional shutdown”. This phase described the experience of turning the focus of attention away from the world and onto the self and the past, thus losing contact with the world and others (emotional shutdown). Transitioning into emotional shutdown involved; “not being acknowledged”, “relational confusion”, “not being expressive”, “reliving the past”, “detachment”, and “no sense of direction” (Le Lievre, 2010). Detail will be added to this framework of experience from other qualitative research in this area. We will now review the six themes that constitute a “transition into emotional shutdown” and corresponding previous research findings.",

In the other possible scenario, the individual experiences a negative reaction to the stressor. Herein, at some point the person begins to exhibit behavioral, mood, or emotional symptoms, the person is then described as manifesting an adjustment disorder, and there is then the need to initiate change in order to restore even functioning. It is important to emphasize that adjustment disorders differ from acute stress disorders in that the latter represent reactions to extraordinary traumatic stressors (i.e., life‐threatening events).",

Une modification de comportements habituels, en fréquence ou en intensité; des comportements pouvant présenter des risques pour la personne ou son entourage font suspecter une souffrance qu’il convient d’évaluer afin de pouvoir la prendre en charge au mieux. La fréquence sous-estimée de pathologies somatiques et leur retard de prise en charge entraînent souvent des douleurs dont la seule expression peut être un trouble majeur du comportement ou un retrait inquiétant. Dans les cas de personnes n’ayant pas le langage, ou un langage fonctionnel limité (de type écholalique par exemple), ayant aussi des particularités sensorielles, il est utile d’avoir recours à des outils d’hétéro-évaluation de la douleur [1].

It is characterized by behavior and other mental process which involve coercion for occasional or regular use of addiction resources with intention to experience it's effect on mental process or to avoid discomfort due to absence of such a resource (medium). Psychic (mental) addiction is characterized by feeling of satisfaction and will for drug re-consummation to cause comfort and avoid discomfort. Physical addiction is defined as a condition of adjustment on drugs followed by need for increase of dose to achieve its effect as it was in the beginning with smaller quantity and with occurrence of abstinence crisis in absence of drugs. Addiction may be and combination of these two types. Psychic (mental) addiction is close to physical in manifestations (something what human misses) but cause is not (or does not have to be) real, therefore it does not have to be about intoxicated substances (only). Human can be addicted to food, lottery games, television, internet, work, some other human or about anything but common characteristic is that activities connected to addiction may become central content and factor of his/her living. Such different addictions have and different importance, influence and consequences and addiction does not have to be necessarily negative phenomenon although it is mostly considered and judged as such.

It is suggested that the extent of such injury is unrelated to the magnitude of shock current and that the timing of the ldquodiffuse electrical injuryrdquo may be indefinitely delayed with respect to the time of the sustained shock. Other reports refer to possible shock injury mechanisms that manifest solely with neuropsychological symptoms. A critical examination of this literature reveals no mechanistic basis for the association of the proposed physical symptoms of diffuse electrical injury with remote injury. Additionally, serious errors in the stated methodology of the publications citing the existence of diffuse electrical injury cast doubt upon the scientific basis for the stated conclusions.",

      "abstract": "Burnout is a highly researched syndrome resulting from job stress. It is an ultimate response that occurs because of chronic exposure to stressors from the job characterised by the magnitudes/key dimensions which are feeling of cynicism, sense of ineffectiveness, detachment from the job, lack of accomplishment and overwhelming exhaustion.1 This implies that burnout characterised by a variety of factors can cause extreme suffering to an individual. Exhaustion is a central quality of burnout and the most obvious manifestation of this complex syndrome. It refers to feelings of being overextended and depleted on one’s emotional and physical resources. The individual feels drained due to perpetual lack of energy as a result of which, the quality of work responsibility is compromised. The major sources of this exhaustion are work overload and personal conflicts at the work place. The cynicism dimension represents the interpersonal context that refers to negative, callous, or excessively detached response to various aspects of the job which results in the loss if idealism and dehumanisation of others. The inefficacy dimension represents the self-evaluation component of burnout that refers to feeling of incompetence and lack of achievement and productivity in work. Burnout is a cumulative reaction on ongoing occupational stressors. Healthcare professionals, especially clinicians seem to be at particular risk for burnout. Additionally nurses, specifically psychiatric nurses are considered as a group at risk for excessive stress and burnout because they are in constant interaction and frequent interpersonal contact with psychiatric clients and their families.2 These reasons and risk factors can be same in between the professions, however, even within the discipline there are gender differences that calls for further discussions.

      "title": "Persistent Delusional Disorder Presenting as Munchausen by Proxy - A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Delusion is a false, unshakable belief that is out of keeping with the patient’s social and cultural background (Patricia Casey et al, 2019). Persistent delusional disorder (PDD) is characterized by the development either of a single delusion or of a set of related delusions which are usually persistent and sometimes lifelong. Often they are persecutory, hypochondriacal, or grandiose, but they may be concerned with litigation or jealously, or express a conviction that the individual’s body is misshapen, or that others think that he or she smells or is homosexual (ICD-10 classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders). Delusional disorder with delusions of infidelity has been called conjugal paranoia or Othello syndrome (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2015). Munchausen syndrome was first termed by Asher in 1951. Munchausen syndrome by proxy, essentially, is a form of child abuse in which a parent, usually the mother, or a caregiver repeatedly fabricates or actually inflicts injury or illness in a child for whom medical intervention is then sought, often in an emergency setting (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2015). This case report presents one such beautiful case, where a father with persistent delusional disorder repeatedly fabricates an illness in his daughter, and make multiple requests to medicate his daughter. The core component of the delusional belief was infidelity. Initially, it was difficult to find any psychopathology in the daughter, except for some maladaptive reaction formation to frequent altercations with the father. Subsequently, it was realized that the father had persistent delusional belief related to his daughter’s fidelity (which was not corroborated by the daughter or other relatives). Personality can play a role in the genesis of delusional states; abnormally suspicious personalities can react to difficulties with deepening ideas of persecution, or may slowly develop delusions of marital infidelity or bodily ill health. One basic difference between Schizophrenia and PDD, is that delusions in PDD are well systematized, with one basic delusion and remainder of the system being logically built on this error (Patricia Casey et al, 2019). Persistent delusional disorders lack other psychopathology like hallucinations seen in Schizophrenia. Keywords: Persistent Delusional Disorder, Munchausen by Proxy, Infidelity, Paranoia",

However, in the physical impairment related diseases, it is difficult for the disease to occur only by internal factors, and it can be said that internal factors and external factors are combined. Therefore, when the physical impairment is caused by disease, it is important to the apportionment analysis of injury to think about the cause of the physical impairment by considering both the external and internal factors. The most commonly used the apportionment guide is the “Rhim's trauma apportionment guideline” in impairment evaluation. But this guideline is often difficult to assess in certain diseases. Since the apportionment analysis of external factors can bring about a difference in degree according to the viewpoint of the assessor, the degree of the physical impairment may vary greatly depending on case by case. Especially, it is not reasonable to assess based on causal relation with common sense or emotional, and it is necessary to make rational assessment based on medical evidence and professional knowledge.",

      "abstract": "Psychosis is a severe and a complicated mental disorder that affects the overall well-being of an individual through alterations in thought and perceptions wherein the person losses touch with reality. The symptomatology of the disorder is demarcated as positive and the negative symptoms. The positive symptoms including delusions, illusions, auditory hallucinations, and thought disorders are the additional behaviors that develop after an individual develops the illness whereas the negative symptoms include introverted behavior, poor sociability, emotional blunting, amotivation, and cognitive deficits that reflect a decline in the normal functioning capacity of the person. People with psychotic disorders exhibit a significant reduction in the overall quality of life particularly in the domains of physical and mental health, social intercourses, self-esteem, and interpersonal relationships. Psychotic disorders are also one of the leading causes of disability and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) globally, causing a dent in the economy of a country through the inherent direct healthcare costs and the indirect costs (productivity and income losses) causing a depletion in capital and labor resource pool and subsequently causing a decrease in the overall productive capacity of the country. The existing literature highlights the importance of early interventions in psychosis, community-based multidisciplinary approaches including cognitive behavior therapy, somatic interventions, and pharmacotherapy in curtailing the impact and ameliorating the overall quality of life in people with psychosis.",

This is due, in part, to the fact that the patient’s complaint is a symptom, not a clinical sign or diagnosis, and the anatomical substrates for causing the problem are myriad (Fig. 16.1). The etiologies are diverse, if not legion, and there is poor correlation with symptoms, laboratory study findings, and pathological findings. This accounts for the fact that in 85% of patients with acute low-back pain and in 50% of patients with chronic low-back pain, no diagnosis is ever established.64,156,209 Further the problem may be complicated by other factors, resulting in an exaggeration of symptoms by nonphysiological processes (psychological, remunerative, occupational, etc.).",

No por el mero acto de empezar a jugar, si no por la posibilidad de no poder detenerse. La ludopatia o juego patologico se refiere al comportamiento desadaptativo, repetido y persistente de juego por dinero (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2005) que expone a la persona a consecuencias negativas en el plano social, profesional e individual; no es una tarea ni esta impuesto por una urgencia fisica ni moral como si fuera una necesidad real (Kuten, 2006). En este trastorno, las repercusiones se hacen sentir de gran forma en la familia del jugador, la cual recibe los embates del flagelo economico y personal que esta enfermedad implica y conlleva. El DSM-IV-TR la considera como la adiccion de los anos noventa y aquella con mayor frecuencia entre los trastornos del control de impulsos. De este aspecto cabe senalar tres visiones generales formuladas sobre la base de esta enfermedad: por un lado es considerada como trastorno del control de impulsos (APA, 2005) debido la alta impulsividad asociada (Grant & Kim, 2003) la cual se refleja en esta incapacidad por mantener el control sobre el juego y su detencion; por otro lado encontramos con que se le considera como una adiccion no toxica puesto que posee caracteristicas similares a la drogodependencia (Choliz, 2006) como lo vendria siendo:",

Few long-term studies concerning outcome of the depressions exist. At least the following factors can be assumed to indicate a favorable outcome: minor extent of depressive symptoms at the beginning, no severe personality disorder, absence of psychotic symptoms, no alcohol dependency or major physical illness, reliable social background, intellectual functions not being impaired, and skillful choice of antidepressant drug therapy regimes.",

What is depression, then, in modern medicine?

      "abstract": "Background- Psychosomatic concept (Manodaihika Siddhanta),Dharaniya Vega (urges to be suppressed or controlled) and Sattvavajay Chikitsa (psychotherapy) are concepts of Ayurveda which are the core of this study. Psychosomatic concept is an inter-relationship of Mind (Manas) and body (Sharira). The diseases evolving due to mind-body interaction are termed as psychosomatic diseases.[1] Vega means the natural urges of the body and mind. Dharaniya Vega are the suppressible or controllable urges which are not only confined to psychological attribute but also to verbal and physical attributes.[2] Some diseases or their subtypes in Ayurveda are nomenclatured based on suppressible urges like Shokaja Atisara (diarrhea due to grief), Bhayaja Atisara (diarrhea due to fear), Kamaj Jwara (fever due to passion),etc.[3,4] Sattvavajay Chikitsa given in Charak Samhita is a psychotherapy which literary means controlling the mind from unhealthy actions which has been developed as a counselling tool. Conclusion- The study will provide clinical evidence that will establish,the role of Dharaniya Vega in remedial or prevention of psychosomatic diseases and the role of Sattvavajay chikitsa in Dharaniya Vega",

      "abstract": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex disease that affects children and adolescents as well as adults. The etiology has not been established. While many pediatricians and other healthcare providers are aware of ME/CFS, they often lack essential knowledge that is necessary for diagnosis and treatment. Many young patients experience symptoms for years before receiving a diagnosis. This Primer, written by the International Writing Group for Pediatric ME/CFS provides information necessary to understand, diagnose, and man-age the symptoms of ME/CFS in children and adolescents. ME/CFS is characterized by overwhelming fatigue with a substantial loss of physical and mental stamina. Cardinal features are malaise and a worsening of symptoms following minimal physical or mental exertion. These post-exertional symptoms can persist for hours, days, or weeks and are not relieved by rest or sleep. Other symptoms include cognitive problems, unrefreshing or disturbed sleep, generalized or localized pain, light-headedness and additional symptoms in multiple organ systems. While some young patients can attend school, on a full or part-time basis, many others are wheelchair dependent, housebound, or bedbound. Prevalence estimates for pediatric ME/CFS vary from 0.1%-0.5%. Because there is no diagnostic test for ME/CFS, diagnosis is purely clinical, based on the history and the exclusion of other fatiguing illnesses by physical examination and medical testing. Co-existing medical conditions including orthostatic intolerance are common. Successful management is based on determining the optimum balance of rest and activity to help prevent post-exertional symptom worsening. Medications are helpful to treat pain, insomnia, orthostatic intolerance and other symptoms. The published literature on ME/CFS and specifically that describing the diagnosis and management of pediatric ME/CFS is very limited. Where published studies are lacking, recommendations are based on the clinical observations and practices of the authors.",

Herein this term is redefined, and an additional term, parahallucinations, is introduced. Hallucinations are defined as sensory perceptions that have the compelling sense of reality of true perceptions but that occur without external stimulation of the relevant sensory organ and are experienced as following the sensory path, that is, can be localized in three-dimensional space outside the body. Pseudohallucinations are defined as hallucinatory phenomena that do not follow the sensory path and are experienced predominantly by psychiatrically ill subjects. Parahallucinations are defined as hallucinatory phenomena that occur due to an injury or abnormality to the peripheral nervous system. Insight into the reality of these experiences-the realization that they are not real-is not felt to be important in their phenomenology.Utilization of this classification system during clinical investigations will yield greater insight into the pathophysiology, course, treatment, and prognosis of psychiatric and neurologic disorders.",

Traumatic events in childhood often cause emotional distress, hindering a person's ability to identify and express their feelings. This emotional pressure can influence the emergence of alexithymic traits. The effects of childhood trauma on alexithymia affect interpersonal relationships and overall psychological health, and may persist into adulthood. Traumatic experiences in childhood negatively affect emotional regulation problems, internal conflicts, and the development of self-protection mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "La depresion se caracteriza por la presencia de tristeza, perdida de interes o placer, sentimientos de culpa o falta de autoestima, trastornos del sueno o del apetito, sensacion de cansancio y falta de concentracion, es el resultado de interacciones complejas entre factores sociales, psicologicos y biologicos. Quienes han pasado por circunstancias vitales adversas (desempleo, luto, traumatismos psicologicos) tienen mas probabilidades de sufrir depresion. A su vez puede generar mas estres y disfuncion, empeorar la situacion vital de la persona afectada. (OMS, 2017). La depresion puede llegar a hacerse cronica o recurrente y dificultar sensiblemente el desempeno en el trabajo o la escuela y la capacidad para afrontar la vida diaria. La posibilidad diagnostica de un trastorno depresivo a partir de datos observacionales poco especificos: deterioro en la apariencia y aspecto personal, lentitud en los movimientos, marcha cansina, tono de voz bajo, facies tristes o poco expresivas, llanto facil o espontaneo en la consulta, escasa concentracion durante la entrevista, verbalizacion de idealizacion pesimista, quejas hipocondriacas, alteraciones en el ritmo del sueno, quejas somaticas difusas y dificiles de encuadrar. (Alberdi Sadupe, Taboada, & Vazquez , 2006).\r\nEn su forma mas grave, puede conducir al suicidio, si es leve, se puede tratar sin necesidad de tratamiento farmacologico, pero cuando tiene caracter moderado o grave se pueden necesitar farmacos y psicoterapia profesional. (OMS, 2017)\r\nEn un estudio realizado a 500 estudiantes universitarios en Lima-Peru, se encontro que la prevalencia de depresion segun los niveles de complejidad corresponde el 9.7% a depresion leve, el 2.8% a depresion moderada y el 0.05% a una depresion severa. \r\nLa presente investigacion busca determinar la prevalencia de la depresion de los estudiantes universitarios en la ciudad Bucaramanga en el ano 2017; utilizando un instrumento disenado para evaluarla clasificandola: en rango normal, ligeramente deprimido, moderadamente deprimido y severamente deprimido.

      "title": "The Explanation of Impulsive Action",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT. Impulsive action, such as binge eating or drinking, wrist‐slashing, compulsive promiscuity or chronically explosive marital conflict, presents serious problems for psychoanalysis. Such action evokes explanations both from the analyst and from the patient. The analyst may be held captive by explanatory notions that emphasise one aspect of impulsive action rather than the whole process. These explanations are based on our notions of drive pressure, adaptation, control and attack of intimate persons, ‘acting out,’ and the ‘compulsion to repeat’. The patient's explanations may be either consciously stated or inferred by the analyst as unconscious‘explanations’from associative material. If the patient's explanations dovetail with or adapt to those of the analyst, the analyst may take them as confirmatory, and the whole process of breakdown and restitution may escape analytic scrutiny. This process includes: (1) a precipitant that is narcissistically wounding; (2) a prodrome consisting of an experience of lack or absence which the patient feels as persecution, and a restitutive phantasy of the lack as fillable by a consummatory act; (3) the act itself; (4) character defences that ward off mortification on awareness of personal disintegration (shame) or the consequences of the act (guilt); explanations emphasising guilt often screen those giving rise to shame; (5) an attempt to regulate distance to protect against narcissistic injury by keeping intimates from getting too close or too far away. The therapist's tendencies to overemphasise the precipitant, the meaning of the act, or its distance regulating may convey an attitude of blame rather than understanding. Therapeutic emphasis on the subjective experience in an unintegrated way is sympathy, not empathy; sympathy is collusive and fosters splitting and impedes working with the negative transference. Blame or sympathy may be buttressed by the type of explanation accepted by analyst and patient. Explanatory preconceptions must be transcended to do effective interpretive work. Interpretation should convey understanding of a preoccupied ego that manifests its disorganising and restitutive propensities in the process of impulsive action.",

It occurs as a consequence of brain damage localized in various cortical and/or subcortical structures, but mainly in parietotemporal areas of the right hemisphere. Neglect syndrome is a heterogeneous cluster of modally specific deficiency signs and often coexists with changes in emotional status and poor self-awareness. According to different criteria of classification, neglect may be perceptual (visual, tactile, auditory) or motor and it may manifest itself in one or in several modalities, and concern personal, peripersonal, extrapersonal, and even imaginal space. Since neglect belongs to cognitive disorders, it cannot be attributed to basic sensory or motor deficits and it should be clearly differentiated from them. Dynamic changes over time are typical of this syndrome, which is commonly seen in the early stages of the disease and in many neglect patients remits completely over a few months. However, in chronic forms, less or more intensive neglect features may disrupt patients’ functioning for a long time and limit efficacy of rehabilitation. There are many different standardised and clinical assessment procedures of hemineglect. Clinical and functional tasks should be analysed along with behavioural observation in natural situations as well as interview data. Differential diagnostics is critical for planning an effective rehabilitation programme.",

A textbook knowledge of the physiology and pathology of hearing does not prepare the clinician to cope with a hearing-impaired family member, friend, or colleague, with whom we feel embarrassed, lest our raised voices attract too much attention. We are even less prepared to evaluate or treat hearing-impaired persons in the course of our professional activities. Yet hearing impairment is common, and the profoundly deaf probably suffer mental disorders at a rate in excess of that of their hearing peers. Profound deafness, the absence of functional or remediable hearing, is extremely disabling. Profound deafness that occurs prior to complete acquisition of verbal language is socially and psychiatrically devastating. , · Such deafness, also known as prelingual deafness, is believed to result in uneven, incomplete, or arrested personality developmentl· 4 and behavioral disturbances, S the understanding of which is complicated by the natural language barrier.

Various psychological factors are involved when a person overuses the mobile phone, e.g., low self-esteem, extrovert personality. The burden of this problem is now increasing globally. Other mental disorders like, social phobia or social anxiety, and panic disorder may also precipitate NOMOPHOBIC symptoms. It is very difficult to differentiate whether the patient become NOMOPHOBIC due to mobile phone addiction or existing anxiety disorders manifest as NOMOPHOBIC symptoms. The signs and symptoms are observed in NOMOPHOBIA cases include- anxiety, respiratory alterations, trembling, perspiration, agitation, disorientation and tachycardia.

This disorder has been formally recognized as a distinct anxiety disorder since DSM-III was published in 1980. In Japan, a number of psychopathological and psychotherapeutic studies have been performed since the 1930s on a pathological condition similar to SAD, known as Taijin-kyofu (TK). TK, especially the convinced subtype of TK (c-TK; also known as the offensive subtype of TK), is described as a culture-bound syndrome similar to SAD. In proposed DSM-5 draft, it is suggested to add \"offending others\" to fear of being humiliating or embarrassing which were indicated in DSM-IV. It is interesting that fearing of making another person uncomfortable or \"offending others\" is consistent with symptom which has been investigated through c-TK in particular. The relation between SAD and TK will become clear in examination by new diagnostic criteria (DSM-5) more in future.",

The actual burden of mental disorders in older adults is probably underestimated because the stigma associated with mental disorders results in under-reporting of symptoms by older adults, under-diagnosis by healthcare providers, clinical significance of sub-threshold symptoms, and underrepresentation in epidemiological studies of high-risk older adults. Common mental health problems often present atypically in older individuals; and loss of physical abilities, financial resources, and family and friends can challenge even the most resilient amongst older people. As part of comprehensive diagnostic workup, neuroimaging such as non-contrast computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans are recommended for all older adults with significant cognitive deficits, new-onset mood or psychotic symptoms accompanied by subtle neurological symptoms, or general physical symptoms.",

The individual is faced with their loss on a daily basis and for some, moving through this process may be very difficult.

      "title": "Management of intimate partner abuse",
      "abstract": "Opening Vignette Sarah visited your clinic with her boyfriend for a cough and runny nose. During auscultation, you noticed a few bruises in the shape of a hand and of different ages on her chest, stomach and upper arm. She also appeared timid and avoided any eye contact with you. You asked her about the bruises, and her boyfriend replied that she was careless and fell frequently.WHAT IS INTIMATE PARTNER ABUSE? Intimate partner abuse is when an intimate partner inflicts violent, threatening or controlling behaviour. An intimate partner could be a current or former spouse, or a non-spouse (e.g. boyfriend, girlfriend or dating partner). Intimate partner abuse is broadly categorised into physical, sexual, emotional-psychological, economical, wrongful confinement or social isolation. It can result in direct injuries such as physical injuries and pain, or indirect injuries such as mental disorders, e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorders, generalised anxiety disorder and decline in functional or cognitive ability, low self-esteem or poor self-care.[1] Intimate partner abuse is the most common form of domestic violence in Singapore. Abuse tends to recur in a repetitive escalating pattern, with many victims not seeking help until much later, if at all. A local survey found that only 23.4% of victims reported a recent abuse incident to the police.[2] Primary care practitioners are often the first point of contact, as victims may present with related injuries or for unrelated medical consultations. They can present for reasons such as acute respiratory infections, chronic disease management or routine health screenings. With a high index of suspicion, physicians can seize these opportunities to detect such cases and enable early intervention before serious injuries or death occurs. WHAT ARE THE RISK FACTORS FOR ABUSE? Individual factors: The perpetrator has a history of substance abuse or interpersonal violence and certain personality traits or psychopathology, such as hostility, jealousy, a suspicious nature, anger-management issues, low self-esteem, high emotional dependency and feeling of depression. He/she may also experience social isolation and have a history of exposure to abuse or a belief in strict gender roles. Relationship factors: These include relationship styles that may contribute to poor communication, conflict-management and problem-solving skills, or the need for power and control. The perpetrator may also have experienced socialisation issues in childhood or a culture of dominance and control by one partner over the other, recent separation between partners, and unhealthy family relationships and interactions. Community factors: These include job loss, economic stress, poverty and its associated issues (e.g., overcrowded housing), and low social capital. Safe management measures imposed during the pandemic may exacerbate the tension between partners in a confined living arrangement. Societal factors: The perpetrator may have patriarchal values, with views that men hold power and dominate in rigid gender roles against women — including men having control over decision-making and limitations to women's independence in public and private life. WHAT ARE THE SIGNS SUGGESTIVE OF ABUSE? Clinicians may suspect possible abuse based on history taking, clinical signs or non-verbal cues. During history taking, if the history given is vague and inconsistent, where explanation for injuries is inadequate or does not match the physical findings, this may be cause for concern. Other hints include a clinical visit that does not address any obvious injuries or significant delays in seeking treatment from the time of injury, or where the patients continually minimise their symptoms. General observations of poor hygiene or malnutrition with decreasing body mass index may also raise red flags. The patient may attempt to hide the injuries with long sleeves, makeup, or cover the neck with hair. During physical examination, suggestive clinical signs include injuries located in unusual areas such as the back, buttocks or ears, patterned injuries such as from a belt or cigarette butts, injuries in multiple areas or multiple injuries of various ages. The patient may give irrelevant answers and excuses for injuries or check in with his/her partner before responding. In addition, non-verbal cues such as the patient being overly submissive or afraid, especially in the presence of the spouse or partner, or a lack of eye contact and avoidance of the spouse or partner are tell-tale signs. The reactions of the spouse or partner, if present, may also give clues. These include the spouse or partner showing incongruent reactions, downplaying or dismissing the symptoms, disallowing the patient to answer questions, or attempting to end the consult prematurely. HOW DO I ELICIT MORE INFORMATION? As patients may not offer abuse as their first presenting complaint, a high index of suspicion is needed. Victims may also minimise or deny their symptoms of abuse. To elicit more information, it is essential to establish a conducive environment for the patient to confide and trust in the doctor. This includes ensuring that the presence of a third party does not interfere with history taking and assessment, and asking the third party to step out if necessary. Direct and sensitive questions can aid in identification of abuse. For instance, physicians may start with a general statement, \"No matter how well people may get along, there are times when they disagree or get annoyed by the other person, or just have spats or fights because they are tired or in a bad mood.\" This can be followed by more detailed questions on whether the spouse or partner has done any of the following: (a) did or said something to spite the patient; (b) threatened to hit or throw something at the patient; (c) threw or smashed something at the patient; (d) pushed, grabbed, slapped, hit, kicked or shoved the patient; (e) threatened to hit other family members of the patient; (f) interacted with the patient in a way that makes him/her live in constant fear; (g) threatened the patient with a weapon; and (h) prevented the patient from contacting his/her extended family, relatives or friends. Screening tools that may be useful include the HITS (Hurt, Insult, Threaten and Scream) questionnaire (consists of only four questions), the Abuse Assessment Screen and the computer-based intimate partner violence questionnaire. Further information on screening tools can be obtained from the recommended readings. Inquiring about the presence of psychiatric illness in the spouse or intimate partner could be considered, as it is a potential risk factor and could have implications on the management of the patient. Special care should be taken when gathering information about suspected abuse. A balance should be struck with the amount of information gathered about the alleged abuse, bearing in mind that each time the patient talks about the alleged abuse, it can be potentially traumatic. Dissociation (e.g. glazed eyes, looking away) is a sign of distress when talking about abuse. The general practitioner can engage the patient in grounding techniques to re-establish a sense of safety and to re-orientate the patient to the present reality. Grounding techniques may include getting the patient to focus on who he/she is and the current location, and asking the patient to name three things that he/she can see, hear or feel in the room. Having a listening ear can be an empowering experience for the patient. The general practitioner should give the patient space to tell his/her story while offering validation and reassurance. It is also important to communicate to the patient that he/she is not at fault. The physician can do so by saying that \"Violence is unacceptable\", but should avoid asking questions such as \"Why did this person hit you?\", or saying anything that may suggest that the patient can control the violence. Patients may also need immediate help to formulate a safety plan, including advanced preparation in case of escalating violence and the need to safely leave the abuser (e.g., list of emergency contact numbers, alternative accommodations, linkup to family social service centres, and advice on making police report and applying for legal protections). WHAT CAN I DO IN MY PRACTICE? Physicians are reminded that the duty of care is to the patients and not to the patients' intimate partners. The management of suspected abuse includes providing appropriate medical care, ensuring protection for the victim if there is a risk of imminent danger, notifying the appropriate authorities and informing the patient of avenues of assistance if needed. Firstly, appropriate medical care should be provided. This may include a referral to the emergency department if medically indicated. A lower threshold can also be applied for suspect cases to enable further investigations such as imaging. In such cases, physician should indicate non-accidental injury in the referral. Secondly, the suspected abuse has to be stopped and the physician can assist the patient to get the help needed to stop the violence. It is useful to understand how the existing legislation framework and protective and personal social services can support these patients. The Women's Charter, Penal Code, Children and Young Persons Act, Mental Capacity Act, Vulnerable Adult Act and Protection from Harassment Act have made provisions for definitions of abusive behaviour, chargeable offences, punishment and deterrence of the abusive behaviour, and provisions for protection of the victims. Protection of the victims come from the following: Personal Protection Order (PPO): This order is issued to the perpetrator and given to the victim to restrain the perpetrator from abusing the victim. If the perpetrator violates the order, he/she can be arrested by the police when the latter is called in. The perpetrator may be concurrently issued a Mandatory Counselling Order together with the PPO to require him/her to attend counselling. Domestic Exclusion Order (DEO): This order is issued to grant the victim exclusive occupation of the shared residence or a specific part of the shared residence to protect him/her from the perpetrator. Expedited Order (EO): If there is imminent danger of domestic violence against the victim at the time of application of PPO, the court can issue an EO to be served on the perpetrator. This is a temporary protection order granted in the absence of the perpetrator, pending the issuance of PPO. Counselling Order, Mandatory Assessment and Treatment Orders: These orders are usually issued to perpetrators to mandate them to receive counselling and treatment. General practitioners should be acquainted with the family service centres (FSCs) in the neighbourhood so that victims of intimate partner abuse can be referred to these centres expeditiously. The FSC social workers can then handhold these patients in the application for these orders either at the court or at the nearest specialist family violence centre, where video linkup with the court for virtual application is available. The FSC can also assist to arrange for crisis shelters for patients who need them. Children in the affected families may also be victims or witnesses of abuse. These experiences can be traumatic for them and hence, it is important to encourage patients to receive assistance from the FSC, if not for themselves (particularly if they show reluctance), then for the sake of their children. Thirdly, medical practitioners are legally required under Section 424 of the Criminal Procedure Code to notify the police in the event of assessment of grievous hurt or high risk of imminent intimate partner violence that might lead to grievous hurt or death. To ensure the safety of the victim, it is recommended that the physician and social worker, in collaboration with the victim, should devise a safety plan to ensure ongoing support for the victim and other vulnerable persons in the family. Importantly, physicians will not be penalised for reporting cases that turn out not to be an abuse case, if there was reasonable suspicion for abuse. General practitioners practising within an institution can follow institutional guidelines for reporting. Otherwise, a police report can be made via the Police Report E-services portal at https://eservices.police.gov.sg/content/policehubhome/homepage/police-report.html. The following details should be clearly documented and included in the report: a description of the injuries sustained (written and/or pictorial description), the circumstances of the incident and the incident location. Finally, if the medical practitioner assesses a risk of potential abuse, but the patient turns down referrals for help, the patient may be discharged from medical follow-up. In such cases, the medical practitioner should still advise victims regarding the available avenues of assistance [Table 1], such as informing them that they can call the police at 999 or seek safe haven at any medical facility or FSC at any point in time, if they are at risk of immediate danger.Table 1: Avenues of assistance for victims of intimate partner abuse.WHAT IF I AM NOT SURE? If the medical practitioner is not certain whether the patient may be a victim of abuse, he/she should consult the National Anti-Violence 24/7 hotline at 1800 777 0000. RECOMMENDED READINGS 'Intimate partner violence: Diagnosis and screening' from UpToDate, by Weil A.[3] Intimate Partner Violence and Sexual Violence Victimization Assessment Instruments for Use in Healthcare Settings: Version 1 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control.[4] TAKE HOME MESSAGES Primary care providers are one of the first touchpoints of potential abuse cases and can help in early detection and escalation for intervention in these cases. A high index of suspicion is necessary as patients may not offer abuse as the presenting complaint. There are various types of abuse — physical, sexual, emotional-psychological, economical, wrongful confinement or social isolation. Clinical signs suggestive of abuse include injuries that cannot be adequately explained, injuries located in unusual locations, patterned injuries and multiple injuries of various ages. Clinicians can look for non-verbal cues and ask appropriate questions to identify abuse cases. Screening tools that may be useful to identify abuse cases include the HITS questionnaire, the abuse assessment screen and the computer-based intimate partner violence questionnaire. Clinicians have a duty of care to their patients, and not to the patients' intimate partners. Primary care providers should provide patients with adequate medical care or refer them to further medical care. They need to ensure that unclear cases who are discharged are counselled on the avenues for help. Clinicians should know the FSCs in the neighbourhood and refer their patients to the FSCs, if necessary. Medical professionals will not be penalised for reporting cases that turn out not to be an abuse case if there was reasonable suspicion for abuse. Failing to do so is an offence under the Criminal Procedure Code. Clinicians should keep a clear and detailed documentation of the injuries sustained, the circumstances of the injuries and the incident location to aid in subsequent investigations. Closing Vignette You requested for the patient's boyfriend to step out for you to perform a physical examination and managed to obtain a more detailed history. You assessed that Sarah may be a victim of abuse, documented your findings from the physical examination and assessment, and proceeded to treat her injuries. There was no serious bodily harm, and she had already moved back to her parent's home. As there was no immediate danger to the patient's life and she had a safe place to stay, you decided to refer her to the nearby FSC instead of the police. In addition, you provided her with information on the National Anti-Violence Helpline and advised her to make a report of the abuse at the nearest police station.Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

Uma vez que a vulnerabilidade é agravada por eventos naturais somados a predisposição psicossocial e psicológica. A depressão trata-se de uma perturbação afetiva que culmina com um estado melancólico, mais que pode evoluir com alguns episódios de ansiedade que compartilha algumas características coma tristeza. As causas da maior parte das doenças de ordem psicológica não estão bem esclarecidas. Não existem causas isoladas da depressão, tratando-se assim de uma doença multifatorial, ou seja, não possui fatores causadores específicos que possam ser identificados dentro dos critérios de certeza absoluta científica. Quando surge imediatamente após o parto toma a designação de Depressão Pós-Parto. O estudo tem como objetivo Conhecer os fatores desencadeantes da Depressão Pós-Parto em gestantes no terceiro trimestre e puérperas do 1° ao 3° mês no PSF da cidade do Crato-Ce. Identificar os principais fatores de risco relacionados ao desenvolvimento da Depressão Pós-Parto. A pesquisa e do tipo exploratório-descritivo, com abordagem qualitativa. A população constituiu-se por gestantes no terceiro trimestre de gestação e puérperas de qualquer idade obedecendo aos seguintes critérios de inclusão e exclusão. Para a obtenção de dados junto à amostra, utilizou-se uma entrevista semi-estruturada contendo perguntas abertas e fechadas. Concluímos que se faz necessário um planejamento das equipes para a execução de ações preventivas que proporcionem uma gestação e um puerpério emocionalmente sadios. Essas equipes devem atuar, fundamentalmente, no acompanhamento das mães puérperas atendendo às suas necessidades básicas de saúde e educação, bem como na orientação daquilo que se refere aos cuidados com a criança. Tais atitudes básicas não devem ser específicas da medicina em geral ou da psiquiatria em particular. Elas devem ser realizadas por equipes multiprofissionais da rede básica de saúde treinada para isso.",

      "abstract": "Un fenomeno frecuente y de dificil tratamiento en los pacientes psiquiatricos es el dano fisico directo e intencional causado por conductas autolesivas que no se efectuan con una finalidad suicida. La conducta se puede presentar eventualmente en padecimientos psiquiatricos como estados depresivos o psicoticos. Sin embargo, cuando se presenta de manera frecuente, constituye lo que se denomina el sindrome de autolesion deliberada que se puede observar en pacientes con retraso mental y trastornos de personalidad. Este trabajo sustenta una implicacion de las estructuras limbicas que procesan el componente cognoscitivo-afectivo del dolor en el desarrollo del comportamiento autolesivo (CAL). Proponemos que el CAL resulta de una disfuncion en la percepcion nociceptiva, particularmente en los mecanismos de alto orden de procesamiento, donde se integra el dolor como una experiencia consciente y se conceptua como sensacion desagradable. Suponemos que esta alteracion en la percepcion nociceptiva puede considerarse como una consecuencia, manifestacion o sintoma, de una anomalia en la percepcion de si mismo. La alteracion en la percepcion nociceptiva y en la percepcion de si mismo, resultaria, en algunos casos, de la incidencia de factores ambientales desfavorables en personas biologicamente vulnerables, mientras que en otros, seria la anomalia biologica la determinante de la conducta. Se ha encontrado una asociacion entre la incapacidad de reconocer estimulos nociceptivos y la presencia de fenomenos disociativos. Esto ejemplifica la forma en que una respuesta altamente especializada y adaptativa en sujetos sanos ante condiciones amenazantes podria originar, de manera paradojica, conductas poco adaptativas. Los sujetos expuestos de manera cronica a situaciones amenazantes en edades tempranas, son susceptibles de desarrollar un patron de respuesta patologico que podria poner en riesgo su vida.",

This finding has been replicated in studies across the globe, even though the prevalence of MDD varies greatly internationally. The greater the number of physical symptoms, the more likely the patient is to have a mood disorder, but the presence of pain or physical symptoms negatively impacts physicians' ability to recognize MDD. To improve the recognition of MDD and ensure that patients receive appropriate treatment, clinicians should perform a differential diagnosis that includes psychiatric disorders when patients present with chronic pain or other somatic symptoms.",

      "title": "Somatic Symptom Disorder",
      "abstract": "Psychiatry is often consulted in the general hospital to assess for underlying psychiatric contributions to a patient's physical symptoms. Such questions are typically prompted after a medical or neurological evaluation has not identified the etiology of the physical symptoms, if the symptoms are incompatible with or disproportionate to existing medical or neurological pathology, or if the patient is engaging in maladaptive health-related or interpersonal behaviors in the hospital. Provider countertransference in response to patients presenting with psychiatric disorders that feature somatic symptoms—as well as the maladaptive behaviors that may accompany these symptoms—can lead to provider distress or impact patient care and is a critical area for liaison interventions from the consulting psychiatrist. This chapter demonstrates the approach to the hospitalized patient whose physical symptoms may arise secondary to psychological processes or whose psychological response to medical symptoms gives rise to pathological distress, behaviors, and impairment. It highlights some of the psychological factors that may contribute to the experience of and response to somatic symptoms, as well as some of the challenging interpersonal dynamics that occur in the hospital setting. Clinical cases involving somatic symptom disorder, conversion disorder, and factitious disorder present strategies for making complex diagnoses, therapeutic interventions, and effectively engaging these patients in psychiatric evaluation and treatment.",

Our volume gathers together empirically informed philosophers who are well equipped to tackle such questions. Contributors specialize in free will, agency, and responsibility, but they are informed by current scientific and clinical approaches to a wide range of psychopathologies, including autism, addiction, Tourette syndrome, personality disorders, depression, dementia, phobias, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. These conditions exhibit a diverse array of symptoms that can contribute quite differently to being blameworthy or praiseworthy.",

An equivalent deficit of expression of the same primary facial emotions in schizophrenics has not been clearly established. Twenty chronic hospitalised schizophrenics and 20 normals were therefore tested on tasks of facial emotional expression upon verbal command, of facial emotional expression imitation, and of non-affective bucco-facial praxic imitation. Results indicate that chronic schizophrenics do manifest a deficit of facial emotion expression which can best be explained by task parameters, such as verbal cueing of emotions, perceptual recognition, and bucco-facial dyspraxia in decreasing order of importance. The deficit does not appear to result from neuroleptic or anticholinergic medication nor length of hospitalisation or disease.",

      "title": "A CONTRIBUTION TO THE NOSOLOGY OF THE IMPULSE DISORDERS",
      "abstract": "We have presented certain clinical pictures typified by a disorder of impulse. This disorder may express itself in a rather specific symptomatic disturbance appearing as an impulse neurosis, a perversion, or a catathymic crisis. On the other hand, the disturbance may be more diffuse and nonspecific, pervading the total personality and behavior of the individual, expressing itself in a character disorder. In the impulsive character disorder we sometimes find evidence of a relationship to organic factors. However, there is another large group belonging to the impulsive character disorders which does not show such evidence of organicity and yet is characterized by the same infantile, explosive, impulsive behavior seen in the former. In surveying the genetic and dynamic factor, it is apparent that no one factor in and of itself determines the development of an impulse disorder. Constitutional factors, early developmental experiences, present-day forces and stresses impinging upon the individual contribute to the efficacy of the control apparatus or to the strength of drive. Constitutionally, varying drive and control potentials, physiologically as well as psychologically, interweave with early developmental experiences. Among the latter are psychological ones such as oral traumata possibly leading to an intolerance of frustration with demands for immediate gratification. Interference with speech-action relationships may result in the latter persisting as the medium of communication, thus leading to a tendency toward acting out. Physiologically, illness and physical traumata may increase the strength of the drives or weaken the control apparatus. The constitutional and early developmental experiences may lend a quality of impulsivity to the character, which in the face of current forces and stresses may result in impulsive behavior. Specific early experiences may supply the clinical clothing which envelopes the impulse skeleton leading to either direct or distorted expression of a given early impulse. The result is a wide array of clinical syndromes, which have as their common denominator an impulse disorder.",

      "abstract": "A esclerose múltipla remitente-recorrente (EMRR) é uma doença neurológica autoimune, onde o sistema imunológico ataca a bainha de mielina do sistema nervoso central, causando inflamação que prejudica a transmissão dos impulsos nervosos. Caracteriza-se por episódios de surtos com exacerbação dos sintomas, como fadiga, fraqueza em membros inferiores e superiores, tremores e equilíbrio dificuldade para andar, perda de visão, entre outros, seguidos de remissões com recuperação parcial ou completa, que podem durar meses ou anos, durante os quais a progressão da doença é mínima ou ausente. A insônia ou baixa qualidade de sono pode ocorrer indiretamente como consequência da EMRR. Ou seja, um sintoma secundário que é acarretado pela presença dos sintomas específicos da doença e dos pseudo surtos. A Percepção Corporal (PC) pode ser definida de duas maneiras, como Imagem Corporal (IC) e Esquema Corporal (EC). A IC está relacionada ao aspecto psíquico, emocional, cognitivo, sociocultural, evolucionário, genético e neurocientífico, em relação a expectativa da imagem de seu corpo. O EC é a perspectiva que possibilita, por meio de mecanismos cinestésicos e proprioceptivos, o reconhecimento do corpo anatômico e da relação que este estabelece com o meio e com os objetos a sua volta. Diante destas definições, surgiu a oportunidade para relacionar a qualidade de sono com a percepção corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos. Sendo assim, o objetivo do estudo foi analisar a relação entre a qualidade do sono e a percepção corporal, pelo aspecto do esquema corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos da esclerose múltipla. Participaram 18 pessoas, entre 21 e 67 anos, que foram avaliados quanto à qualidade do sono pelo questionário de Pittsburgh, à percepção corporal pelo Teste de Askevold, e aos sintomas por meio de uma entrevista estruturada. Os resultados indicaram que todos os participantes com sono adequado foram classificados como hiperesquemáticos, enquanto 67% dos que apresentaram sono inadequado foram classificados como hipoesquemáticos. Além disso, indivíduos com sono inadequado mostraram uma distribuição equilibrada entre sintomas motores e sensitivos, enquanto aqueles com sono adequado relataram predominantemente sintomas sensitivos. A fadiga foi um sintoma relevante em 67% dos indivíduos com sono inadequado. Esses achados sugerem que a qualidade do sono pode estar associada à percepção corporal e à manifestação dos sintomas na EMRR, destacando a importância de intervenções que melhorem o sono para o manejo dessa condição.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

This article will not itemize the numerous disorders and disease entities which may be manifested by coma, or to discuss the differential diagnostic procedures that may lead to the identification of the causative factors in any particular case (1). In caring for the comatose patient the nurse meets one of her most stimulating challenges. She must be aware of the circumstances that tend to perpetuate and complicate the comatose state and of the preventive and therapeutic measures she may resort to in combating them. She must understand the factors that menace life and those that threaten to prolong the patient's illness and lead to functional disability when he has recovered from coma.",

No diagnostic difficulty arises if the history and physical examination reveal, in addition to ptosis, diplopia and opthalmoplegias of changing character, such symptoms as ready fatigability on slight exertion, weakness or paralysis of speech, chewing or swallowing, facial diplegia and easily exhausted tendon reflexes. A definite differential diagnosis may then be established by employing corroborative diagnostic criteria, such as the Jolly reaction, 1 the data from electromyographic and ergographic studies 2 and the response to prostigmine methylsulfate (dimethylcarbamic ester of hydroxyphenyltrimethylammonium methylsulfate).

In other words, these symptoms have been considered to be categorically different from other forms of human behavior and experience, whether they occur in healthy persons or patients with other psychiatric disorders. In this paper, we advocate a dimensional approach to negative symptoms, which is supported by two main arguments. First, enduring negative symptoms can even be observed in a variety of psychiatric disorders and they are not specific to schizophrenia. Second, we review evidence that negative symptoms show a continuous distribution from apparently healthy subjects to those with a fully developed clinical syndrome. Although the evidence does not allow for a definite decision concerning the dimensional distribution of negative symptoms, it certainly justifies exploring a dimensional approach with respect to its clinical and scientific utility. Understanding negative symptoms as a variation of normal mental processes will strengthen the development of neurocognitive models and treatment approaches.",

      "abstract": "THE cases of melancholia narrated in the former papers have exihibited-1. Alterations or lesions of the moral faculties as a morbid degree of depression, grief, anxiety, fear, etc.; 2. Alteration or lesion of the psychical or intellectual faculties, as false per ceptions, false conceptions, illusions, delusions, etc.; and 3. Alterations in miiotility; but, so far as we have yet gone, only an excessive motion or restlessness has been illustrated. There are cases in which the pro minent feature is a lesion of motility, but which con sists in an indispositioni t-o move-in torpor of rmove ment. Cases of this kind are next to be detailed. Bearing in mnind that the lesion of the moral faculty appears to be, as it were, the starting point or ground work of the disease, it would appear that cases are to be met with in which the whole of the phenomena seem to be confined to this division of the mental faculties, while in other cases this groundwork is in volved with one, or chiefly with one, of the other sub divisions. On the one hand, we m-neet with cases in .which the motility is scarcely affected; or, on the other hand, we findl cases in which the psychical func tions appear but very partially implicated. It is a common cause of surprise to the friends of melan cholic patients that the melancholic talks or writes quite rationally or coherently; that he is quite cor rect in memory; or that he argues as acutely as ever. When, however, there is torpid condition of the mo tility, the patient, though he often retains his intel lectual powers nearly intact, bears the expression of the lowest degree of dementia; the features are dull and heavy. The Frenlch call this form mnelancolie avec stupeur. Tphe next case is of this kind, and the intellect proper -was only partially implicated. CASE ix. A. K., aged 34, married, wife of a butler, was formerly a lady's maid. She lived, previously to her marriage, eleven years in one place, anAd married the butler. This appears to have been an unfortunate match. The famnily miiade frequent inquiries about the patient. The husband has taken very little interest abouat her. He attributed her disease to stubborn ness; and recluested by letter that she imiight be treated with firmness anid well routed. The medli cal cerltificate accompaiving the order of admission gave tlae following description of the patient just prior to her reception:- She sits weeping and miserable; says she has broken her husband's heart; that shle is better without food. Her landlord and fellow-lodgers found her in a state of comiiplete ex hauistion fromii wvant of food. The clhildren also ap peared half-famiished. She declares she heard voices forbidd!inu her to eat or cdrink, or light fire, or go to becl. In this hearing of voices there was evidence of dis tinct intellectual or ply,ychical disturbance. It never, however, manifested itself afterwards. On aclmission (Oct. 21st, date of disease uncertain), she conversed quietly and correctly, though in a weak tone of voice. She said slhe had been living in London with her children in a lodging. She had no headache. The tongue was much furred. The bowels were con lined. She took beef-tea only for dinner. She had no thirst. Pulse 60, feeble. There was no cough, nor any morbid chest-signs. She was ordered full diet, one eog, and two glasses of wine daily. Oct. 24th. Sho was up; was pale, but had consi derable turgescence of the vessels of the conjunctiva. The tongue was red; bowels not open. An aloetic draught twice a day was ordered. It will be sufficient to describe the progress of the case by entries taken at the different epochs. During the first three months, she continued constantly de pressed; was always more or less indisposed to exert herself; would not dress herself. She declinecl in strength, but made no complaint. During my temu porary absence from home, her head was shaved and blistered without apparent benefit. The bowels con tinued obstinate; but she would seldom take an aperient; and she occasionally refused food. Jan. 8th (three months after admission). She varied from day to day. One day she refused all food, and said she did not require it; that she could do without it. Another day she ate ravenously. The bowels seldom acted. She refuised medicine. She emaciated visibly. Pulse 70, regular. There were no cough nor chest-symptoms. She was always listless and depressed. The expression of the features was dull and heavy. Jan. 13th. Her mind was in the same state; but she ate ravenously. She would gorge herself if not watched; she filched the meat from the other patients' plates. Jan. 0Oth. She again refused food. She sat moodily in one position for lolng periods. Her features were dull and expressionless. She allowed the nasal secre tion and saliva to dribble from her as she sat. Feb. 10th (fotur months after admission). Motility was still more involved. She sat for lonog periods in one posture, apparently indifferent to all around, aand too lazy to move. She was like a statue in immobility; but the attitude was expressive of hebetude. She hung her head; the features were relaxed, and did not change; her arms dangled by the side of the chair as she sat. The secretions were dropping from the mouth and nose, and the lacrymnal secretion had dried upon her cheek. The breathing was slightly acceler ated. Her bowels were confined. She was at the pre sent date eating largely. Three grains of podophyllin were ordered. Feb. 26th. She was moving down the gallery at a snail's pace. Her head was drooping, and her arnms hanging heavily by her side. Her dress was neglected. She had not menstruated since admiiission. Compounlld iron mixture was ordered. March 2nd. She would not take the medicine; was still more dull and heavy. She stood about in one positioni, obstructing the passage, and did not moive to allow olne to pass. She appeared motionless and statue-like. Her arm-s and head drooped. The saliva and nasal secretion dribbled from her. She dropped her fIeces about, and wet herself as she stood. She never attempted to dress or wash herself. The pulse was 60; te circulation appeared torpid; the nose and lips were purplish; the hands cold anid puffy. At times she would eat, and at times refuLsed food for days together; she had, however, gained flesh. March 9th. She asked voluntarily for some paper, and sat down and wrote a letter to her sister, request ingf her to send her some needlework. The letter was correctly worded and spelt; bnt rather less neatly written towards the close; and it was without signa ture. Great improvement in the appearance of the pa tient took place from this date, and increased. The work was sent, and she took to it at once. 163rd day (or five months). Her expression was greatly improved. She was now quite animated. The 33",

      "title": "Η σχέση υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης και διατροφής στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό τρίτης ηλικίας",
      "abstract": "Τα τελευταία χρόνια κερδίζει έδαφος η ιδέα της υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης (ΥΓΕ) ως υποψηφίου ισοδυνάμου του προκλινικού σταδίου της νόσου Alzheimer. Ως υποκειμενική γνωστική έκπτωση (subjective cognitive decline) ορίζουμε την (αυθόρμητη ή μη) αναφορά από ένα άτομο παραπόνων για εμμένουσα έκπτωση της μνήμης ή άλλων γνωστικών λειτουργιών σε σχέση με το προηγούμενο επίπεδο, χωρίς από την αντικειμενική εξέταση να προκύπτει νευρογνωστική διαταραχή (ήπια γνωστική διαταραχή ή κλινική άνοια), λαμβανομένων υπόψη της ηλικίας, του φύλου και του μορφωτικού επιπέδου. Η έκπτωση πρέπει επίσης να μη σχετίζεται με κάποιο οξύ συμβάν και να μην μπορεί να εξηγηθεί από άλλη νευρολογική, ψυχιατρική ή παθολογική νόσο, λήψη φαρμάκων ή ουσιών. Τα δεδομένα υποδηλώνουν ότι τα άτομα αυτά έχουν αυξημένο κίνδυνο νόσησης από άνοια στο μέλλον και συνιστούν ελκυστικό ερευνητικό στόχο, τόσο για επιδημιολογικές, όσο και παρεμβατικές μελέτες.Εφόσον η ΥΓΕ είναι παράγοντας κινδύνου για τη μετέπειτα εγκατάσταση κλινικής άνοιας, είναι ιδιαίτερα ενδιαφέρον να μελετηθούν οι παράμετροι που θα μπορούσαν να επηρεάσουν αυτήν την εξέλιξη. Ένας από τους πιο ενδιαφέροντες παράγοντες που σχετίζονται με τον τρόπο ζωής είναι η διατροφή, η οποία προσφέρεται ως στόχος για την υιοθέτηση ευρείας κλίμακας στρατηγικών πρόληψης της γνωστικής έκπτωσης με καλή σχέση κόστους-αποτελεσματικότητας. Καθώς η διεθνής βιβλιογραφία παρουσιάζει σημαντικές ελλείψεις στη μελέτη της σχέσης ΥΓΕ και διατροφής, η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή φιλοδοξεί να συνεισφέρει στην κάλυψη αυτού του κενού. Για το σκοπό αυτό, η εργασία στηρίχθηκε στα δεδομένα της μελέτης HELIAD [Hellenic Epidemiological Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (Νευροεκφυλιστικές και άλλες νευρολογικές νόσοι στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό – συχνότητες και παράγοντες κινδύνου)] και κινήθηκε σε δύο παράλληλους σχεδιασμούς:1.Συγχρονική μελέτη (cross-sectional), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση του επιπολασμού συγκεκριμένων ειδών ΥΓΕ και της σχέσης τους με ποικίλους παράγοντες, μεταξύ των οποίων και τη διατροφή·2.Προοπτική μελέτη (prospective cohort), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση της επίδρασης της διατροφής στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ στο χρόνο.Τα παράπονα που σχετίζονται με ΥΓΕ αναδείχθηκαν με τη βοήθεια ενός δομημένου καταλόγου ερωτήσεων/θεμάτων για συζήτηση με το συμμετέχοντα. Η ΥΓΕ ταξινομήθηκε ανάλογα με το γνωστικό πεδίο στο οποίο ο συμμετέχων εντοπίζει προβλήματα, δηλαδή τη μνήμη, το λόγο, την οπτική-αντιληπτική και την επιτελική λειτουργία. Οι συμμετέχοντες θεωρήθηκαν θετικοί για ένα είδος ΥΓΕ σε περίπτωση τουλάχιστον μίας θετικής απάντησης στις ερωτήσεις του συγκεκριμένου γνωστικού πεδίου. Η συνολική βαθμολογία ΥΓΕ ορίστηκε ως ο αριθμός των αναφερόμενων γνωστικών πεδίων με ΥΓΕ και συνεπώς κυμαίνεται από 0 ως 4.Με βάση τα ευρήματα από το συγχρονικό σκέλος της μελέτης, η ΥΓΕ στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό ≥65 ετών είναι πολύ συχνή (84,6%) και εστιάζεται κυρίως στη μνήμη. Τα συμπτώματα άγχους και η ύπαρξη αγγειακού εγκεφαλικού κινδύνου σχετίζονται με αυξημένη πιθανότητα ΥΓΕ, ενώ προστατευτικό ρόλο φαίνεται να έχει η εκπαίδευση. Όσον αφορά τα είδη ΥΓΕ, σημειώνεται η επιβαρυντική δράση του γυναικείου φύλου, της γενετικής προδιάθεσης για γνωστική έκπτωση και της αυξημένης ενεργειακής πρόσληψης στην εμφάνιση υποκειμενικής έκπτωσης στη μνήμη. Η παρουσία συμπτωμάτων κατάθλιψης ή/και άγχους και η πρόοδος της ηλικίας συνδέονται επίσης με τα περισσότερα είδη ΥΓΕ.Αναλύοντας τα δεδομένα από την προοπτική παρακολούθηση του δείγματός μας, υπολογίσαμε ότι αρχική συμμόρφωση με το διατροφικό πρότυπο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας υψηλότερη κατά 10 μονάδες στην κλίμακα MDS (Mediterranean Diet Score) σχετίζεται με μείωση κατά 7% στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος, και ότι κάθε επιπλέον μερίδα λαχανικών καθημερινά σχετίζεται με περιορισμό κατά 2,2% της προόδου της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος. Τα αποτελέσματά μας ενισχύουν την άποψη ότι η μεσογειακή δίαιτα δρα προστατευτικά έναντι ολόκληρου του συνεχούς της γνωστικής έκπτωσης, ξεκινώντας από τα πρώτα γνωστικά παράπονα. Η επιβεβαίωση των ευρημάτων αυτών και από άλλες μελέτες, ιδίως για συγκεκριμένες ομάδες τροφίμων, και η αποσαφήνιση των υποκείμενων μηχανισμών μπορεί να ενδυναμώσει το ρόλο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας ως εύκολα εφαρμόσιμης, χαμηλού κόστους και υψηλής αποτελεσματικότητας στρατηγικής πρόληψης που στοχεύει τους τροποποιήσιμους παράγοντες κινδύνου για γνωστική έκπτωση.",

      "abstract": "Key Points Anxiety symptoms (eg, fears about harm to self or loved ones; distress when child is asked to engage in feared activity; somatic complaints associated with fears) are common in children and adolescents; at some life stages and in some circumstances, a certain level of anxiety is developmentally appropriate.Anxiety symptoms may be features of 1 of 6 anxiety disorders or may cause functional impairment in the absence of a diagnosable disorder. Anxiety-like symptoms are a frequent response to trauma (physical or psychological) and can be features of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress disorder, or adjustment disorder.Validated tools are available to screen for mental health symptoms generally, anxiety symptoms specifically, posttraumatic stress specifically, and impaired functioning, and to assess the effect of the child’s problem on caregivers; results lead to further discussions with the child and family.A child who feels anxious often has a parent who feels anxious or depressed; care of the parent is integral to helping the child.Pediatric clinicians can provide meaningful intervention, even in the absence of a diagnosis, through expressions of hope, empathy, and support to the child and family; encouragement of healthy habits and reducing overall stress; emphasis on coping with or gradual exposure to feared activities, rather than avoiding them; and brief interventions derived from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).Refer for full diagnostic evaluation and evidence-based care (CBT, plus medication for certain disorders) or comanage care with a mental health specialist ifThe child has severe functional impairments at school, at home, or with peers.Multiple symptoms of anxiety occur in many domains of life.The child or parent is very distressed by the symptom or symptoms.There are co-occurring behavioral problems (especially if combined with shyness).Anxiety was preceded by serious trauma or symptoms suggesting PTSD, acute stress disorder, or adjustment disorder.The child seems to have panic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), both of which require specialized treatment.Anxiety occurs in a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).",

They can be determined by the action of various influences and their interactions on functional development of the brain. There is ample epidemiological and experimental evidence that chemical and/or physical factors acting during sensitive time windows of the brain development can cause mental, behavioral, emotional and/or cognitive disorders. Environmental pollutants, addictive substances, drugs, malnutrition, excessive stress and/or hypoxia-ischemia were reported to induce functional maldevelopment of the brain with consequent neurobehavioral disorders. The article provides review on most significant neurobehavioral manifestations of developmental impairment of the brain during prenatal, perinatal and early postnatal period. The most known adverse factors causing developmental neurobehavioral dysfunctions in humans as well as in experimental animals are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Depression and Parkinson's DiseaseParkinson's disease (PD) is generally considered to be a neurological disorder.However, because of the frequency of mood and other psychiatric complications, PD could be considered a neuropsychiatric disease.In fact, James Parkinson himself observed in 1817 that depression is commonly associated with PD. 1 The estimated prevalence of depression in PD varies according to the type of mood assessment applied (interview versus self-report questionnaire), diagnostic criteria or definition of depression (the number and type of symptoms required), and research setting (community-based versus neurology clinic). 1,2However, overall the data suggest that at any given time 20-40% of individuals with PD are experiencing depression of some type.4][5] Depression can be difficult to diagnose in PD because of the overlap between symptoms of depression and PD.For example, the biological symptoms typical of depression-such as low energy, insomnia or excessive sleep, weight loss, diminished sexual function, and an emotionless face-can be directly related to the neuroanatomical disruption characteristic of PD.These symptoms are not necessarily evidence of depression and, conversely, the psychomotor slowing of depression might be accidentally overlooked in a patient with PD. 2,6 Depression in PD could be considered an understandable reaction to a disabling chronic illness.However, some researchers believe that depression may be a part of the disease and caused by neurological changes. 2,7This notion is supported by the fact that depression sometimes precedes the diagnosis of PD.Of course, the cause of depression in patients with PD could be a combination of a subjective reaction to the illness and the brain changes brought about by the disease. 5The consensus is that depressive symptoms should be addressed and treated by physicians regardless of whether these symptoms are part of PD itself or due to a separate cause. 1,8,9e psychiatric complications of PD require attention because they can exacerbate the already considerable physical challenges brought on by the disease.In fact, an international survey of patients with PD discovered that depressive symptoms were the most important factor in patient quality-of-life ratings. 10,11Another reason to treat depression in PD is that reports of care-giver burden correlate significantly with patients' depression and quality of life. 12",

In fact no immediate dramatic cause has yet been demonstrated that would account for such mental breakdowns, and it would be surprising if it had, for the great majority of psychoses not related to maternity show no simple sequence of cause and effect. Yet it would be wrong to dismiss without further examination an occasion so important in the life of the mother as childbirth as of no aetiological consequence. In the types of psychosis under consideration the clinical onset had often been a sudden and disturbing event, just at that particular time in the patient's life when she was confronted with the responsibility of motherhood. Further examination of the patient's history however often revealed previous evidence of emotional disturbance, or of instability in other members of her family.",

      "title": "Estudio de los síntomas somáticos asociados a los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en una población de atención primaria",
      "abstract": "Es conocida la elevada frecuencia de los trastornos mentales y psicosociales en la poblacion general y en la poblacion atendida en el ambito de la atencion primaria de salud. Los estudios epidemiologicos demuestran que existe una alta morbilidad psiquiatrica en la practica medica general ya que los pacientes buscan ayuda principalmente en el primer escalon del sistema oficial de atencion de salud. Por otra parte, y a pesar de la frecuencia con que se presentan los trastornos psiquiatricos comunes en atencion primaria, la depresion es una queja poco frecuente entre los sintomas que los pacientes relatan al medico de familia y rara vez se presentan en la consulta con sintomas que encajan perfectamente en las taxonomias psiquiatricas de diagnostico, sino que habitualmente se presentan con una combinacion de sintomas fisicos, psicologicos y problemas sociales. El medico generalista se enfrenta a una situacion dificil: ante un paciente que se presenta con sintomas fisicos tiene que diagnosticar o descartar una enfermedad fisica, diagnosticar o descartar una enfermedad mental, despistar una enfermedad depresiva comorbida con enfermedad fisica o identificar los trastornos del estado de animo subyacentes en pacientes que presentan problemas somaticos.\nEn atencion primaria se produce un importante infra diagnostico de problemas mentales y una de las causas principales que se cita es la presentacion somatica de los mismos problemas. La presentacion somatica de los trastornos mentales comunes va a ocasionar un retraso en el tratamiento, pruebas diagnosticas y tratamientos inutiles y yatrogenos, incapacidad laboral, insatisfaccion del medico y del paciente y, como consecuencia, una importante repercusion en el paciente, en la sociedad y en el propio sistema sanitario.\n Dice D. Goldberg en el prologo a la primera edicion del libro Psiquiatria en Atencion Primaria del que es editor J.L. Vazquez-Barquero (1), que los trastornos mentales se podrian clasificar en dos grandes grupos: los trastornos ?comunes?, que incluiria los trastornos ansioso ? depresivos, las fobias, los trastornos de panico?, que deberian ser tratados fundamentalmente en el ambito de la atencion primaria; y los trastornos graves, esquizofrenia, trastornos bipolares, demencias? que se tratarian en los servicios especializados, aunque su atencion sea tambien compartida con los centros de medicina general. Dentro del primer grupo estan procesos muy frecuentes en la poblacion general y en las consultas de medicina general, que en muchas ocasiones no llegan a ser diagnosticados.\nEn los ultimos anos hemos asistido a un importante cambio en la figura del medico de atencion primaria. Hemos pasado de las consultas ?de cupo? de los antiguos consultorios en las que los medicos generales actuaban de filtro y clasificacion de los pacientes hacia la atencion especializada, a los actuales equipos de atencion primaria en los que el medico generalista es figura central del sistema de salud. Esto se refleja en que para la mayoria de enfermos, el medico de atencion primaria no es solo el punto de entrada al sistema sanitario, sino tambien el profesional que realiza de forma principal su diagnostico, tratamiento y seguimiento y el que atiende las necesidades derivadas de sus alteraciones (2).\nLos pacientes atendidos en atencion primaria presentan una gran heterogeneidad clinica claramente diferente de la poblacion atendida en atencion especializada, donde los procesos patologicos han sido tradicionalmente definidos e investigados. Es importante definir e investigar los procesos que se atienden en atencion primaria y no solo aceptar lo que se define en atencion especializada. Esto es particularmente importante en esos trastornos que antes denominamos como ?comunes? y que se estudian de manera principal en atencion especializada y, sin embargo, en el ambito donde habitualmente se diagnostican y tratan estan poco estudiados. Ademas, en general, los medicos tienen una clara orientacion biologica y la maxima ?primero descartar lo organico? sigue siendo valida en general, y los trastornos mentales son habitualmente un diagnostico de exclusion.\nEl medico de atencion primaria debe actuar sobre el paciente en su conjunto; de forma integral, porque considera a la persona en un modelo biopsicosocial; integrada, porque en el proceso de atencion existen elementos de promocion, prevencion, tratamiento, rehabilitacion y reinsercion social; continuada y permanente, porque se realiza a lo largo de la vida de la persona y en todos sus ambitos; y activa porque los profesionales no deben actuar unicamente como receptores de las demandas, sino buscando de forma activa las distintas necesidades de salud, aunque estas no sean expresadas (3). En el caso de la depresion y de la ansiedad con una presentacion fundamentalmente somatica en atencion primaria, es importante remarcar dos caracteristicas del proceso de atencion, la accesibilidad del paciente al proceso asistencial y la actitud activa del profesional que facilite la expresion de los sentimientos, y no solo el registro de los sintomas fisicos. Estas caracteristicas de la atencion primaria se han considerado fundamentales en el proceso que nos ocupa y no se ha pretendido ser exhaustivos en su descripcion pues no corresponde a este trabajo el estudio de las citadas caracteristicas.\nEl presente estudio busca de forma preferente la deteccion y analisis de los sintomas fisicos que acompanan a los trastornos de ansiedad y depresion que pueden detectarse en la consulta del medico de familia. Para realizar el trabajo, en primer lugar se ha realizado una busqueda de la literatura en las bases de datos PubMed y Embase y posteriormente se ha realizado un estudio transversal en la consulta de un medico de atencion primaria del Sistema Nacional de Salud. Se ha utilizado como instrumento de criba y diagnostico psiquiatrico el cuestionario PRIME-MD®, un cuestionario de datos generales, uno de atribucion de sintomas somaticos, el indice acumulativo de enfermedad y la frecuentacion de los pacientes a la consulta en el centro de salud, que nos han permitido extraer unos datos accesorios al trabajo principal.\n Se justifica el estudio por la frecuencia de los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en las consultas de medicina general, con una gran repercusion en la salud del propio paciente, de la familia, de los cuidadores, de la sociedad en general y del propio sistema sanitario. Por otra parte, los sintomas somaticos son la principal causa de consulta en atencion primaria y son predominantes en cualquier consulta de medicina general. Entre los pacientes que presentan trastornos de ansiedad o depresivos se pueden observar altos niveles de sintomas somaticos, muchas veces como sintomatologia predominante o unica, con poca participacion de sintomatologia de la esfera psicologica e incluso con negacion de estos sintomas. Esta caracteristica de estos trastornos en el ambito de la atencion primaria supone una dificultad en el diagnostico, un retraso de este y consecuencias negativas: falta de eficacia de un tratamiento correcto, elevado gasto de tiempo, pruebas diagnosticas, tratamientos ineficaces y iatrogenia, tanto diagnostica como terapeutica, en un sindrome que presenta elementos cognitivos, afectivos y somaticos. Este ultimo grupo de sintomas es el que trataremos en nuestro estudio con mayor detalle.\nOBJETIVOS ? Estudiar los sintomas somaticos que se asocian a los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en una muestra de poblacion de atencion primaria espanola.\n? Determinar la frecuencia de presentacion de estos sintomas somaticos en los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad, comparado con un grupo control de la misma consulta.\n? Estudiar que sintomas somaticos se asocian mas frecuentemente a los trastornos depresivos a los trastornos de ansiedad y a la situacion comorbida de ambos trastornos y determinar si existen diferencias en su presentacion.\n? Determinar si algun tipo de sintomas somaticos se asocia con mas frecuencia a los trastornos de depresion o de ansiedad.\n? Conocer la atribucion causal que los pacientes hacen de los sintomas somaticos que presentan asociados a la ansiedad y la depresion.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Uncontrollable episodes of emotional expression occur in a variety of neurological conditions. This emotional disinhibition syndrome is characterized by episodes of crying or laughing that are unrelated to or out of proportion to the eliciting stimulus. This syndrome is common among patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and traumatic brain injury and a variety of terms and definitions have been used to describe it. The confusing nomenclature has been a barrier to understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of this disorder. The authors propose a unifying term, involuntary emotional expression disorder (IEED), and provide diagnostic criteria for this disorder.",

      "title": "Cross-Addiction: From Morbid Obesity to Substance Abuse",
      "abstract": "Obesity is a complex phenomenon that continues to defy one unifying scientific explanation. Behavioral, psychological, environmental, physiologic, metabolic, and genetic explanations are just some of the possibilities identified as contributing to or causing obesity; yet, each explanation encounters controversy and no one explanation has gained unanimous consensus. Ideally, once a patient has had weight loss surgery (WLS), he or she loses excess weight in a controlled, healthy manner and complies with all the components of the recommended bariatric treatment program; sometimes, however, patients \"modify\" their post-surgical instructions. The ability to identify program modifications may be initially camouflaged if patients continue to lose weight and their laboratory values and other medical tests indicate that their weight loss status is smoothly progressing. On the surface it may seem that all is well, but appearances may be deceiving. A dysfunctional relationship with food and other substances of abuse, such as alcohol, may be lurking underneath the surface of what passes as treatment success, and this condition, left untreated, may persist or evolve to a cross-addiction, also known as an addiction transfer or a substitute addiction. A cross-addiction occurs when an individual exchanges one compulsive behavior for another compulsive behavior, such as when a weight loss surgery patient is no longer overeating or bingeing, but instead is abusing alcohol. An incisive and comprehensive nursing assessment that includes how, why, and in what manner the WLS patient is losing weight needs to be conducted to uncover established or developing cross-addictive behaviors. Clearly, assuming that any weight loss is better than no weight loss is a dangerous proposition when the mechanisms of how this weight loss occurred are not identified.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

      "title": "[Pain--physiological or medical phenomenon].",
      "abstract": "The word \"pain\" is ambiguous, symbolic and it is understood differently by the patient and by the doctor or physiologist. It describes a kind of sensation evoked by harmful stimuli which is a physiological phenomenon indispensable for protection and also suffering caused by injury or disease. The second component of the phenomenon is usually not recognized--this is the reaction to pain. The primary component is centripetal and ascending to brain centers, the second is centrifugal, descending and they both form the reflex arc. This is the pain or nociceptive reflex. Commonly, when we speak of pain we mean only the centripetal part of the reflex which cannot be objectively assessed in medical practise. This part is blocked by anaesthesia before surgical procedures. The second part is the subject of a separate consideration which begins with psychic reaction to pain and pain tolerance, and suffering depend on it. The motor reaction to pain is more spectacular and possible for recording. Three types of this reaction are discerned: flight, defense and suffering expression. Nociceptive sensation is a physiological receptor-mediated sensation, while pathological pain can derive from receptors as well as from nerves /conduction pain, neuropathic differentiation pain/ or from centres/central pain. The pathological pain has clinical features making possible the recognition of its origin, its mechanism for undertaking of appropriate measures. Neuropathic pain is the one most difficult to treat. The receptor-mediated pain continues as long as the stimulus is active, the neuropathic pain is longer lasting.",

      "abstract": "Dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality) is increasingly diagnosed, often follows childhood trauma, and is characterized by rigidification of phenomena that resemble hypnosis. To interpret dissociated aspects of selfhood as autonomous entities is a useful heuristic; but when taken too literally, it leads to three kinds of anomaly: (1) legal: dissociators remain culpable for misdeeds carried out beyond apparent awareness or control; (2) clinical: legitimization sometimes leads not to relief, but to escalating cycles of regressive dependency; and (3) scientific: the form of dissociated entities varies with how they are defined, in ways that are intrinsically motivated and clinically manipulable. These anomalies yield to an evolutionary perspective that views dissociative identity disorder as an evolved strategy of adaptive deception of self and others; e.g., a beaten subordinate avoids further retribution by \"pleading illness.\" Such a deceit best avoids detection when fully experienced; through its intensity and persistence, it becomes real at a new level. One's basic competencies remain intact, however, and are the source of the anomalies described. They can be clinically accessed and empowered, providing the key to therapeutic change when dissociative processes are problematic. Overall, despite clear impairment in subjective awareness and volition, dissociative-disordered individuals are best held fully accountable for the consequences of their actions.",

      "title": "Current Concepts in Diagnosis and Treatment of Functional Neurological Disorders",
      "abstract": "Functional neurological disorders (FND) are common sources of disability in medicine. Patients have often been misdiagnosed, correctly diagnosed after lengthy delays, and/or subjected to poorly delivered diagnoses that prevent diagnostic understanding and lead to inappropriate treatments, iatrogenic harm, unnecessary and costly evaluations, and poor outcomes. Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder/Conversion Disorder was adopted by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, replacing the term psychogenic with functional and removing the criterion of psychological stress as a prerequisite for FND. A diagnosis can now be made in an inclusionary manner by identifying neurological signs that are specific to FNDs without reliance on presence or absence of psychological stressors or suggestive historical clues. The new model highlights a wider range of past sensitizing events, such as physical trauma, medical illness, or physiological/psychophysiological events. In this model, strong ideas and expectations about these events correlate with abnormal predictions of sensory data and body-focused attention. Neurobiological abnormalities include hypoactivation of the supplementary motor area and relative disconnection with areas that select or inhibit movements and are associated with a sense of agency. Promising evidence has accumulated for the benefit of specific physical rehabilitation and psychological interventions alone or in combination, but clinical trial evidence remains limited. Functional neurological disorders are a neglected but potentially reversible source of disability. Further research is needed to determine the dose and duration of various interventions, the value of combination treatments and multidisciplinary therapy, and the therapeutic modality best suited for each patient.",

      "abstract": "SummaryProlonged fatigue is a common complaint in the community and is usually transitory. If fatigue continues for more than six months, is disabling, and is accompanied by other constitutional and neuropsychiatric symptoms, then a diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) should be considered.CFS probably is an heterogeneous disease, maybe multifactorial, or it includes different pathologies which manifest with the same symptoms. In some cases, the mode of presentation of the illness implicate the exposure to chemical and/or food toxins as precipitating factors (e.g., ciguatera poisoning, Gulf War Syndrome, etc.). In other CFS cases, the etiology is still unknown: there are various hypotheses on pathogenetic events which, alone or in association with each other, may precipitate the illness. In fact, it is probable an involvement of multiple events in CFS onset where different precipitating factors can interact each other, even if not always all present in the single patient: latent and/or chronic viral infections, immunologic and neuroendocrine dysfunctions, psychological, environmental and mood factors.In accordance to this theory, we consider various subgroups of CFS patients on the basis of the pathway and the mode of presentation of the disease. The Clinic of Infectious Diseases of \"G. D'Annunzio\" University of Chieti is one of the main National Reference Centers for the CFS Study in Italy. From January 1992 to January 1998, 238 patients came to our observation: 89 of them met CDC criteria for CFS (1994), 127 did not; the other 22 patients are still under evaluation. Our patients underwent physical examination (including tests for searching for the possible coexistence of a fibromyalgia syndrome), psychiatric interview with several neuropsychological tests, laboratory tests (including magnesium determination on serum), neuroendocrine evaluation (circadian rhythm of several hormones, buspirone challenge test), SPECT scans to evaluate cerebral perfusion, and other examinations where necessary in according to the symptomatology of each patient (e.g., orthopedic, ORL, EMG, muscle biopsy, etc.).According to our preliminary results, we subdivided our patients in different subgroups and we studied them comparatively.We report the more significant data collected from this evaluation that might lead to a better understanding of the syndrome and in particular of its pathways course, a knowledge that will help in choosing appropriate therapies for each subgroups.",

      "abstract": "The majority of people who have experienced traumatic events do not suffer long-lasting psychological sequelae. The development of post-traumatic psychopathology depends on individual vulnerability, both genetic and acquired, the nature and severity of the traumatic event, and the quality of the post-traumatic environment. Children who are the victims of abuse or neglect may be particularly profoundly affected by their experience. Even if the stress is only relatively small, if the trauma occurs at a sensitive or critical period of psychological development, a child's cognitive or emotional functioning may not progress normally. The psychopathology of severe personality disorder may thus originate at an early age. Adults who have previously experienced such traumaticevents and who are then involved in later traumatic incidents may be particularly susceptible subsequently to manifest severe psychological disorder. However, even if there is no pre-existing vulnerability, severe trauma can lead to the development of the full range of abnormal psychological symptoms in someone who was previously healthy.",

The presence of psychotic features has a profound influence on the course and treatment response of mood disorders, and psychotic disorders in turn are influenced by coexisting dysregulation of mood. Psychosis and mood, along with other features such as severity, a high rate of recurrence, psychomotor changes, dissociation, and mental states reflecting a history of trauma, appear to interact to alter each other's expression. The treatment of psychotic mood disorders, regardless of coexisting conditions, requires pharmacotherapy--usually a combination of an antipsychotic drug and a medication for mood--or electroconvulsive therapy.

Unfortunately for psychology, those who gave subject this attention approached it with a bias resulting from preoccupation with system of psychotherapeutics known as psycho-analysis. Owing to this bias these investigators found in these lapses confirmation of their theories about mental and they have used these lapses and their interpretations of them as a means of introducing uninitiated into mysteries of so-called new psychology. According to this new such lapses are not explainable by principles of orthodox psychology, are due to operation of mental processes of which individual is not and cannot be aware at time of lapse, are manifestation of activity within the of desires of a painful or disgusting or unthinkable nature, and betray something which individual does not want to know or have known about himself. In following analyses of such lapses (slips of tongue, etc.) as have recently come under my notice or have been studied by me, I shall show that such psychic mishaps or accidents can be satisfactorily explained by principles of orthodox psychology, do not involve unknown or unknowable mental processes, are not manifestations of repressed desires, are not unconscious betrayals of individual's secret self, and that they furnish not slightest basis on which to construct a psychology of unconscious. The careful scrutiny of circumstances surrounding lapses (slips, forgettings, accidental breakages, etc.) proves that these mistakes are results of verifiable psychophysiological processes, that known laws of orthodox psychology are adequate to explain them, that they are psychologically determined (not psychically determined), that they are not valid psychic acts and do not give expression to repressed, unknown, and unknowable motives of an undesirable, discreditable, or disgusting nature.

Negative symptoms occur alongside positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations in acute psychotic episodes, where they generally respond to treatment with antipsychotic medication, but for the 15-20% of patients for whom negative symptoms are enduring,1 2 current treatment strategies have modest benefits at best.\n\nA critical but often difficult clinical distinction is between primary and secondary negative symptoms,3 The former constitute an enduring deficit state within schizophrenia, whereas the latter can be manifestations of depressive features or medication side effects such as bradykinesia (as part of drug induced parkinsonism), or the consequence of positive symptoms (for example, social and emotional withdrawal may be a response to persecutory delusions or reflect a patient’s avoidance of social stimulation to minimise the provocation of intrusive psychotic experiences). Irrespective of cause, persistent negative symptoms disproportionately limit recovery4 and are associated with poorer occupational and social functioning in the community, including a reduced likelihood of living independently.5 6\n\nFindings from studies that have tested drug strategies for negative symptoms in the context of acute psychotic episodes may not be generalisable to those with persistent symptoms. Few published studies have specifically recruited patients with illness characterised by persistent symptoms.\n\nThe introduction of the second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, was accompanied by claims of better efficacy against negative symptoms, but whether any such effect is independent of an improvement in positive symptoms or medication …",

Loss of motivation due to disturbance of intellect, emotion, or level of consciousness defines the symptom of apathy.

Somatform disorders are diagnosed by the presence of body symptoms that suggest a physical disorder without a demonstrable organic cause or known physiological mechanism that fully explains them and by the reasonable presumption that these symptoms are related to psychological factors or stress. Patients with chronic, serious somatoform disorders (mainly somatisation disorder, hypochondriasis, body dysmorphic disorder, and psychogenic pain) also present with personality disorders that determine the evolution or are even the main diagnosis. In addition, these patients frequently present/display severe psycho-social stress when they go to the doctor and have social adjustment problems, which often reinforce the symptoms. The gains derived from the disease and the role the patient assumes, the anomalous cognitive-perceptive mechanisms and the doctor-patient relationship are all essential for the understanding of the configuration process of many somatoform disorders and for determining their treatment. Primary care doctors therefore should be aware of and consider somatisation disorders in their clinical practice because many of the patient's symptoms could be an expression of their emotional difficulties that summarize complex psychological, life, family and social interactions, that may jeopardize the doctor-patient relationship.",

El estado de animo esta implicado en la generacion del dolor. O el estado de animo y el dolor son debidos a la disfuncion de otros procesos centrales comunes. En el presente trabajo, intentamos mostrar la complejidad de los mecanismos subyacentes a la interaccion que observamos en la FM.",

      "title": "“This Is Not the Original Timeline”: A Case Report of an Extended Dissociative Episode in a Healthy Young Male Accompanied with Severe Decline in Mental State",
      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

Sjögren’s may vary in its intensity and effects, but there is no cure and it never goes away. Patients with Sjögren’s often look better than they feel, so other people may not believe they are “really” sick. A chronic illness generates stress and uncertainty. Patients do not know what will happen next and can’t predict how they will feel. Anxiety, confusion, frustration, and depression are all common emotions. Challenges brought on by the disease can lead to changes in relationships with family and friends. People may cope well at times, not well at others. Physicians can help validate the changes in patients’ lives and encourage them to maximize a sense of well-being. Despite the challenges, people with Sjögren’s can still lead meaningful, productive lives.",

They do not have frank psychiatric illness, and are conventionally considered to have functional disorders. The term ‘functional disorder’ is, unfortunately, sometimes used in a pejorative or dismissive manner, as biomedical science has become the focus of medical attention. Altered emotional states are commonly associated with physical symptoms, and most people will have experienced (say) urinary frequency before an interview or an examination. Some individuals do not find it easy to admit to, much less to express, the emotions which are disturbing them; others lack the insight and emotional vocabulary which would help them to associate their physical symptoms with an emotional problem. As Balint [124] has said, some illnesses allow patients to complain of a problem.",

If measures are not made to periodically relieve these pressures, carers run a significant risk of collapsing and may have a variety of physical and emotional issues. A weaker immune system, high blood pressure, heart problems, depression, and other harmful health conditions have all been linked to prolonged stress. Any external or internal discomfort that is caused by a physical, chemical, or emotional stressor may contribute to the complaint. Stress can also be defined as a state of being. Trauma, illnesses, poisons, injuries of any type, and infections of all kinds are examples of physical and chemical variables that can cause stress. There are many different types of emotional reasons of stress and strain.

      "title": "Reactive attachment disorder as an evolutionary adaptation",
      "abstract": "This paper suggests that the behaviours associated with the formal diagnosis of the “disinhibited” form of reactive attachment disorder (RAD) might be seen as a functional adaptation rather than a mental health problem, a facultative response enhancing the probability of survival that is triggered by certain conditions. Although disinhibited RAD is most commonly observed in institutionalised children, similar behaviours may also be a part of the emotional difficulties displayed by some fostered and adopted children (the latter includes those once institutionalised), and these may demonstrate not so much a discrete attachment disorder as either the need to fend for oneself following loss of dedicated caregiving or a lack of opportunity to build specific intimate relationships with dedicated caregivers. In many cases this may be inextricably mixed with the neurobiological and psychological seqelae of maltreatment. Indiscriminate attachment behaviour, from this proposed evolutionary perspective, is less a syndrome of mental ill-health than an astute survival manoeuvre following being orphaned, abandoned or fecklessly reared. Such a response, allied to the innate facility to access caregiving from different adults, could be expected to be initiated by specific events as are the other attachment configurations. Classing disinhibited RAD as an adaptation has implications for helping children brought up under extreme duress when their caregiving environment has changed for the better.",

The psychic and narcissistic deconstructions involved in such neurological disorders bring about the kind of vacillation of identity usually associated with the feeling of falling in love with the Other. Moreover, in a number of disorders, the shame of the subject crystallizes around a body that fails, falls, or becomes autonomous, totally independent of the subject’s will. On the basis of several clinical cases from a hospital neurology practice, and through the socio-historical treatment of these disorders, here we propose to examine the basis of the affect of shame in this experience of the body’s “dropping” of the subject and its becoming uncontrollable, as if abandoned to itself and its raw instincts. What exactly is it that falls for the subject and thus reveals itself to the gaze of the Other, and what may be the subject’s responses to this shame, and ways of “relieving” it ?",

Suicide may be the end-point of a number of different contributing factors.

Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population.

      "abstract": "The psychosis phenotype is traditionally thought of as a dichotomous entity with symptoms that can be clearly distinguished from the normal state. An alternative, dimensional approach assumes that psychotic symptoms are continuous with normal experiences and are not necessarily associated with disability. Evidence for a continuum of psychosis comes from studies showing that the core symptoms of psychosis, delusions and hallucinations, are much more prevalent in the general population than their clinical counterparts. These milder forms of expression of psychosis show similar patterns of associations with demographic and environmental risk factors as the clinical disorder, providing further support for the notion of continuity. Although the majority of individuals experiencing these lesser psychotic “symptoms” are not in need of care, they may nevertheless have an increased risk of developing a clinical disorder. Transitions over the psychosis continuum may in part be driven by the cognitive and emotional response to the psychotic or psychosislike experiences.",

      "title": "The Problem of &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Functional&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;",
      "abstract": "Functional neurological disorder is an entity that is commonly referred to by names such as psychogenic or conversion disorder [1]. It is defined as a neurological disorder caused by psychological factors, falling into the category of somatic symptom disorders in the most recent version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). Some well-known examples of somatic symptom disorders involving other organ systems include irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, and chronic pelvic pain [2].\r\n\r\nPatients with functional disorders are seen in various clinical settings and are commonly admitted as an inpatient for further work-up and symptom management [3]. Those with neurological symptoms in particular may receive work-up beyond the scope of being thorough, as their symptoms can be concerning for neurological disorders such as stroke, epilepsy or multiple sclerosis. Physicians may ultimately become convinced that these patients’ symptoms are due to a psychological cause, but convincing these patients may not be easy, as the suffering is real but the treatment is not instantaneous.\r\n\r\nAs a movement disorders clinical fellow, I often see patients with functional movement disorders. Functional movement disorders can present in various ways such as tremor, myoclonus, or dystonia, but share common clinical features on examination such as variability, distractibility and entrainibility of the movements [4]. Although the term psychogenic is considered to be less ambiguous than functional, its negative nuance may add to the patients’ struggle to accept the diagnosis. Some common reactions are: “Are you saying it is all in my head?” “I find it hard to believe that what I am experiencing is just from stress.” “…but I don’t feel stressed.”\r\n\r\nThrough my fellowship, I have tried different ways of delivering the diagnosis of a functional movement disorder. My strategy has evolved with experience, a mix of successful and unsuccessful situations. For example, the patient might seem to be initially receptive of the diagnosis and considering the recommended treatment options with a positive attitude. When this appeared to be the case, I would feel not only relieved, but also a sense of triumph-I had successfully dealt with a challenging situation, and now surely the patient would be on the road to recovery! I quickly realized that this was not always the case. In the following days, I would receive emails doubting or misinterpreting the diagnosis that seemed to be clear at the time. Some patients seemed unhappy, if not angry or disappointed. I would often review the approach that I had used to deliver the diagnosis on the day of the visit, and try to revise my strategy accordingly, hoping to be more successful the next time.\r\n\r\nSeveral reasons may underlie this difficulty of accepting the diagnosis of a functional disorder. Currently, the knowledge on the physiology of the disorder is limited, and we cannot satisfactorily explain to these patients exactly how this occurs, which may add to the patient’s skepticism towards the diagnosis. The variability of symptoms, a common feature of the disorder itself, may confuse and deceive the patients, leaving them to wonder what rare organic neurological disorder they might have as the cause. Last but not least, patients may be influenced by the stigma of having any disorder that has relation to psychological factors, and even misinterpret the diagnosis as malingering, an intentional production of symptoms.\r\n\r\nBut do we physicians also have difficulty embracing the diagnosis of a functional disorder? Some patients are seen by several physicians and undergo extensive testing until seen by someone who might finally share the diagnosis. It is not unusual that this can be years later since the beginning of symptoms. Delivering the diagnosis is certainly challenging for reasons mentioned above, and physicians fear missing an organic neurological disorder. However, simply labeling these patients as having ‘medically unexplained symptoms’ not only leads to increased healthcare cost [5], but can result in increased morbidity and mortality from unnecessary diagnostic workup or treatment.\r\n\r\n“How can you tell me it’s functional when I am not functional?” The words of a patient echo through my head as I share this diagnosis with yet another patient. I only hope to be able to help my patients so that they understand that the diagnosis was achieved through identifying positive signs and symptoms, and that it is not merely a diagnosis of exclusion. I try to reassure them that this disorder is very much real, involuntary and acknowledge that it can be very disabling. Some patients have accepted the diagnosis and made a substantial recovery through cognitive behavioral therapy.

Case Report: A 34 year old patient known to have schizophrenia with previous admissions to psychiatric hospital suddenly complaining of paraplegia with no sensory deficit . these symptoms persist for 6 months. Conclusion: Long lasting symptoms is something unusually seen in conversion disorder cases where the course of illness stay for a couple of days.",

This condition can arise due to various factors, including neurological disorders, systemic illnesses, medications, or substance abuse. Secondary mania often presents diagnostic and therapeutic challenges as a comprehensive evaluation is required to identify the underlying cause. Understanding the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment strategies for secondary mania is crucial for effective management. This chapter explores the etiology, diagnostic criteria, differential diagnosis, and evidence-based treatment approaches for secondary mania, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in managing this complex disorder.",

      "abstract": "Both painful and nonpainful somatic symptoms essentially characterize clinical states of depressive mood. So far, this well-established psychopathological knowledge has been appreciated only insufficiently by the official diagnostic systerms of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV TR) and the ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders. Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines (ICD-10). From a perspective of primary care services, this unmet diagnostic need is deplorable, as the main mode of presenting a depression is by reporting somatic symptoms. This somatic form of presentation, however, significantly contributes to low rates of recognition in primary care. A diagnostic challenge may be seen in the differentiation of a depression with prevailing somatic symptoms from anxiety, somatoform disorders, and medical conditions. When somatic symptoms, particularly painful physical conditions, accompany the already debilitating psychiatric and behavioral symptoms of depression, the course of the illness may be more severe, implying a higher risk of early relapse, chronicity, suicide, or mortality due to other natural causes, the economic burden increases considerably the functional status may be hampered heavily, and health-related quality of life may be lowered dramatically. The neurobiological underpinnings of somatic symptoms in depression may guide more promising treatment approaches.",

      "title": "Classification of psychodermatological disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Currently, psychodermatological disorders are classified under different criteria exhibiting several limitations, and no single universal classification system exists. Herein, we discuss previous suggested classifications in psychodermatology, highlighting their limitations, and we propose a new classification system, without redundant information and with accurate terminology, incorporating the relevance of the terms “disorder,” “disease,” and “illness” in psychodermatology. In this new classification, the following three groups are then suggested: “primary psychodermatological disease,” to include primary dermatoses, where psychological stress, a psychological mechanism, and/or psychopathology are some of the main elements that are recognized in the etiopathogenesis (which may induce and/or worsen a primary dermatosis); “primary psychodermatological illness,” to include skin symptoms, with or without secondary self‐induced skin lesions (such as excoriations), without a primary dermatosis, and where psychopathology, psychological characteristics, and/or a neuropathic mechanism, where stress plays a relevant role, are key features responsible for the skin symptoms and the secondary skin lesions; and “secondary psychodermatological disorder,” to include medications prescribed in dermatology with psychiatric consequences and medications prescribed in psychiatry with dermatologic consequences. Our goal with this system is to broaden the recognition of psychodermatology and improve patient management, with practical and scientific relevance for dermatologists, psychiatrists, and psychologists working in psychodermatology, but also for general practitioners, physicians from other medical and surgical specialties as well as specialists in esthetic dermatology, who frequently encounter patients with psychodermatological disorders.",

Body dysmorphic disorder is an increasingly recognized somatoform disorder, clinically distinct from obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders, and depression. Patients with body dysmorphic disorder are preoccupied with an imagined deficit in the appearance of one or more body parts, causing clinically significant stress, impairment, and dysfunction. The preoccupation is not explained by any other psychiatric disorder. Patients present to family physicians for primary care reasons and aesthetic or cosmetic procedures. Cosmetic correction of perceived physical deficits is rarely an effective treatment. Pharmacologic treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and non-pharmacologic treatment with cognitive behavior therapy are effective. Body dysmorphic disorder is not uncommon, but is often misdiagnosed. Recognition and treatment are important because this disorder can lead to disability, depression, and suicide. Psychiatric social work assessment and intervention was provided to the person with Body dysmorphic disorder, focusing on to building for change in misbelieve and strengthening commitment to change. The psycho social intervention was provided to the patients and his family members. Sessions on Admission counseling, Family intervention, Supportive therapy, Psycho education, role play, reminiscence, Pre discharge counseling, Discharge Counseling and Social Group Work was conducted. At the end of the therapy, the client knowledge about the illness and coping skills has improved.",

Based on definitions from the DSM-IV, the term \"nomophobia\" refers to a \"phobia for a particular or specific things.\" When someone uses their phone excessively, there are a number of psychological issues at play, such as low self-esteem and an outgoing personality. The weight of this issue is currently growing on a global scale. NOMOPHOBIC symptoms may also be triggered by other mental illnesses, such as panic disorder, social anxiety, or social phobia. It is very difficult to tell if a patient develops NOMOPHOBIC symptoms as a result of an addiction to cell phones or if their anxiety issues are present [1]. Instances of nomophobia include the following signs and symptoms: tachycardia, anxiety, shaking, sweating, agitation, and altered breathing patterns. Nomophobia can also serve as a stand-in for other mental illnesses. As such, we must exercise extreme caution while diagnosing it. Nomophobia can also be triggered by certain mental illnesses, and vice versa. Because nomophobia shares clinical symptoms with other diseases, it can be extremely tough for clinicians to diagnose and treat patients due to its complexity [2].",

Among the various systemic diseases, endocrine diseases, viral infections, collagen disease, pancreatic cancer, vitamin B12 deficiency, and folic acid deficiency are particularly likely to cause depression. Drugs, including interferon, methyldopa, and steroids, may also be the cause of depression. The depression seen in organic brain disease (secondary depres- sion) includes depression in convalescence from disturbance of consciousness caused by head trauma or encephalitis, poststroke depression, and depression in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or other neurodegenerative diseases. The symptoms of depression associated with a medical condition are basically the same as those in endogenous depression, including depressed mood, sadness, diminished mental activity, and impatience. However, depression associated with chronic organic brain disorders is characterized by the predominant symptoms of diminished intellectual capacity, apathetic tendency, lability of mood, retardation in thinking and speech, and flat affect, whereas depressive mood, insomnia, anorexia, low self- esteem, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and suicidal ideation are mild.",

Chronic pain is difficult to treat and often the interventions fail. This failure is, in part due to the fact that chronic pains usually result as a manifestation of some chronic degenerative, inflammatory or neoplastic process. As far as the choice of interventions is concerned, the indication for its use may not be well justified, and the choice itself may be determined by the type of specialist and not by the actual clinical picture. The various treatment interventions usually fail due to non- compliance of patients towards the untoward side effect of the systemically used drugs. The patient may not receive the treatment for appropriate time and dosage due to the side effects. Furthermore, indication of specific treatment modality depends upon the evidence of positive effects of the modality, as indicated in various control trials or the related literature2.",

The symptoms referred to as FSS are comprised of varying combinations of pain in different parts of the body, functional disturbances attributed to organs like cardiovascular or gastrointestinal dysfunctions or dizziness, and symptoms surrounding fatigue. Their main characteristics, pathophysiology, and etiology are briefly discussed.

The peculiar architecture of neural cells, their high-energy demands, and the mandate for electrochemical communication combine to place the nervous system at high risk for chemical perturbation. This inherent vulnerability is exploited by natural agents, synthetic chemicals, medications, and recreational substances designed or used to target the nervous system as well as by a host of other substances that are occasionally encountered in the environment. The neurotoxic actions of chemicals are expressed in a wide range of neurologic phenomena, some of which are associated with purely functional changes, others with structural damage, and still others with both. Many chemicals cause effects that appear and disappear rapidly; others produce effects that evolve over days or weeks and regress over months or years. Diagnosis is heavily dependent on the history and characteristic clinical phenomenology. Specific treatment other than termination of exposure is rare. Although clinical improvement is the rule, neurotoxic disorders leave scars or disappear without a trace.",

      "title": "Pramenstrnelles Syndrom nnd Dysmenorrho",
      "abstract": "Der Begriff pramenstruelles beinhaltet eine Vielzahl von somatischen und psychischen Veranderungen, die im Zusammenhang mit der Menstruation auftreten. Dabei sind bis zu 150 verschiedene Symptome beschrieben worden, die diesem Syndrom zugeordnet werden konnen. Allein die Vielzahl der Symptome weist darauf hin, wie unscharf der Symptomenkomplex charakterisiert ist. We it unklarer als die klinische Beschreibung ist seine Pathophysiologie. Nach klinischen Gesichtspunkten spricht man von einem pramenstruellen Syndrom, wenn es urn die Beschreibung von psychischen oder somatischen Beschwerden geht, die pramenstruell auftreten und postmenstruell vollig verschwinden (Dalton 1985). Das pramenstruelle Syndrom war offensichtlich schon im klassischen Altertum bekannt. Bereits Hippokrates bezog Veranderungen der Gemiltslage in der pramenstruellen Phase auf ein Verhalten des Regelbluts. Die Regelblutung wurde als ReinigungsprozeB des Korpers und der Seele aufgefaBt. Zu den soma tisch en Beschwerden, die im Rahmen des pramenstruellen Syndroms gesehen werden, gehort die Odemneigung mit Gewichtszunahme, Brustspannen mit Mastodynie, Vollegefilhl mit Obstipationsneigung und Ubelkeit. Bei den psychovegetativen Symptomen stehen erhohte Reizbarkeit, Aggressivitat, Stimmungslabilitat, Angstlichkeit, Antriebsarmut, Schlaflosigkeit, Appetitveranderungen, gesteigerter Durst, Libidobeeintrachtigung, Konzentrationsund Koordinationsschwache im Vordergrund. Die Wesensveranderung kann so we it reichen, daB Kleptomanie, Pyromanie, Trunksucht, Nymphomanie und Halluzinationen beobachtet werden. Das pramenstruelle Syndrom gilt in GroBbritannien als strafmildern, in Frankreich gar als zeitweilige Unzurechnungsfahigkeit. Hinsichtlich der Pathophysiologie des pramenstruellen Syndroms gibt es eine Reihe von Hypothesen. Der zeitliche Zusammenhang zwischen der Menstruation und dem Auftreten dieses Syndroms lieB vermuten, daB eine gesWrte Ovarialfunktion mit veranderter Relation von Ostrogenund Progesteronsekretion ursachlich verantwortlich zu machen sei (Backstrom et al. 1976). Eine unzureichende sekretorische Umwandlung des J::ndometriums machte einen relativen Progesteronmangel zusatzlich wahrscheinlich. Damit wurde gleichzeitig ein relatives Uberwiegen der Ostrogenwirkung angenommen. Die gilnstigen therapeutischen Wirkungen einer Progesteronsubstitution schienen diese Hypothese zu bestatigen. In klinischen Studien, in denen serienmaBig Plasmaspiegel von Ostradiol und Progesteron bestimmt wurden, zeigte sich, daB das pramenstruelle Syndrom sowohl bei ovulatorischen als auch bei anovulatorischen Zyklen auftreten kann (Reid u. Yen 1981). Kritisch ist bei",

The allegation of secondary gain is diffi cult to confi rm, and may arise from a lack of an appropriate diagnostic evaluation and proper attribution of symptoms to pathology. Additionally, clinicians who allege secondary gain or malingering in a patient in the absence of clear evidence may be motivated by economic incentives to make such determinations.",

El diagnóstico de Trastorno de Evitación y Restricción de la Ingesta de Alimentos, (ARFID, de sus siglas en inglés) fue incluido en el Manual Diagnóstico y Estadístico de Trastornos Mentales, 5ta Edición (DSM-5) el año 2013, como un nuevo diagnóstico dentro de los Trastornos Alimentarios y de Ingesta (TAI) para describir un grupo de pacientes que tienen conductas alimentarias evitativas o restrictivas que no están motivadas por una alteración de la imagen corporal o un deseo de adelgazar. Este trastorno puede manifestarse en una pérdida de peso significativa y/o deficiencia nutricional y/o una marcada interferencia en el funcionamiento psicosocial. Se describen tres formas de presentación que pueden ocurrir en conjunto o de manera independiente: (i) Niños con aversiones sensoriales (selectivos), que rechazan algunas comidas por sus sabores, texturas, olores o formas; (ii) otros que presentan inapetencia, baja ingesta o poco interés en alimentarse (ingesta limitada); (iii) y los que rechazan algunos alimentos o dejan de comer después de un evento traumático asociado (aversivos). Debido a la incorporación reciente del diagnóstico al DSM-5, existe aún escasa evidencia respecto a su enfrentamiento.

      "title": "The psychosocial effects of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES)",
      "abstract": "What are Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures? A recent research study conducted by Flinders University explores the experience of a disability which is both hidden and lacks physiological ‘evidence’; a condition which is not understood by health professionals, and results in individuals feeling confused and isolated. Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) (also called pseudoseizures) are events resembling epileptic seizures, which are not associated with ictal electrical discharges in the brain but by psychological processes. PNES may be triggered by anxiety, psychological tension and heightened defence against intense emotions. In some cases PNES may be a result of psychological trauma, previous psychiatric history, physical and sexual abuse or posttraumatic stress disorder (Fiszman, Alves-Leon, Nunes, Dandrea, & Figueira, 2004). Health professionals often overlook PNES due to the common misconception that they are “fake” (Benbadis, 2005) or are categorized as a “non-disease” (i.e. not epilepsy) (Bodde, et al., 2009). However, this is a very real condition, with considerable psychosocial implications. People diagnosed with PNES feel anger, shame, helplessness, and experience suicidal ideation (thinking about suicide with some intent but without actually making plans to commit suicide) (Thompson, Isaac, Rowse, Tooth, & Reuber, 2009). Stigma is often attached with this label, fuelled by poor understanding and little education and support following diagnosis (Benbadis, 2010). One complicating factor is that an individual may experience both PNES and epileptic seizures. 15% of people with diagnosed PNES also have epilepsy (Benbadis, 2010), and it is estimated that 10 to 50% of individuals with “intractable seizures” (seizures not adequately controlled by AEDs) have either lone PNES or a combination of epileptic seizures and PNES (LaFrance, et al., 2006). Co-morbidity can cause significant diagnostic and management issues, with health professionals often unable to accurately identify the cause of seizures, and thereby communicate and manage them appropriately. The current study aimed to further explore the psychosocial effects of PNES and their implications for the development of appropriate multidisciplinary support and management strategies.",

The disturbance of purposive movements cannot be termed apraxia, however, if the patient suffers from any elementary motor or sensory deficit (i.e., paresis, dystonia, ataxia), which could fully explain the abnormal motor behavior, or if it results from a language comprehension disorder or from dementia (1,2). Nevertheless, praxic errors are well defined clinically and kinematically and can be superimposed on elementary motor disorders (3,4). Praxic disturbances may affect specific parts of the body (i.e., limb apraxia, buccofacial apraxia, gait apraxia) and may involve both sides of the body (i.e., ideational and ideomotor apraxias), preferentially one side (i.e., limb-kinetic apraxia) or, alternatively, interlimb coordination, as in the case of gait apraxia.",

      "title": "A review on pain and its signals modulation by body",
      "abstract": "Pain is an uncomfortable feeling that tells you something may be wrong. It can be steady, throbbing, stabbing, aching, pinching, or described in many other ways. Sometimes, it’s just a nuisance, like a mild headache. Other times it can be debilitating. Pain can bring about other physical symptoms, like nausea, dizziness, weakness or drowsiness. It can cause emotional effects like anger, depression, mood swings or irritability. Pain can change your lifestyle and impact your job, relationships and independence. Pain is classified as either acute or chronic. Acute pain is usually severe and short-lived, and is often a signal that your body has been injured. Chronic pain can range from mild to severe, is present for long periods of time, and is often the result of a disease that may require ongoing treatment. When we sense pain, we pay attention to our bodies and can take steps to fix what hurts. Pain also may prevent us from injuring a body part even more. If it didn't hurt to walk on a broken leg, a person might keep using it and cause more damage. If your throat is really sore, you'll probably go to the doctor, who can treat the infection if you have one. Pain itself often modifies the way the central nervous system processes pain, so that a patient actually becomes more sensitive and gets more pain with less provocation. This is called “central sensitization.” (And there’s peripheral sensitization too.) Sensitized patients are not only more sensitive to things that should hurt, but also to ordinary touch and pressure as well. Their pain also “echoes,” fading more slowly than in other people. This phenomenon is usually superimposed over other problems, but it can also occur acutely and be the primary issue, as in complex regional pain syndrome, or amplified pain syndrome, which disporportionately affects everyone.

      "title": "Psychiatric Approach of Fibromyalgia",
      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia is a disease that occurs frequently. However, people do not know much about this disease and many doctors find it difficult to diagnose such patients. Symptoms of fibromyalgia may not only include pain, but also sleep disorder, fatigue, melancholia, and other mood disorders. Pain is one of the major symptoms of many diseases and may greatly impede the quality and functionof an individual's life. Yet many clinicians have trouble treating chronic pain in part because they focus on the pain itself, which is merely one of the causes, and not on the evaluation and treatment of problems incidental to pain. It is noted that pain may be accompanied by not only physical suffering, but also emotional problems, such as melancholia and other secondary problems. The causes for fibromyalgia syndrome have not yet been clearly revealed but it is known that mental factors contribute to the occurrence and progress of the symptoms, and that the evaluation of or therapeutic interventions for the mental causes may be due to physical effects. Therefore, based on ad-equate psychiatric knowledge, clinicians should under-stand and treat the patients accordingly. It may be that more effective medical services are needed through in-tensive treatments in multidisciplinary teams for the patients. This article is aimed at investigating the psychological issues that fibromyalgia patients encounter. It also considers the psychiatric drugs and psychosocial treatment that are applied to the disease.",

      "title": "Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "Somatic symptom and related disorders comprise a heterogeneous group of psychiatric illnesses characterized by prominent physical symptoms or complaints that are associated with significant distress and impairment. The conceptualization of these disorders under the category of somatoform disorders in DSM-IV/DSM-IV-TR) (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 2000) required that these somatic presentations lack objective organic causes. This latter requirement has been deleted in DSM-5, largely because somatic symptoms often do have related medical conditions (American Psychiatric Association 2013). Even when such associations have not been established, the assumption that they are present has often led to patients being labeled in pejorative ways, as if they are faking symptoms or somehow responsible for their own suffering. The seven disorders encompassed in the DSM-5 category of somatic symptom and related disorders are somatic symptom disorder, illness anxiety disorder, conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder), psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, factitious disorder, other specified somatic symptom and related disorder, and unspecified somatic symptom and related disorder. DSM-IV disorders that are subsumed under this new nomenclature include somatization disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, hypochondriasis, pain disorder, and factitious disorders (which appeared in their own separate category in DSM-IV). Body dysmorphic disorder is not included in the new somatic symptom disorder category and is now classified as one of the other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. Prevalence rates in the literature for what were previously labeled somatoform disorders varied by diagnosis, but in general and across ages these disorders have been seen in 16% of primary care outpatients and in 23% of outpatients with medically unexplained symptoms (de Waal et al. 2004; Smith et al. 2005). A comparison of DSM-5 and DSM-IV diagnoses in a sample of patients suggests that prevalence rates are similar across the old and new nomenclatures (Voigt et al. 2012). Older individuals with somatic symptom and related disorders are seen in all health care settings, where they frequently overuse medical services and overburden general practitioners (de Waal et al. 2008; Puri and Dimsdale 2011). They often come to the attention of a geriatric psychiatrist after another clinician has attempted unsuccessfully to resolve their physical symptoms. To date, the somatic symptom and related disorders have not been well studied in late life, in part because many of the disorders tend to begin in early adulthood. In addition, research involving older cohorts has usually focused on reported somatic symptoms rather than on specific diagnoses. A complicating factor is that somatoform symptoms in late life are often obscured by comorbid physical and psychiatric illnesses. In particular, these disorders have been strongly associated with stress, depression, anxiety, psychological trauma, substance abuse, and personality disorders (de Waal et al. 2004; Haftgoli et al. 2010; Hasin and Katz, 2007; Sack et al. 2007; Tomenson et al. 2012). DSM-5 is trying to make the diagnoses more parsimonious by eliminating the requirement for medically unexplained symptoms, but additional research is needed to further elucidate their characteristics under the new nomenclature.",

      "abstract": "During adolescence physical, psychic and social changes occure more rapidly and to a greater extent than during any other period of live. The marked changes concern not only the outern appearence, but also its intrapsychic representations, the body image. The complex integrative processes towards the identity as man or woman cannot be mastered without a certain emotional and physical instability. This is particularly the case if, in addition, nearly infantile disturbances in the socialisation or conflicts specific for this life period are, or have been, present. They can in the sense of a disposition lead to the manifestation of more or less severe crisis in adolescence. These crises interfere not only with the body image, but in many cases with the somatic functions as well. In the study three general aspects of this developmental problem are discussed as far they are relevant in the therapy of psycho-somatic disturbances in adolescents. 1. The implication of the adolescent phase in the course of psycho-somatic diseases. 2. Diseases which mainly occure in adolescence and are predominantly confined to this life period or are mainly influenced by it. 3. The influence which conflicts and phase-specific anxieties and fantasies exercise on the development and establishment of a mature body image and an adult identity.",

Evidence suggests that these comorbidities may be explained by a limited capacity of individuals to exert cognitive control on thoughts, emotions, or behaviors. A decrease of this capacity of control could contribute to the development and maintenance of chronic pain and its associated symptoms. Benefits of the cognitive-behavioral therapy in the treatment of chronic pain may be explained by learning efficient and less costly pain coping strategies in terms of cognitive control capacity.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Definition: Disease means any abnormality in a person that causes undue discomfort, deformity, dysfunction, or death (Humber and Almeder, 1997). Literally the term disease means a state of dis-ease (dis = negation or lack of, ease = ease— therefore a state of lacking ease or of un-ease). Many states of discomfort, such as grief, reactive depression, or anxiety, only qualify as a disease if they exceed normal limits. The concept of “normality” and “abnormality”: The concept of disease and its diagnosis rests on the assumption that human beings exist in definable states of health or disease, but health and disease exist in a continuum. No strict dichotomy separates them, particularly in regard to mental illness. Some unusual, often creative people, like the mathematician Paul Erdös (Hoffman, 1998), defy a simple normal/abnormal dichotomy. Nevertheless, we can assume that a standard healthy “normal” or “average” person exists, normal in mind and body, to the degree that we could enshrine the person in the Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C., along with the standard meter bar and standard kilogram. By matching the findings in a given patient against normal persons of like age, race, sex, and culture, physicians recognize abnormal states of body and mind that constitute disease.",

The development of anxiety or depressive disorders are common with demoralization, another psychological syndrome, a topic of interest in psychiatry. To feel demoralized is to lose hope, courage, or confidence, which upsets normal functioning. While depression may co-exist with demoralization, they are 2 distinct entities, with the former characterized by an inability to experience pleasure and the latter characterized by helplessness and avoidance coping. In an effort to more adequately address the psychological stress in organ transplant patients, it is important to distinguish between demoralization and depression. Demoralization has prognostic implications such as negative disease outcomes such as treatment nonadherence and an increase risk of suicide. Medication for depression is not effective for demoralization syndrome. Therapeutic interventions include cognitive behavioral techniques that focus on exploration of attitudes toward hope and meaning in life.",

For the physician, it is a guide to diagnosis itself, and for the patient it is a signal which warns of new conditions of the body and soul or of a disorder. Objectives Mental disorders are most commonly presented by a group of symptoms, among which the patients often can’t point out the leading one. Anxiety as a symptom can occur in a number of psychiatric entities and it can stimulate differential diagnostic dilemma in daily practice. We will show a 26-year female in which the internal anxiety is the main symptom. Aim To underlined the importance of taking in to account a leading symptom of the disease in the way of establishing the correct diagnosis. Methods The psychiatric and psychotherapeutic interviews were performed together with a clinical assessment of mental status and structured clinical interviews (SCID I and SCID II), EEG and psychological testing. Results/conclusion Internal discomfort is a subjective feeling, respectively a symptom which the patient in this case continuously underlined, and which guided us (along with a comprehensive analysis) to a clear diagnosis. Following the choosing of an effective psycho-pharmacological combination, and with the goal of reducing a leading symptom, according to enlarged diagnostic process, we decided to diagnose the Schizoaffective disorders (F 25.2).",

      "title": "The threshold problem of impairment criteria in psychiatric diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Psychiatric diagnoses are made based on careful ascertainment of cluster of signs and symptoms. However, just having symptoms and signs is not sufficient, these need to create problems to the person (or others around him/her) and manifest as distress or functional impairment. For example, a person may have third-person-discussing-type auditory hallucinations for over a month, but he or she may be able to attend to most social occasions and conduct the occupation as an agriculturist diligently. Similarly, individuals may present with symptoms of cannabis use disorder, but not manifest impairment of substance use disorder.[1] We argue that there is considerable heterogeneity in the conceptualization, practical ascertainment, and interpretation of functional impairment. This results in, at least to some degree, nebulousness of determining the threshold of psychiatric disorders.[2] Determining a threshold has implications in adjudicating the prevalence of psychiatric disorder, whether a psychiatric disorder is in remission, and whether a person needs treatment. We envisage three main reasons contributing to the threshold of psychiatric diagnosis. The first is the individual context of the person being interviewed for a diagnosis. A pilot experiencing sleep difficulties due to anxiety and missing a day of flight would be considered to have a diagnosis, whereas a college student missing a class in a month might not be considered passing the diagnosis threshold. The second is the social and cultural context of the person being evaluated. A person from rural parts of Punjab in India being extremely jocular and interrupting the therapist occasionally may be passed off as nonimpairing. A similar presentation of an individual from rural Tamil Nadu may be considered manifesting impairment associated with an affective illness. The third factor is the experience and expectations of the therapist. The therapist decides whether a person crosses the threshold or not. This may have something to do with how they appraise the information and what clinico-therapeutic experiences they may have had in the past. Since there is heterogeneity in determining the threshold of psychiatric diagnoses, there are a few suggestions to address the issue. One is acceptance of the subjectivity of the process of determining the threshold of diagnosis. One could determine kappa values of interrater reliability of impairment criteria. Interrater reliability of diagnoses and functional impairment assessment has been found to be acceptable, though not completely concordant.[3] The second approach could be greater recognition of contextual aspect in determining diagnosis and addition of an explanatory note on how social, educational, economic, political, legal, and other factors might have influenced determining threshold in a particular case. The third approach could be to put a-priori note during diagnostic evaluation process, when the diagnosis is being made and about in what circumstances or degree of functional impairment would the mental health professional not consider a psychiatric diagnosis or the diagnosis to be deemed to be in remission. To conclude, we do proffer that subjectivity exists in determining the lower threshold of impairment of psychiatric disorders, and being cognizant of this may help in rationally labeling an individual as having psychiatric disorder.

      "abstract": "Kernaussagen Definition und Diagnostik Die Diagnose Anpassungsstörung gehört zu den im DSM-IV und im ICD-10 eher weniger gut operationalisierten Kategorien. Ebenso ist sie gleichzeitig eine Diagnose, bei der entgegen den meisten anderen Störungen der Ätiologiebezug beibehalten wurde. So ist immer ein auslösendes Ereignis gefordert, das in einem bestimmten Zeitraum eine charakteristisch ausgestaltete Symptomatik zur Folge hat. Je nach vorherrschenden Symptomen werden Anpassungsstörungen mit depressiver Stimmung, mit Angst, mit anderen beherrschenden Gefühlszuständen, mit Störung des Sozialverhaltens und Mischformen unterschieden. Leider gibt es keine konkreten Aussagen über die Art und Stärke des auslösenden Ereignisses und über die genaue Schwere der Symptomatik, sodass die Abgrenzung der Anpassungsstörung gegenüber „normalen Reaktionen” einerseits und „höherwertigen” pathologischen Störungen – vor allem der Major Depression – andererseits sehr unscharf ist. Umso weniger verwunderlich ist es daher, dass zu dieser Störung im Vergleich zu anderen nur spärlich Studien vorhanden sind und somit auch nur wenige Aussagen, z. B. zu Prävalenz und Therapie, getroffen werden können. Therapie Verschiedene Interventionen von supportiven Gesprächen bis zur Krisenintervention / Kurzzeittherapie sowie zunehmend auch die EMDR-Technik kommen zum Einsatz. Mittlerweile wurden auch einige wenige spezifische Programme entwickelt, von denen bisher 2 spezielle Psychotherapieformen bei Anpassungsstörungen randomisiert-kontrolliert untersucht wurden. In den letzten Jahren ist die erfreuliche Entwicklung einer Hinwendung zu diesem Thema zu verzeichnen, sodass Hoffnungen auf bessere Diagnostik und Differenzialdiagnostik, vor allem aber auf spezifischere Therapien, berechtigt erscheinen.",

Some of these seizures cause great alarm to their victims, in that they seem to threaten paralysis, speechlessness, unconsciousness, or even death itself, or because they occasion profound states of instability and prostration. The appearance and sufferings of the patients during these attacks may further alarm relatives or onlookers, and even the medical man, unless he be familiar with the true nature of the seizures or fully alive to the history of the case, may be taken unawares, and feel so dubious about their purport and outcome as to be unable to give a reassuring prognosis. And yet the seizures which I have in mind are all consistent with long life and with good health at other times.

      "title": "Hallucinations and Delusions",
      "abstract": "Defining terms is an appropriate introduction to this chapter. Hallucinations imply seeing things that are not truly present, or hearing illusory voices or music. In DLB and PDD, hallucinations are nearly always visual and manifest as seeing nonexistent people or objects, such as strangers in the house or yard. The affected individual may realize that he or she is experiencing a hallucination, but some people may not recognize that these are not real. In other disorders auditory hallucinations may be present, such as hearing voices. However, such auditory hallucinations are rare in Lewy disorders. Delusions are defined as false, often irrational beliefs. Frequently, these will have a theme, such as the conviction that someone is spying, or paranoia about friends or neighbors. A common theme is spousal infidelity, sometimes nonsensical, such as an older adult’s accusations of their mate starting an extramarital affair after 50 years of marriage. Capgras syndrome is an uncommon but striking example of delusional thinking in which the spouse or other immediate family member is accused of being an impostor. Hallucinations or delusions may occur in Parkinson’s disease in the absence of frank dementia. However, dementia is the usual setting for these problems. Hallucinations are much more common than delusions. Sometimes they are very limited, perhaps only present at night. Hallucinations are a contraindication to driving a motor vehicle, for obvious reasons. The fundamental cause of hallucinations and delusions in DLB and PDD is the Lewy neurodegenerative process. The precise region of the brain that is responsible is not known, however. These often occur in the absence of any external provocative factors. However, medications are notorious for inciting such problems in susceptible people. Chapter 7 focused on simplifying medications especially for this reason. Drugs for parkinsonism are well-known culprits, in particular two classes: (1) the dopamine agonists: pramipexole (Mirapex), ropinirole (Requip) and rotigotine (Neupro patch); and (2) anticholinergic drugs: trihexyphenidyl (Artane) and benztropine (Cogentin). Carbidopa/levodopa by itself may provoke hallucinations, but that is not very common unless combined with other drugs for parkinsonism.",

The clinical differentiation between functional and organic disease is at times difficult to establish, because, presumptively, in the beginning, at least, all organic disease is preceded by a physiologic perversion, that is, functional alteration, which may or may not be apparent with our present diagnostic limitations.

Dicha constitucion revela los estigmas de una maduracion parcialmente retardada. 3. o La edificacion de la enfermedad, una vez se han admitido los elementos endogenos ya expuestos, es psicologica y reaccional, y se caracteriza por la triada formada por el caracter, la experiencia vivida y el medio. 4. o El delirio de relacion sensitivo esta condicionado por la disposicion caracterial 1; se forma segun reglas precisas: cuanto mas sensitiva es la disposi­ cion, mas tipicas son las manifestaciones del delirio. El caracter sensitivo es enor­ memente astenico. Desde una perspectiva psicologica, se ubica entre el caracter expansivo y el caracter astenico puro. Se caracteriza por una falta de expansion, una incapacidad psiquica de efectuar una descarga. La neurosis de relacion sensi­ tiva se diferencia de la variante obsesiva del caracter sensitivo por el contraste mas acentuado de tensiones interiores. La personalidad de un neurotico sensitivo presenta, por una parte, una suavidad extrema, una debilidad, una sutileza, una vulnerabilidad y, por otra parte, un cierto grado de ambicion, de conciencia en si y de tenacidad. Los representantes mas perfilados de este grupo caracterial son individuos complicados, de elevada inteligencia y de gran valor; poseen una sen­ sibilidad fina y profunda, y poseen una etica escrupulosa. Su vida psiquica inte­ riorizada e hipersensible hace que sean presa facil para las pruebas banales de la vida. Ocultan profundamente sus afectos, y los ocultan durante mucho tiempo. Se analizan y se critican con refinamiento. Son muy susceptibles y tenaces, pero",

Behavior disturbances, recognized as due to the encephalitis, because of an acute onset following a typical epidemic encephalitis history, are nearly always accompanied by some neurologic findings in the form of pupillary changes, facial paresis, muscle stiffness, etc. These behavior disturbances have been shown to be typical of an organic brain disease quite unlike the usual behavior disturbances in children. It has been demonstrated<sup>1</sup>that there is little or no correlation between the severity of the mental disturbance and the physical symptoms; children with slight mental disturbance may have extreme physical findings and vice versa. Originally the behavior of a child was pronounced postencephalitic when the following three conditions were fulfilled: (1) a sudden change in personality, (2) physical evidence of postencephalitis and (3) a history of acute epidemic encephalitis.

Освен това депресията често идва със симптоми на безпокойство. Тя може да доведе до различни емоционални и физически проблеми и да намали способността на човек да функционира на работното място и у дома. Депресията е различна от колебанията в настроението, които хората изпитват като част от нормалния живот. Временните емоционални отговори на предизвикателствата на ежедневието не представляват депресия. Депресията и тревожните разстройства са различни, но хората с депресия често изпитват симптоми, подобни на тези на тревожно разстройство, като нервност, раздразнителност и проблеми със съня и концентрацията. Но всяко разстройство има свои собствени причини и собствени емоционални и поведенчески симптоми. Много хора, които развиват депресия, имат история на тревожно разстройство по-рано в живота си. Няма данни, че едно разстройство причинява другото, но има ясни доказателства, че много хора страдат от двете заболявания. Депресивните разстройства включват две основни подкатегории: тежко депресивно разстройство / депресивен епизод, което включва симптоми като депресивно настроение, загуба на интерес и намалена енергия. В зависимост от броя и тежестта на симптомите депресивният епизод може да бъде категоризиран като лек, умерен или тежък. Дистимия, персистираща или хро нична форма на лека депресия. Симптомите на дистимия са подобни на депресивен период, но са склонни да бъдат по-малко интензивни и да продължават по-дълго. Депресията е рисков фактор за суицидни мисли (има много повече опити за самоубийство, отколкото завършени действия). Депресията засяга 350 милиона души. Търсенето на ограничаване на депресията и други състояния на психичното здраве се увеличават в световен мащаб.",

Physical pain itself can be exacerbated by non-physical causes such as fear, anxiety, grief, unresolved guilt, depression and unmet spiritual meets. Likewise, the inability to manage physical pain well can be due to emotional and spiritual needs. This is why a holistic, interdisciplinary assessment of pain and suffering is required for each patient and family. The mind, body and spirit are understood in relationship to each other and, in those cases, in relationship to a deity or deities are important to understand. Cultural interpretations of pain and suffering may conflict with the goals of palliative care. Understanding the spiritual framework of the patient and family can help to assure that the physical and spiritual suffering of the patient can be eliminated to provide a peaceful death. Spiritual practices may help in the management of physical pain.",

Our interest in the subject of conversion hysteria originated during a study of the behavioral effects of acute brain injuries, when it was noted that subjects who developed hysterical anesthesias and paralyses recalled their accidents and described their injuries in language of violence. In contrast, patients without hysterical symptoms were either amnestic for or confabulatory about accident and injury, or used language which did not emphasize the physically traumatic aspects of the",

      "abstract": "Pain is the most common symptom of disease, which accompanies us from an early age. It is a protective mechanism to which the body responds to harmful stimulus. The definition of pain states that it is a subjective sensory and emotional experience. It is connected to the stimulus that it invokes and is also based on the observation of psychological interpretation of the phenomena taking place. Pain is individual for each person. Pain affects both our previous experience of pain and psychosomatic conditions, depending on the relationship between the psyche and the body. Pain is always an unpleasant sensation. The feeling of pain can be caused by irritation of pain receptors, which can be found in the skin, joints and many internal organs. The cause of pain may also be damage to the nervous system, both the peripheral nerves, brain and spinal cord. Pain can also occur without damage to tissues, although the patient refers to it (psychogenic pain). The process of pain is a complex phenomenon. Experience of pain depends on the strength of the stimulus, individual susceptibility and individual resistance to pain. Pain receptors are sensitive to mechanical, thermal or chemical stimuli. The operation of noxious stimulus to these receptors results in the processing into an electrical signal. This impulse is conducted by nerve fibress into the spinal cord and then to the brain. At this point, there is the realization that something hurts us. Pain is not only somatic in nature, associated with the condition of the body, but it is a multidimensional phenomenon. Therefore, in addition to the physiological process of pain, its subjective perception is also important, which is decided by the central nervous system. It consists of the emotional aspects: suffering and attitude towards pain and pain expression. A review of pain physiology is essential to fully understand the principles of pain management.",

      "abstract": "Capgras syndrome is a distressing delusion found in a variety of neurological and psychiatric diseases where a patient believes that a family member, friend, or loved one has been replaced by an imposter. Patients recognize the physical resemblance of a familiar acquaintance but feel that the identity of that person is no longer the same. Here we describe a 73-year-old male with right posterior frontal and bilateral anterior-medial frontal damage from prior brain trauma with a similar delusion of an imposter replacing his pet cat. Misidentification syndromes for animals, as opposed to humans, have been rarely reported. Neuropsychological testing showed deficits in executive processing and memory retrieval with prominent intrusions and false positive responses. The delusional belief content in Capgras syndrome has been hypothesized to result from loss of an emotional or autonomic response to familiar stimuli, from theory of mind deficits, or from loss of self-environment distinctions. We instead propose that Capgras delusions result from a dysfunction in linking external stimuli with retrieved internal autobiographical memories pertaining to that object. This leads to an erroneously learned identity that persists as a specific delusional belief.",

With no safe level of alcohol consumption found during pregnancy, symptoms at the severe end of the spectrum can be obvious, easily diagnosed and extremely debilitating; at the mild end of the spectrum the disabilities may be subtle, and often attributed to other causes. Common symptomatology in an individual with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders includes: attention problems, impulsivity, mood disorders, conduct and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms, drug and alcohol problems, impaired executive functioning, memory disturbances, learning disabilities, poor social skills and reduced ability to function independently as an adult. Because of the lack of widespread knowledge of this disorder by mental health providers, especially in the absence of mental retardation or dysmorphic features, individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are often not identified as having an organically based mental health, and/or cognitive disorder; thus reduces their ability to qualify for special support services found to improve long-term outcome. Despite the great need for neuropsychiatric treatment research that could lead to improved fetal alcohol spectrum disorders targeted multilevel mental health, and social support services, there is much the mental health professional can provide at this time to improve the lives of these individuals. Accordingly, the mental health community needs to be prepared, as the disorder becomes more widely recognized by affected patients and their families; they will be requesting formal diagnoses and sensitive, creative options to prenatal alcohol related problems in all areas of neuropsychiatric treatment.",

Like other rare disease patients, individuals with CHH/KS frequently experience feelings of isolation, shame and alienation. Unlike many rare diseases, CHH/KS is not life threatening and effective treatments are available. Nevertheless, it remains a profoundly life-altering condition with psychosocial distress on a par with untreatable or life-limiting disease. Patients with CHH/KS frequently express lasting adverse psychological, emotional, social and psychosexual effects resulting from disrupted puberty. They also frequently experience a ‘diagnostic odyssey’, characterized by distressing and convoluted medical referral pathways, lack-of-information, misinformation, and sometimes-incorrect diagnoses. Unnecessary delays in diagnosis and treatment-initiation can significantly contribute to poor body image and self-esteem. Such experiences can erode confidence and trust in medical professionals as well as undermine long-term adherence to treatment - with negative sequelae on health and wellbeing. This review provides a summary of the psychological aspects of CHH/KS and outlines an approach to comprehensive care that spans medical management as well as appropriate attention, care and referrals to peer-to-peer support and mental health services to ameliorate the psychological aspects of CHH/KS.",

Key risk factors for pathological bereavement outcomes can be identified on admission to palliative care, permitting preventive models of psychological care to be used through palliative care into bereavement. Models of therapy include supportive-expressive, interpersonal, cognitive behavioural, family focused, and specific therapy for complicated grief. Pharmacotherapy can judiciously accompany psychotherapy. Life-cycle issues include bereaved children, siblings, parents, and grief for the very elderly.

Etiology of the syndrome is not yet clear, post-viral and stress hypotheses were not verified. Diagnosis is confirmed in case of new onset of severe fatigue, for six consecutive months or more; fatigue is leading to significant reduction of the activity levels and is accompanied by other four or more of the specific associated symptoms, which are also lasting for six months or longer. The management of the disease is based on cognitive behavioral therapy, graded exercise therapy and pacing; medication plays a minor role in therapy.

      "title": "Vataja Unmada: Schizophrenia or Dementia or Mood Disorder with Psychosis?",
      "abstract": "Unmada (a broad term which includes different psychiatric conditions under one umbrella) is characterized by the derangement of manas (mind), buddhi (cognitive functions), samgna gnana (orientation), smriti (memory), bhakti (interests), sheela (character/personality), cheshtha (psychomotor activity/behavior), and achara (conduct). Unmada is classified into five (vataja, pittaja, kaphaja, sannipataja and agantuja) types, and \"Vataja Unmada\" (VU) is one among them. The description of VU is available in all major Ayurvedic classical texts, and it comes under \"Doshaja\" (psychiatric disorder which occurs due to the aggravation of doshas) category. Studies or scientific literature on VU has been lacking, and the present work is focused on to explore this condition. The etiopathology of VU denotes deficiency of various nutritional factors such as vitamins, minerals, omega-3-fatty acids, amino acids, and antioxidants. Lacking or deficiency of these nutritional factors leads to structural and/or functional damage and degeneration of the brain (neurodegenerative or demyelinating pathology) which ultimately leads to the manifestation of different degenerative psychiatric disorders. The clinical picture of VU resembles various psychiatric or neuropsychiatric conditions such as \"disorganized schizophrenia\" or \"hebephrenia\" or \"catatonia\" or \"dementia\" or \"bipolar disorder with psychotic features\" or \"mania with psychotic features,\" or \"organic or secondary psychoses.\" VU is a treatable condition, and it can be managed successfully by \"Panchakarma\" procedures along with internal medicines.",

So, in the realm of descriptive psychopathology and phenomenological diagnosis, dereistic thinking or animism, demands, first of all, exclusion of organic problems, like space occupying lesions of brain, and, then, ruling out psychosis, like schizophrenia. On the other hand, dereism can be found in neuroses or personality syndromes, a finding that may indicate its multidimensional connotation. In the present article, while dereism has been appraised from psychoanalytic and cognitive viewpoints, it has been tried to delineate some of its valuable aspects, as well, which may be ignored clinically during routine psychiatric evaluation, counseling or psychotherapeutic approaches.",

Individuals with dangerous misidentification delusions were more likely to experience grandiose ideation, thought disorder, generalized hostility, excitement, general psychopathology, and a previous history of violence than dangerous delusional individuals with no delusional misidentification.

      "title": "Depresija kao rizični čimbenik za školski uspjeh kod adolescenata",
      "abstract": "Depression is a condition of continuous low mood and loss of energy that affects a person’s thoughts, behaviour, feelings, and physical condition. It is a disease with a thousand faces and is one of the most common disorders nowadays. Although until recently depression was considered a disorder that affects adults and the elderly, research has shown that this disorder is increasingly occurring in children, adolescents, and younger people. Adolescence is a turbulent period in which psychosocial maturity is achieved, identity is formed, crises of earlier developmental stages are resolved. If crises are not adequately resolved, the action of hereditary or various psychological, emotional and social factors leads to the development of depression. Symptoms that manifest in a depressed adolescent can be of varying intensity, may be short-lived, and may be present throughout life. Depression most commonly occurs as a primary disorder, but it can also occur in combination with other psychological disorders. In adolescents, it carries a high risk of developing delinquent behaviour, substance abuse and alcohol abuse, school failure, and suicide attempt. Diagnosing depression in children and adolescents can be challenging due to the specificity of the clinical picture in relation to adults. Therefore, a team of experts participates in the diagnosis of depressive disorders, and an important role in the team is played by a subspecialist in child and adolescent psychiatry. The treatment of depression in children and adolescents aims to eliminate symptoms and achieve complete remission, prevent recurrence, alleviate long-term morbidity and create conditions for normal growth and development. The treatment requires a holistic and multimodal approach, which includes psychoeducation, psychotherapy and, if necessary, pharmacotherapy. With proper diagnosis, choice of treatment methods and the inevitable support of family and friends, depression can be cured. Since depression is a multifactorial disease, which leaves numerous consequences on the further physical and mental health of adolescents, the emphasis is on prevention. Risk and protection factors can be found in the school, family and social environment, which then means that prevention should also be multifactorial.",

Currently stress is a fairly important factor at the social level, since it manifests itself in people when it comes to having excessive or controlled loads that go beyond the capacities they suffer. Occupational stress can be the cause of many diseases, from physical health problems such as cardiovascular disorders, digestive system problems, and dermatological disorders, among others; to mental health problems, anxiety, depression, insomnia, Burnout syndrome and many more. All these pathologies experience that work stress is not an issue that should be ignored, overlooked, or even judged, since as was specifically the consequences of this situation that currently occurs in almost all people who carry out child labor.

Depression in three groups of medically ill, disabled patients (Parkinson's disease, right hemisphere stroke, and amputation) was studied. Mean depression severity and frequency of depression were equal for all groups. Severity of neurologic symptomatology was not consistently related to depression. Type of prosthesis, but not amputation type, was related to depression for amputees. Patterns of depression on discriminant analysis did differentiate the groups. A depression symptom conglomerate suggesting guilt and body image change with fatigue characterized the Parkinson patients most and the amputees least. A second depression conglomerate suggesting indecisiveness and thoughts of death or self-harm characterized amputees most and stroke patients least. Depression as an emotional response may not be a singular, specific feature of disabling illness in general, given uniformity of prevalence and severity, but differential etiology in specific instances should be considered.",

The social factors are critical for a successful adaptation, while emotions are means of both signaling the organism's state and of adapting the physiological responses to environmental challenges. Hence the importance of a biopsychosocial model of health and disease. Psychoemotional distress generates and/or amplifies somatic symptoms. Somatization may be viewed as an altered cognitive process, inclining the individual to an augmented perception of bodily sensations and to an increased degree of complexity in reporting negative experiences (hence the greater cognitive effort allocated thereto). Somatosensory amplification and alexithymia are key elements in this process. The brain's right hemisphere is more involved in the generation of emotionally conditioned somatization symptoms. Somatic symptoms have various psychological and social functions and are strongly influenced by the particular belief system of the individual. Inappropriately perceiving the environment as an aggressor and excessively responding to it (by activating the cytokine system in correlation with the arousal of the psychic, nervous, and endocrine systems) may be a key element in the altered cognition conducive to ill health.",

      "abstract": "• Evaluation of attentional and neuromotor functions in 45 patients meeting the Research Diagnostic Criteria for schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and other affective disorders showed that schizoaffectives could not be distinguished from patients with other affective disorders by any of the measures. However, schizophrenics differed from the other diagnostic groups on four measures: they showed significantly more oculomotor, stereognosis, and right-left identification abnormalities and more errors of omission on the attentional task under distraction conditions. The findings of this study are consistent with earlier reports that schizoaffectives are not greatly different from patients with other affective disorders in family history, treatment response, or long-term outcome. There is not yet sufficient etiologic or behavioral evidence to indicate that schizoaffective disorder is a valid diagnostic category.",

Psychologists consider personality a long‐term, relatively consistent phenomenon, but healthy individuals are able to adapt their personalities to the demands of various situations. The difference for people with personality disorders is that their behaviors lack flexibility and tend toward extremes that impair their ability to interact well with others, causing problems in their work and family relationships. For example, they may be exceedingly sensitive, hostile, suspicious, deceitful, self‐absorbed, or impulsive, depending on the type of personality disorder they have. Mental health professionals consider personality disorders to be some of the most difficult problems to treat, especially given that most people with these disorders lack insight into the role they play in their own interpersonal problems. Thus, people with personality disorders continually replay their complex dynamics and relational struggles in both their daily lives and in the therapeutic relationship.",

      "title": "Cytochrome p4502D6 and Serotonin Transporter Polymorphism in Patient with Bipolar Disorder Type II",
      "abstract": "IntroductionBipolar disorder (BD) is a complex psychiatric entity, which represents a diagnostic as well as a therapeutic challenge in clinical practice. The very definition and classification of BD is determined by a range of possible clinical presentations, which are sometimes difficult to distinguish from other psychiatric entities by means of a differential diagnosis, for example acute schizophrenic episode, schizoaffective disorder or psychotic depression. Furthermore, BD is frequently comorbid with other psychiatric disorders, especially substance abuse disorders, but also personality disorders or eating disorders, [1-4] which complicate the diagnosis and treatment further.BD can manifest itself for years with recurring depressive episodes before the first manic, hypomanic or mixed episode occurs. The depressive episode of the BD thus frequently remains unrecognised and misdiagnosed as a major depressive disorder (MDD), and therefore inadequately treated with antidepressant monotherapy. According to the current psychiatric classification DSM-V, BD is not diagnosed before an occurrence of a manic or hypomanic episode, while ICD-10 describes, besides a manic and hypomanic episode, a mixed episode in BD as well. [5,6] However, a clinician can consider bipolar depression based on clinical characteristic of depressive episodes. Disease onset before the age of 20, recurrent depressive episodes, which cause the person to be ill most of the time, failure to respond to antidepressants, severe psychomotor retardation, hypersomnia, increased appetite, presence of psychotic symptoms or suicidal ideations are frequently present in patients with bipolar depression. [7,8]Data on prevalence of mood disorders is significantly changing in the last decade. According to past epidemiological data, BD I is responsible for about 2% of prevalence among mood disorders, in the same percentage as BD II. MDD has been diagnosed in 86% of all patients with mood disorders, and non-specific mood disorder in 10% of the patients. Today, we believe that MDD represents 50 % of all mood disorders, BD I about 2%, BD II 15%, while 33% of mood disorders belong to a heterogeneous group of disorders from the bipolar spectrum. [9] Accordingly, it is necessary to adjust the pharmaco-therapeutic approach and introduce mood stabilizers to the treatment if BD or a disorder from the bipolar spectrum is suspected. Special attention should be paid to symptoms of the depressive episode, and all medical history data on patients with depression should be carefully analyzed for evidence of possible episodes of elevated mood in the past.Clinical research has shown that the individual therapeutic response to psychotropic drugs considerably varies, from tendency to develop side effects to therapeutic resistance. In the treatment of a depressive episode, about one third of the patients show no therapeutic response after an adequate therapeutic trial. [8] It is a well known fact the therapeutic response can be affected by different factors, such as the age of the patient, liver or kidney dysfunction, diet, smoking or excessive alcohol use. Recent research shows the lack of response to antidepressant treatment is associated with bipolar disorder, [10] and the association of other psychopathological phenomena with the lack of therapeutic response is also being investigated. However, it is believed that the genetic basis is of key importance for the variability of response to antidepressants. [11,12] Pharmacogenetics studies the influence of specific gene polymorphisms, which are responsible for the function of enzymes important in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.Biotransformation of most psychotropic drugs in the liver occurs via cytochrome P450 (CYP P450) superfamily, which consists of more than 50 different enzymes. CYP2D6 has an important role in biotransformation of a large number of antidepressants. [13,14] The gene that encodes the CYP2D6 is located at the locus 22q13. …",

In obsessive compulsive disorder, patient is compelled to think the opposite of what is said (Contrast thinking). Whether same type phenomenon can occur in affective domain- compulsion to express an opposite emotion to the existing situation has not been described in literature. This case report addresses the dilemma about phenomena and nomenclature regarding above experience. Aims and methods This case report is about a 28 year old unmarried male patient who reported experiencing emotions opposite to the prevailing external circumstances i.e, uncontrollable urge to laugh in sad situations, which occurred episodically since 15 years. It was very distressing to the patient and made him anxious & sad. There were no other obsessive compulsive phenomenon. He did not have any psychotic features like delusions, hallucinations, or thought disorder. There was no decline in functioning in any spheres of his life. Differentiating this experience from inappropriate affect occurring in schizophrenia can be difficult but is essential. A provisional diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with features of ‘Contrast emotion’ was made and patient was advised Cap. Fluoxetine 20mg OD. Results Patient did not adhere to the pharmacological regimen advised. He came for follow up once, when he reported one more similar episode. Conclusions Abnormalities in experience and expression of emotions have to be closely analysed to delineate the phenomenon as it can have diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",

Naturally, chronic pain can present occasions when patients feel misunderstood or mistreated, feel threatened by poor health, experience interference with normal daily functioning, take medications that can produce side effects, and experience depression and anxiety. When chronic pain leads to painful emotions, memories, and other unwanted experiences, the pain sufferer will naturally attempt to avoid these as well. On the level of human experience, chronic pain brings loss, threats, uncertainty, restraint, apparent mistreatment, and failure into the lives of those who suffer with it. Chronic pain is possibly not best understood as a symptom or condition of the body that results in effects on the person and their functioning. The behavior of the individual pain sufferer, interacting with and in a broader psychological context, is an indivisible whole.",

En más del 50% de los casos las lesiones se presentan en cabeza, cara y cuello. Es por eso que el odontólogo y especialmente el odontopediatra deben estar preparados para reconocer alguna forma de maltrato o negligencia con base en una historia clínica adecuada y una exploración intencionada ante la sospecha de síndrome de niño maltratado. Objetivo: Conocer los indicadores intraorales y extraorales que le permitan al odontopediatra reconocer los signos y contribuir en el diagnóstico como parte de un equipo multidisciplinario encargado de la atención de estos pacientes. Caso clínico: Paciente masculino de dos años cinco meses quien acude al Servicio de Urgencias del Instituto Nacional de Pediatría por presentar edema periorbitario, múltiples fracturas en extremidades e indicadores orofaciales que permitieron diagnosticar síndrome de niño maltratado. Conclusión: Considerando la frecuencia con que las estructuras orofaciales se ven involucradas en el síndrome de niño maltratado, existe un compromiso médico, ético y legal para que todos los dentistas y específicamente los odontopediatras intervengan en la prevención, detección, diagnóstico y tratamiento de este problema médico social.",

People become mentally ill, insane, or psychotic and a few such individuals in a society can destroy its fabric. People can become addicted to drugs. They can ruin their lives, and their habits create an underworld willing and able to exploit them. Some people become alcoholics. The chapter discusses about schizophrenia disorder. The primary characteristic of schizophrenia is the impairment of logical thought processes. Speech is often bizarre and confused, reflecting a disturbed mind. Thoughts that are usually only remotely connected emerge together in speech (loose associations), and in extreme cases speech may be completely incomprehensible. Depression is another behavioral disorder. It is diagnosed as being either primarily endogenous or exogenous. The endogenous form of depression refers to severe depression that occurs in the absence of any identifiable external source; the exogenous form of depression results from external stresses.",

      "title": "A Comparative Analysis of Psychiatric Profile, Depression andBody Dysmorphic Disorder in patients with Amputation and PostStroke.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nAmputation is defined as the removal of extremities of body part by trauma or by\r\nSurgical procedure. Amputees may feel empty, and mutilated. Amputation due to\r\nTrauma is a catastrophic injury and causes major disability in most of the cases\r\n(Wald 2004)1. Loss of limb is associated with low self-esteem, body image\r\nDisturbance, social isolation and also a sense of stigmatization (William et al.\r\n2004). In many conditions amputation is unavoidable. Irrespective of the aetiology,\r\nAmputation is considered as a mutilating surgery and it definitely affects the lives\r\nOf the patients (De Godoy et al. 2002). Limb amputation is a more commonly\r\nOccurring event in the present society.\r\nThe loss of a limb distorts the individual’s body image leading to the thought of\r\nNot being a complete human being. The loss of the functions performed with that\r\nLimb renders him helpless for sometime. The amputee not only loses physical\r\nFunctioning, he also loses hope and future aspirations, his plans and ambitions get\r\nShattered. Thus, he loses not only a limb but also a part of his world and future.\r\nMost of them remain anxious and worried about their interpersonal relationship in\r\nThe social, vocational, familial and marital milieu. Individuals having an overt\r\nMental breakdown will need active psychiatric intervention whereas careful\r\nPsychiatric interview is necessary for the ones whose mental symptoms are not so\r\nObvious.\r\nLimb loss is a major event that can severely impact the psychological health of the\r\nIndividual concerned. Studies show that 20-60% of the amputees attending follow\r\nUp clinics are assessed to be clinically depressed. Individuals with traumatic\r\nAmputation irrespective of the age are likely to suffer from body image problems,\r\nBut these findings are more common in younger individuals. The psychological\r\nReactions to amputation are clearly diverse ranging from severe disability at one\r\nExtreme; and a determination to effectively resume a full and active life at other\r\nEnd. In adults the age at which an individual receives the amputation is an\r\nImportant factor. Studies by Bradway JK et al (1984)2, Kohl SJ Et al (1984)3,\r\nLivneh H (1999)4, on the psycho-social adaptation to amputation has led to a\r\nPlethora of clinical and empirical findings. Kingdon D et al 1982 equated\r\nAmputation with loss of one’s perception of wholeness, while (Parkes CM 1976)5\r\nWith loss of spouse and (Block WE et al (1963)6 with symbolic castration & even\r\nDeath. The individual’s response to a traumatic event is influenced by personality\r\nTraits, pre-morbid psychological state, gender, peri-traumatic dissociation,\r\nProlonged disability of traumatic events, lack of social support and inadequate\r\nCoping strategies. Previous studies on amputation mainly focused on demographic\r\nProfile, coping skills and outcome; with there being a scarcity of literature on\r\nPrevalence of various specific psychiatric disorders in the post-amputation period.\r\nMost patients with a limb loss irrespective of whether due to traumatic injury or\r\nSurgical procedures go through a series of complex psychological reactions\r\nReported by Cansever et al (2003)8. Most people try to cope with it, those who\r\nDon’t succeed develop psychiatric symptoms Frank et al (1984)7. Shukla et\r\nAl9 noted that psychological intervention in some form is needed in about 50% of\r\nAll amputees, and Shukla et al9 reported depression to be the most common\r\nPsychological reaction following amputation.\r\nThe three major problems faced by many amputees are anxiety, depression and\r\nPhysical disability (Green 2007)\r\nHorgan & maclachlan (2004)10 found that anxiety is associated with depression,\r\nLow self esteem, poorer quality of life and higher level of general anxiety. Both\r\nAnxiety and depression are associated with higher disability as age increases.\r\nBody image is the combination of psychosocial adjustment and attitude of the\r\nIndividual that are related to the function and appearance of one’s own body which\r\nCan be influenced by the individual and his environmental factors (Horgan &\r\nMaclachlan 2004)10. Each person has an idealized body image, which he uses for\r\nMeasuring perceptions and concepts of his or her own body (Fishman, 1959)11.\r\nFrom another perspective, Flannery & Faria (1999) body image is viewed as a\r\nDynamic, changing phenomenon occurring in a person and it is formed by the\r\nConstantly changing perceptions about his body. According to Newell (1991)13,\r\nAttractive people after amputation will receive less reinforcement from others\r\nLeading to low self-esteem and reduced positive self-image. Jacobsen et al (1997)\r\nSupports this stating i.e. Amputation leads to disfigurement which in turn leads to a\r\nNegative body image and greater loss of social acceptance. The relationship\r\nBetween disability experience and stigma are interwoven and inter-dependent. The\r\nReason for the amputee’s subjective perception of being unfit for the society\r\nProbably is that body image provides a sense of ‘’self’ ’and also affects the\r\nPersons thinking (Wald 2004)1. According to Kolb (1975)14, changes in body\r\nImage may cause series of psychological reactions.\r\nThe psychiatric aspect of amputation has received scant interest in our country, in\r\nSpite of accidental injuries being common (Shukla et al., 1982)9. The commonest\r\nPsychiatric disorder seen in amputees is major depression. Randall et al. (1945)15\r\nHave reported an incidence of 61 % in non-battle casualties, while Shukla et al.\r\n(1982)9 found depressive neurosis (40%) and psychiatric depression (22%) to be\r\nThe leading psychiatric disorders in amputees; only 35% of the total sample in the\r\nLater study had nil psychiatric disorders. The paucity of literature in this field has\r\nPrompted us to study about amputation and its co morbid psychiatric conditions so\r\nThat proper care & management for the patients can be planned. The present study\r\nWas undertaken with the aim of studying the psychiatric problems especially\r\nAnxiety, depression and Body Dysmorphic Disorder which may be associated with\r\nDisability or changed life circumstances in the immediate post-amputation period.\r\nA comparison was made with Stroke patients, as these patients often experience\r\nPhysical and social handicaps similar to amputees.\r\nDepression is the most common mood disorder to follow stroke (Starkstein &\r\nRobinson, 1989), with major depression affecting around one quarter to one third\r\nOf patients (Hackett16)..\r\nDepression hampers functional recovery in a post stroke individual. In Diagnostic\r\nAnd statistical manual (DSM) IV Post Stroke Depression classified under “mood\r\nDisorder due to general medical condition (i.e. Stroke)” with the specific depressive\r\nFeatures, major depressive-like episodes, manic features or mixed features. Studies\r\nDescribe that cerebral ischemia is associated with two types of depressive disorder.\r\nIncidence of major and minor depression is 25% and 30% respectively. Prevalence\r\nMay vary over time with an apparent peak 3months after the stroke and\r\nSubsequently decline in prevalence at 1 year. Robinson and colleagues studies\r\nShowed a spontaneous remission in the natural course of major depression\r\nOccurring post stroke in the first to second year following stroke. However in few\r\nCases depression may become chronic and persist for a longer period.\r\nWhile some propose that post stroke depression is due to stroke affecting the\r\nNeural circuits concerned with mood regulation (thereby supporting a primary\r\nBiological mechanism), others in the scientific community claim it to be due to the\r\nEnsuing psycho-social stressors occurring as a result of stroke. Though an\r\nIntegrated bio- psycho- social model is warranted, most studies clearly suggest\r\nBiological mechanism to have an upper hand in the later post stroke period than in\r\nThe immediate phase.\r\nIn the same way Anxiety is also common in post stroke individuals with the\r\nIncidence rate being 20%, and it is most common in first three to four months after\r\nThe stroke.\r\nStudies and literatures on post stroke anxiety are very few still remain in its\r\nInfancy. Studies have concentrated on socio-demographic variables, cognitive\r\nFunctions and laterality as examined for post stroke depression. Many studies show\r\nThat there is correlation between anxiety and right hemisphere lesions and also that\r\nCo-morbid post stroke anxiety and depression are associated with left hemisphere\r\nLesions [Astrom, (1996)17]. Many studies have shown the relationship between post\r\nStroke anxiety, age and gender. Women and younger individuals are more\r\nVulnerable to develop post stroke anxiety (Morrison, walter et al 200069), while\r\nAnother study reports no such relationship (Schultz et al).19",

      "abstract": "Psychogenic epidemics cover various forms of collective behavior and include mass hysteria, mass psychogenic illness, and hysterical contagion for which no physical explanation can be found. The typical course of a psychogenic epidemic at a workplace progresses from sudden onset, often with dramatic symptoms, to a rapidly attained peak that draws much publicity and is followed by quick disappearance of the symptoms. Over 90% of the affected persons are women, and the symptoms range from dizziness, vomiting, nausea, and fainting to epileptic-type seizures, hyperventilation, and skin disorders. The background mechanisms are thought to be generalized beliefs and triggering events which create a sense of threat that leads to a physiological state of arousal. This state, in turn, creates new beliefs which give meaning to the sense of arousal. The new belief spreads through sociometric channels. Predisposing factors include boredom, pressure to produce, physical stressors, poor labor-management relations, and impaired interpersonal communications, and lack of social support. It is important that a thorough investigation be carried out in all instances. Investigation is not only necessary for diagnosis, but it also reassures the management, the employees, and the press that physical factors are unlikely to be responsible for the disease.",

      "title": "ALEXITHYMIA IN HEALTHY PEOPLE AND ITS ROLE IN DEVELOPMENT OF DIFFERENT DISORDERS",
      "abstract": "The reduced ability or difficulty to express verbally, to name one’s own emotional states or feelings of other people, is commonly called alexithymia. Currently, studies are being conducted in which they ascertain whether alexithymia is a specific property of a person or whether it can only predispose to psychosomatic diseases, being their predictor. Some researchers believe that alexithymia itself is not a disease and is a series of characteristics characteristic of certain individuals. Alexithymia is clearly expressed in the personality structure of patients with cardiovascular diseases and represents a separate factor in this structure. In general, studies show that patients with alexithymia are hypersensitive to both internal somatic unpleasant sensations and external pain stimuli, but they cannot describe the differences between different types of pain. Alexithymia can be considered as one of the premorbid personality factors that reduce the compensatory psychological defense capabilities in lucid alcoholism. Alexithymia is found in many drug addicts. Instead of simply getting rid of painful, intolerable, or overwhelming feelings, people who abuse chemicals can use them to control affects, especially when these affects are hard to grasp, distinguish, and give them a name. At the same time, the differences in the manifestations of alexithymia in alcohol and drug addiction, including its influence on the development of addictive behavior, are not well understood. The study of alexithymia is a topical issue of modern psychiatry and narcology, which allows us to apply a personified approach to the patient and to improve modern therapeutic and rehabilitation measures.",

The medical profession becomes itself maltreating by scheduling more and more invasive additional examinations and the mortality would be 5%. The disease by proxy questions the clinicians in front of its unusual form and its absence of anatomo-clinical parallelism: the symptoms most frequently presented are sleep apneas and convulsions. If all somatic symptoms were described, forms of artificial disorder by proxy with psychiatric expression are underestimated. After a review of the literature on the syndrome of Münchhausen by proxy on one hand and its psychiatric expression on the other hand, we shall explain a clinical case illustrating this atypical presentation. The diagnostic of factitious disorder by proxy and its psychiatric expression is very complex. The child can present an authentic psychiatric disorder establishing a differential or tangled diagnosis. This victim can develop psychological aftereffects of this child abuse like behavioural problems. The child can even secondly participate to the presentation of the symptoms in a morbid alliance with the simulated parent. We shall return on diagnostic and therapeutic measures of care to offer to the maltreated child but also to the parent too, whose psychopathological determiners will be useful to clarify.",

      "title": "Chronic Pain, Psychopathology, and DSM-5 Somatic Symptom Disorder",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor:\r\n\r\nThe neurophysiological mechanisms and comorbidities of anxiety and depression with chronic pain cited by the authors1 serve as evidence of correlation, not causality. When A (neurophysiological mechanism) and B (symptom of chronic pain) occur together, it cannot be concluded that A causes B, because it could just as well be that B causes A, or a third factor causes both. Regarding the comorbidity of chronic pain with anxiety or depression, it could be that these forms of psychological distress result from chronic pain due to physical impairment, that the pain is a symptomatic expression of anxiety or depression, or that underlying psychosocial issues are causing both. A mentor of mine used to say, “You can’t have a bad thought without a bad molecule, and you don’t know which comes first,” and this paper proves that adage.\r\n\r\nWhen a symptom or condition is diagnosed as psychosomatic, this should not be done solely by exclusion, that is, lack of objective medical evidence. There should be positive substantiation through identification of psychological factors that provide an understanding of what is going on in the life of the patient. The ability to at least ballpark such situations should be in the therapeutic armamentarium of every physician, while psychiatrists should be able to provide biopsychosocial formulations as a core skill. By doing so, we help our patients by empowering them to deal with real life problems, as opposed to placing them in a position of passivity as recipients of a medical solution. Problems occur when psychosomatic diagnoses are communicated poorly, such as “There’s nothing really wrong with you” or “It’s all in your head,” and when patients are not ready to assume psychological ownership of personal problems. Either of these can result in demonization of physicians who make such diagnoses, in the former case justifiably, not so the latter.\r\n\r\nCase in point: the diagnosis of tension headaches seems to have disappeared from the medical lexicon, because everyone has migraines. Despite their potential severity, tension headaches are not seen as medical enough, place an onus on patients to deal with whatever source of tension is causing the headaches, and places physicians who make this diagnosis at risk of demonization for allegedly blaming patients and minimizing their suffering. By contrast, the diagnosis of migraine is perceived as more validating and more supportive, leading to a proliferation of migraine diagnoses and treatments.\r\n\r\nJust as the failure to make a medical diagnosis can have serious consequences in patients with chronic pain and other medically unexplained symptoms, so, too, can the neglect of a psychosomatic diagnosis, in terms of extensive and fruitless investigations and consultations, iatrogenic complications of questionable treatments, and reinforcement of illness–disabled role issues at the expense of dealing with real problems. The mind is more than the sum of the neurochemical parts of the brain, and the failure to recognize this places us at risk of falling into a mindless brand of psychiatry.2",

      "abstract": "Sensory impairment is defined as the inability to interpret outside stimuli such as visual, auditory, verbal, sense of touch, taste or smell or feelings of pain. This leads to absence of sensation and neuronal coordination. The impairment may be caused by ageing and other physiological changes, accident or injuries or can be found in some cases of mental retardation (MR) also referred to as intellectual disability. Known cases of MR involving inability to accurately interpret an outside source or stimuli are: Fragile-X syndrome; Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) with associated autism spectrum disorder (ASD); Rett syndrome; Autism and ASD with or without MR; Chromosome 22q13.3 deletion syndrome; familial dysautonomia, Prader-Willi's syndrome, Williams syndrome. In this review we will discuss in particular form of ASD and altered sensory sensitivity. The role of NGF in causing pronociceptive activity and its role in peripheral sensitisation is discussed under the light of its involvement in forms of MR where loss of pain perception is a main feature due to mutations to NGF receptors or NGF genes during development. Other forms of MR with altered sensory impairment will be considered as well as additional potential mechanisms involved.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder is a form of anxiety disorder which is poorly known in children and manifests as a series of symptoms occurring after an extraordinary event outside the range of usual human experiences and responsible for a feeling of terror. Virtually pathogmonic symptoms include re-experiencing the event through play and ceaselessly repeated behaviors (re-enactments), cognitive distortions when relating the facts (chronological errors, belief in omens), changes in attitudes towards others and life in general, and neurovegetative hyperactivity (hypervigilance, startle responses, difficulties controlling impulses). Although adequate follow-up data are lacking, the disorder can probably become chronic in children, as in adults. This nosographic entity raises the theoretical issue of the roles of life events and individual vulnerability. A number of factors may either \"predispose\" or \"protect\" the child: degree and duration of exposure to the trauma, nature of the event, preexistence of psychiatric disorders, level of cognitive development, sex, degree of social support, and containing or noncontaining attitude of the family. Treatments advocated in adults (pharmacotherapy, cognitive and behavioral therapies, group therapy) remain to be used and evaluated in children.",

Suicide may be the end-point of a number of different contributing factors. It is more likely to occur during crisis periods associated with upheavals in personal relationships, through alcohol and drug abuse, unemployment, clinical depression and other forms of mental illness. Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population. However, the number of suicides in certain countries may be under-reported because of the stigma that is associated with the act, or because of data issues associated with reporting criteria (see Definition and comparability).",

Autobiographical amnesia, loss of insight and executive dysfunctions are the major reasons of vulnerable \"self\" in FTD. Mind representation deficits, decrease of perception of emotions and semantic amnesia contribute to reduced recognition of the relative's identity. Alterations of body expressions, social disinhibition, changes in social and religious values decrease the recognition of patient's identity by the relatives. Different psychological components of identity are modified by the FTD such as feeling of unity, of consistency, of temporality and of affiliation. The fact that brain lesions of FTD are focalized can contribute to understand the biological knowledge of \"identity\".

Si bien sabemos que la causa de la enfermedad es una afectacion cerebral, se desconoce, no solo la etiologia de dicha afectacion, sino el momento en que esta sucede, su posterior evolucion y los factores pronosticos. Una de las manifestaciones de esta afectacion cerebral, es el deterioro cognitivo. El deterioro cognitivo propio de la esquizofrenia se ha demostrado que no es difuso o generalizado, sino que afecta de forma diferencial y especifica a la atencion, memoria de trabajo, memoria y funciones ejecutivas, si bien es cierto que otras funciones que dependen del optimo funcionamiento de estas, van a verse secundariamente afectadas. Asi mismo, la literatura avala la asociacion de la gravedad de la afectacion cognitiva a la mayor presencia de sintomas negativos y a un peor desempeno social y laboral. El deficit cognitivo inherente a la enfermedad se ha podido observar tambien en familiares sanos de personas con esquizofrenia y en poblaciones de riesgo para desarrollar psicosis, por lo que determinados deficits cognitivos han sido conceptualizados como marcadores endofenotipicos de vulnerabilidad a la esquizofrenia. Una de las cuestiones aun sin resolver en relacion con el deterioro cognitivo en la esquizofrenia, es su evolucion a lo largo del desarrollo de la enfermedad, habiendose planteado como hipotesis alternativas, que su evolucion es estatica, o que sigue un curso de deterioro, lento, pero progresivo. Para tratar de responder a esta cuestion, se ha realizado un estudio de diseno transversal, con una muestra de 22 pacientes con una evolucion de la enfermedad entre uno y cinco anos, y 21 pacientes con diez o mas anos de evolucion de la enfermedad.",

      "title": "The frailty process: update of the phenotype and preventive strategies",
      "abstract": "Frailty has long been considered synonymous with disability and co-morbidity, to be highly prevalent in old age and to confer high risk for falls, hospitalization, and mortality. However it is becoming recognized that frailty may be a distinct clinical syndrome with a biologic basis. The frailty process appears as a transitional state in the dynamic progression from robustness through to functional decline. During this process, total physiological reserves decrease, and become less likely to be sufficient to maintain and repair the ageing body. The lack of consensus on the definition of frailty is partially related to the widespread use of the expression for different aspects of the condition. Longitudinal studies have demonstrated that slow gait, fatigue, exhaustion, anorexia, unintentional weight loss and reduced muscle strength should all be considered as major symptoms of frailty. At the stage of frailty, clinicians can easily distinguish frail from non-frail older adults using factors such as appearance (consistent or not with age), nutritional status (thin, weight loss), subjective health rating (health perception), performance (cognition, fatigue), sensory/physical impairments (vision, hearing, strength), and current care (medication, hospital). The process of “becoming frail” is silent and insidious. A better understanding of these clinical changes and their underlying mechanisms, beginning with the pre-frail state, may confirm the impression held by many geriatricians, that increasing frailty is distinguishable from ageing, and in consequence is potentially reversible. We therefore provide an update of the physiopathology and clinical, and biological characteristics of the frailty process, and speculate on possible preventive approaches.",

      "abstract": "Brief psychotic disorder is a sudden onset of psychosis in a patient for a duration of more than a day and less than a month. The DSM-5 defines brief psychotic disorder as a psychotic condition involving the sudden onset of at least one psychotic symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thought processes, disorganized speech and/or behaviors. This condition can also be associated with impaired memory of recent events, screaming, mutism, outlandish dressing, or behaviors. Acute psychotic symptoms can be associated with emotional lability often triggered by substance abuse or severe and acute stress such as the loss of a loved one. Patients ultimately receive the diagnosis of schizophrenia if the symptoms persist for a duration longer than six months. Brief psychotic disorder is often diagnosed in teenage patients, but it is less commonly seen in the females. Although the exact pathophysiology of brief psychotic disorder has not been determined, historically and similarly to schizophrenia it has been strongly linked to familial history. In some cases, it has been preceded by a traumatic and stressful event. Brief psychotic disorder has also been theorized to be the cause of maladaptive defense mechanism to escape a stressor. In this case report, we present a fifteen-year-old female patient who abruptly lost her mother to COVID-19, her adaptation few months following the loss and her eventual reactive psychosis as well as management challenges.",

      "abstract": "Psychosis is a symptom complex that may include hallucinations, delusions, disorders of thought, and disorganized speech or behavior. Acute psychosis is primary if it is symptomatic of a psychiatric disorder, or secondary if caused by a specific medical condition. Patients with primary psychiatric disorders are likely to have auditory hallucinations, prominent cognitive disorders, and complicated delusions. If psychosis is caused by a medical condition, the patient may exhibit cognitive changes and abnormal vital signs, and may have visual hallucinations. Illicit drug use is the most common medical cause of acute psychosis. Clinicians should ask about recent head injury or trauma, seizures, cerebrovascular disease, or new or worsening headaches. A subacute onset of psychosis should raise suspicion for an oncologic cause. Collateral history from family members is helpful in establishing the presentation and course of the illness. The physical examination should include complete neurologic and mental status assessments. Tachycardia or severe hypertension may indicate drug toxicity or thyrotoxicosis; fever may suggest encephalitis or porphyria. Suggested initial laboratory tests include a complete blood count, metabolic profile, thyroid function tests, urine toxicology, and measurement of parathyroid hormone, calcium, vitamin B12, folate, and niacin. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus infection and syphilis should also be considered. Prompt recognition of the etiology of psychosis may improve treatment, consultation, and prognosis.",

      "title": "Dysphoria from a Transnosological Perspective",
      "abstract": "The objective of our psychopathological analyses is to shed light on the position of irritable mood (dysphoria) in psychiatric diagnostics and nosology. In today's most commonly applied classification systems, the ICD-10 and the DSM-IV, dysphoria is mentioned mostly in the context of diagnostic criteria of personality and affective disorders. Other authors have emphasized the importance of dysphoric states in organic psychoses and delusional disorders. Summarizing the various publications on the nosological position, dysphoria is a nosological nonspecific syndrome which may occur in the course of all psychiatric disorders and illnesses. According to the results of our psychopathological analyses, the pathogenesis of dysphoria has to be considered as a multidimensional circular process in which various mental, physical and social factors act as predisposing, triggering and disorder-maintaining factors. Stressors induced by particular experiences and perceptions and by impaired health may lead to a dysphoric state if adequate coping mechanisms are missing. Dysphoria itself usually leads to a deterioration in the mental and physical state of the patient, and shows a clear impact on the patient's social network. The reactions of people close to the patient combined with the impaired mental and physical conditions of the patient cause the circle to restart. As contemporary diagnostic entities do not refer to pathogenesis, classical categorical diagnostics cannot provide the basis for effective pathogenesis-oriented therapy. A change of paradigm in diagnostics from a categorical to a dimensional approach thus becomes necessary. Following a dimensional diagnostic approach based on a dynamic model of vulnerability, a precise differential diagnosis of the complex constellation of conditions and their interactions becomes necessary in order to develop effective treatment strategies. Disorder-maintaining factors determine the treatment of the acute symptomatology, whereas predisposing and triggering factors serve as the basis for the prophylactic treatment.",

      "abstract": "Physicians at times are confronted with patients who present with vague yet disabling, nonprogressive symptoms for which they can offer no concrete medical explanation despite extensive evaluation. Many individuals who present with abdominal complaints, musculoskeletal pain, headaches, fatigue, dizziness, and other symptoms and/or their families believe that an undiscovered anatomic or biochemical aberration explains their symptoms despite having been informed that the symptoms may represent a “functional disorder.”1 They have difficulty believing that relatively common disorders such as functional abdominal pain,2 fibromyalgia,3 and chronic daily headache can cause the incapacitating symptoms that they or their children are experiencing. Their belief that a more specific “organic” explanation exists is rooted in the medical model, which implies that there is a specific cause for most symptoms that, when identified, will offer a path to cure.4 The faith in this conviction is reinforced by reports of miraculous cures in the press, in medical dramas on television, and by material on the Internet that allows patients to search for uncurated information that might explain their symptoms and communicate with others confronting similar issues. Pediatricians may be particularly vulnerable to experiencing this phenomenon because of intense parental desire for a diagnosis that captures the symptoms that their child is experiencing.5 As a result, many individuals believe that the solution to their or their child’s suffering exists around the next investigative corner, and they bring this expectation to each physician encounter. Unfortunately, at the end of these visits, if no organic diagnosis emerges, patients are often disappointed and unsatisfied and physicians are often frustrated.\n\nWe perceive that physicians generally tend to fall into 1 of … \n\nAddress correspondence to Neil L.

      "abstract": "Article AbstractNumerous psychiatric disorders are hypothetically linked to a vulnerable genome that can trigger illness when meeting adverse environmental experiences. Some disorders may be more highly biologically endowed, such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, whereas others may be more strongly linked to environmental exposure, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders, medical and cardiac complications of stress, substance abuse, and chronic pain. Currently, our therapeutic approach to psychiatric disorders is largely to wait until symptoms are overtly expressed and, once symptoms interfere with social or occupational functioning, to treat them, usually reducing but not removing symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In general medical patients, the physical examination typically comprises hypothesis-testing driven by the chief complaint and medical history, and screening for physical signs. A physical examination conducted by a medical psychiatrist can narrow a differential diagnosis and can search for physical symptoms that create functional impairment; quantify the severity of a known physical condition; help determine the emotional impact on the patient; enhance positive transference; and stimulate communication among other specialists. The 4 major types of physical examinations that are administered by medical psychiatrists are screening for medical diseases, investigating poorly explained symptoms, assessing status of a known disease, and a functionally focused examination. The neurological examination is used to detect deviations from normal function, to test hypotheses, and to measure the severity of a condition. This chapter details the essentials of both physical and neurological examinations which can help exclude conditions and diagnoses and determine the root causes of any distress or impairments.",

      "abstract": "Sexual sadistic and masochistic disorders fall into the paraphilic disorders according to the DSM-5 classification. Paraphilic disorders are defined as persistent, intense and atypical forms of sexual excitement that appear with clinically significant functional impairment. The original clinical use of the terms sadism and masochism was to describe the sexual perversions of attaining sexual pleasure by hurting or being hurt. These terms have been usefully expanded to mean emotional sadism and masochism: experiencing emotional satisfaction or comfort due to exercising power over another or submitting to another’s power. This disorder begins at an early age and most sadists and masochists are actually satisfied with their unconventional sexual activity. Personality disorders are divided into three groups: A, B, and C, based on descriptive similarities. Group B in the classification of personality disorder is composed of an antisocial, histrionic, borderline and narcissistic personality disorder. People who fall into this group are characterized by impulsiveness and emotional instability, in their behavior they are dramatic and mischievous. Unlike true love, falling in love by itself is not a conscious choice nor a willing act. Love constitutes a voluntary act with which spritiual growth and maturity of ourselves and others is achieved. Similarly, love is action, not a feeling. In every long-lasting romantic relationship, including sadomasochistic ones, mutual respect and paying atttention play a major role.",

Depressive illnesses are amenable to treatment by both pharmacological and psychological means.

These may include organic aggressive, or organic affective syndromes that are episodic in nature and therefore require a more specific diagnosis, a different classification, and a different approach to treatment. Consequently, it is necessary for clinicians to learn to distinguish between \"primary\" psychiatric illnesses and those disorders of behavioural control and mood that stem specifically from brain injury. There is relatively little in the clinical literature that explains the relationship between variable states of behaviour, mood or temperament, and clinical disorders that may have long-term implications for patient management. This concept paper therefore addresses abnormalities of mood and behaviour that are episodic in character and are not recognisably included in the DSM and ICD classifications of psychological or psychiatric disorders.",

Some clinicians speak, as it were, of a return to instinctive, i.e., emotional and even reflex life; others attribute the disorder to suggestibility, explaining the entire behaviour of hysterical persons and the so-called stigmata of hysteria (analgesia, paralyses, etc.) by suggestion and autosuggestion. In this chapter Pavlov makes a deep physiological analysis of all the most characteristic symptoms of hysteria, the acute hysterical reactions, as well as the hysterical traits of the personality. He offers a physiological explanation of hysterical nosophilia, the so-called \"escape into disease\" of the hysteriacs not infrequently superficially interpreted as manifestation of simulation. According to Pavlov, this presumably deliberate behaviour of hysteriacs is determined by conditioned reflexes and is a case of fatal physiological relations.",

      "title": "Desarrollo y validación de un serious game para sensibilizar a los jóvenes sobre los problemas de salud mental.",
      "abstract": "La acuciante problematica social que supone el estigma relativo a la Salud Mental, y las negativas repercusiones directas e indirectas que se derivan del mismo demandan el desarrollo de intervenciones eficaces que consigan minimizar en la medida de lo posible las devastadoras consecuencias a todos los niveles para quienes lo padecen. De entre todos los trastornos psicologicos, la esquizofrenia es el que presenta una mayor carga estigmatizante, por diversos factores, como las representaciones distorsionadas de la cultura popular cercanas a la imagen tradicional de locura, el sensacionalismo de la prensa que presenta una imagen dramatizada o violenta de las personas que la padecen, o lo llamativo y aparatoso de la sintomatologia, asi como, los efectos secundarios de la medicacion. Todo esto se traduce en diferentes manifestaciones como miedo, rechazo o verguenza, que desembocan en condiciones de desigualdad para estas personas que ademas de hacer frente a la sintomatologia, deben padecer los efectos que se derivan del estigma, de caracter refractario a la intervencion.\n En el caso de la poblacion adolescente o joven, la investigacion sobre el estigma no es muy abundante, esta llena de contradicciones y ademas no esta exenta de carencias metodologicas. En este sentido, es por tanto conveniente ahondar en este tipo de estudios dado que en estas edades comienzan a manifestarse muchos trastornos psicologicos, ademas de ser el periodo de formacion y consolidacion de las creencias, por lo que son particularmente susceptibles a las actividades de sensibilizacion y lucha antiestigma.\n Asimismo, una vez conocidos los multiples beneficios que supone la integracion de las nuevas tecnologias como herramienta de intervencion y mas concretamente el uso de videojuegos en este tipo de poblacion, se desarrollo un “Serious Game”, esto es, un videojuego que ademas de entretener pretende educar sobre algun aspecto tematico, con el objetivo de sensibilizar contra el estigma en Salud Mental. Disenado por un equipo interdisciplinar de psicologos, educadores e informaticos, Stigma-Stop, presenta cuatro personajes con diferentes trastornos psicologicos (trastorno de panico con agorafobia, depresion, trastorno bipolar y esquizofrenia). El jugador debera interactuar con los cuatro para conseguir un objetivo comun, como es disenar un videojuego con las aportaciones de estos personajes. A medida que va progresando el juego, se van conociendo las caracteristicas de los personajes, asi como diferentes estrategias de actuacion, rompiendo de este modo con mitos y creencias erroneas. El objetivo de la tesis es comprobar la validez del mismo en la disminucion del estigma, concretamente en el caso de la esquizofrenia, evaluada esta a traves del Cuestionario de Actitudes de los Estudiantes hacia la Esquizofrenia (CAEE, Schulze et al., 2003).\n En un primer estudio se comprobo la idoneidad de adaptar este cuestionario al castellano aplicandose en poblacion espanola, encontrandose tras examinar los resultados que las propiedades psicometricas eran adecuadas y que se mantenia la estructura original bifactorial (prejuicios y distancia social), aunque con ligeras variaciones en cuanto al contenido de los mismos. Asi, en la version castellana el primer factor haria referencia al miedo o temor hacia las personas con esquizofrenia, mientras que el segundo de los factores se refiere a estereotipos. En estudios posteriores se utilizo esta herramienta para cuantificar el estigma en la linea base y tras una intervencion basada en la aplicacion de Stigma-Stop en estudiantes universitarios de diferentes titulaciones con una clara orientacion social (Magisterio de Educacion Infantil, Trabajo Social, Psicologia, Educacion Especial y Educacion Social). De este modo, se genero un perfil del estigma para estos estudiantes que podria esclarecer los efectos de la formacion academica en la tematica en el estigma.\n Dado que en todos los casos los resultados fueron favorables, se decidio aplicarlo a la poblacion diana para la que se diseno el videojuego, en este caso, 412 alumnos de ensenanzas medias y universitarias, pertenecientes a diferentes centros educativos de la provincia de Almeria, asi como de la Universidad de Almeria. Los resultados se compararon con un grupo control equivalente de 118 participantes. Se decidio que los dos grupos no tuvieran el mismo numero de participantes con la intencion de que se beneficiaran de los supuestos posibles efectos positivos de la intervencion el mayor numero de participantes posible.\n Del mismo modo, en un estudio posterior se comparo la eficacia de Stigma-Stop con otras intervenciones de corte clasico como una charla impartida por un profesional o el contacto con usuarios de los servicios de Salud Mental, asi como, con respecto a un grupo control (en este caso como medida de estigma, se aplico el Attribution Questionnaire 27-Espanol; AQ-27-E; Munoz, Guillen, Perez-Santos y Corrigan, 2015). Stigma-Stop mostro una eficacia similar o incluso superior en algunos de los siete factores que finalmente fueron tenidos en cuenta en comparacion con el resto de intervenciones.\n En definitiva, estariamos en disposicion de concluir que Stigma-Stop es una herramienta util para concienciar y sensibilizar a adolescentes y jovenes en lo relativo al estigma en Salud Mental. Los resultados hallados en todos los estudios apoyarian la bondad de este Serious Game como herramienta de utilidad en la lucha antiestigma, por lo que se concluye apuntando hacia futuras lineas de investigacion entre ellas, la integracion de este tipo de recursos en las intervenciones antiestigma, la adaptacion de Stigma-Stop para permitir su aplicacion en otros paises, asi como, contar con un papel mas activo de los usuarios de los servicios de Salud Mental para el diseno de futuros softwares en esta linea.\n Palabras clave: Serious Game, Estigma, Salud Mental, esquizofrenia.",

      "abstract": "Background: Sudden death is a death that happens suddenly, unexpectedly whereby beforethis the person looks healthy, showing no signs of trauma or poisoning. One of the reason ofsudden death as well as the biggest reason is because of cardiovascular system disease.Case Presentation: It is reported a case with a deceased male with the initial of Mr. B, 72years old, addressed in Medan,Labuhan. The deceased was brought to the hospital by thepolice with the request of Visum et Repertum and then an examination on the corpse as wellas corpse surgery was done. Before the deceased was stated dead, it was known he had anargument with someone, he then fell and died.Conclusion: Someone who is irritable and easily offended can give out negative auras thattrigger stress and give bad effect to the entire office, household, or classroom. When feelingupset, anxious, angry, and fussy, our tolerance is lower and we are more likely to be disturbedby the kind of small frustration that we usually avoid. Our reaction to anger also tends to befar more aggressive than usual",

De igual modo, tambien se ha relacionado esta sintomatologia con sindromes que necesariamente no conllevan un intento de suicidio como son el uso y abuso de sustancias, el autismo o la esquizofrenia. En este sentido, estas conductas autolesivas han sido planteadas como con causa de necesidad afectiva o llamada de atencion. El presente trabajo valida una herramienta para el diagnostico y posterior tratamiento de estas autolesiones sin intencion suicida. Los datos arrojan que existen dos subdimensiones de la autolesion: Autolesion por encima de la piel y Autolesion por debajo de la piel. Existen igualmente diferencias de genero entre hombres y mujeres tanto en el tipo de autolesion como en el nivel de la misma. EnglishSelf - injury behaviors have been related to different syndromes of anxiety, depression, attempted suicide and consummate suicide, bullying, and physical and/or sexual abuse. Similarly, this symptomatology has also been linked to syndromes that do not necessarily lead to an attempted suicide such as substance use and abuse, autism or schizophrenia. In this sense, these self - injury behaviors have been related to affective or attention need. The present study validates a questionnaire for the diagnosis, and subsequent treatment, of these self - injuries without suicidal intent. The results show that there are two sub - dimensions of self - injury: Self - injury above the skin and Self - injury below the skin. There are also gender differences between men and women in both the type of self - harm and in the level of it.",

Patients with Alzheimer’s disease, however, often develop apraxia, which can be defined as a disorder of skilled movement not caused by weakness, akinesia, deafferentation, abnormal tone or posture, movement disorders (such as tremor or chorea), intellectual deterioration, poor comprehension, or uncooperativeness.3Moreover, subtypes of apraxia have been delineated and are defined by the nature of errors made by the patient and the means by which these errors are elicited.4 5 Accordingly, a patient with probable dementia of the Alzheimer’s type is described who had normal prosodic elements to his spontaneous everyday speech, but could not produce the same acoustical features underlying prosody to command.

Durante una consulta médica, muchos adultos mayores no mencionan sus dificultades para andar, algunos no se refieren a haberse caído ya porque consideran que éste es un problema normal que forma parte del envejecimiento y porque desconocen las intervenciones que puedan minimizar el problema. La inestabilidad postural es considerada un síndrome geriátrico con señales, síntomas propios y con etiología multifactorial. Una caída en un adulto mayor puede considerarse un evento centinela o una señal de alerta que anuncia un declive funcional, un cuadro infeccioso asintomático, o el efecto adverso de un medicamento o una patología subyacente sin señales y síntomas clásicos. El examen físico de un adulto mayor comienza incluso antes de su ingreso en el consultorio. El médico debe estar atento a la manera en la que él se levanta de la silla y anda, si necesita ayuda para levantarse o si usa algún aparato para ayudar a la marcha. La evaluación del equilibrio y de las alteraciones de la marcha, así como la investigación de la ocurrencia de caídas en adultos mayores debe ser muy cuidadosa; durante la entrevista clínica el médico debe preguntar abiertamente sobre los problemas de equilibrio, marcha y ocurrencia de caídas, así como conocer las circunstancias en que acontecieron. Habitualmente, las caídas son consecuencias de perturbaciones del equilibrio y de la marcha, algunas de éstas son típicas de patologías específicas, por esto, la observación cuidadosa de la marcha puede ayudar al médico a elaborar hipótesis diagnósticas más probables a fin de proponer intervenciones preventivas.",

      "title": "Juvenile fibromyalgia: A call for diagnostic refinement, a case report",
      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> BackgroundFibromyalgia is a clinical syndrome consisting of widespread musculoskeletal tenderness and various somatic complaints including nonrestorative sleep, mood disorders such as anxiety or depression, abdominal pain, and/or headaches. There is a great deal of heterogeneity in its expression which leads to difficulty in identifying predisposing factors. A singular review of patients in an academic pediatric pain clinic reveal immune system dysfunction, mood disorders, infection, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome, and hypermobility are premorbid conditions. It is unclear if these premorbid conditions confer a distinct fibromyalgia clinical phenotype that can provide insight into targeted therapies. Current diagnostic measures for fibromyalgia do not allow for this level of discrimination and are not validated in children.Case Presentation20 children who demonstrated widespread musculoskeletal pain, tenderness to pressure on exam and multiple somatic complaints were diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Average time from start of pain to diagnosis is 2 years. Over half the patients have psychopathology, a third have an immune system dysfunction related to autoimmunity or an infectious exposure, a third with orthostatic intolerance or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, a quarter relating to hypermobility, and a quarter of the cohort with dysmenorrhea were pre or comorbid conditions. Effective therapeutic regimens among patients varied widely from responding to medical monotherapy to multimodal treatment. Trigger point injections worsened pain in one fibromyalgia patient but decreased pain in another. Patients with comorbid autoimmunity report appreciating a difference between a flare in their arthritis as opposed to a flare in their fibromyalgia. Such varying responses within the same clinical syndrome suggest distinct phenotypes within fibromyalgia which is difficult to distinguish using our current diagnostic tools.ConclusionThere is a need for clear diagnostic criteria for both the recognition of juvenile fibromyalgia and tools to distinguish phenotypes within fibromyalgia. Currently, the recognition of clinical symptoms renders it an often-overlooked neuropathic pain condition. This case series suggest there are different phenotypes within fibromyalgia. Some patients respond remarkably to serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors alone whereas others require multidisciplinary therapy. A diagnostic tool refined to capture these nuances can facilitate targeted treatment recommendations.",

Field independence may relate closely to sense of reality, state of mental health, strong self-esteem, differentiated identity, and articulated body concept. Witkin with his coworkers considered field dependence a predisposing factor to alcoholism and not a result of alcoholism. Field dependence of alcoholics seems to be related to identity problems and disturbed body image, as well as to adopted helplessness and external locus of control. Disturbances in separation-individuation process may provide a basis for a narcissistic prealcoholic personality which results in poor perception of body image and weak self-esteem.",

Anticipatory grief can be a particular challenge during palliative care. The family is recognized as the major source of social support and the environment in which grief is shared with others. Key risk factors for pathological bereavement outcomes can be identified on admission to palliative care, permitting preventive models of psychological care to be used through palliative care into bereavement. Models of therapy include supportive-expressive, interpersonal, cognitive behavioural, family focused, and specific therapy for complicated grief. Pharmacotherapy can judiciously accompany psychotherapy. Life-cycle issues include bereaved children, siblings, parents, and grief for the very elderly. Grief can be stigmatized and ambiguous in special circumstances, yet positive growth is a desirable outcome from any loss.",

EOS begins before the age of eighteen, while VEOS begins before the age of\r\nthirteen. Since etiopathogenesis remains unclear, there are various theories about the emergence\r\nof schizophrenia: the dopamine theory, the genetic theory, the psychodynamic theory, the\r\nenvironmental theory and other. Schizophrenia is a multidimensional disease characterized by\r\nheterogeneous symptoms. The psychotic symptoms are present in children and adolescents even\r\nbefore the diagnosis of the disease. The symptoms are divided into positive, negative and\r\ndisorganisation symptoms. The expression of symptoms in children differs from those in adults\r\ndue to the cognitive variation of different ages. The delay of the cognitive development is quite\r\noften in EOS. The cognitive impairment is a basic symptom of schizophrenia and it has an\r\ninfluence on the course and recovery. DSM-V define the criteria for the diagnosis: delusions,\r\nhallucinations, disorganized speech or behaviour, and negative symptoms. The indicators of a\r\nworse outcome are: worse cognition, male sex, earlier beginning, poor economic condition, long\r\nnon-treated period, previous lower social adjustment, and negative symptoms. The most common\r\ncomorbidity is drug abuse. The conditions considered for differential diagnosis are: general\r\nmedical conditions, other psychotic disorders, pervasive developmental disorder and autism.\r\nTherapy include: antipsychotics, psychoeducation and psychotherapy. Antipsychotics are the\r\nfirst-line therapy, and the atipycal antipsychotics are the first choice. Typical (classical) and\r\natypical (newer) antipsychotics are used in therapy. It is necessary to include psychotherapy,\r\nparticularly cognitive therapy and psychoeducation.",

Pain may impact physical function, psychological function, and other aspects of quality of life. A thorough history and physical examination may optimally assess a person with a persistent pain complaint in the context of a multifactorial pathway from accumulated impairments in multiple systems. Older people may perceive that integrative medicine treatments based on lifestyle and lower-risk therapies may help them get relief from pain and improve quality of life.

      "abstract": "Abstract: Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a chronic disorder characterized by widespread and persistent musculoskeletal pain and other frequent symptoms such as fatigue, insomnia, morning stiffness, cognitive impairment, depression, and anxiety. FMS is also accompanied by different comorbidities like irritable bowel syndrome and chronic fatigue syndrome. Although some factors like negative events, stressful environments, or physical/emotional traumas may act as predisposing conditions, the etiology of FMS remains unknown. There is evidence of a high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities in FMS (especially depression, anxiety, borderline personality, obsessive-compulsive personality, and post-traumatic stress disorder), which are associated with a worse clinical profile. There is also evidence of high levels of negative affect, neuroticism, perfectionism, stress, anger, and alexithymia in FMS patients. High harm avoidance together with high self-transcendence, low cooperativeness, and low self-directedness have been reported as temperament and character features in FMS patients, respectively. Additionally, FMS patients tend to have a negative self-image and body image perception, as well as low self-esteem and perceived self-efficacy. FMS reduces functioning in physical, psychological, and social spheres, and also has a negative impact on cognitive performance, personal relationships (including sexuality and parenting), work, and activities of daily life. In some cases, FMS patients show suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and consummated suicide. FMS patients perceive the illness as a stigmatized and invisible disorder, and this negative perception hinders their ability to adapt to the disease. Psychological interventions may constitute a beneficial complement to pharmacological treatments in order to improve clinical symptoms and reduce the impact of FMS on health-related quality of life.

It is a mental health condition that can range in severity from mild to severe. The severity of depression can be assessed based on the number, intensity, and duration of symptoms, as well as their impact on an individual's daily functioning. Mild depression typically involves symptoms such as feeling sad, low energy, and a lack of motivation. These symptoms may not significantly interfere with an individual's ability to function in their daily life, and they may still be able to maintain their social and occupational obligations. Moderate depression involves more severe and persistent symptoms, such as a sense of hopelessness, persistent feelings of sadness, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions. These symptoms may make it challenging to fulfill daily responsibilities, and may result in social isolation or problems at work or school. Severe depression involves symptoms that significantly impair an individual's ability to function in their daily life, such as suicidal thoughts, complete loss of interest in activities, and difficulty with basic tasks such as personal hygiene or eating. Severe depression is a medical emergency and requires immediate professional intervention to prevent harm to oneself or others",

      "abstract": "Objective: The definition of “hikikomori” evokes dysfunctional personality pictures already known in the literature and medical practice. The aim is to refute the hypothesis of the need to identify this clinical condition in a new descriptive framework. Materials and methods: Pubmed checklist, clinical interview, and psychometric tests. Results: In the entirety of the selected population, it emerges that the primary disorder is schizoid personality disorder; this is followed by depressive disorder, narcissistic covert disorder, bipolar disorder with depressive prevalence, obsessive disorder, avoidant disorder, and somatic disorder as secondary dysfunctional personality traits. Childhood and/or family trauma, capable of impacting the sexual and affective sphere, is present in almost the entire population. Conclusion: The syndrome should be framed as a specific phenomenon and not as a new psychopathological disorder, as the symptomatological descriptions are similar to the already known schizoid personality disorder; the symptomatological differences among patients should be framed according to a logic of correctives determined by the presence of one or more secondary psychopathological traits that draw a more complex personality picture than the simple nosographic diagnosis of the DSM-V.",

In fact, this may be among the most common predicament that individuals seek medical attention for (1). Typically, an evaluation is performed looking for a \"cause\" for the pain. If none is found, these individuals are often given a diagnostic label that merely connotes that the patient has chronic pain in a region of the body, without an underlying mechanistic cause [e.g., chronic low back pain, headache, temporomandibular disorder (TMD), etc.]. In other cases, the label given alludes to an underlying mechanism that may or may not be responsible for the individual's pain (e.g., \"facet syndrome\").",

      "abstract": "There are children whose behavior has conveyed to others that they are not themselves in a manner that has made those others believe that they were having a fit, though (so far as we can tell) they were not. There are similar expressions of distress that have a different outcome. They are construed as an emotional outpouring of no medical significance. Doctors only become involved if the believer, or significant others, think the person might be sick. Who is responsible for what then ensues deserves discussion since about one in five of those offering a history of “seizures” to neurology outpatients only think they have them. A false belief about seizuring (aka Hysterical Epilepsy and/or Pseudoseizures) does not differ in any significant way nor have interestingly different psychological antecedents from any other false beliefs about being diseased (Medically Relevant Hysteria). But what there is to ‘treat’ is not the fit but the belief; and the most important believer may not be the person with the odd behavior. In the case of pseudoseizures, that believer’s concern is innocent. (See also Outlandish Factitious Illness in this volume) Belief is an assent to a proposition whose primary attributes are its truth or falsity. Beliefs can become convictions and so persist and look to convert others to that belief. Knowledge however requires the attainment of certain facts as a result of a",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is an epileptic condition, lasting more than 30 min, characterized by con tinuous or recurrent epileptic activity on EEG, which is responsible for various clinical symptoms (especially in mental status or behavior) in the absence of manifest seizure activity. It includes different clinical forms, from minor confusion to complex behavioral disorders, psychosis, or coma. These psychotic symptoms can be very complex and their differential diagnosis can be difficult. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient without previous personal or family recorded history of epilepsy and/or schizophrenic disorder, without identifiable stressors, showing a subacute episode of anxiety with aggression. Initially, he was discharged without treatment. Seven days later he went to the emergency services accompanied by his family members reporting delusions of injury. He presented a disorganized behavior with self-harm, anxiety, dysesthesia, cenestopathy and in ternal field hallucinations (auditory and visual). The initial EEG study revealed a nonconvulsive status with an active tempo ral focus. In this patient, the psychotic symptoms and EEG abnormalities consistent with NCSE appeared simultaneously. Once the EEG returned to normal, the symptoms only persisted residually and were compatible with intraictal psychosis.",

      "abstract": "__Abstract__\r\n\r\nThe term parkinsonism refers to a neurological syndrome defined by the combination of\r\nbradykinesia (slowness of movement) in combination with any of the following motor signs: tremor\r\nat rest, muscular rigidity, and loss of postural reflexes (1). This is an etiologically heterogeneous\r\nentity, which might be due to dysfunctions at various levels in the basal ganglia, and especially\r\nin the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum. The parkinsonism can be classified into four broad\r\ncategories: (i) Parkinson's disease (PD, MIM#168600), also called primary parkinsonism, or typical\r\nparkinsonism, which includes the common, idiopathic form, and the rare forms with a recently\r\ndefined genetic etiology; (ii) parkinsonism-plus syndromes, which include different idiopathic,\r\nbut atypical neurodegenerative forms of parkinsonism (additional motor neurologic features are\r\npresent); (iii) secondary parkinsonism, which is caused by known, non-genetic etiologies, such as\r\nenvironmental insults (drugs, toxins, viruses), inflammation, tissue infiltration/compression or\r\nischemia; (iv) parkinsonism in the context of other degenerative disorders, with or without a known\r\ngenetic cause, in which parkinsonism represents a minor, or occasional component of the clinical\r\npicture (table 1 ).\r\nIn the primary forms of parkinsonism (PD) the initial symptoms occur typically in one side of\r\nthe body, spreading in a few years to the contralateral side. However, a certain degree of clinical\r\nasymmetry persists during the more advanced phases of the disease (the body side where\r\nthe symptoms started remains the more severely affected). Moreover, these motor symptoms\r\ndisplay typically a substantial beneficial response to the therapy with levodopa. While the motor\r\nsymptoms dominate the clinical picture, many PD patients have also other, non-motor problems,\r\nsuch as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, constipation, bladder and other autonomic\r\ndisturbances, and sensory complaints (2).\r\nThe diagnosis of primary parkinsonism (PD) remains based on the presence of the clinical\r\nsyndrome, and the exclusion of other (secondary) causes.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is a common complaint in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). More than half of all patients with PD rank fatigue among their three worst symptoms. Fatigue has been variously hypothesized to be caused by dysfunction of the striato-thalamo-cortical loop, abnormalities in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, inflammatory processes, and neurotransmitter abnormalities within the central nervous system. However, there is no firm evidence that any of these proposed etiologies explain the fatigue experienced by patients who have PD or other diseases. Fatigue may be associated with depression, sleep disorders, and medication-induced adverse effects, but it also remains a distinct symptom that can occur independently from these other disorders and problems. Fatigue is a persistent symptom in individual patients, and it is unrelated to disease severity. Fatigue is difficult to define and even more difficult to measure. Several questionnaires are available to measure fatigue, but many of these are disease-specific and do not apply to patients who have PD. Some questionnaires measure general overall fatigue, whereas others measure different aspects of fatigue, including mental, physical, emotional, motivational, and exertional fatigue. Often fatigue is confused with sleepiness, a related but distinct construct. Clearly, fatigue has a significantly negative impact on the quality of life and physical function of patients with PD. Currently, there is no proven effective treatment for this problematic nonmotor symptom of PD. Additional research is needed to provide a better understanding of this complex problem.",

Su heterogeneidad clínica representa un reto para el diagnóstico y el manejo farmacológico. Se presenta el caso de un varón de 19 años, procedente de la ciudad de Pucallpa, de ascendencia judía, sin antecedentes familiares reportados, leptosómico, con rasgos marfanoides, síntomas psicóticos, retraimiento social, manifestaciones obsesivas y episodios impulsivos incontrolables. Tras el descarte de patologías similares, se le diagnosticó SLF. Fue tratado con clozapina, periciazina, carbamazepina, clomipramina y levomepromazina, logrando una remisión parcial de los síntomas psicóticos y obsesivos. Su etiología se vincula a mutaciones genéticas, como las ocurridas en el gen Mediator Complex Subunit 12 (MED12). El diagnóstico se basa en la presencia de manifestaciones clínicas (como la apariencia marfanoide) y en el descarte de patologías similares. Los síntomas psiquiátricos son un componente importante por considerar, ya que, como ocurre en el presente caso, son polimorfos y muestran una respuesta limitada al tratamiento. El diagnóstico de SLF sigue siendo un reto en ámbitos clínicos donde el planteamiento de entidades genéticas como causa de patología psiquiátrica es poco usual y deben considerarse en el análisis de diagnóstico de casos, particularmente con respuesta terapéutica insatisfactoria.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatry is, indeed, basically similar to the rest of medicine. it is based upon making reliable diagnoses and applying evidence - based treatments that have success rates comparable with those used in other specialties. Psychiatric syndromes may be defined as disorders that are conventionally treated with treatments used by psychiatrists. The illnesses in which psychiatrists have developed proficiency have tended to be those that either manifest with disordered psychological functioning (thinking, perception, emotion, and memory) or those which have no obviously established organic basis. However, scientific developments are showing us that these so - called psychological ailments are linked with abnormalities of the brain, just as so - called medical illnesses are deeply affected by psychological factors. Modern psychiatry is an evolving field that is becoming less hospital based, more evidence based, and more neuroscience based. Nonetheless, during the last decades, random antipsychiatry attitudes have amalgamated and turned into a conjectural effort, which has a humanistic appearance, too. On the other hand, publicized criticisms by some associates, including known psychiatrists or psychotherapists, have, radically, stirred and reinforced the movement. Anyway, though various criticisms or worries about psychiatry, either as a subdivision in science or as a clinical practice in medicine are understandable due to existing scientific or diagnostic deficits, anti-psychiatry stance, which comprises many historical exaggerations based on happenings and primitive conditions from a century ago, may help to keep us rigorous and honest about what we do and inspiring us to insistently seek better diagnostic prototypes and management standards. In the present article, the said antagonism, in addition to the existing facts and expected responsibilities of psychiatry has been discussed concisely.",

It represents an efficient system of information introducing or evoking a series of defensive mechanisms concerning acute illness, whereas the chronic ache is senseless, because it doesn't take over any protective functions; on the contrary, it burdens the total organism, especially the vegetativum and the psyche as well. Chronic pain very often renders independent, then it is no longer any symptom of a disease, but the disease itself: the idiopathic or unspecific syndrome of pain. Analyzing, for example, rheumatological aspects of a case, you can recognise that there exist continuous transitions from concrete local pain to diffuse indefinite psychalgia, whilst that gliding scale is more and more defined by psychic causes. Many aspects of cases imply a lot of such components.

As a result, healthy expression of parental grief over a child's mental illness is seriously inhibited, and problems, both for parents and the patient, are exacerbated.

Attempted suicide is common in patients with psychiatric disorders, and may also occur in individuals with physical health problems. Suicide, even when completed, is not without meaning. Suicidal ideation is often triggered by feelings of hopelessness or social isolation. Individuals who commit suicide have usually indicated their wish to die either directly or indirectly prior to the suicide attempt. Persons who undertake suicide attempts usually go through the stages of contemplating suicidal ideas as a possibility to terminate intense suffering, which is followed by a period of ambivalence and narrowing of perceived alternative options before a final decision is made. Suicide attempts with terminal intent can be classified as desperate or impulsive. In a minority of cases, suicide is altruistically motivated, and such behaviour may not necessarily be associated with psychopathology.",

It is more likely that head injury can sometimes unmask an underlying predisposition to another neuropsychiatric disease that has already begun to manifest, often sub-clinically. Such unmasking may occur as a result of a brain injury superimposed on an already vulnerable brain, or a brain injury that contextually removes the individual from a routine that served as a reliable and dependable structural context. Thus, when abrupt neuropsychiatric manifestations such as psychosis or dementia manifest after concussion, a thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation should be performed, and one should not simply assume that concussion is the cause.",

Chronic pain is longer and presents either with a current physical source or after its apparent healing. Chronic pain perception involves fewer physical factors and more subjective factors. Recurrent pain syndromes, commonly headache and abdominal and limb pains, are painful and without apparent physical cause; however, they do not always imply a psychological disorder.",

      "abstract": "Summary Chronic pain syndrome is a major health and socioeconomic problem that is manifested by frequent asking of medical assistance, high price of health care, sick leave, work inability and disability as well as frequent compensation requests. Generally speaking, pain, especially chronic pain, significantly diminishes the patient and their family’s quality of life. Most people experience one or more pain disorders during their life. Chronic pain prevalence accounts for 15 to 22% in population. It occurs more frequently in women, in older age and persons of decreased socioeconomic status. Chronic pain can be causally linked to comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as fear of physical illness, constant worry, anxious disorders, depression and reaction to stress. Every pain, especially chronic, has psychological characteristics as well which are expressed to an extent. When the pathophysiologic factor is known, the pain is conventionally classified as “specific” and when it is unknown it is called “nonspecific”, psychogenic, idiopathic, conversive or euphemistic atypical pain. Nonspecific pain is very often a symptom of a psychiatric disorder or it is classified in the group of soma toform psychiatric disorders according to contemporary classification systems, e.g. the American Psychiatric Association’s DSM-IV and the International Classification of Di seases (ICD-10). Psychosomatic medicine studies the connection of psychological conditions and psychiatric disorders, psychosocial stress, family and occupational factors with somatic disorders. On the other hand, a painful somatic illness can cause anxiety, depression, social phobia and isolation. Treating nonspecific psychogenic pain disorder is not possible without a holistic, integrative, interdisciplinary team approach of psychiatrists, psychologists, physiologists, neurologists and sometimes even neurosurgeons.

      "title": "Fibromyalgia and abnormal illness behavior: A catch-22",
      "abstract": "Sir, Thanks to the editor for publishing such an interesting article on fibromyalgia - an under recognized, undertreated condition, and an often misdiagnosed and missed diagnosis condition! This article by Prasanna[1] highlights the important diagnostic aspects of fibromyalgia and alludes to the etiological aspects of this condition. Fibromyalgia patients are often silent sufferers as the pain they experience is poorly localized and widespread associated with poor sleep and fatigue. When the doctors are unable to find any positive findings on routine investigation they may label it as being psychological (which often may be a comorbid condition rather than the primary diagnosis), malingering and may just not be considered worthy of pain relief and be referred to mental health professionals. The patient often ends up visiting many health professionals and 'doctor shopping' for relief of symptoms. They exhibit features of abnormal illness behavior (AIB). AIB[2] is an important issue in fibromyalgia. Illness behavior is defined as 'the ways in which given symptoms may be differentially perceived, evaluated, and acted (or not acted) upon';[3] whereas, AIB is a maladaptive ways of perceiving one's health status.[2] Another related concept is the 'sick role' which may be of relevance in fibromyalgia.[4] In fibromyalgia, patients experience pain, fatigue, and poor sleep and consider themselves ill; however, the health professionals may not find any objective evidence of illness and resulting in discrepancy in patient's illness behavior and the health professional's assessment. Thus, it appears that fibromyalgia patients may have AIB or a sick role. In a study on patients presenting with predominant AIBs with chronic pain or fatigue as presenting complaint were examined for fibromyalgia and nearly 33% of these patients fulfilled criteria for fibromyalgia as per American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria.[5] In fact, majority had one or more tender points and 33 patients had more than 10 tender points. The tender points were more common in patients who are diagnosed as somatoform disorder, on left side than on right side and were higher in females. The study emphasized that the features of fibromyalgia need to be looked for in somatizers in order to diagnose and treat them appropriately.[6] This is a catch-22 situation in pain practice! On one hand, it appears that patients with fibromyalgia perceive symptoms in the absence of any positive laboratory tests, but seek consultations for symptom relief and a diagnostic label for the symptoms. In this way, they fulfill criteria for AIB.[2] On the other hand, patients with fibromyalgia receive a diagnosis after many consultations and may be dubbed as having AIB while they actually are suffering and need treatment for the same!!! Pain practitioners need to be aware about AIB in their patients reporting chronic pain (especially non-organic) or multiple sites of pain, as in fibromyalgia. Studies on AIB in chronic pain patients in Indian settings have been already reported,[7] and the authors are involved in an ongoing study on AIB in chronic pain patients. Source of Support: None. Conflict of Interest: None declared.",

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guidelines for Assessment and Management of Aggressive and Assaultive Behaviour",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Violence and aggression are common in mental health facilities, sometimes with grave consequences[1] warrant the formation of a guideline that addresses these issues. The combination of extrinsic and intrinsic factors along with the context and setting of violence makes the task of its prevention and management a complex phenomenon. The intrinsic components mainly consisted of personality features, current serious mental stress, and difficulty in managing anger. On the other hand, extrinsic factors are more diverse and depend not only upon the physical and social context where violence and aggression happen but also on the aggressor's attitude, victim's characteristics, health professional's training and experience, and perceived risk of danger.[2] DEFINITIONS OF VIOLENCE AND AGGRESSION Violence and aggression can be defined as a set of activities that may lead to harm to other persons. It can be expressed in actions or words, but the physical damage remains and the purpose is clear.[2] EPIDEMIOLOGY Aggression by patients in psychiatric wards may be a common occurrence. Studies show that 18%-25% of hospitalized patients exhibit violent behavior while in the ward.[3] High occurrence of aggression particularly verbal aggression is also reported by Emergency staff.[4] The association of mental conditions with violence and aggression Contrary to the popular public view that recognized the link between mental health problems (especially serious mental health problems such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia) and violence, the literature on this fact varies and shows mixed results. People with mental health problems are more likely to become victims of violence than perpetrators, and most people do not engage in violence at all.[5] However, a consensus has emerged among researchers that a small fraction of patients have a relationship between mental health issues and violence. Persons with organic brain dysfunction (post-traumatic, posthead injury, and seizure disorder particularly temporal lobe seizures) tend to exhibit violent and aggressive behaviour. The Epidemiological Catchment area study[6] reported a 7.3% of lifetime prevalence of violence within the population who is free from psychiatric issues. On the other hand, the lifetime prevalence of violence was more than double (16.1%) in persons with schizophrenia or major affective disorders and 35% and 43.6% in those with substance use disorders and substance use disorder with comorbid mental health issues, respectively. An association of violence was noticed, in different meta-analyses with Mood disorders, schizophrenia, and other psychosis.[7-9] A huge number of varieties were recognized with an odds ratio between 1 and 7 for schizophrenia in males and between 4 and 27 for females. For bipolar disorder, the odds ratio extended from 2 to 9. Be that as it may, for both disorders a comorbid substance-use disorder expanded the odds ratio up to 3-fold. In the early 20th century, researchers recognized a set of symptoms called threat/control-over-ride symptoms that seemed to be associated with the risk of violence.[10] Threat/control-over-ride symptoms are delusional symptoms that make an individual feel like he is under threat and under the control of external forces. Personal impact of violence and aggression against self and others Staff within the hospital A fraction of the injuries that happen to staff occur while trying to intervene in fights between patients, but staff may also receive injuries by unpredictable assaults made by patients who respond to their psychiatric symptoms or by confrontation while stopping patients from leaving the ward.[11] Sometimes staff also have to physically intercede to halt patients from harming themselves or attempting to take off to the ward, which may lead to aggression. Individual consequences Patients who carry on violence are likely to encounter more accommodation difficulties, diminished social relations, and social support and be more disconnected. As a result, violence can be dangerous for those involved and have a negative impact on quality of life. Relatives, Carers, and Social networks Family members, carers, and close contacts of patients are more likely to be injured when there is a risk of violence exists. On the other hand, in case the patient is living freely, relatives may pull back and stop supporting and visiting him if they frequently face aggressive and abusive behaviour. In hospitals, staff blames a person's illness as the source of hostility, while patients blame illness, interpersonal problems, and the environment equally as sources of aggression.[12] This staff awareness is critical to understanding how staff responds to incidents of violence and the postincident support needed to effectively manage the impact on themselves and patients.[13] Demographic and premorbid factors Histories of aggression, schizophrenia, and recent illicit drug use are associated with aggression while inconclusive evidence for age, gender, and h/o conduct disorder. Causes of aggressive and violent behavior listed in Table 1.Table 1: Causes of aggressive and violent behaviorRISK FACTORS FOR AGGRESSION AND VIOLENCE Risk factors are characteristics of the patient or their environment and care that make them more likely to behave aggressively. Two types of risk factors: Static risk factors:Historical and remain unchangedExample: Age, sex, family background, and childhood abuse.[14]Dynamic risk factors:Are changeable and hence there is an opportunity for intervention. Examples: Presenting symptoms, alcohol and illicit substance consumption, and compliance issue with treatment.[14] Risk assessment involves identifying risk factors and assessing the likelihood and nature of adverse outcomes. On the other hand, risk management involves methodologies to prevent these negative results from happening or to limit their effect. Some researchers believed that static factors were better suited to assess risk over the long term and dynamic factors for assessing the risk of violence in the short term.[14] VIOLENCE ANDAGGRESSION RISK ASSESSMENT AND PREDICTION Predicting events that are imminent or perceived as imminent is not a trivial task. But, in acute clinical scenarios, it is difficult to perform comprehensive assessments that comprise history and physical and mental status examination in patients with a risk of violence and aggression. Different methods of risk assessment and tool were listed in Tables 2 and 3 respectively.Table 2: Broadly there are three methods to assess riskTable 3: Various violence-related risk assessment toolsVarious places where violence risk may be present Institutional facilities: includes large and small hospitals, nursing homes, long-term care facilities, inpatient/outpatient care facilities, small clinics, and community health facilities. Fieldwork settings: healthcare or social workers who sometimes need to make home visits. Use safety measures in all settings to prevent violence and aggression.[24] MANAGEMENT OF AGGRESSION AND VIOLENCE Management of aggressive and violent behavior will depend upon the sensorium and orientation of the patient at the time of the presentation. If the patient is disoriented/delirious then the management would be as per the guidelines of a delirious patient.[25] If he/she is well oriented and has clear sensorium then management will be as follows. Verbal de-escalation Restrictive interventions Pharmacological management VERBAL DE-ESCALATION Process of verbal de-escalation describe in Table 4 RESTRICTIVE INTERVENTION Modifications as per the environment Personal and institutional alarms to be fixed in easily accessible site. Table 4: Verbal De-escalationCommon restrictive interventions include A. Physical Restraint As per section 97 of the Mental Health Care Act 2017, physical restraint should only be used when there is imminent and immediate harm to the person concerned or to others and it should be authorized by a psychiatrist in charge. Salient points to be considered as per the mental health act 2017 for physical restraint: Physical restraint should not be used longer than necessary. Treating psychiatrist or medical officer should be responsible for ensuring the method and nature of the restraint, its justification, and appropriate record. The nominated representative should be informed if restraint is prolonged beyond 24 hours. It should not be used as a punishment method or counter to staff shortage. A person should be placed under restraint at a place where he can cause no harm to him or others and be under regular supervision by medical personnel. All instances should be reported to the mental health board on monthly basis. For further reference, a reader can use specific restraint guidelines for mental health services in India by Raveesh et al.[27] Techniques used for Physical restraint Approach 1 For physical restrain, patient should be lying down on the bed. Both upper and lower extremities should be tied with soft clothes or bandages. Constant monitoring of patients during mechanical restraint is a must. If constant monitoring is not possible, the patient has to be visually observed for at least 15 minutes of restraint time and should be within eyesight. And keep watch at every 10–15 minutes for the remaining hours. Approach 2 In the prone position, both arm and legs should be joint to the bedside. It should be done with cotton bandage.[2] This will allow some free movement of patient during restrain. Physical restraint techniques should be modified as per the patient's condition and physical health.[2] B. Seclusion Seclusion is not permitted in India as per the existing Mental Health Care Act 2017. However, in western guidelines, seclusion is reported as one of the techniques. It is 'the involuntary imprisonment of an individual in a room from which the individual is physically avoided from moving out. Patients were watched each 10 to 15 minutes through a window within the door.[2] One randomized controlled trial[28] reported a low level of evidence that suggests a minimal restrictive care (seclusion) is as effective as a more prohibitive pathway (mechanical restraint). Three reviews[29-31] reported that although staff believes restrictive measures to be a necessary step, this was also associated with the feeling of regret, trauma, and concern about the therapeutic relationship. Advisable Laboratory Investigations As soon as the patient is cooperative or sedated by pharmacological management, the following investigations may be done to rule out comorbid organic conditions or for the planning of pharmacological management. Full Blood Count Liver Function Test Kidney Function Test Blood Glucose level Electrocardiogram Electrolytes Urinary drug screening Brain scan (optional, after clinical judgment) 3. PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT Every individual with aggressive and assaultive behaviour presented with a different set of issues. There is a lack of good scientific literature in the area of medical management in the acute setting for aggressive and assaultive behaviour. Pharmacological management of aggressive and assaultive behaviour should be considered only when other methods of management failed or respond inadequately.[32] Selection of pharmacological treatment for aggressive and assaultive agitation should be based on underlying etiological issues and psychiatric diagnosis. See the overview of pharmacological management of aggression and assaultive behaviour in Figure 1.Figure 1: Outline of pharmacological management of aggressive and violent behaviourPsychiatric reasons for the presentation of acute aggressive behavior are due to psychotic illnesses like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, substance-related issues, conduct disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, and personality problems. Certain patient-related and medication-related factors should be kept in mind before planning an effective management plan.[33] Factors to be considered in the pharmacological management of aggressive and violent behaviour shown in Table 5.Table 5: Factors to be considered in the pharmacological management of aggressive and violent behaviour[ 33 , 35 ]A mainstay for pharmacological treatment of aggressive and assaultive behaviour lies in rapid tranquilization in the short term. Search for psychopathology and/or medical reasons and appropriate management of it should be the next step of action.[2] Presentation of such assaultive and aggressive behaviour is also varied in different settings like community, acute and emergency department, psychiatric inpatient setting, or medical setting. The definition of rapid tranquillization is subject to debate. The major goal of treatment is to archive calmness without oversedation of the patient and rapid control of acutely disturbed behaviour.[2,34] However, in the case of acute behavioural disturbance, level of sedation is required to a much deeper extent. The Recent NICE guideline defines rapid tranquilization specific to the parental route, particularly by intramuscular and in the rare case intravenous route. Although this guideline also highlights the use of oral preparations before parental.[2] The general principles of pharmacological management of aggressive and violent behaviour listed in Table 6.Table 6: Principles of pharmacological management of aggressive and violent behaviourManagement of acute aggressive and violent behaviour No agent preferred over the other. The use of medication is based on various factors as mentioned in Table 5. Use of oral medication must be encouraged before any form of parenteral medicine. But it may depend on the severity of the acute presentation, availability of resources, and patient cooperation. Also, single medication use should be always preferred over a combination of medicines. Summary of some major studies with different medication combinations and their outcome listed in Table 7. A combination of more than one agent leads to develop unnecessary side effects and negative patient experience. The patient's age and hepatic and renal function also consider before prescribing any agent.Table 7: Summary of studies with different medication combinations and their outcome[ 38 - 42 ]A stepwise approach should be considered as shown in the following path [Figure 2] for acute management of aggressive and assaultive behaviour.[2]Figure 2: Stepwise approach for acute management of aggressive and assaultive behaviourOral and inhaled treatment Research supported the early use of oral medication due to the good efficacy of medications in controlling assaultive and violent behaviour. Patients with mild to moderate levels of agitation may show cooperation in taking oral medication. Benzodiazepines and antipsychotics have been used primarily to treat aggression and violent behavior.[2,36] Benzodiazepine acts through the GABA receptors and it has anxiolytic, hypnotic, and anticonvulsant properties.[33] Oral benzodiazepine is available in various formulations like melt –in mouth, oral disintegrated molecule, and buccal preparations. Oral Lorazepam, diazepam, and midazolam were used extensively in the past for controlling violent behaviour. Oral benzodiazepine is relatively safe and less associated with respiratory depression compared to its parental preparations. Both first-generation and second-generation antipsychotics were used due to their brain-calming effect. Oral mouth-dissolving preparations of Olanzapine, Risperidone (both mouth dissolving and solution base preparation), Haloperidol, and Quetiapine have been used for a long time.[33] Sublingual Asenapine has also shown its effectiveness in managing acute behavioural changes.[33] Recently FDA approved inhaled form of Loxapine for the management of acute violent behaviour associated with schizophrenia and bipolar.[37] But the availability of bronchodilator medication should be ensured due to its serious adverse effect of bronchospasm. Commonly used medication and their adverse reactions are given in Table 8.Table 8: Various medication options available for rapid tranquilization, their dosage and maximum dose in 24 h and waiting interval[ 33 , 36 , 38 ]Parenteral treatment Intramuscular preparations of Olanzapine, Haloperidol, Aripiprazole, Lorazepam, and Diazepam have been used for a long. Research has not shown the parental route has any advantage over the oral route in treatment efficacy but the onset of action is rapid with the parental route. A large observational study shows IM Olanzapine is more effective than all other second-generation antipsychotics. The combination of IM midazolam and IM haloperidol is more effective than IM haloperidol alone.[2] NICE recommends intramuscular lorazepam should always try before haloperidol in case of insufficient information to guide the choice of medication.[2] Partial response to intramuscular lorazepam NICE recommends repeated doses of lorazepam based on considering risks and benefits. But in case of the partial response of intramuscular haloperidol addition of intramuscular promethazine should be tried.[2] Avoid the use of a combination of olanzapine intramuscular preparation with an intramuscular benzodiazepine in case of alcohol use.[38] ECG must be carried out before haloperidol because of the risk of QT prolongation.[2,38] The intravenous route is no longer advised as an initial choice for rapid tranquillization.[2,38] Intravenous midazolam is more closely associated with respiratory depression. Flumazenil should have been kept handy whenever the intravenous injection of benzodiazepine is given.[38] Medication to be consider in various psychological conditions [Table 9] and consideration in case of the special populations mention in Table 10.Table 9: The table shows various psychological conditions and medication to be considered[ 32 , 37 , 43 ]Table 10: Consideration in case of special populations[ 2 , 33 , 38 ]Management of agitation in emergency and consultation liaison specific should refer to specific guidelines by Raveesh et al.[43] Monitoring in case of rapid tranquillization Monitoring of sedation with appropriate tools and rating scales like the Ramsay scale, Richmond Agitation Sedation scale, and Sedation Assessment Tool should be carried out and postsedation documentation about the incident and trying to find out the cause for such behaviour is also an important part in the management of patients.[2] If possible, provide one-to-one nursing and eyesight observation for better management of the condition. Continuous monitoring of vital signs is as mentioned follows [Table 11].Table 11: Physical health monitoring in case of rapid tranquillizationFrequent monitoring of vitals every 15-20 min should be ideally carried out for high-risk patients.[2] One should also need to be watchful for acute side effects of antipsychotic medicines like Acute Dystonia, Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome, Acute Confusional State, Hypotension, Irregular Heart rates, and Respiratory Depression due to benzodiazepine.[38,44] Also staff should be trained in providing basic life-saving resuscitation and use of flumazenil in case of severe respiratory depression. Further investigations are required before giving a repeating dosage of medications and rule-out medical causes and medical comorbidities. If the patient is calm and cooperative for mental status examination, then an attempt should be made for the same. Uncooperative violent and aggressive patient at home For emergencies, medical treatment for mental illness may be provided by a registered medical practitioner to a person with mental illness either at a health establishment or in the community with the informed consent of a nominated representative. A nominated representative should be available at the time of evaluation. An emergency is to be considered and needs immediate intervention to prevent: Death or irreversible harm to the health of a person; Person inflicting serious harm to himself or to others; and Person causing serious damage to property belonging to himself or to others where such behavior is believed to flow directly from the person's mental illness. For the purpose of treatment, only the situations mentioned above can be considered. Emergency treatment duration is to be considered up to 72 hours from the initial evaluation by a registered medical practitioner/psychiatrist. Emergency treatment includes transportation of a person with mental illness to the nearest mental healthcare establishment for assessment and management If management at home is not possible or unaffordable relatives or caregivers of such patients should approach the nearest police station for escorting him/her to the nearest psychiatric care facility for management. Management of chronic aggressive and assaultive behaviour In some cases, aggressive and assaultive behaviour may persist for a longer duration. The use of specific medication should be required to control future behaviour. Use of a particular medication is based on consideration of clinical features and mechanism of action of the medication. Since no medication has been approved for this specific indication.[45] The clinician must have to consider other groups of medication apart from antipsychotics and benzodiazepine (i.e., mood stabilizing antiepileptics, antidepressants). The clinician should also try to diagnose underlying psychopathology in-depth and consider substance misuse and personality-related problems in the case of chronic aggressive behaviour. Prolonged use of antipsychotics in the elderly population should be considered against the risks and benefits.[45] Workplace violence in psychiatry Victims of workplace violence subsequently may develop psychological trauma, work avoidance, guilt feeling, powerlessness, and changes in relationships. A follow-up program for addressing these abovementioned responses may be needed that includes counseling, critical incident stress debriefing, an employee-assistance program, and support groups.[24] Safety and health training All staff members should be trained in de-escalation techniques. Training can improve knowledge about hazards and safety measures. Patient, client, and setting-related risk factors include Working directly and alone with a person having a history of violence, substance abuse, gang membership, and possession of arms. Faulty design of working place that may impede safe escape. A deficit in means of emergency communication. Transporting patients. Working in a criminal neighborhood.[24] Organizational risk factors Poor staff training and policies, understaffing, inadequate security, overcrowded patients, and unrestricted movement in hospitals are the organizational risk factors.[24] Training of health workers to reduce risk and violence The topics for training may include a policy for violence prevention and documentation, possible risk factors, warning signs, diffusing anger and methods of dealing with hostile patients, safety devices and safe rooms, a response action plan, and self and staff defense.[24] Appropriate training of supervisors to recognize dangerous situations so that they can avoid putting staff in such risky situations. SUMMARY Aggressive and assaultive behavior is a complex issue and is dealt with effectively with an appropriate management plan. Environmental modification and the safety of another person and the patient should be our priorities. Nonpharmacological methods should be the choice of initial response in case of such acute behavioral disturbance. A pharmacological approach should be used only in case of failure of other strategies. Extensive monitoring of physical health and trying to find out underlying psychopathological issues should be important aspects of care. Certain points like the definition of treatment end points, proper assessment instrument for response measurement, and issues related to consent and library of patients required further research in this area.

The disorder was first described in 1886 as dysmorphophobia in the European medical literature, but not officially included as a distinct diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association until 1987. According to the DSM‐IV‐R, diagnostic criteria include(1) a preoccupation with an imagined or slight appearance defect; if slight defect is apparent, the person's concern is extreme; (2) the preoccupation results in significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning; and (3) the preoccupation is not due to another psychiatric disorder (e.g., anorexia nervosa). A diagnosis of Delusional Disorder, Somatic Type can also be applied to persons who hold their distorted beliefs with delusional intensity. BDD is currently categorized as Somatoform Disorder, although it has been argued that it is more appropriately classified as an obsessive‐compulsive spectrum disorder or an affective spectrum disorder.",

      "abstract": "Frailty is a common, but under-described, condition in older people, that is now better understood thus aiding better identification and treatment. It is characterised by multisystem deterioration and loss of physiological reserve to cope with insults. The traditional physical phenotype of frailty comprises 5 key findings: weakness, sarcopaenia, weight loss, physical inactivity, and slowness (which are also modulated by psychosocial factors). Several inflammatory, endocrine and nutritional markers have been proposed as contributory, although cause-and-effect is not clear. Predisposing factors are early childhood development and lifestyle, followed by physical inactivity, chronic disease, and anorexia/ malnutrition in later adulthood. These may form a cycle of deterioration. Frailty predisposes to marked decline in physical and mental function resulting from even apparently small insults. This commonly manifests as a \"domino\" effect, with a small initial insult leading to a cascade of adverse events. Several interventions have been shown to be helpful for frail older adults including exercise programs, nutritional support, maximising function prior to a planned interventions such as surgery, and early intervention when an acute insult threatens independence. Specialist geriatric assessment and management identifies and treats unstable medical conditions, reviews polypharmacy, facilitates early mobilisation, offers nutritional support, and assesses social circumstances. Frail older people in whom function has been compromised may be labelled as \"unable to cope\" but in fact many benefit from early comprehensive geriatric assessment to enable them to regain lost function.",

      "title": "Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Unmasked through Recurrent Psychogenic Cough",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition that develops following exposure to traumatic events such as actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence, which one experiences, witnesses, or listens to.[1] Although the research into the concept and diagnosis of PTSD remains debatable, it typically manifests through reliving experiences, avoidance behavior toward trauma reminders, and hyperarousal. However, the new description of trauma itself has become fluid, with atypical and low magnitude experiences like watching an animation series or eating spoiled food are also equated to trauma.[2] Further, dissociation and somatization are reported in as much as 70% of cases of PTSD.[3] Furthermore, there are atypical manifestations of PTSD, especially in children, such as repetitive play involving traumatic events, sleep disturbances, self-blame, behavioral regression, and somatization.[4] This case highlights an unusual manifestation of PTSD, where a recurrent non-productive cough emerged as the predominant symptom in the absence of any identifiable organic pathology, a symptom currently not reported as a part of PTSD in the literature. While standard management includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), this report also supports the existing evidence for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in refractory PTSD,[5] which has not been useful in dissociative disorders. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient. This is the case of a 19-year-old male, currently studying for a diploma, who was first seen at the age of 13 (in 2019) in this hospital with complaints of abrupt episodes of fearfulness and palpitation with eventual loss of consciousness lasting for approximately half an hour. This was triggered by thoughts of traumatic events, of being beaten by his father's employer on one occasion, and bullying in school. It was accompanied by academic underperformance, disturbed sleep, and intermittent absenteeism from school. There were no obvious reliving experiences. His developmental milestones were reportedly normal. He was given a diagnosis of dissociative disorder and a differential diagnosis of PTSD. He was started on 2.5 mg of escitalopram per day. Subsequently, he was lost to follow-up. In August 2024, he was once again referred to our hospital with complaints of intense, non-productive coughing spells lasting about 1 h, associated at times with chest pain, palpitations, and anxiety. He was first evaluated by emergency medicine, cleared of organicity, and then referred to psychiatry. Further exploration revealed a history of repeated physical abuse by his father's employer using a belt or stick, that lasted for more than a year during 2021–2022. Both families stayed in the same compound, and the employer and his son would do this when his parents were away at work. This was because he was not good at studies. It was stopped later when his father reprimanded his employer. However, the patient started to get episodes of coughing as explained above. The local physician referred him to a psychiatrist who again started him on escitalopram 10 mg/day, but it was not effective this time. The patient was taken to another psychiatrist who gave him dothiepin 50 mg/day. As it was also ineffective, even after several months, he was referred to us. He was provisionally diagnosed as having a dissociative disorder. However, on serial mental status examination, it was revealed that whenever his class teacher yelled at or punished any student, this would remind him of the abuse that had happened to him at home, and he would start coughing for hours. It was as if he was being beaten up then and there. He would avoid any situation that involved yelling or any kind of abuse, as it would trigger such episodes. At school, he would remain vigilant of such events happening and used to have frequent absences. His diagnosis of PTSD as per International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11) was confirmed, based on the history of trauma, reliving experiences expressed as cough, avoidance of the school environment that reminds him of trauma, and being vigilant when at school or wherever he perceives threats. He was started on desvenlafaxine, propranolol, and clonazepam, and the dose was built up to 150 mg, 40 mg, and 1 mg, in that order. Both the patient and his family were educated regarding the nature and course of the illness as well as the importance of adherence to treatment. The grounding techniques and relaxation techniques were taught to the patient. He was partially better and was discharged after 10 days. However, the patient reported with worsening of cough despite medication, in October 2024. Further increase in the dose of desvenlafaxine to 200 mg did not help, prompting consideration of rTMS. He underwent 20 sessions of intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) targeting the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, over 5 days, as per the evidence.[6] Following this, he showed rapid improvement in cough frequency, with alleviation of anxiety symptoms. He was discharged on 200 mg desvenlafaxine, 10 mg buspirone, 0.75 mg clonazepam, and 1 mg risperidone was added for the excessive fear as a trauma response. He was maintaining well during follow-ups in November and December. However, due to significant improvement, he abruptly stopped medication in January 2025 and reported back in February 2025, following the trigger of witnessing a road traffic accident, presenting again with cough episodes. Given prior good response, rTMS was re-initiated, and desvenlafaxine 100 mg and clonazepam 0.5 mg were reintroduced. The patient showed significant clinical improvement by the end of 20 sessions of rTMS. Grounding techniques and breathing exercises were reinforced, and the patient was discharged on the same medication. He has been coming ever since for follow-up and psychotherapy sessions on stress management and relaxation. This case highlights a rare and strikingly atypical presentation of PTSD, in which psychogenic cough emerged as the predominant symptom, overshadowing the usual features such as reliving experiences, avoidance, and hyperarousal, but triggered by trauma reminders. It brings attention to the complex and often underappreciated interplay between psychological trauma, dissociative responses, and somatic symptomatology. Such presentations challenge conventional diagnostic frameworks and underscore the need for clinical vigilance in identifying non-traditional manifestations of trauma-related disorders. Although superficially it appears to be a dissociative disorder, the trauma and demonstrable reliving, avoidance, and hypervigilance established the diagnosis of PTSD. There are published atypical presentations of PTSD. A child perceived an animation series as traumatic and was later diagnosed with PTSD.[2] An African refugee in America presented with chronic abdominal and back pain, which was later found to be a trauma response to stabbing and hence was diagnosed with PTSD.[7] A 12-year-old girl with a history of ankle sprain after a road traffic accident persisted to have chronic ankle pain and PTSD, was diagnosed.[8] A Turkish soldier presented with spontaneous ejaculations, and it was his presentation of PTSD.[9] Our patient reported a recurrent cough. The case further exemplifies the importance of a comprehensive, mu ltimodal treatment, incorporating pharmacotherapy, neuromodulation (rTMS), and psychotherapy. The patient's significant clinical improvement following rTMS reinforces its therapeutic value among poor responders to conventional treatment of PTSD. Despite growing evidence supporting its efficacy,[10] rTMS remains underutilised, possibly due to limited accessibility and high costs. All in all, PTSD can have diverse presentations, and clinicians' careful assessment is the key.

      "title": "Behavioral Changes Associated with Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Epilepsy can be accompanied by changes in cognition, personality, affect, and other elements of behavior. There is no single epileptic constitution or personality complex. A unifying theme to the behavior in epilepsy is diversity. As one looks at the behavioral traits reported in epilepsy, a specific and consistent pattern is lacking. Rather, extremes of behavior are accentuated: sometimes in one direction, often in both directions. Changes in emotional state are prominent among behavioral features in epilepsy. Some authors describe a prominent deepening or increase in emotionality, whereas others identify a global decrease in emotional life and content. Emotional lability is also reported. Sexuality and libido are typically decreased, but fetishism, transvestism, exhibitionism, and hypersexual episodes also occur. Concerns over morality may be lacking or exaggerated. Patients may be irritable and aggressive or timid and apathetic. The impressive list of people with epilepsy in politics, religion, arts, and sciences suggests a positive expression of this behavioral spectrum. Psychosis, depression, paranoia, and personality disorders may represent a negative pole of epilepsy-related behavioral changes. The most important aspect of behavioral changes in epilepsy for physicians is to recognize and treat dysfunctional behavior. Depression is a common problem that is often unrecognized and untreated. Other treatable problems include impotence, anxiety, panic attacks, and psychosis. Identifying risk factors will, it is hoped, assist in developing methods to prevent these disorders.",

And social reverse represents all the failures of the ego in contact with others—serious business losses, disappointments in love, attempts which have not reached their goal. Remembering that neurosis means a reaction to something, we, as physicians, must not be content when we label a man neurotic until we have sought behind the scene for the reverse responsible.

When someone becomes ill in this way, it is known as a psychotic episode. This is serious, but uncommon in childhood, accounting for less that 1% of reported mental health problems. Possible symptoms of a psychotic ‘episode’ Confused thinking Everyday thoughts are jumbled, sentences become unclear or nonsensical. A person might find it difficult to concentrate on conversations or remember things. Thoughts are perceived to speed up or slow down. Delusions (false beliefs) Young people can be convinced of their belief (e.g. working as a government spy), and will attempt to give plausible responses to any challenging argument.

      "abstract": "Self-injury is a mental health–related behavior people engage in to feel pain because they feel numb, to experience physical pain to ease their psychological pain, or to experience an emotional release. Self-injury is more common in patients with other co-occurring anxiety or mood disorders. An addictive component to self-injury has been identified related to an increase in dopamine levels from the self-injury, which then disrupts normal dopamine production similar to substance use disorders. Instruments are available to help identify patients who self-injure along with questions that should be asked in the course of a mental health assessment and physical examination. Patients with self-injury should be treated for any underlying mental health disorder as well as for self-injury, which includes therapy strategies and medications. Nurses can play a vital role in identifying and treating this disorder, which carries risk factors including infection, accidental death, and a higher risk of suicide.

Maniacal problems, similar to schizophrenia, include psychosis that normally influences you without precedent for the late teenager years or early adulthood. Youngsters are particularly prone to get it, yet specialists don't have the foggiest idea why. Indeed, even before what specialists call the principal scene of psychosis (FEP), you may show slight changes in the manner in which you act or think. This is known as the prodromal period and could last days, weeks, months, or even years. Some of the time you can put some distance between realities in any event, when you don't have an essential maniacal ailment like schizophrenia or bipolar problem.",

Thus a specific role for neurochemical or neuroendocrine factors certainly cannot be postulated or elucidated to explain such behavior in its entirety. Even when the term “antisocial” is used in other than a legal or criminological sense – for example, when it is applied in psychiatric diagnostics in an attempt to define and understand individual human behavior more fully – it remains overinclusive. From a clinical standpoint, the term “antisocial” most often signifies antisocial personality disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 1952, 1968, 1980), which in the third edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) is considered an “axis II” personality disorder, which may or may not coexist with certain “axis I” clinical syndromes or other conditions. Simply stated, this means that, according to current diagnostic nomenclature, an antisocial personality disorder theoretically could coexist with an organic mental disorder, substance use disorder, paranoid disorder, depressive disorder, psychosexual disorder, and so on.",

Reaction to pain cannot be easily generalized; group differences are postulated, based on sex, age, culture, psychiatric diagnosis and personality variables. Early developmental aspects of pain and discussed in animal studies and case reports but little systematic data exist. Experimental findings show the influence on pain response of cognitive and emotional factors. Clinically, the variables determining perception, reporting and reaction to pain are numerous and harder to study scientifically. Acute and chronic pain should be distinguished: the latter is more complicated, leading of ten to diagnostic problems and management stalemates. Discovering the relationship of pain to emotional phenomena, as cause or effect, is difficult, though essential to effective treatment. Various frames of reference apply: e.g., individual medical, familial, and \"workmen's compensation\" models. Reaction by family, lawyer, or work commission involves potential secondary gain and may reinforce or discourage pathological responses by the patient. The potential of pain for symbolic meaning and its acceptance as a \"legitimate\" medical symptom renders it ideal for both expression and masquerading of intrapsychic and interpersonal conflicts involving anger, punishment, control and dependency. Teaching about pain and its significance is best done in clinical settings such as obstetrical units and multidisciplinary pain clinics. Videotaped modular presentations with discussion provide a satisfactory though less desirable alternative.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Depressive illness in the elderly may be the result of a physical illness, the cause of secondary physical problems, coincidental tophysical illness or the result of an aetiological factor common to both conditions. Analysis of a cross‐sectional community sample of 396 elderly people showed depression to be significantly linked to presence of headaches, dyspnoea, and malignant disease known to the patient. It was not linked with heart disease nor arthritis per se , although those on anti‐arthritic or analgesic medication were significantly more depressed. The subjective description of physical health given by the patient also correlated strongly with depression. Depressive illness is sometimes unrecognized and frequently untreated with a consequent reduction in quality of life for many patients. Clinicians must be aware of the possibility that depression may coexist with physical illness, and that both conditions may need appropriate treatment. Further analysis of the above sample, controlling for physical illness and the additive effect of the variables concerned, showed depression to be positively correlated with adverse social factors such as not going out because of physical disability, feeling lonely, having a shopper and having hearing difficulties. The home help service was identified as a probable protective factor, implying the importance of this service in supporting the emotional as well as the physical needs of its clients.",

This syndrome is characterized by contractures resulting in fixation of the larger articulations (hips, shoulders, elbows andknees) in defective postures, and by motor difficulties of a special type—contraction, paralysis or an association of both—localized in the distal ends of the limbs and producing a condition described by the French as \"main figée\" (palsied stiff hand) and \"pied bot réflexe\" (reflex club foot).

      "abstract": "The delusional misidentification syndromes (DMS) are a group of disorders, characterized by patients mistaking the identity of people they know, although they recognize them physically. The term DMS is an umbrella term which may cover disorders whose definition extends to objects other than people, such as animals, places, or familiar material objects. The most common and best known DMS is Capgras syndrome. In this disorder, the misidentification leads to the delusional conviction that a close friend or relative has been replaced by an identical - or almost identical - \"double,\" whose original has disappeared. This double is an imposter without name or identity. Most often considered as a persecutor, the double may be subjected to aggression, which may be very violent. Neuropsychological hypotheses based on cerebral dysfunctions are now commonly considered to be at the origin of the disorder. They have been elaborated from achievements in the neurosciences, particularly the facial recognition models. In return, knowledge about the normal cognitive processes involved in recognition and familiarity has benefited from the work that cognitive neuropsychiatry has invested in these disorders. The DMS are observed in various contexts of morbidity: primary psychiatric diagnosis, or secondary to various organic disorders, particularly in neurodegenerative disease; they are rarely met in isolated form. Most often, they develop in line with the associated pathology. In the absence of consensual clinical description, the epidemiology of DMS is uncertain; they may be more frequent than previously supposed. There is no specific treatment for these disorders; neuroleptics are generally used in association with treatment of the concomitant disorder. The frequent association of DMS with organic disorders which may be curable and the particularly dangerous profile of these patients are factors that underline the need for better screening.",

DMS) is thought to be related to dissociation between recognition and identification processes. DMS was described for the first time in 1932 as a variant of the Capgras syndrome and is currently on the DSM-V list of diseases as an independent disease entity. Patients affected by DMS believed that people around them, most often family, have changed physically (appearance) and mentally (character). Other symptoms include confabulation, derealization or depersonalization. In patients, aggressive behavior is often observed, aimed at alleged doppelgangers resulting from the sense of being cheated and manipulated. With the intermetamorphosis syndrome, for example, schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder or other misidentification syndromes (Fregoli's, Capgras) may coexist. There is also a reverse intermetamorphosis, where the object of the changed appearance or character becomes the patient himself. One of its forms may be lycanthropy. The etiology of the intermetamorphosis has not been fully understood, one of the reasons may be brain damage and changes in the parietal and/or temporal lobes of the right hemisphere. It may then damage long neuronal connections to the frontal areas of the brain, disturbances of working memory (WM) accountable for the keep and online management of data, so that it is available for further processing, and the patient's will be uncritical. The basic method of diagnosis of this delusion is a medical interview with the patient. Other diagnostic methods include computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, EEG and ERPs. Experimental methods include searching for the neuromarker of DMS. Currently, there are no treatment guidelines of this delusional disorder, and pharmacotherapy experimental, but the drugs from the group of neuroleptics and lithium seem effective. Some hope for the treatment is created by neurotherapy, but it is also experimental.",

Following a historical overview of pain theories, we present the leading theory of chronic pain, which is a biopsychosocial theory incorporating psychological, affective, cognitive, and physiological factors as key contributors to the development and maintenance of chronic pain symptoms. We summarize evidence supporting the important contribution of each of these factors and how they interact to culminate in the chronic pain experience.

If an individual can cope successfully with the environmental challenge, little or no stress is experienced, the challenge is viewed as only minimal stressful and no major health consequences seem to arise. If an individual cannot cope or needs a great deal of effort to cope, stress is experienced, the environmental event becomes stressful and major health consequences seem to arise.

      "title": "Causes and Risk Factors for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: The Importance of Right Diagnosis and Treatment",
      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious debilitating syndrome with significant personal, social, and economic consequences. People with PTSD experience one or more major symptoms that include flashbacks and paranoia, difficulty in interpersonal relationships, and problems engaging in work and activities of daily living. In severe cases they can harm themselves or the others; but these events are preventable by appropriate therapies. PTSD is a well-characterized serious psychological and behavioural abnormality that occurs after exposure to one or more acute severe stressful events. It often occurs among soldiers returning from battlefields and the civilian victims of war. However, it also occurs in non-war situations, such as terrorist attacks or serious accidents; sexual abuse, rape, or other violent acts; and school or workplace bullying, harassment, or retaliation. Nevertheless, the diagnosis of PTSD is made too infrequently, particularly in the post-conflict periods in developing countries. This is in part because of inadequate awareness but also due to limited resources and expertise. Consequently, the resources for clinical care and research are diverted to other forms of behavioral issues, such as adjustment disorders. The treatment of PTSD needs to be well coordinated so that all stakeholders work synergistically using the resources necessary for the prolonged treatment and follow-ups. PTSD is underdiagnosed, and even misdiagnosed or mislabeled as depression or adjustment disorders. The failure to make a timely diagnosis or mislabeling of PTSD likely will harm victims and their families and may lead to negative outcomes, including suicide. The provision of appropriate, well organized, individualized, cost-effective treatment plans should alleviate PTSD symptoms and enable those with the disorder to return to their normal productive lives.

      "title": "Causes and Risk Factors for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: The Importance of Right Diagnosis and Treatment",
      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious debilitating syndrome with significant personal, social, and economic consequences. People with PTSD experience one or more major symptoms that include flashbacks and paranoia, difficulty in interpersonal relationships, and problems engaging in work and activities of daily living. In severe cases they can harm themselves or the others; but these events are preventable by appropriate therapies. PTSD is a well-characterized serious psychological and behavioural abnormality that occurs after exposure to one or more acute severe stressful events. It often occurs among soldiers returning from battlefields and the civilian victims of war. However, it also occurs in non-war situations, such as terrorist attacks or serious accidents; sexual abuse, rape, or other violent acts; and school or workplace bullying, harassment, or retaliation. Nevertheless, the diagnosis of PTSD is made too infrequently, particularly in the post-conflict periods in developing countries. This is in part because of inadequate awareness but also due to limited resources and expertise. Consequently, the resources for clinical care and research are diverted to other forms of behavioral issues, such as adjustment disorders. The treatment of PTSD needs to be well coordinated so that all stakeholders work synergistically using the resources necessary for the prolonged treatment and follow-ups. PTSD is underdiagnosed, and even misdiagnosed or mislabeled as depression or adjustment disorders. The failure to make a timely diagnosis or mislabeling of PTSD likely will harm victims and their families and may lead to negative outcomes, including suicide. The provision of appropriate, well organized, individualized, cost-effective treatment plans should alleviate PTSD symptoms and enable those with the disorder to return to their normal productive lives.

      "title": "A glossary on psychiatric epidemiology",
      "abstract": "Psychiatric epidemiology constitutes an important subdiscipline of scientific psychiatry. Nevertheless, it still lags behind other branches of epidemiology. This has been attributed to the difficulties encountered in conceptualising and measuring mental disorders.1 It is only recently that the emphasis in the field has shifted from descriptive to analytical research and this is probably because of the influences from genetic epidemiology and social sciences.2 Psychiatric epidemiology has taken most of its tools from general epidemiology—that is, chronic disease epidemiology.3 It is therefore not surprising that no fundamental differences between the mother discipline and her psychiatric descendant exist. Yet, there are particular challenges in the conduct of psychiatric epidemiological research that are absent or less prominent in general, mostly somatically oriented, epidemiology.4 Challenges particularly encountered in psychiatric epidemiology include\n\n\n\n1. Assessment of caseness: psychiatric diagnoses are mostly made on the basis of symptoms—patients’ reports of their subjective experiences—and not signs, like fever in general medicine. Moreover, there are no pathognomonic symptoms or signs;\n\n2. Neither most mental disorders nor their best-known risk factors, like social deprivation, stress exposure, lack of social support, social isolation, abnormal personality traits or genetic liability, are as easily captured in a singular variable as tends to be the case in the epidemiology of somatic disease;\n\n3. Making a psychiatric diagnosis is costly in time and effort; and\n\n4. Information bias and non-response bias are more of a problem in psychiatric epidemiology than in other branches of epidemiology.\n\n\n\nIn our view, this warrants recognition of the epidemiology subspecialty “psychiatric epidemiology”.\n\nIn trying to cope with the above-mentioned challenges, psychiatric epidemiology has developed a set of concepts, albeit limited, and vocabulary of its own. The purpose of this glossary is to provide brief definitions, sometimes with comments, of frequently used special terms one may come across in dealing with …",

      "title": "Extreme Psychospiritual States Versus Organic Brain Disease: Bringing Together Science and the Human Factor",
      "abstract": "Extreme states can be psychospiritual and “functional” in origin or they can be “organic” and driven by biological dysfunction. Contemporary psychiatry largely rejects this distinction, preferring to insist that everything “extreme” is biological in origin; but the distinction is important for understanding and helping people. Psychospiritual crises, including those labeled bipolar or schizophrenic, are “functional” and express meaning. As “bizarre” as the language or the symbols may seem, meanings that often reflect childhood abuse can be explored in a trusting, kind, and caring therapeutic relationship. The more that a real biological or organic dysfunction, such as traumatic head injury or neurotoxic exposure, is the root cause of the extreme state, the less sense its manifestations will make. Nonetheless, drug-induced extreme states, even when caused by hallucinogens or by psychiatric “medicines,” often leave sufficient brain function operational to reveal important meanings about the person’s experience, along with the otherwise senseless intoxication. With so many people prescribed psychiatric drugs, these neurotoxic chemicals are now the most common cause of extreme states in clinical practice, and withdrawal from these offending agents is critical to recovery (Breggin, 2013). However, even when the extreme state is driven by neurological dysfunction, a safe space and skilled therapists can help relieve the individual’s otherwise overwhelming feelings of anxiety or terror.",

      "title": "The Antecedents of Misdiagnosis: When Normal Behaviors of Gifted Children Are Misinterpreted As Pathological",
      "abstract": "A patient walks into the physician's office and presents with a unique set of symptoms. To the physician, this is an unknown illness—the symptom presentation is unusual, like nothing he has ever seen before. Despite a thorough search, there is no information about it in the medical journals, and he hadn't heard about anything like it in medical school. He consults with colleagues and finds they haven't seen this either. He wonders, ‘What is going on here?’ He realizes he is in uncharted territory and attempts to fit the patient's symptomatology into his existing knowledge, finally determining that it is close to Disorder X, but not completely. In the absence of information about the specific situation, the physician uses his current knowledge and framework to explain the situation as best he can. Does this situation sound unusual? Is this something one might expect? When it comes to gifted children, this situation is often more the norm than the exception. Gifted children come with a set of characteristics that are often unknown to a typical medical or mental health professional because professionals receive little, if any, training about the characteristics, social/emotional development, or special needs of gifted individuals. When a gifted child presents to a professional who has no knowledge of gifted children, it is likely that the professional will fit the presenting behaviors or ‘symptoms’ into a framework with which he is familiar, perhaps saying that it looks like this disorder or that disorder, but has an unusual presentation that does not fit any diagnostic criteria completely. He may use the Not Otherwise Specified label for the condition, and it is unlikely that the professional will use giftedness as a frame to explain the behavior, due to lack of experience or knowledge about giftedness. This paper explores and explains much of the inadvertent misdiagnosis of gifted individuals.",

      "abstract": "In the older population, one of the serious health concerns that are associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) is a depressive disorder. Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

      "abstract": "It is in the nature of trauma to elude knowledge, both because of deficit and defence. Massive trauma cannot be grasped because there are neither words nor categories of thought adequate to its representation; knowledge of trauma is also fiercely defended against, as it poses a momentous threat to psychic integrity. Yet knowing nevertheless occurs on some level, often in restricted or defensive forms. This paper sets forth various forms of knowing and not knowing massive historical trauma as manifested in clinical symptomatology, transference phenomena, life themes and witnessing narratives. Metaphor is also mentioned as yet another form of knowing and addressing trauma, available primarily to those who have not been directly affected as victims nor as family members of victims. The different forms imply a continuum of progressively more integrated and subjectively owned levels of knowing, directly related to the actual and psychological distance from the traumatic event. Illustrations drawn from clinical and testimonial settings are given for each level of knowing described, and implications for therapeutic strategy are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Depression and moral masochism are inseparable, and originate in a particular climate of lived experience in which one or both parents suffer from a masochistic-depressive disposition. Developmentally, there has been a deficit in the child's experience of shared pleasure, and of being a source of enjoyment to the parent. Instead, the child experiences himself or herself as a source of pain and feels responsible for the parent's dysphoric, anhedonic state. This is not simply a fantasy construction of the child, as parental reproachfulness is characteristically encountered. The child makes reparative efforts, but they generally do not succeed. Central psychological capacities are compromised under these conditions, particularly a sense of personal efficacy and of natural entitlement. The evolution of initiative, autonomy, and individuation are also significantly affected. The aggression, both conscious and unconscious, which is generated by these early conditions creates intrapsychic conflict which further inhibits the development of these essential psychological functions. Some therapeutic recommendations are proposed based on these considerations.",

      "title": "OCCUPATIONAL STRESS IN COMPUTER OPERATORS",
      "abstract": "During work, a person is exposed to various types of stressors that can negatively affect an individual's health and reduce labor productivity. Irrational organization of work, poor interpersonal relations in the team, too short deadlines for the realization of the work tasks, inadequate microclimatic conditions, non-ergonomic design of equipment and tools, as well as accelerated changes and innovations in technology, which require additional education and acquisition of new knowledge and skills, are just some of the factors that negatively burden the person who works.In response to occupational stress, disorders occur on a physiological, psychological and behavioral level. Under conditions of stress, a person, as a social and emotional being eager for affirmation and proof, turns to some bad habits, such as consuming cigarettes, alcohol, psychostimulant substances or anxiolytics, which additionally have a bad effect on health. Employees who are exposed to chronic stress cannot be expected to achieve the desired professional results because they lose motivation, innovative thinking and increased absenteeism from work. Stress often worsens without the support of relatives, the environment and colleagues. Therefore, early recognition of signs of stress, identification of stressors and taking measures and procedures to combat unwanted factors, as well as providing support are of great importance for both human health and to reduce company costs.In this paper, we surveyed 120 computer operators, 72.5% female, average age 37.6 years, and 27.5% male, average age 39.2 years old. 7.8% had a high school diploma, 8.6% higher education, and 83.6% high education. Among them, 32.5% stated that they have moderate, while 29.2% state that they have a high level of stress at work. Poor working conditions and short deadlines are cited as the most common reasons. Of these, 25.6% associated stress with the current epidemiological situation of Covid-19. A significant percentage, 25.2% feel worn out or exhausted, 10% wake up tired, and 8.3% try to overcome fatigue in order to complete their work tasks.Fatigue, apathy, dissatisfaction, overtime work, „bringing work home― can negatively affect family and social relationships as well as leisure activities. There are a variety of stress management techniques at the individual and organizational levels, including group therapies, support and counseling, and breathing exercises that can help overcome the negative effects of stress. Workplace stress must be minimized, in order to ensure a favorable work environment, as well as the physical, mental and social well-being of the working man",

Much of the time, feeling a specific degree of stress and nervousness can really help support your exhibition in explicit settings. For instance, an individual may encounter a degree of uneasiness the days paving the way to a public discourse, marriage, or another large life occasion. By and large, a touch of pressure and stress can be normal and is viewed as an entirely typical response. At the point when confronted with an impending task at work, a significant occasion, or even an arranged meeting, a great many people will experience a temporary feeling of apprehension and additional strain. Notwithstanding, persevering and solid sensations of apprehension and nervousness might be a lot greater concern. Nervousness and panicky sentiments that wait long after a stressor has passed, or which happen with no unmistakable explanation, may demonstrate that you are battling with an uneasiness problem.",

      "abstract": "Social phobia is one of the most frequent psychiatric disorders, with a lifetime prevalence rate of about 3-5%. The diagnosis is relatively easy in the classical forms, with a meticulous interview when the context and the patient's complaints are in favour of this condition, but there are various cases in which the symptoms are not typical or in which other diagnoses are in the forefront. In this way, depressive and addictive disorders are frequent complications of social phobia but they often hide the primary diagnosis because of their severity. The initial and even the main complaint can also be a somatic symptom, which the patient can consider as the most disturbing, without linking it with his social anxiety. It is the case of the patients dreading to blush, shake, sweat, or to produce digestive noises in front of other persons. Finally, some social anxiety disorders have the deceptive appearance of aggressive or cold attitudes. In all these cases, the screening and the treatment of social phobia can have a crucial impact on the global prognosis, with possible significant and enduring improvements of the primary and secondary disorders.",

      "abstract": "Post-stroke mood and emotional disturbances are frequent and diverse in their manifestations. Among them, post-stroke depression is the best known. Although post-stroke anger (PSA) has been studied relatively less, it can be as frequent as depression. Manifestations of PSA range from overt aggressive behaviors (including hitting or hurting others) to becoming irritable, impulsive, hostile, and less tolerable to family members. The possible pathophysiological mechanisms of PSA include neurochemical dysfunction due to brain injury, frustration associated with neurological deficits or unfavorable environments, and genetic predisposition. PSA causes distress in both patients and their caregivers, negatively influences the patient’s quality of life, and increases the burden on caregivers. It can be treated or prevented using various methods, including pharmacological therapies. In addition, anger or hostility may also be a risk or triggering factor for stroke. The hazardous effects of anger may be mediated by other risk factors, including hypertension or diabetes mellitus. The identification of anger as a result or cause of stroke is important because strategic management of anger may help improve the patient’s quality of life or prevent stroke occurrence. In this narrative review, we describe the phenomenology, prevalence, factors or predictors, relevant lesion locations, and pharmacological treatment of PSA. We further describe the current evidence on anger as a risk or triggering factor for stroke.",

      "title": "The Physiological Aspects of the Stress",
      "abstract": "Generally the term stress refers to experiences of endangering one’s physical or psy­chological wellbeing. Physiological stress refers to bodily adaptation processes and the maintenance of body’s balance. Selye defined stress as a function of elevated corticosteroid levels and used the term stress to refer to the effects of any agent that threatens the homeostasis of the organism. The term allostasis which refers to the body’s ability to achieve stability. The allostatic load is assumed to be caused by frequent stress, lack of adaptation to repeated stress, and inability to shut down the allostatic response when the stress is over and inadequate response or dysfunction of the stress systems  Thus, psychological stress can be defined as a discrepancy between personal capacities and environmental demands. Somatic stress symptoms are related to both physiological and psychological stress. The different types of stressors are likely to elicit divergent stress reactions. The multifaceted nature of stress and various sources of stress must also be taken into account. It is important to define the stress precisely in epidemiological studies. Consequently, stress has been determined here in terms of stressful life events, experience of chronic stress, experimentally induced mental and physiological stress reactions and work stress. The work stress models that are presented here have been used extensively in studies of occupational and cardiovascular health. The inheritance of stress refers here to an innate temperament. Rationale is as follows: temperament a) has a biological basis, b) is highly inherited, and c) explains what one experiences as a stress and partly determines what the health consequences are. The common assumption in several temperament theories is that temperament plays important role in moderating stress. In the end we presented the comparative analysis between the eustress and distress.",

      "abstract": "A common neurological condition known as epilepsy is characterized by recurrent bouts of uncontrollable body movements that affect only a portion of the body (partial) or the full body (generalized), occasionally accompanied by loss of consciousness and control over bowel or bladder function. Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure. The duration of postictalphase varies from minutes to hours depending on the type of seizure, the frequency and intensity of seizures, and the length of the seizure.",

A review of the empirical literature on psychological reactions to trauma suggest that this pattern of symptoms has often been identified across different kinds of traumatic events. It is likely to constitute a psychological adaptation to a stressful event, limiting painful thoughts and feelings associated with the event and allowing the person to function at least minimally. Continuation of these symptoms, however, may impair the person's quality of life and disrupt social and other functioning. If symptoms last beyond a month following the traumatic event, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may ensue, continuing for months or even years after the precipitating event. Hence, it is important to be able to identify this pattern of reactions that may be manifested in reaction to trauma, so that appropriate intervention can be provided.

      "title": "Meaning making and psychological well being of persons living with human ammunodeficiency virus",
      "abstract": "Being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness such as HIV or cancer can be often traumatic. It can also have other devastating impact on a personâ€™s life. Earlier researches\r\non Persons Living with HIV (PLHIV) have found that HIV infection is a medical and existential crisis. PLHIV go through psychological trauma as well as social problems\r\nsuch as depression, stigma, poverty and marginalization in India and elsewhere. In India there has always been report of prejudice, exclusion and stigmatization of PLHIV. As a\r\nconsequence PLHIV tend to isolate themselves, or go into a hiding. It is already known that both in India and in other parts of the world HIV infection has a wide range of\r\npsychological, physical and social consequences which the infected individuals and their families may have to face. Stigmatization worsens this impact. Due to all these it has\r\nbeen found that PLHIV and their families have to cope with a multitude of stressors. It is also known that when individuals experience tragedies or setbacks in their\r\nlife, they respond to it in an adaptive way by ascribing positive meaning to their experience that may enable them to restore their psychological functioning or even\r\nexceed it. This is known as meaning based coping. It means that when people go through an illness such as cancer or AIDS, that threaten their integrity they are found to forma\r\ncoping strategy or plan to deal with the consequences of illnessâ€™ threat to oneâ€™s health and thereby oneâ€™s life. Search for meaning and finding positive meanings are important themes around which such adaptations occur. This has already been established in health psychology and positive psychology. The meaning-based psychological growth and wellbeing among PLHIV, however, has not been adequately explored in this country. This sets the background for an exploration of the different ways in which PLHIV ascribe\r\nmeaning to and make sense of the experience of living with HIV. Therefore the current study was undertaken with the aim of exploring the idiosyncratic meaning-making themes of PLHIV in Kerala and how they perceive their illness and its influence on their psychological wellbeing and cognitive coping. The current study has adopted a Mixed Method Convergent Parallel Design to explore the meaning that the participants attribute to their experience. The participants\r\ncomprised of 37 persons for the qualitative strand and 232 persons for the quantitative who were recruited using purposive sampling method. They were between the ages of 18 and 70 years, who have known their HIV status for at least a year and all residing in Kerala State at the time of the study. Apart from the demographic data sheet and a semistructured interview schedule, standardized tools such as the Meaning in Life Questionnaire, the Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised, the Cognitive Emotion\r\nRegulation Questionnaire-Short Form and The Psychological Wellbeing Scale were used to collect data. Analysis of the interviews with the participants identified 12 representations of HIV which were the ways in which HIV is perceived and the life with HIV is lived by the\r\nparticipants. In the analysis of the quantitative data it has been found that majority of the participants find no meaning in their present life. On Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ) majority fell under the normal category while a quarter of participants scored high on all domains. It was also found that majority of the participants did not have a sense of control over their illness. An average of 25% of the participants scored high on all the domains of the psychological wellbeing scale. Majority of the participants ruminated about their illness while 28% viewed their illness as catastrophe. The results have also\r\nidentified a few important association between gender, marriage, counselling with illness perception, coping and psychological wellbeing. The significance of the current study lies mainly on the fact that there has not been an in-depth exploration of the lived-experiences of PLHIV in India. Some of the learning of this study, such as pre-test counselling is associated with the rumination in PLHIV, can be made use of by the counsellors providing HIV/AIDS counselling to shift from focusing on the dangers of the infection to positive living with HIV diagnosis. The\r\nqualitative findings such as â€˜HIV as the spoiled identityâ€™ and â€˜HIV as isolationâ€™ highlights that stigma is the worst experience in being infected with HIV. Measures could be taken to increase the awareness of HIV so as to reduce stigma even by including discussion on HIV infection as part of the school curriculum in India. The results also\r\nindicate to the fact that there is a need for more facilities that would provide psychological care for PLHIV together with ART centers to ensure PLHIVâ€™s psychological wellbeing in this country.",

      "abstract": "There is little written in the geriatric literature about the concept of psychological frailty which encompasses cognitive, mood, and motivational components. The concept is intended to consider brain changes that are beyond normal aging, but not necessarily inclusive of disease, that result in decreased cognitive or mood resilience in the presence of modest stressors, and may eventually lead to negative health outcomes in a manner parallel to physical frailty, an entity well known to clinicians. Most work exploring the interface between cognition, mood, and physical frailty has demonstrated a bidirectional association between the two domains. Psychological symptoms or deficits have been described as either worsening the degree of physical frailty, or physical frailty has been viewed as a risk to a worsening cognition or depression. However, psychological frailty, a consequence of age-altered brain function, has not been studied for itself. By what possible mechanism does the brain reveal its loss of resiliency under modest stress and how can this be visualized? Are there markers that predate a psychological decline that might permit a preventive intervention which could delay the appearance of negative health outcomes such as reduced functional capacity or increased dependency? The present review will explore these concepts and possibilities.",

      "title": "Social trauma : consequences of emotional maltreatment on physiological reactions to social rejection in subjects with social anxiety disorder",
      "abstract": "A history of child maltreatment is associated with psychopathology, predominantly affective and anxiety disorders as well as substance abuse. In the past, research has primarily focused on the consequences of physical abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect or combinations of these types of maltreatment. However, besides physical and sexual transgressions, child maltreatment does also involve emotional abuse and emotional neglect. Although it was suggested that the consequences of emotional maltreatment might be as severe as the outcomes of physical or sexual maltreatment, there is little knowledge about the unique effects of emotional maltreatment on psychopathology. However, there is a growing body of evidence for an association of emotional maltreatment by caretakers and psychopathology, particularly social anxiety.\r\nIn addition to emotional maltreatment that involves abuse and neglect by parents and other caretakers, emotional abusive treatments (also referred to as emotional victimization) are highly prevalent among peers. Similar to emotional maltreatment by parents or caretakers, emotional peer victimization contributes to various forms of general psychopathology, e.g., depression, anger-hostility, dissociation, and drug use. However, peer victimization is particularly associated with characteristics of social anxiety disorder.\r\nSocial anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common anxiety disorder, which is characterized by persistent fear of social or performance situations, fear of negative evaluation, social avoidance of general and new situations, as well as physiological symptoms in social situations. However, the mechanisms that associate emotional maltreatment by caretakers as well as peers and social anxiety are still unknown. Models of cognitive vulnerability suggest that negative learning experiences establish associative information structures in memory that activate various stereotype and pathological behavioral programs in similar situations. This conceptualization predicts that social events may provoke more intense reactions in emotional maltreated subjects as such situations trigger associative response elements of social traumatic experiences. \r\nA key element of emotional maltreatment is social rejection. Experiences of social rejection elicit negative mood, emotional distress, and activity of neural networks that are associated with the processing of physical pain. However, because physiological reactions to social rejection were found to be ambiguous, there remains a need for clarification of the impact and direction of social rejection on other physiological measures such as heart rate and skin conductance. In socially anxious subjects, social rejection elicited immediate and delayed effects on psychological outcomes. Therefore both, physiological reactions in healthy subjects as well as increased psychological reactions in socially anxious subjects were suggested in previous studies. However, a combination of these, i.e., an investigation of physiological reactions in socially anxious subjects, was not presented, yet. This might be of specific interest, as fear of social rejection is one of the core components of social anxiety. Accordingly, socially anxious subjects should present stronger and prolonged physiological reactions to social rejection.\r\nHowever, there is so far minimal evidence that experiences of aversive social situations evoke an associative network and an activation of associative memory processing. The aim of the present work was to address this point and to explore the impact of prior emotional maltreatment on physiological reactions to social rejection. In addition, it was assumed that associative memory representations are potential links between maltreatment and social anxiety disorder. Thus, the effect of a history of emotional maltreatment on the experience of potential traumatic social events was expected to be even stronger for subjects with SAD.\r\nIn a first step, the association of emotional maltreatment with social anxiety was examined. Results indicate a relation of childhood maltreatment with psychopathology, and in particular, social anxiety symptoms. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the relative impact of emotional forms of abuse and neglect might even be higher than indicated by previous research on child maltreatment, which had mainly focused on physical and sexual types of abuse and neglect. Moreover, emotional maltreatment mediated the association of physical maltreatment and social anxiety. In addition to emotional maltreatment through parents and other caretakers, reports of emotional peer victimizations were independently related to social anxiety symptoms. Thus, it was concluded that symptoms of social anxiety are mainly predicted by emotional types of victimization, either in childhood through the caretakers, or during childhood and adolescence through peers.\r\nAs a second step, physiological reactions to social rejection were examined in healthy subjects. The results suggest that social rejection evokes reactions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) apparent in accelerated heart rates. Although the effects of social rejection did not imply changes of skin conductance levels, it was concluded that the autonomic nervous system is affected by experiences of social exclusion indicating that behavior activation rather than inhibition is associated with socially threatening events. \r\nAfter that the link between social rejection and physiological reactions had been established, it was examined whether these reactions are affected by histories of emotional maltreatment and symptoms of social anxiety. Data suggested that reactions to an episode of social exclusion were primarily influenced by the degree of relational peer victimization rather than by the diagnosis of SAD. While an increase in skin conductance immediately after the exclusion was observed for all groups of subjects, this physiological response was attenuated among the subjects with a history of peer victimization.\r\nIn general, the results provided evidence for the existence and significance of associative networks and associative memory processing that is established by experiences of emotional maltreatment. In line with memory models of traumatic events and network models of emotional processing, a history of emotional maltreatment altered physiological reactions to a social challenge. After it has been demonstrated that experiences of emotional maltreatment place individuals at risk for symptoms of social anxiety disorder, findings indicate that associative information processing may account for an enhanced cognitive vulnerability for social anxiety. Although the mechanisms involved remain uncertain, it may be speculated that altered physiological reactivity in subjects with a history of emotional maltreatment contributes to the development of social anxiety. \r\nImportantly, the findings of the present research highlight the role of emotional forms of abuse and neglect in the development of a wide range of psychological disorders. Besides the impact of emotional maltreatment on social anxiety, the present research suggested influences of emotional maltreatment on various types of psychopathology. These findings establish a cross-diagnostical perspective on the consequences of emotional maltreatment. Assuming that experiences of emotional abuse and neglect account for various forms of symptomatology, it may be speculated that a plurality of patients would benefit from treatments that address these experiences. Therefore, the development of therapeutic interventions that combine disorder-specific treatments with an approach that focuses on adverse life experiences including social trauma should be a main goal of future clinical research.",

      "abstract": "Mental Exaltation, Mania .—The question of the Prognosis in Mental Exaltation—Mania—in its various forms, is a far more debatable and uncertain matter than in melancholia. The symptoms in melancholia being of a negative character due to a lowering or suspension of brain activity, we do not look for all those diversities, endless varieties and aspects which we may find in mania, be it simple, acute, or chronic. Generally there is an increased vitality, a state of hyperæsthesia, an increase in the activity of the brain, generally of the whole brain, and we must believe that these states will not so easily end in complete resolution as the condition of merely depressed action, or rather no action, which obtains in melancholia—I mean in melancholia generally, and not those states of acute melancholia which are supposed to be closely allied to the state which in other brains and under other subjective circumstances would give rise to mania from a pathological point of view. If this increased activity does not rapidly terminate in resolution, one of two things must occur—either exhaustion or atrophy, resulting in death or dementia, will supervene, or abnormal tissue will invade or replace healthy nerve paths or areas, and chronic aberration of mind ensue.",

      "abstract": "1. Although psychological factors are an important etiological component in producing and perpetuating TMJ disorders a comprehensive view of the problem can be best understood through the concept of multifactorial etiology. 2. Psychological factors operative in TMJ disorders cannot be understood within any single frame of reference. It is appropriate to examine emotional, behavioral, and interpersonal relationships in parallel, not as dichotomous concepts. 3. The symptom complex defined in this review as \"TMJ disorders\" is the musculoskeletal component of a larger group of microtraumatic signs and symptoms, all of which are manifestations of a generalized injury-producing activity termed dysfunction. 4. More explicit diagnoses need to be identified if definitional problems involving TMJ disorders are to be overcome. 5. Classical psychoanalytic conceptualization of the etiology of TMJ disorders has not been systematically examined, but has been widely accepted and found clinically useful by some therapists. 6. Clinical impressions notwithstanding, there is little evidence to indicate that TMJ disorders are correlated with one specific personality trait. Perhaps more definitive assessments will reveal uniform personality characteristics in subclasses of TMJ patients. 7. Emotional factors (e.g., anxiety, fear, frustration, and anger) play a significant role in the etiology of TMJ disorders, in that they elicit muscular tension and oral habits. Although it would appear unlikely that emotionally induced muscle activity is a \"necessary\" factor, it is probable that it will be found a \"sufficient\" cause for TMJ disorders. 8. Learning principles, should not be considered as an alternative etiological position but should be viewed as a framework upon which any psychological theory of etiology must be based. 9. The presence of chronic pain in TMJ patients may be of as much clinical significance in the prognosis as the physical findings associated with the disorder itself. 10. The potential placebo effect resulting from any treatment, coupled with other nonspecific effects of the doctor's attitudes, remains a powerful tool that can be utilized in treating TMJ disorders. A vital ingredient in the placebo effect is the quality of the doctor-patient relationship. 11. Patient evaluation should not only include a) a search for the immediate organic stimulus or biomechanical disturbance, but also b) an assessment of situational or chronic anxiety and other emotional factors and c) an observation of interpersonal styles of behavior commonly associated with the chronically sick patient. 12. Unilateral etiological views of TMJ disorders and rigid treatment approaches need modification. Treatment involving simultaneous dental and psychological approaches appears to have more promise.",

      "title": "The subjective experience of negative symptoms: Characteristics of emotional withdrawal",
      "abstract": "According to the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), negative symptoms are those personal characteristics that are thought to be reduced from normal functioning, while positive symptoms are aspects of functioning that exist as an excess or distortion of normal functioning. Negative symptoms are generally considered to be a core feature of people diagnosed with schizophrenia. However, negative symptoms are not always present in those diagnosed, and a diagnosis can be made with only negative or only positive symptoms, or with a combination of both. Negative symptoms include an observed loss of emotional expression (affective flattening), loss of motivation or self directedness (avolition), loss of speech (alogia), and also a loss of interests and pleasures (anhedonia). Positive symptoms include the perception of things that others do not perceive (hallucinations), and extraordinary explanations for ordinary events (delusions) (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Both negative and positive symptoms are derived from watching the patient and thus do not consider the patient’s subjective experience. However, aspects of negative symptoms, such as observed affective flattening are highly contended. Within conventional psychiatry, the absence of emotional expression is assumed to coincide with an absence of emotional experience. Contrasting research findings suggests that patients who were observed to score low on displayed emotional expression, scored high on self ratings of emotional experience. Patients were also observed to be significantly lower on emotional expression when compared with others (Aghevli, Blanchard, & Horan, 2003; Selton, van der Bosch, & Sijben, 1998). It appears that there is little correlation between emotional experience and emotional expression in patients, and that observer ratings cannot help us to understand the subjective experience of the negative symptoms. This chapter will focus on research into the subjective experiences of negative symptoms. A framework for these experiences will be used from the qualitative research findings of the primary author (Le Lievre, 2010). In this study, the primary author found that subjective experiences of the negative symptoms belonged to one of the two phases of the illness experience; “transitioning into emotional shutdown” or “recovering from emotional shutdown”. This chapter will use the six themes from the phase of “transitioning into emotional shutdown”. This phase described the experience of turning the focus of attention away from the world and onto the self and the past, thus losing contact with the world and others (emotional shutdown). Transitioning into emotional shutdown involved; “not being acknowledged”, “relational confusion”, “not being expressive”, “reliving the past”, “detachment”, and “no sense of direction” (Le Lievre, 2010). Detail will be added to this framework of experience from other qualitative research in this area. We will now review the six themes that constitute a “transition into emotional shutdown” and corresponding previous research findings.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) is a secondary amenorrhea with no evidence of endocrine/systemic causal factors, mainly related to various stressors affecting neuroendocrine control of the reproductive axis. In clinical practice, HA is mainly associated with metabolic, physical, or psychological stress. Stress is the adaptive response of our body through all its homeostatic systems, to external and/or internal stimuli that activate specific and nonspecific physiological pathways. HA occurs generally after severe stressant conditions/situations such as dieting, heavy training, or intense emotional events, all situations that can induce amenorrhea with or without body weight loss and HA is a secondary amenorrhea with a diagnosis of exclusion. In fact, the diagnosis is essentially based on a good anamnestic investigation. It has to be investigated using the clinical history of the patient: occurrence of menarche, menstrual cyclicity, time and modality of amenorrhea, and it has to be exclude any endocrine disease or any metabolic (i.e., diabetes) and systemic disorders. It is necessary to identify any stressant situation induced by loss, family or working problems, weight loss or eating disorders, or physical training or agonist activity. Peculiar, though not specific, endocrine investigations might be proposed but no absolute parameter can be proposed since HA is greatly dependent from individual response to stressors and/or the adaptive response to stress. This article tries to give insights into diagnosis and putative therapeutic strategies.",

In an alternative paradigm, voices are understood as trauma-driven dissociated, disowned, or disavowed aspects of self; the goal is not to suppress them but to integrate them during psychotherapy. Auditory hallucinations are common in dissociative identity disorder, borderline personality disorder, and complex posttraumatic stress disorder and are not specific to psychosis. The features that differentiate psychotic from dissociative voices include the qualities of the voices themselves, as well as other symptoms: for example, compared with dissociative voices, psychotic voices are accompanied by less sociability, more formal thought disorder, more negative symptoms including blunted affect, and more delusions. The author proposes that the psychotherapy of dissociative voices can be indicated trans-diagnostically, including in a subgroup of individuals with diagnoses of schizophrenia. Psychotherapeutic strategies are illustrated with a case example.",

      "abstract": "There is a worse prognosis for psychosis and schizophrenia when onset is in childhood or adolescence. However, outcomes are improved with early detection and treatment. Psychotic symptoms can be associated with a variety of disorders including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, drug-induced psychosis, personality disorder, epilepsy and autistic spectrum disorder. Positive symptoms include hallucinations and delusions. Negative symptoms include apathy, lack of drive, poverty of speech, social withdrawal and self-neglect. The DSM IV criteria for schizophrenia include two or more of the following: hallucinations, delusions, disorganised speech, grossly disorganised or catatonic behaviour and negative symptoms. Adults may raise concerns about social withdrawal, bizarre ideas, a change in behaviour or a decline in achievement. Most children and young people with psychotic symptoms will not go on to develop psychosis or schizophrenia. Direct enquiry may be needed to elicit suspected unusual beliefs or hallucinations. To distinguish unusual ideas from delusions the ideas should be tested for fixity. For example by asking: 'Are you sure? Could there be another explanation?' Mood and anxiety symptoms should be explored. The assessment should include a developmental history with particular attention to premorbid functioning. Failure to make expected progress whether personal, social or academic is significant. Better outcomes in terms of symptoms and social function are associated with a shorter duration of untreated psychosis. The detection of psychotic symptoms in primary care therefore warrants an urgent referral to secondary care mental health services for assessment and treatment.",

      "title": "Grief Accompanied by Suicidal Thoughts After Traumatic Loss in Adolescent: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Grief is a normal process that occurs following the irreversible loss of a loved one. This process, characterized by painful experiences, varies widely and is influenced by numerous factors, including the identity of the deceased, the circumstances of their death, the individual characteristics of the bereaved, and the availability of support systems. The suddenness and violence of a loss can disrupt the normal grieving process, leading to the manifestation of traumatic symptoms. This phenomenon, referred to as “traumatic grief” in the literature, is associated with an increased risk of various psychiatric disorders, including major depression, anxiety disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The death of a parent represents a profound loss for an adolescent, complicating their coping mechanisms and significantly impacting their psychological well-being. Parental loss alone is a significant risk factor for suicidal behavior in adolescents. When a parent’s death is traumatic, it can further exacerbate this risk, leading to suicidal thoughts and behaviors by disrupting the normal grief process, even in adolescents who were previously mentally healthy. This article presents the diagnosis and treatment of a 17-year-old girl who exhibited active suicidal thoughts and behaviors after her father was killed with a firearm. The objective of this case report is to explore the atypical grief symptoms that can follow traumatic losses during adolescence and to assess the effectiveness of holistic approaches that combine supportive psychotherapy with pharmacotherapy in treating such cases.",

      "title": "Psychopathology of stroke",
      "abstract": "The psychopathology of stroke encompasses several psychiatric and behavioral disorders that have high prevalence in the geriatric population, reduce the patient autonomy and increase the caregiver's burden. These disorders are usually associated with other cognitive and neurological deficits, and are labelled as neuropsychiatric when the whole clinical picture is consistent with the specific dysfunction of a neural system or brain region. Thus the neuropsychiatry of stroke comprises disorders of the perception/identification of the self and the environment (anosognosia of hemiplegia, misidentification syndromes, confabulations, visual hallucinations, delirium and acute confusional state), amotivational syndromes (apathy and athymhormia), disorders of emotional reactivity (blunted affect, emotional incontinence, irritability, catastrophic reactions), poor impulse or ideation control (mania) and personality changes. The clinical profile of the subcortical vascular dementia also points to specific brain dysfunction (frontal-subcortical pathways) that manifests with behavioral (depression, emotionalism, irritability) and cognitive symptoms (psychomotor retardation, attention, executive and memory deficits). However, post-stroke depression and anxiety, which have a more variable clinical presentation and might be assimilated, for several aspects, to post-traumatic or adaptive disorders, are disorders less characterized in their neural correlates.",

      "abstract": "Abstract As we have already discussed, in much of the assessment of psychopathology the focus is on internal, unobservable processes of which there is only indirect evidence. In chapter 2, we described the signs and symptoms that comprise the main types of psychopathology. We mentioned that in addition to complaints of subjective distress (symptoms), evidence for the presence of psychopathology may also be shown in the form of abnormal behaviour, which may be self-reported by the subject or observed by a clinician/researcher or other informant (observational measures or signs). One such example of this type of evidence can be noted in the examination of children with suspected attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Evidence regarding a subject’s ADHD could consist of both the individual’s own description of their perceptions, cognitions and emotions and of observations by a clinician or, for that matter, by a parent or a teacher. Probably, the simplest way of measuring psychopathology is by the means of questionnaires. The subject or an informant/observer (such as a spouse, a close friend, parent or teacher) answers a series of questions about the subject’s behaviour and experiences, either in a written pencil and paper or computerized form. Some examples of the use of questionnaires are given in more detail elsewhere, particularly in chapters 7,8 and 9.",

      "abstract": "Patients with an acquired sensory dysfunction may experience symptoms of detachment from self or from the environment, which are related primarily to nonspecific symptoms of common mental disorders and secondarily, to the specific sensory dysfunction. This is consistent with the proposal that sensory dysfunction could provoke distress and a discrepancy between the multi-sensory frame given by experience and the actual perception. Both vestibular stimuli and vestibular dysfunction can underlie unreal experiences. Vestibular afferents provide a frame of reference (linear and angular head acceleration) within which spatial information from other senses is interpreted. This paper reviews evidence that symptoms of depersonalization/derealization associated with vestibular dysfunction are a consequence of a sensory mismatch between disordered vestibular input and other sensory signals of orientation.",

Further classication depends on a mixture of phenomenological, pathological, and genetic or other aetiological features. It is heterogeneous in aetiology, diverse in pathology, and varied in severity. Managing a case of perpipheral neuropathy brings along numerous challenges include identifying a case of peripheral neurophy and differentiating it from mimicks, working up for etiology and treatment based on aetiology. Patients can present with either positive or negative symptoms (or both) linked to motor and sensory systems or with autonomic disturbances in some neuropathies. A detailed history and physical examination provides information regarding onset, course and progression of the disease and the type of involvement like generalized, distal or proximal, symmetric or asymmetric, also the type of bre involvement like large myelinated or small unmyelinated and may give clues to neuro anatomic localization of the disease. The diagnosis can be conrmed through a appropriate investigation for the neuropathic pattern like blood tests, Cerebrospinal uid (CSF) analysis, MRI Brain, Ultrasound (USg). These test along with Electro diagnostic investigations like Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS), needle electromyography (EMG) can narrow down differentials and possible aetiologies, However in signicant cases etiology remain undiagnosed. Genetic testing is most diagnostic in carefully selected cases. Sometimes nerve biopsy and skin biopsy may be needed to conrm the etiologies.",

Although first identified and considered a memory disorder by Pick, evidence in support of this has been difficult to identify. They have been most often seen in various psychotic and organic brain diseases but lesions have been generally diffuse although the right temporal lobe has been implicated. A patient was investigated who abruptly developed a disorder wherein she misidentified her husband as her deceased sister and claimed that her home was a duplicate of her real home that were typical of Frégoli syndrome and Pick9s reduplicative paramnesia, respectively. A discrete area of brain damage, probably ischaemic, in this patient was seen on MRI in the anterior part of the right fusiform gyrus and a smaller area in the nearby anterior middle and inferior temporal gyri with associated parahippocampal and hippocampal atrophy. A high order nervous system function that is devoted to the identification of faces is located in the adjacent midportion of the fusiform gyrus and a similar locus for environmental scenes, termed the parahippocampal place area, is present in the bordering parahippocampal gyrus. The misidentification phenomena in this case can be explained by disruption of the connections of these highly specialised areas with the most anterior inferior and medial part of the right temporal lobe where long term memory and mechanisms for the retrieval of information that are required for the visual recognition of faces and scenes are stored.",

It is hypothesized that subtle diffuse axonal injury may contribute to persistent symptoms in some individuals. In all cases, the trauma experience has personal meaning for the person affected, and significant psychological reactions are common. Adaptive biological reactions occur in the postinjury period. These biological changes interact with the numerous psychological factors that come into play during the same time.",

DSM-5 includes illness anxiety disorder in the category called somatic symptom and related disorders, characterised by prominent somatic concerns, distress, and impaired functioning. More often than in psychiatric settings, individuals with illness anxiety disorder are encountered in primary care and specialist medical settings. Despite negative laboratory results, the benign course of the alleged disease over time, and adequate reassurances from specialists, their conviction of being ill persists. Illness anxiety preoccupations are heterogeneous, and the degree of insight is variable. Their illness-related preoccupation interferes with their relationships with family, friends, and coworkers. They are frequently addicted to internet searches about their feared illness, inferring the worst from the information (or false information) they uncover. Patients with illness anxiety disorder often have comorbid psychopathology, especially anxiety and depressive disorders. Typically, illness anxiety disorder is chronic. Physical symptoms are absent or mild and frequently represent a misinterpretation of normal bodily sensations. This case report presents the case of a patient diagnosed with IAD by a psychiatrist. The patient had been seen by his primary care physician and therapist for three years without any improvement in his symptoms before he was referred to a psychiatrist. After undergoing a partial thyroidectomy in 2018, this patient has been experiencing increasing symptoms of recurrent anxiety/fear consistent with IAD, despite extensive medical examinations that have consistently revealed normal results.",

Almost all of the children had attention deficit disorder. Some were obtuse or unable to interpret social cues, others could not express their feelings but appeared to be sensitive and aware of the emotions of others. The older children were generally in psychotherapy or counseling but responded poorly, suggesting that a different approach to treatment may be indicated.",

      "abstract": "Alexithymia is a tendency to experience psychological distress in the form of somatic symptoms. Alexithymia is a syndrome that is defined by the inability to recognize and express emotions. It is a common feature in patients with psychoactive abuse disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and psychosomatic disorders such as gastrointestinal complaints, migraine, dermatological symptoms, and irritable bowel syndrome. Alexithymia is associated with a failure to use adaptive affect regulation such as modulating arousal, appropriately expressing or suppressing emotions, tolerating painful emotions and cognitive assimilation. Alexithymia is presumed to play a very important role in the pathogenesis of medically unexplained physical symptoms and it is a risk factor for a psychosomatic condition. It is of clinical importance that the majority of patients with medically unexplained physical symptoms are able to recognize that their physical symptoms may be related to their depression or anxiety disorder which are the most common mental disorders.",

      "title": "Manic episode with psychotic symptoms in a patient with Pseudologia Fantastica of years of evolution. A case report",
      "abstract": "Introduction Pseudologia Fantastica (PF) also called “mythomania” is a disorder centred on the tendency of the sufferer to distort reality through constant lies. These patients find it difficult to moderate their sense of self and their self-esteem. Therefore, they display significant grandiosity, which seems to defend them from intense psychological disturbance, pretending to counteract deep feelings of unworthiness, emptiness and alienation. Notable characteristics include: normal or above average IQ, absence of formal thought disorder, poor sense of identity, poor sexual adjustment, low frustration tolerance, strong dependency needs and narcissism. The phenomenon of “imposture” (the person’s claim of achievement or having connections to famous or influential people) is frequent. The patient’s history often shows that one or both parents were experienced as rejecting figures. They are more likely to be involved in legal problems and 20% receive some form of psychiatric treatment. The aetiology and pathogenesis of this disorder requires consideration of developmental disturbances, personal history and current life stressors. Objectives A case of a patient with PF is presented followed by a theoretical review on the topic. Methods A case is presented with a bibliographic review. Results We admitted a 47-year-old man to the Acute Hospitalisation Unit for a suspected “psychotic episode with clinical mania”. He presented manic and psychotic symptoms, with delusional ideation of months of evolution, megalomaniacal and fantastic discourse, centred on his work with high-ranking government officials and other implausible events. Multiple academic, work and personal life failures, with a diagnosis of depression 15 years earlier. During admission, he constantly confirms his history. He tends to present a rationalising discourse and a minimising attitude towards behavioural alterations. He appears cooperative and docile at certain times, while at others he is irritable, complaining and threatening. As for medication, olanzapine was initially prescribed at a dose of 20 mg per day, which was reduced to 10 mg given the psychopathological improvement and the difficulties of adherence. On discharge, the presumptive diagnosis was “delusional disorder and probable personality disorder with narcissistic traits, with a history of PF, which in recent months has presented a manic episode with psychotic symptoms”. Conclusions Their management poses challenges in terms of engaging with treatment and building a therapeutic alliance. It is important to assess the social and legal implications. Ensuring that they have stable relationships and adequate social supports is essential for successful treatment. Further exploration and research into this disorder is needed to better understand its manifestations and psychiatric consequences. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "title": "Stress and Insomnia – A Vicious Circle",
      "abstract": "Insomnia refers to the complaint of experiencing unsatisfactory sleep, typically characterized by difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep. Individuals with insomnia are dissatisfied with their sleep quality and perceive it as hindering their ability to perform well in work, school, and social settings. Common symptoms of insomnia include fatigue, decreased mood,irritability, general discomfort, and cognitive difficulties. Stress, on the other hand, is the result of emotional or physical tension triggered by various events that can lead a person to feel frustrated, angry, or anxious. Stress is the body&amp;#39;s response to a challenge or demand, and it is accompanied by the release of hormones. The specific physiological response to stressdepends on factors such as the type of stress, the individual's characteristics, their neuroendocrine system, and the combination of these elements, which collectively determine how the brain and body react to a particular stressor. The activation of the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a response mechanism triggered by stress. Disturbed sleep, particularly insomnia, is a common side effect of stress, varying in intensity. Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining both physical and mental well-being, making the physiological connections between sleep and stress vital in understanding the development of stress-induced pathophysiology. Current treatments for insomnia include Cognitive BehavioralTherapy, improving sleep hygiene, and employing psychological and pharmacological interventions. However, these approaches primarily aim to improve insomnia symptoms rather than addressing its underlying cause. In the context of Homoeopathy, the concept of constitution refers to an individual's unique structure, composition, nature, and physicalmakeup, influenced by both inherited qualities and environmental factors. Therefore, it is essential to individualize each case and administer a similimum remedy to achieve complete healing according to Homoeopathic principles. This review aims to explore the physiological and neuroendocrine changes that occur as a result of the interplay between stress and thedevelopment of insomnia.",

Catatonia has been associated with psychiatric disorders - schizophrenia and bipolar disorder for example - as well as secondary to various underlying medical conditions.It will be described a case report of a 55 years old woman with prior psychiatric history of hospitalization with an unspecified nonorganic psychosis (F29-ICD10), presenting features of catatonia - immobility with fixed posture and gaze (sometimes presenting posturing), an almost absence of spontaneous movements and speech, echophenomenon (echolalia, palilalia, coprolalia) erupting in a otherwise mute state and showing, on occasions, periods of purposelessness motor excitement and restlessness, verbigeration and screaming with a grim of terror. She was disoriented and performed poorly on the MMSE. No neurologic focal signs were disclosed other than prominent primitive reflexes. Prior to admission, her family reported a sudden mood change: she became irritable, argumentative, with delusional thought content of persecutory nature, grandiose ideas. Viral and immune-mediated encephalitis were discharged. The MRI scan showed a right temporal medial lesion (amygdala atrophy).

The DSM-5 definitions of personality disorder are rather complex, both in their traditional form, and in an altérative model now included in Section III of the manual: many clinicians find them difficult to apply.

      "title": "BURNOUT SYNDROME AS A MANIFESTATION OF TEACHER'S PROFESSIONAL DEFORMATION",
      "abstract": "Professional deformation is the destruction that occurs during work activity and negatively affects its performance. In addition, the destructions generate professionally undesirable qualities changing both professional and personal behaviour. Furthermore, professional deformation has the greatest impact on the personal characteristics of representatives of those professions whose work relates to people (teachers, psychologists, social and medical workers, officials, leaders, police officers, etc.). One of the significant signs related to professional deformation of teachers is the emotional burnout syndrome. Burnout syndrome is viewed as a process of gradual loss of emotional, cognitive and physical energy, which is characterized by the symptoms of emotional and mental exhaustion, as well as physical fatigue, personal isolation, depersonalization, and reduced satisfaction in performance. It is mainly regarded as the result of stress which has not been successfully dealt with at the workplace. Above all, there are three main symptoms of emotional burnout syndrome: extreme exhaustion, detachment from clients (patients, pupils, students) and from work, a sense of inefficiency and lack of achieving high-performance goals. Recent research suggests five key groups of symptoms regarding burnout syndrome. These include both physical, emotional, behavioural, social symptoms and intellectual state. As a result, scientists came to the conclusion that personal, role and organizational factors play an essential role in professional burnout. This paper gives an overview of diagnostic criteria and methods of prevention for burnout syndrome, which are of primary importance for representatives of all professions, especially those who are at risk.",

A growing body of evidence suggests this is a biologically distinct subtype of depression. This assertion is supported by genetic epidemiologic studies and by a preferential response of the subtype to monoamine oxidase inhibitors compared with tricyclic antidepressants. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) includes atypical features as a parenthetical modifier for depressive illness. According to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria (\"atypical features\" specifier), the disorder is primarily characterized by 2 or more of the following symptoms as predominant features in patients with major depression or dysthymic disorder: overeating, oversleeping, \"leaden paralysis,\" and interpersonal rejection sensitivity. Patients also show mood reactivity in response to actual or potential positive events. Despite aspects of the disorder resembling a maladaptive, persistent mode of behavior, patients diagnosed with depression with atypical features demonstrate a good response to antidepressant treatment.",

Razvoj simptoma ovog poremecaja određen je karakteristikama licnosti izložene osobe, vrstom i jacinom traume, ulogom koju je osoba imala tijekom traumatskog događaja, kao i karakteristikama okoline. Utvrđivanje postojanja posttraumatskog poremecaja u neke osobe moguce je provesti nizom standardiziranih instrumenata. Iako je u literaturi dostupan znatan broj istraživanja koja proucavaju ovaj poremecaj kao i njegove razlicite aspekte, gotovo je nemoguce pronaci ona koja se bave ovim poremecajem u populaciji osoba ostecena vida. Stoga se sa sigurnoscu nije moglo tvrditi da su instrumenti, prikladni za utvrđivanje PTSP-a u opcoj populaciji, jednako pouzdani i kod osoba ostecena vida u kojih se ocekuje pojavnost ovog poremecaja. Kako bi se utvrdila pouzdanost W-PTSD instrumenta za osobe ostecena vida koje su proživjele traumatsko iskustvo bilo je potrebno uz ovaj instrument primjeniti i dodatni standardizirani instrument za utvrđivanje PTSP-a. U tu svrhu upotrijebljen je LASC-01 upitnik. Rezultatima istraživanja, koje je provedeno na 28 slijepih invalida Domovinskog rata, utvreno ja da na oba upitnika u podrucju varijabli koje mjere PTSP ispitanici postižu slicne rezultate. Na osnovi toga moguce je zakljuciti da se instrument W-PTSD može s pravom koristiti za utvrđivanje PTSP-a u populaciji osoba ostecena vida",

This dizziness almost always occurs either spontaneously or as a result of certain movements or positions.

We performed the DST in 95 depressed inpatients to determine whether abnormal DST results were associated with individual symptoms of depression, latent behavioral \"factors,\" melancholia, or severity of depression. Initial insomnia, agitation, loss of sexual interest, and weight loss correlated significantly with nonsuppression. Using multiple regression, these four symptoms contributed independently to the variance in DST results and more closely associated with the DST results than did severity or the diagnosis of melancholia or endogenous subtype. Factor analysis failed to identify a factor that correlated with the DST results more significantly than did the individual symptoms. Our findings and a literature review suggest that DST nonsuppression associates with certain vegetative signs of depression but not with such symptoms as loss of interest or anhedonia nor with \"psychological\" symptoms such as guilt, worthlessness, helplessness, hopelessness, or suicidal ideation.",

      "abstract": "Secure attachments with caregivers play a critical role in helping children develop a capacity to modulate physiological arousal. Loss of ability to regulate the intensity of feelings and impulses is possibly the most far-reaching effect of trauma and neglect. It has been shown that most abused and neglected children develop disorganized attachment patterns. The inability to modulate emotions gives rise to a range of behaviors that are best understood as attempts at self-regulation. These include aggression against others, self-destructive behavior, eating disorders, and substance abuse. The capacity to regulate internal states affects both self-definition and one's attitude toward one's surroundings. Abused children often fail to develop the capacity to express specific and differentiated emotions: Their difficulty putting feelings into words interferes with flexible response strategies and promotes acting out. Usually, these behaviors coexist, which further complicates diagnosis and treatment. Affective dysregulation can be mitigated by safe attachments, secure meaning schemes, and pharmacological interventions that enhance the predictability of somatic responses to stress. The ability to create symbolic representations of terrifying experiences promotes taming of terror and desomatization of traumatic memories.",

Since it connotes reduction or absence of stimulation of the five senses, it involves the patient's physical activity, social relationships, intellectual status and overall \"value system.\" Geriatric patients with various illnesses are particularly vulnerable to sensory deprivation, which becomes increasingly pronounced as physical or mental deterioration progresses. All cells require stimulation for continued growth and activity; lack of stimulation leads to atrophy, with secondary physical or psychosocial abnormalities. Depression acts as a negative reinforcement of stimuli, and anxiety acts as a blocking mechanism. The goal of rehabilitation is to maintain and strengthen the patient's social values and to preserve mental and physical motility. The recommended procedure involves assessment of medical, psychologic and social factors, and determination of whether organic disease is present. A specific treatment plan to meet the individualized needs of each patient is then established so as to minimize sensory deprivation and maximize physical and mental functioning. Re-evaluation (physical and psychologic) at regular intervals establishes a pattern not only for individual comparison but for comparison with results in untreated control groups.",

Valuable tools such as opioid analgesics, steroids, and anticholinergic medications may produce undesirable psychiatric side effects. Adverse effects (including delirium, mania, and depression) as well as milder effects (such as irritability, insomnia, and weight gain) may impair quality of life. One major challenge to psychiatric diagnosis presents itself during end-of-life care. In this case, it may be difficult to distinguish between primary psychiatric disorders and end-of-life distress. Psychosocial stressors, unrelated to disease or treatment, can occur and sometimes complicate management. Patients' reactions to recommended treatments may be related to other issues, such as grief, frustration, or need for control.

      "abstract": "<b>Abstract:</b> Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a syndromic label for people with informant-corroborated memory problems and evidence of memory impairment on formal testing in the absence of more pervasive deficits in cognition and functional abilities. It is often described as a “risk factor” for dementia though this is misleading; patients with the first signs of Alzheimer9s disease (AD) will meet the criteria for MCI and as their illness progresses they will move to more traditional criteria for dementia (eg, DSM). Importantly though, they have not changed or “converted” from one disease to another. The problem with MCI clinically, and hence the reason why all such patients are not simply diagnosed with very mild AD is that as one moves closer to normal performance (ie, not clearly demented), the risk of patients who do not have AD (eg, so-called “worried well”; depression; alternate degenerative or non-degenerative pathology) being captured by the MCI syndrome increases. Furthermore, although the concept of MCI seems straightforward, “absence of dementia” or “intact cognition in domains other than memory” or even “objective evidence of memory impairment” varies according to the methods used to define each criterion. Nevertheless, with longitudinal follow-up to confirm that initial MCI status was due to incipient AD, this syndrome offers a important window to examine the earliest symptomatic stages of the disease. Emerging evidence from such studies have highlighted that incipient (MCI-stage) AD is underpinned by degeneration of an interconnected neural circuit including mesial temporal lobe, diencephalon and posterior cingulate regions—all of which, interestingly, have been implicated in memory processing from focal lesion studies in humans.",

Ademas, hace referencia a un estado de enfermedad que pone en entredicho la integridad cognitiva y moral de la persona y su respetabilidad ante el grupo social al que pertenece. El VIH arrebata al enfermo su autonomia psicologica, el control de sus decisiones; debilita su vida mental, su identidad y su autoestima. El VIHafecta al sistema nervioso en diversas formas y desde el inicio, manifestandose en alteraciones de atencion, memoria, funciones ejecutivas y en casos de fasesavanzadas de SIDA, cuadros complejos de demencia. La enfermedad representa un grito de auxilio de un cuerpo enfermo en el presente, pero comunmente maltratado en etapas tempranas de su desarrollo, sobre todo si crecio y vive en situaciones de pobreza economica y educativa. La situacion se recrudece debido principalmente al estigma del trinomio sida-sexo-pecado de que se ha investido a la enfermedad, en una cultura donde reina el prejuicio como movil de la conducta, donde se privilegian la mojigateria, la apariencia y la hipocresia destructiva, sobre la razon, la informacion y la empatia hacia el doliente.El VIH es un estado complejo, de multiples y variados aspectos interrelacionados, un campo abierto y demandante de atencion, donde el profesional de la psicologia encuentra amplias posibilidades de servicio, a multiples niveles, todos relevantes, necesarios y pertinentes.",

      "abstract": "Children and adolescents may express psychiatric symptoms via somatic complaints. Likewise, children with chronic somatic illnesses are likely to experience psychiatric sequelae. We report three cases of adolescents who were admitted to general paediatrics services for abdominal pain and/or nausea and vomiting with a negative medical workup. In each case, a clear psychosocial stressor was evident. It is possible that somatic symptoms without clear medical causes may reflect psychosocial stress, but it is difficult to discern whether the psychosocial issues preceded the somatic complaints or were a result of them. Making an accurate diagnosis is difficult, and broaching such a subject with patients and their families is a delicate matter. More research is needed to determine appropriate screening tools for identifying cases where psychosocial stress may play a relevant role in symptom presentation, as well as potential treatment modalities for such cases.",

Here, we shall refer to conditions with long-lasting and disabling symptoms, not trivial or passing symptoms. Such conditions are called medically unexplained symptoms (MUS). Syndromes with specific diagnostic criteria, such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, or irritable bowel syndrome, are often included among MUS conditions.2\n\nAlthough management of patients with MUS presents several challenges, GPs accept the responsibility for investigation, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up.5\n\nBiopsychosocial approaches are commonly applied in medical practice, whether the aim is full recovery or coping with symptoms and disability,1 and psychologically based interventions (especially different cognitive behavioural therapies [CBT]) have been developed for coping and symptom relief. Yet, such approaches do not substantiate MUS as a mental disorder. Lamahewa et al found, for example, that comorbidity with depression and generalised anxiety disorder occurred in only one-third of these patients.2 Studies have evaluated effects of CBT on different outcome measures, such as pain, function, work ability, or healthcare use, often presenting limited or no significant effects based on weak evidence.4\n\nMUS is not a clinical diagnosis but an analytical concept, unifying a diverse group of health problems where no joint cause or biomarker have been identified.

With respect to the distinction between psychological and somatoform manifestations of dissociation current data suggest a hypothesis to which extent mild manifestations of 'pseudoneurological' symptoms in healthy young population may be linked to stress-related psychopathological symptoms or whether these symptoms more likely could be attributed to unexplained somatic factors. With this aim we have assessed the relationship between somatoform dissociation and stress-related psychopathology (i.e. anxiety, depression, symptoms of traumatic stress, alexithymia) in a group of 250 healthy non-psychiatric and non-clinical young adults. Results of this study show that the symptoms of somatoform dissociation are significantly linked to stress-related psychopathology. Findings of this study show that the 'pseudoneurological' symptoms may be linked to stress-related psychopathological processes which indicate that also mild levels of stress may influence somatic feelings and may lead to various somatoform dissociative symptoms.",

As noted in Chapter 1, dysfunction of the human mind results in symptoms in three primary spheres: thinking (cognition), emotion (meaning), and motivation (ability to set and achieve goals). These disorders can also produce a variety of physical (or “neurovegetative”) symptoms that include changes in appetite, sleep, sexual function, and energy level, among others. Some people develop symptoms suggestive of other medical or neurological disorders, such as heart palpitations, shortness of breath, pain, and memory disturbances. Additionally, patients with serious medical and neurological disorders can develop psychiatric disorders (e.g., people with diabetes are prone to develop depression), with adverse effects likely affecting the outcome of both conditions.",

These conditions include conversion disorder, illness anxiety disorder (hypochondriasis), somatic symptom disorder, and factitious disorder. While the term MUS recognizes the uncertainty around causation, it is less helpful clinically. The cornerstone of management is to assist the patient in finding an explanation that is helpful, enabling collaborative management of symptoms and ultimately allowing for a reduction in utilization of healthcare. We also describe cacosmia, a person's delusional belief that an unpleasant odour can be smelt, versus olfactory reference syndrome, where the person believes he/she emits the unpleasant odour.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia may be described as a disease where speech, bodily language and social responsiveness are obvious expressions of a deteriorated ability to interact with the surroundings in a precise and relevant way. The lack of precision and relevance pertains to perception and recall as well as communication and action. The deficient potential for activation of the prefrontal cerebral cortex is a neurobiological correlate to the lesion of precise and relevant planning and expression. Impairment of formal thought and language in schizophrenia are suggested to result from a developmental disorder pertaining to language and concept formation (apperception). In reactive psychoses with dissociative disturbances of consciousness there is an inefficient capacity for adapting to external reality; thus relevant conscious planning and interaction with the outside world are impaired. Clinically a distractibility of a tematic nature ensues. Except for catastrophic events, psychotic reactions cannot be predicted from analysis of the actual experience--neither concerning the external nor the internal aspects of conscious awareness. Sometimes, however, previous events relating to the formation of the self may add explanatory value to the analysis of reactive psychosis. In some cases biological predisposition is the decisive determinant. The normal discrimination between sense-perception and imagination has a counterpart in the dichotomy of awareness of the outside world versus awareness of the self. The following are examples of psychotic experience where the normal ability for dichotomic discrimination may be damaged: Illusions of affect, hallucinations, Schneider's first rank symptoms, \"Anwesenheit\" and consciousness of time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

An obvious obsessive or fixated quality is associated with both behaviours, and personality traits of rigidity and rumination are frequently observed, though the state of mind rarely conforms to that found in obsessional disorders. Stalkers and querulants rarely regard their behaviour as unjustified, let alone irrational, and few see their persistence as senseless. They may resist the impulse or urge to pursue their victims or cause on occasion but, for the most part, devote themselves wholeheartedly to their objectives. This chapter explores the epidemiology ad phenomenology of stalking and querulousness and the role of (forensic) psychiatry in responding not only to the perpetrators of these behaviours, but also to the unfortunate victim’s of their disordered attention.",

      "abstract": "At first glance, acute grief would not seem to be a medical or psychiatric disorder in the strict sense of the word but rather a normal reaction to a distressing situation. However, the understanding of reactions to traumatic experiences whether or not they represent clear-cut neuroses has become of ever-increasing importance to the psychiatrist. Bereavement or the sudden cessation of social interaction seems to be of special interest because it is often cited among the alleged psychogenic factors in psychosomatic disorders. The enormous increase in grief reactions due to war casualties, furthermore, demands an evaluation of their probable effect on the mental and physical health of our population. The points to be made in this paper are as follows: i. Acute grief is a definite syndrome with psychological and somatic symptomatology. 2. This syndrome may appear immediately after a crisis; it may be delayed; it may be exaggerated or apparently al)sent. 3. In place of the typical syndrome there may appear distorted pictures, each of which represents one special aspect of the grief syndrome. 4. By appropriate techniques these distorted pictures can be successfully transformed into a normal grief reaction with resolution. Our observations comprise tot patients. Included are (i) psychoneurotic patients who lost a relative during the course of treatment, (2) relatives of patients who uied in the hospital, (3) bereaved disaster victims (Cocoanut Grove Fire) and their close relatives, ( ) relatives of members of the armed forces.",

      "title": "Delusions in Major Depressive Disorder: Recommendations for the DSM-V",
      "abstract": "false negatives and false positives may occur. The presence of the delusions may be actively concealed by the patient (for instance, by a mother who is afraid that she will lose her children if she reveals her delusions), or the patient may be unable to fully recognize or report the presence of delusions because of perplexity, psychic retardation or agitation. On the other hand, the expressions sometimes used by patients when talking about their depressive feelings may be misleading, and some severely depressed patients may endorse the strongest terms used in structured interviews even if these terms do not apply to their particular case: this may generate false positives. Delusions are not included in the DSM-IV criteria for a major depressive episode, but their presence can be recorded using the specifier ‘severe with psychotic features’, with the possibility to further specify whether the delusions are ‘mood congruent’ or ‘mood incongruent’ [7] . Thus, the DSM-IV seems to make two assumptions: (a) that every delusional depression will also be severe (i.e. characterized by the presence of several symptoms in excess to those required to make the diagnosis, and by a marked interference with social functioning), and (b) that, in an individual depressive episode, delusions will either be all congruent or all incongruent with depressed mood. In fact, it is not possible to record the concomitant presence of both mood-congruent and mood-incongruent delusions. However, some preliminary research evidence seems to question these two assumptions. One study reported that delusions can also be present in deDelusions are a common symptom in major depressive disorder, occurring in about 25% of hospitalized patients and almost 15% of cases in the community [1, 2] . The phenomenology and prognostic significance of delusions in depressed patients are currently being discussed again within the context of the work on the DSM-V [3–6] . According to the DSM-IV [7] , depressive thoughts, in order to be classified as delusions, must fulfill two criteria: (a) the judgment has to be so extreme as to defy credibility (i.e. the belief has to be of ‘delusional proportions’), and (b) the patient must be unable to acknowledge the possibility that the belief may not be true (i.e. the belief has to be maintained with ‘delusional intensity’). However, in clinical practice, there may be problems in applying these criteria. For instance, the delusional intensity of a belief may fluctuate during a depressive episode: some clinicians and researchers will classify the belief as a delusion even if the delusional intensity is present only for most of the time during the depressive episode, whereas others will require that the delusional intensity be consistently present throughout the depressive episode. Moreover, it happens that a belief fulfills one of the two criteria above but not the other: it is of delusional proportions but not maintained with delusional intensity, or vice versa. In these cases, clinicians and researchers may reach different conclusions about whether or not the patient has a delusion. It is also useful to emphasize that, in the assessment of the presence of delusions in a depressed patient, both Received: June 22, 2007 Accepted after revision: July 30, 2007 Published online: October 18, 2007",

      "title": "Blunt Force Trauma",
      "abstract": "Abstract Blunt injuries are caused by mechanical force resulting in damage to the affected tissues mainly due to compression, traction, torsion, and shear stresses. The impact is induced either by a moving blunt object hitting the body or the victim's movement against an obstacle having a hard surface. In forensic practice, injuries from blunt force are often seen after criminal assaults where they may be inflicted, for instance, by fist blows or kicking. They not only occur in physical child abuse and other kinds of domestic violence, in traffic, sports, and industrial accidents but also in falls brought about by the victims themselves for various reasons (e.g., in drunken, infirm, or sick persons or in suicides jumping from a height). On skin, blunt traumatization produces abrasions, contusions (bruises), and lacerations. In some cases, a patterned configuration helps to determine characteristic features of the causative instrument. Within the body, blunt traumatization may be followed by bone fractures and laceration/rupture of vessels and organs with concomitant blood loss and potential failure of vital functions. The article shortly describes and illustrates the most important manifestations of blunt force injuries (including head trauma) under reconstructive aspects and from the medicolegal point of view.",

Stres yang tidak ditangani dengan baik dapat bermanifestasi dalam bentuk gejala-gejala fisik yang disebut sebagai gejala psikosomatik. Gejala psikosomatik ini kerap kali tidak disadari sehingga sering terjadi berulang kali meski sudah diberikan pengobatan sebelumnya. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menghitung proporsi stres dan gejala psikosomatik pada siswa kelas XII SMA serta kedua keluhan tersebut pada saat yang bersamaan. Penelitian ini merupakan penelitian potong lintang deskriptif. Pengambilan data dilakukan dengan menggunakan kuesioner Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) 42 dan kuesioner yang diadaptasi dari Psychosomatic Symptoms Scale for Child and Adolescents yang dibagikan kepada subjek penelitian di SMA Negeri 1 Denpasar, SMA Negeri 2 Denpasar, dan SMA Negeri 3 Denpasar pada bulan Oktober–November 2019. Sebanyak 67 (32,2%) dari 208 sampel yang mengaku mengalami stres dan terdapat 158 (76%) subjek penelitian yang mengalami gejala psikosomatik. Subjek penelitian yang mengaku mengalami stres dan juga mengalami gejala psikosomatik dijumpai sebanyak 48 (71,6%).",

Medical training is identified as full of stress\r\nand it is also observed that students undergo tremendous stress during various years of medical training.

Moreover, there is a growing evidence that patients with CFS belong to an inhomogeneous group with different etiologic constellations. Specific somatic factors, e.g. viruses, seem to be less important for onset than certain personality-traits like depressiveness and workaholism. These traits lead to an increased vulnerability to unspecific psychological or biological stressors that may cause chronic fatigue by complex psychosomatic interferences. Concerning diagnosis, there are no specific methods or results available, the same is true for pharmacological treatment. As a consequence, practitioners should be aware not to miss a somatic disease causing fatigue, and, parallel to this, start right from the beginning talking about the psychosomatic background of CFS. Furthermore, psychotherapy has shown to be effective in CFS.",

Among the precipitating factors are emotional reactions, changes in life situation; various psychosocial stresses, periods of overactivity and 'let down' periods. In addition to the operation of the above psychological factors, which constitute a psychosomatic sequence of events, there are also mood changes which may accompany an attack of migraine associated with alterations in energy, concentration, and ability to work. There may also be a somatopsychic sequence of events in which the sufferer may react in various ways to an attack of migraine just as he may react to any other illness or disability.",

While classical forms of major hysteria are less frequent in occurrence in recent years, the etiological basis of the pattern still is clinically significant. Conversion reactions and psychophysiological reactions affecting various body systems continue to be a part of the spectrum of psychiatric illness seen in active practice. While no organic cause for the symptoms is present, the loss of function, when substantial and persistent, equates with the loss of function resulting from actual organic disease. Not all of these reactions occur in the ‘hysterical personality’, and both social and cultural patterns must be taken into account. In evaluating the severity of an impairment (loss of function) resulting from a functional illness, the psychological and physiological homeostasis of the patient is a crucial consideration. Symptoms derived from purely conscious reactions are seldom associated with actual loss of function.",

      "title": "Grief: Aetiology, Symptoms and Management",
      "abstract": "Abstract Grief is a process provoked as a response to different losses, such as death, loss of job, relationship breakdown, some unexpected life events and changes, etc. The experiences of loss and bereavement are very individual. Even though loss is expected, the person feels traumatized, especially if death is provoked by violence, natural disasters, or war. This pandemic, like other disasters (wars, tsunami, earthquakes, floods, etc.) has provoked intensive reactions of grief, reactions that could persist for years. The core symptoms of grief are described in the ICD-11 and DSM-5 manuals. The term “complicated grief” in the medical sense refers to a superimposed process that alters grief and modifies its course for the worse. Prolonged grief disorder (PGD) is characterized by normal grief symptoms, but these are symptoms that remain too intense for too long of a period. This article is a review of the manifestations and duration of grief in different occasions, and it is based on over 50 published papers, and discoveries in the Medline and Psych-Net databases. Commonly described reactions to grief are: shock, disbelief or denial, a high level of anxiety, distress, anger, sadness, insomnia, and a loss of appetite. As predictors for a high/slow decreasing trajectory of grief process are: female gender, reported symptoms of depression before the traumatic event, and higher scores on avoidance. However, grief is transient, even as we are is in the midst of its clutches. People should expect to fluctuate between moments of sadness and mourning, and moments of acceptance, or even happiness for being alive. Researchers suppose that when a crisis passes; most people will be able to bounce back and move on with their lives.",

They vary from the clearly neuropathic with a well defined pathology, such as trigeminal neuralgia and postherpetic neuralgia, through conditions in which there is a demonstrable pathophysiology, such as some presentations of temporomandibular pain and central post-stroke pain to those in which no pathology can be demonstrated, such as atypical facial pain. The importance of psychosocial factors cannot be underestimated: what the patient thinks about the significance of the pain has an important bearing on its perception, the degree of impairment and the way it is treated.",

One of the symptoms of schizophrenia is sensory perception disorder, namely hallucinations which are typical of mental disorders in individuals characterized by changes in sensory perception, by feeling false sensations in the form of sounds (hearing), sight, taste, touch, or smell. Mental disorders are syndromes or patterns of behavior that are clinically significant that are associated with distress or suffering and pose obstacles to one or more functions of human life. One that includes mental disorders is schizophrenia. Hallucinations are false perceptual distortions that occur in maladaptive neurobiological responses, sufferers actually experience sensory distortions as real things and respond accordingly. Factors that can influence the recurrence of schizophrenic patients with hallucinations include high family emotional expressions, lack of family knowledge, availability of health services, family income and medication adherence in schizophrenic patients. psychiatric nursing care to Tn.

      "title": "Borderline Personality Disorder Is a Heritable Brain Disease",
      "abstract": "The prevailing view among many psychiatrists and mental health professionals is that borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a psychological condition. BPD often is conceptualized as a behavioral consequence of childhood trauma; treatment approaches have emphasized intensive psychotherapeutic modalities, less so biologic interventions. You might not be aware that a large body of research over the past decade provides strong evidence that BPD is a neurobiological illness--a finding that would drastically alter how the disorder should be conceptualized and managed. Neuropathology underpins the personality disorder Foremost, BPD must be regarded as a serious, disabling brain disorder, not simply an aberration of personality In DSM-5, symptoms of BPD are listed as: feelings of abandonment; unstable and intense interpersonal relationships; unstable sense of self; impulsivity; suicidal or self-mutilating behavior; affective instability (dysphoria, irritability anxiety); chronic feelings of emptiness; intense anger episodes; and transient paranoid or dissociative symptoms. Clearly, these dusters of psychopathological and behavioral symptoms reflect a pervasive brain disorder associated with abnormal neurobiology and neural circuitry that might, at times, stubbornly defy therapeutic intervention. No wonder that 42 published studies report that, compared with healthy controls, people who have BPD display extensive cortical and subcortical abnormalities in brain structure and function.1 These anomalous patterns have been detected across all 4 available neuroimaging techniques. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Magnetic resonance imaging. MRI studies have revealed the following abnormalities in BPD: * hypoplasia of the hippocampus, caudate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex * variations in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and subiculum * smaller-than-normal orbitofrontal cortex (by 24%, compared with healthy controls) and the mid-temporal and left cingulate gyrii (by 26%) * larger-than-normal volume of the right inferior parietal cortex and the right parahippocampal gyrus * loss of gray matter in the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices * an enlarged third cerebral ventricle * in women, reduced size of the medial temporal lobe and amygdala * in men, a decreased concentration of gray matter in the anterior cingulate * reversal of normal right-greater-than-left asymmetry of the orbitofrontal cortex gray matter, reflecting loss of gray matter on the right side * a lower concentration of gray matter in the rostral/subgenual anterior cingulate cortex * a smaller frontal lobe. In an analysis of MRI studies,2 correlation was found between structural brain abnormalities and specific symptoms of BPD, such as impulsivity suicidality, and aggression. These findings might someday guide personalized in-terventions--for example, using neuro-stimulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and deep brain stimulation--to modulate the activity of a given region of the brain (depending on which symptom is most prominent or disabling). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In BPD, MRS studies reveal: * compared with controls, a higher glutamate level in the anterior cingulate cortex * reduced levels of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA; found in neurons) and creatinine in the left amygdala * a reduction (on average, 19%) in the NAA concentration in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Functional magnetic resonance imaging. From fMRI studies, there is evidence in BPD of: * greater activation of the amygdala and prolonged return to baseline * increased functional connectivity in the left frontopolar cortex and left insula * decreased connectivity in the left cuneus and left inferior parietal and the right middle temporal lobes * marked frontal hypometabolism * hypermetabolism in the motor cortex, medial and anterior cingulate, and occipital and temporal poles * lower connectivity between the amygdala during a neutral stimulus * higher connectivity between the amygdala during fear stimulus * deactivation of the opioid system in the left nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, and hippocampus * hyperactivation of the left medial prefrontal cortex during social exclusion * more mistakes made in differentiating an emotional and a neutral facial expression. …",

It is the normal response to the distruption of healthy tissues, but its persistence beyond the period of healing should alert the practitioner to other unrecognized causes. On the other hand, learned pain is a condition resulting mainly from socio-emotional factors in the absence of progressive, invasive and, most of the time, demonstrable pathology. The key to success in the management of a painful condition is an accurate diagnosis followed by appropriate intervention and treatment. A complete history and a detailed physical examination, complemented by ancillary laboratory tests and consultations, when necessary, offer the best approach to initial management. This article discusses the pathophysiology of pain, the diagnostic approach and therapeutic interventions for evaluation and management of pain patients. The role of multiple factors as reinforcers of pain behavior deserves careful attention, and a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary approach may be indicated in selected cases.",

The benefits of physical activity on quantity and quality of life for both physical and mental health concerns are well acknowledged and the 'exercise as medicine' concept has progressed rapidly, most notably in the domains of physical medicine. Mental disorders encompass a wide variety of signs, symptoms, experiences and disorders which are diagnosed by a medical professional and significantly interfere with an individual's cognitive, emotional or social abilities. 'Flourishing' or complete mental health is to be filled with positive emotion and to be functioning well psychologically, emotionally and socially and is the opposite of those 'languishing' in life with low well-being. The growing costs and burden of disease associated with mental disorders, along with limitations in availability and cost effectiveness of optimal treatment, has turned a spotlight on the primary prevention of common mental illnesses.",

On the other hand, depression can also be described as a quantifiable diseased state of the brain that may be cured using a biological therapy or pharmaceutical. Neither one of these definitions is incorrect; rather, they each describe different aspects of this form of mental illness. This duality inherent to understanding depression makes light of the sparse assemblage of literature that exists concerning such a socially, psychologically, and biologically complex phenomenon. Research has shown that the therapeutic benefits of exercise offer treatment for both the psychosocial and biological effects of depression. A more unified research perspective that looks for a coincidence of the social with the biological may allow for steps forward in understanding mental illness and disease.",

Somatization is an individual's unconscious use of the body or bodily symptoms for psychological purposes or psychological gain. As the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), Sixth Edition, notes, somatization is a “tendency to experience and report somatic complaints (physical symptoms) in response to psychosocial stress and seek health care services for them.” The AMA Guides also advises evaluators that “exclusion or inclusion of somatization disorder, factitious disorder, and/or malingering must be done with care.” A table lists developmental factors that may dispose to somatization (eg, somatizers are present in the family of origin, or coping mechanisms other than illness behavior are absent or unacceptable); a second table compares disorders that may involve somatization. Somatization is prevalent in clinical practice and is likely to occur with equal, or higher, frequency in the evaluation setting. The presence of somatization distorts symptom presentation and can exert a confounding effect on impairment assessment methodologies that rely on the accuracy of patients’ self-presentations.",

Die Impulsivität als beeinträchtigendes Merkmal bzw. beeinträchtigte psychische Dimension ist ein Symptom zahlreicher Persönlichkeits- und Verhaltensstörungen. In dieser diagnostischen Gruppierung ist sie zentrales Kriterium, wobei hier die verschiedenen abnormen Gewohnheiten wegen gewisser Ähnlichkeiten in der Beschreibung und nicht wegen anderer gemeinsamer Charakteristika zusammengefasst wurden. Definitionsgemäß sind Gebrauch von Alkohol und psychotropen Substanzen, sowie Störungen des Sexualoder Essverhaltens ausgeschlossen. Das bringt uns zu der kontroversiellen Frage der stoffgebundenen und nicht-stoffgebundenen Süchte. Offenbar ist es, in den Augen der Autoren des ICD-10, sinnvoll, den mit Sucht, d.h. mit dem Gebrauch psychotroper Substanzen, verbundenen Verlust der Impulskontrolle diagnostisch und phänomenologisch anders zu fassen als andere, auf den ersten Blick ähnliche, Phänomene. Das schafft allerdings auf der anderen Seite eine, wenig zufrieden stellende, Mischkategorie von allen möglichen Störungen oder Störungssymptomen mit ähnlichem Phenotypus",

      "abstract": "Predictability of dangerousness in association with mental disorders remains elusive, outside of a few relatively well-established risk factors for the prognostication of violence, such as male sex, the presence of a psychotic disorder, and comorbid substance abuse. In clinical practice, inquiry into the presence of aggressive or violent ideation, in the form of ideas of homicide or suicide, is part of a standard mental status examination. Nonetheless, fantasy life, when it concerns harm toward others, may not be as reliable an indicator of imminent danger as it may be in the case of self-harm. Five cases of young Italian men with Asperger syndrome and recurrent and extremely violent femicide fantasies are presented. While there is no direct correlation between autism spectrum conditions and violence, as other humans, persons with an autistic condition are capable of committing crimes, including homicide. All five had in common a number of characteristics and behaviors felt to be pathoplastic: All had been bullied, all had been romantically rejected, all were long-standing First Person Shooter (FPS) game players, and all were avid violent pornography consumers. The potential for an actual neurocognitive impact of violent video games, well documented in the literature, and its combination with personal life history and chronic habituation following long-standing violent pornography use is discussed in the context of social and emotional vulnerabilities. While aggressive fantasies cannot and should not be underestimated, in countries where duty to protect legislation does not exist, a clinical approach is imperative, as, incidentally, should be anywhere.",

Anxiety is usually appropriate, short-lived and controllable. When anxiety is present inappropriately, and its symptoms are abnormally severe, persistent and impair physical, social or occupational functioning, an ‘anxiety disorder’ can be diagnosed. In this section, we summarise what is known about the aetiology and neurobiology of the anxiety disorders included in the International Classification of Diseases, 11th edition (ICD-11) classification of mental disorders: generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder and separation anxiety disorder [1]. As there is significant overlap in the neurobiology of these disorders, we discuss the anxiety disorders as a whole, highlighting specific aspects where relevant. Characteristic features of the anxiety disorders are shown in Table 9.4.1.",

      "title": "Descriptive Psychopathology",
      "abstract": "Psychopathology is ‘the systematic study of abnormal experience, cog­nition and behaviour; the study of the products of a disordered mind’ (Sims, 2002). Descriptive psychopathology refers to a particular approach to the assessment and understanding of the signs and symptoms of men­tal disorder and forms the basis of clinical psychiatry. The term descriptive in this context refers to a necessarily value- and theory-free interpreta­tion of the mental and behavioural phenomena a patient presents with. For students of medicine and psychiatry, it is essential to understand the significance of this and the rationale behind it. Psychiatry is unique among the medical specialties in that there are few objective clinical signs and no biomarkers (at least in vivo) which indicate the presence or otherwise of specific mental disorders. Contrast this with bodily disorders whose features are physical and objective; they lend themselves to being measurable, quantifiable, and therefore reliable to assess. Features of mental disorders present through behaviour and experience (thoughts, feelings, perceptions); they are internal and essen­tially subjective. This renders psychopathological phenomena elusive to clinical assessment in the way physical disorders are, leaving psychiatry in somewhat of a quandary; how to establish a reliable and valid system of assessing subjective phenomena? Furthermore, there needs to be a safeguard against the undue influence of bias caused by personal value judgements when interpreting subjective phenomenon. A chest X-ray showing a lobe consolidation or a blood test showing anaemia is open to far less interpretation than a person complaining of low mood or hearing voices. A further challenge in addition to that posed by the subjective nature of psychopathological phenomena is that of the absence of established aetiological mechanisms of mental disorders. Whether they are caused by physical changes in the brain or are social phenomena caused by experience (or some combination) remains contentious. Indeed, this debate continues to strike at the very concept of mental disorder. Therefore, clinical assessment of a person presenting with mental disorder must enable accessing and understanding the patient’s inner world; it must be based on a system that is value-free so as to avoid the undue influence of the personal beliefs of the clinician; and it obvi­ously cannot be reliant on thus-far absent aetiology.",

      "abstract": "Even though recognition of restless legs syndrome (RLS) by the medical community is not yet proportionate to its prevalence in the general population,1RLS was a syndrome reported as early as 1672 by Willis,2 and well defined clinically by Ekbom in 1945 and 1960.3,4 RLS may either occur as a primary disturbance, frequently familial and not associated with other neurological or systemic illnesses, or secondary to other pathological conditions such as peripheral neuropathy, uremia, and pregnancy.5 Landmark but serendipitous discoveries, such as its association with periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS)6 and the discovery of the therapeutic effects of levodopa,7 were later followed by more systematic approaches aimed at the definition of the clinical diagnostic criteria,8,9 at measuring the degree of clinical severity,10 and of quality of life (QoL).11,12 Accordingly, the essential diagnostic criteria for RLS9 include the following: an urge to move the legs usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs; the urge to move or unpleasant sensations begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity, such as lying or sitting; the urge to move or unpleasant sensations are partially or totally relieved by movement, such as walking or stretching, at least as long as the activity continues; and the urge to move or unpleasant sensations are worse in the evening or night than during the day or only occur in the evening or night. Supportive clinical features include a positive family history, response to dopaminergic therapy, and periodic limb movements during wakefulness or sleep. The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) rating scale for severity10 rates symptoms over 10 items with a score ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe symptom) experienced by the patient for the most recent 2-week period; RLS symptoms are defined as moderate to severe when a score of at least 15 is reached. Recently, diagnostic criteria for thePLMS have also been made available.13 These efforts have brought about previously lacking clinical instruments useful for epidemiological studies and clinical trials, at least for the adult population with RLS, and facilitated the recognition and assessment of the significant effects of RLS upon sleep, cognitive function, and memory and psychomotor performance. Here, the clinical features of RLS will not be tackled, and the reader is directed to more general works;5,14 we shall instead deal first with the consequences of RLS on the function of sleep, and the attendant mood disruption. We shall afterwards summarize the effects of RLS upon cognitive performance and more generally upon QoL. Such a way of dealing with the subject at hand is not meant to imply definite causal relationships between pain, disturbed sleep, mood depression, and finally cognitive defects and poor QoL. All of these clinical features associated with RLS could indeed represent intrinsic properties of the RLS brain or mind.",

      "abstract": "Whether the experience, symptoms, treatment or neuropathology of Parkinson's disease (PD) could potentially play a role in shaping religious beliefs and practices can be viewed from several different angles. For example, a diagnosis of a serious illness could make one reassess and question previously held attitudes and beliefs; faith in a benign God may be challenged. Spirituality, broadly defined as a quest for meaning and truth, could also play a role in the process of integrating the experience of living with Parkinson's disease, as with any disease or major life experience. Less conscious mechanisms might also be in play, more intrinsic to the disease process, such as loss of motivational drive due to dopaminergic dysfunction. The resulting apathy, which is often seen in PD, might reduce efforts to pursue personal interests, including a religious faith. Cognitive deficits, for example altered social cognition such as changes in 'theory of mind', could also potentially contribute. At a more pragmatic level, problems with decreasing mobility, and energy levels as well as a host of other symptoms and drug side-effects could potentially make all aspects of daily life problematic, therefore impeding the pursuit of religious practices or a spiritual path. In this chapter we review and discuss the existing literature and research, in the hope that it might augment understanding of this little-studied aspect of PD as well as contribute to cognitive perspectives on religious belief and experience.",

Pain is defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage [2]. Pain is described as acute or chronic. Acute pain is experienced for short time (two weeks) due to trauma while chronic pain last longer than three months and is associated with injury to tissues or nerves. There are four factors that commonly affect pain expressions: Location, Duration, Intensity and Etiology. The location is the place where the pain occurs. Duration is the time that pain lasts, and is classified as chronic or acute. Intensity tells how severe the pain is. It is usually measured through a pain scale from zero to ten.

However, PTSD can prove difficult to assess accurately owing to the unique problems of co-morbidity with other psychological disorders or the late onset of symptoms. Paradoxically, PTSD may be misdiagnosed by a healthcare professional which may result in inappropriate therapeutic intervention. This article introduces a simple five-stage assessment that is designed to help the clinician determine whether the client's distress is caused by PTSD or another disorder. These guidelines are structured and explore the five stages of PTSD assessment: collecting background information; initial contact with the client; correctly identifying the problem; general assessment; and summary. Finally, some recommended structured clinical assessment guidelines and psychometric rating scales are outlined.",

The second aspect of psychosomatic medicine suggests that specific somatic diseases are influenced by mental states. Thus, peptic ulcer is aggravated when the patient is distressed or under tension and apt to be improved during periods of physical and emotional relaxation. The third consideration is the one that is least established, but nevertheless the most discussed recently. This maintains that repeated emotional or psychologic stress may actually produce certain somatic diseases, such as asthma, essential hypertension or eczematoid dermatitis.

      "abstract": "The word “depression” has come to be used in psychiatry to denote both a syndrome (or symptom:sign cluster) and one or more of the symptoms commonly occurring in this cluster. This attribution of two meanings to one term has led to considerable confusion. Thus it is often claimed that depression may be present in almost any mental illness. This statement may be true in the sense that the mood of depression may occur in almost any mental illness; but it cannot be true in the sense that the depressive syndrome may enter into almost any mental illness, since the term depressive syndrome has already, at least by implication, been used to denote a particular symptom:sign cluster which differentiates it from all other symptom:sign clusters. To deny this would be to deny the original principles of division.",

Suffering refers to a perceived threat to the integrity of the self, helplessness in the face of that threat, and exhaustion of psychosocial and personal resources for coping. The concepts of pain and suffering therefore share negative emotion as a common ground. Examination of the central physiological mechanisms underlying pain, negative emotional arousal, and stress helps clarify the physiological basis of suffering and the causal influences of persistent pain and other stressors. Central mechanisms involve both limbic processing of aversive stimulation and disturbance of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis with consequent biological disequilibrium. The palliative care specialist can address suffering proactively as well as reactively by treating potentially chronic pain and symptoms aggressively and promoting the psychosocial well-being of the patient at every opportunity.",

Reports on the psychology of patients before and after leucotomy and given in good faith by neurosurgeons are apt to look naïve in the extreme to the psycho-analyst. The psycho-analyst is perforce used to the extreme complexity of human material, and who is more aware than most people of the areas of ignorance in the understanding of persons. Leucotomy alters the seat of the self, puts a premium on relief of suffering and creates teams of skilled neurosurgeons who constitute a type of vested interest, which can affect scientific evaluation.",

(2) No special list of symptoms which has enough specificity, reliability and validity can be drawn in order to describe this state. (3) The term 'masked' is vague, and is in contradiction to the basic necessity to describe what is observed in contrast to what is unobservable and masked. However, precise and scientific criteria may be unsuitable for diagnostic purposes in these cases which are quite common; thus an entity which has a deep meaning and begs recognition among general physicians may be ignored. In addition, diagnosis of such depression is very important to allow for suitable and adequate treatment procedures. Diagnostic problems, clarification of the term 'masked' and the procedures of diagnosis are discussed in the article.",

While commonly associated with psychiatric illnesses, they are also frequently observed in conjunction with neurodegenerative diseases. Diagnosis is primarily established through clinical evaluation. However, cases of these syndromes pose a significant burden on caregivers. Therefore, it is crucial not to overlook the possibility of dementia in these syndromes. This consideration is vital for providing appropriate support and treatment to patients and their families. This case report aimed to provide a detailed examination of this topic by presenting five cases.",

Postural tremor is present while voluntarily maintaining a position against gravity (e.g., holding up outstretched arms).

From an epidemiological point of view, normality can be seen as the person being within the mid-range of a bell shaped curve of normal population distribution.Abnormality typically has a negative connotation or meaning like being anomalous, aberrant, deviant, odd, etc. A person has a mental disorder if the person suffers from a disturbance of thought, mood, volition, perception, orientation or memory that impairs judgment or behaviour to a significant extent. Psychiatric diagnosis usually refers to a statement specifying required symptoms and signs, their onset, duration, reaction to treatment and possible outcome. The main practical purposes of diagnosis in psychiatry are communication between mental health professionals and statistics of mental disorders. The reliability of psychiatric diagnoses is sometimes questionable and their validity can be dubious and arbitrary.

It consists of two opposite states, manic state and depressive state. Typical manic symptoms include a pathologic delightful mood, flight of ideas, heightened level of activity and sexual interest. Grandiosity, rapid and pressured speech, increased energy and decreased need for sleep are also frequently seen. On the other hand, depressive symptoms are characterized by prolonged depressive mood, inhibition of thought, lowered level of activity, depressive ideas or delusions and various somatic dysfunctions such as loss of appetite and sleep disturbance. Mood disorders are often seen in association with organic brain diseases, collagen diseases such as SLE, some endocrinological diseases and medication. Diagnosis of manic or depressive states is usually carried out by careful psychiatric interviews. No specific somatic symptoms or signs have been identified for manic-depressive illness. Many rating scales, for instance Zung's SDS or HDSR, have been utilized as diagnostic aids. Rating scales and the symptomatology and diagnosis of manic-depressive illness are described in general.",

Pseudodementia is a term used clinically to describe symptoms that resemble dementia but are caused by other conditions (most frequently depression), rather than being recognised as an official diagnosis. Pseudodementia is characterised by a cognitive impairment that mimics dementia but which does not have its origin in neurological degeneration, deriving instead from functional psychiatric conditions. This condition is more commonly observed in older adults (particularly those over the age of 50 or 60 years), and its risk factors overlap with those for depression. Pseudodementia is essentially characterised by deficits in memory, executive function and speech and, therefore, can easily be confused with dementia, although there are aspects that allow its differentiation. Diagnosing pseudodementia can be difficult, especially as there is significant overlap between its symptoms and those of other conditions. However, it is important to recognise characteristic aspects of this disorder, as its correct identification is essential for proper treatment.",

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by the development of a set of specific symptoms following a psychologically distressing event that is outside the range of usual human experience. 2. Recovery does not seem to feel as difficult or overwhelming if it is approached \"one day at a time.\" 3. The psychologic damage that occurs in PTSD is due primarily to holding the experiences inside, \"stuffing\" them down through various psychodynamics, or keeping the experiences subdued through addictive behaviors. 4. PTSD among Vietnam veterans is not a mental illness; it is a reaction to extreme stress and a reaction to keeping memories stuffed down and not allowed to surface.",

      "abstract": "La fragilité, aujourd’hui définie selon les critères de Fried et al. [1], est souvent associée à une souffrance psychique et notamment aux symptômes dépressifs ou même à la dépression. S’agit-il d’une co-occurrence ou bien existe-t-il des liens physiopathologiques plus ténus ? De nombreuses études ont rapporté une association positive entre dépression et risque de morbidité et de mortalité [2]. La présence de symptômes dépressifs chez les fragiles aggrave-t-elle le risque de morbidité et de mortalité de ces patients ? Les maladies mentales sont des facteurs de handicap et de vulnérabilité. Il n’existe, à ce jour, aucune étude s’étant intéressée aux populations psychiatriques vieillies au regard du concept de fragilité utilisé en gériatrie. Il existe dans ce domaine un vaste champ de recherche encore inexploré. Il est des situations au cours desquelles apparaissent des syndromes démentiels et la question de la co-occurrence d’une maladie neurodégénérative ou celle d’une évolution vésanique de la maladie psychiatrique se pose [3]. Il n’existe que peu, voire pas, d’études prospectives au long cours permettant de répondre à cette question. Les personnes âgées sont surexposées aux traitements psychotropes. Il s’agit de molécules qui auront de façon quasi-obligatoire des effets délétères, les personnes âgées étant beaucoup plus vulnérables aux effets secondaires de ces traitements alors que leur efficacité dans cette population est souvent difficile à démontrer. Une personne sur deux de plus de 70 ans fait usage de psychotropes en France. La iatrogénie est bien sûr importante avec des risques de chutes et de confusion ou de sédation excessive [4]. Il s’agit de molécules à fort potentiel cognitif. Dans une situation de fragilité gériatrique et lorsque coexiste une symptomatologie psychiatrique, la prescription des psychotropes viendra nécessairement aggraver le pronostic fonctionnel des patients notamment lorsque cette prescription n’est pas maîtrisée et répond à des critères de mésusage.",

      "title": "The relationship between Stigma and Self-Efficacy in individuals with epilepsy or nonepileptic attack disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract\r\nStigma is when a certain characteristic (such as weight or race) causes an individual or group to be treated negatively based on a feature that differentiates them from other members of society. Stigma can be considered in different ways; Stigma can be ‘enacted’, when the individual is directly discriminated against, and ‘perceived’, when individual believes the negative actions of others to be linked to an undesirable characteristic of their self. Stigma can have serious consequences, such as reduced quality of life, lower rates of employment and less overall life satisfaction. \r\nEpilepsy is a reasonably common neurological disorder where individuals experience seizures. Over 500,000 UK residents are estimated to be affected by Epilepsy. It can be caused by a number of different factors, such as brain lesions, but there may be no known cause for up to two-thirds of individuals with epilepsy. Historically, seizures have been associated with negative factors, such as demonic possession, and have experienced stigma. There is also evidence that stigmatising attitudes towards seizures continue to be prevalent. Non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD) is a condition whereby an individual experiences seizures that are outwardly similar to epileptic seizures. These seizures, however, are not associated with the neurological correlates of epilepsy. NEAD is a fairly common disorder with an estimated 15 000 UK residents receiving a diagnosis. The causes of NEAD are often considered psychological rather than physical and, as such, NEAD is often considered a mental health disorder. \r\nThe causes and manifestations of stigma in NEAD are unclear. This project aimed to extend the current understanding of stigma in NEAD by first: reviewing the literature on the experiences of stigma for NEAD and second: investigating the possible underlying factors that may cause perceived stigma in NEAD compared to epilepsy.\r\nPart I describes the outcomes of a systematic narrative review that identified 22 papers investigating the experiences of stigma by individuals diagnosed with NEAD. The results indicate that individuals with NEAD experience stigma from healthcare professionals, the public, and family and friends. Some evidence suggests that individuals with NEAD experience higher rates of stigma than epilepsy. \r\nPart II presents a cross-sectional study that investigate the relationship between perceived stigma and self-efficacy, depression, anxiety and seizure symptom severity in 2 groups (epilepsy and NEAD). The study found individuals with NEAD report more perceived stigma than those with epilepsy and higher, clinical, levels of depression. The severity of symptoms was not associated with perceived stigma for NEAD but it was with epilepsy. Depression was significant predictive factor for perceived stigma in both epilepsy and NEAD.\r\nThese studies develop the current understanding of stigma in NEAD and epilepsy. The findings suggest individuals with NEAD experience more stigma than those with Epilepsy and that depression predicts perceived stigma for other groups. The findings also suggest that stigma may be a useful target for future interventions for individuals with NEAD.",

La etiologia esta asociada a multiples factores, entre ellos los desordenes geneticos donde la deficiencia mental es caracteristica, como el trastorno de Lesch Nyhan, el sindrome de Cornelia de Lange, el sindrome de Rett, el sindrome de Rubeola Congenita y el sindrome del Cromosoma X Fragil.

Muchas de las manifestaciones de autolesividad se producen con los dientes para lacerar mucosas y otras areas, generando lesiones importantes, las cuales el odontologo debe estar en capacidad de diagnosticar y tratar. Diversos protocolos han sido aplicados como tratamientos dependiendo del caso y su complejidad. Estos varian desde el manejo farmacologico, la modificacion de conducta o la restriccion fisica. En casos extremos, se recurre a procedimientos quirurgicos.

      "abstract": "A great many, perhaps the majority, of those who see a doctor present subjective suffering and behaviour disorders that are problematic to classify as illness. This is because no pathobiological foundation for such classification is demonstrated--no matter how thoroughly the patients are examined, or how long they are followed up. Symptomatologically too, organic and non-organic conditions are distinctive. While organic illnesses are characterized by physical and biochemical signs, non-organic disorders manifest only distressing experiences (as pains or anxiety) or undesirable behaviour (as abuse of alcohol)--phenomena that are inseparable from normal sensation, emotion, intentions and actions. As for treatment, the main methods applied in organic illnesses are of a physical and biochemical nature. In cases of subjective suffering or behavioural deviances therapy consists of general relief, correction and sedation--all of the kind we make use of in our everyday lives. If the majority of those who consult a doctor are not really ill, what then, is the alternative? Individual and collective misery? The sole alternative to illness is normal psycho-physiological and behavioural variations. A widely held opinion, however, is that non-organic disorders fulfill the criteria for illness. This means that some kind of pathological substrate is postulated even when we fail to demonstrate its existence. The crucial point, however, is not to solve the problem of whether a person is ill or not, but to underline that we are dealing with two separate categories of phenomena - bio-pathologically and psycho-physiologically founded suffering and dysfunctioning.",

Prolonged delirium can also affect patients with multiple predisposing and/or precipitating factors. In clinical practice, prolonged delirium is often unrecognized, and can be misdiagnosed as other psychiatric disorders. We describe a case of a 59-year-old male presenting with behavioral and cognitive symptoms that was first misdiagnosed as a mood disorder in a general hospital setting. After prolonged delirium due to multiple factors was confirmed, the patient was treated accordingly with symptomatic management. He evolved with progressive improvement of his clinical status. Early diagnosis and management of prolonged delirium are important to improve patient prognosis and avoid iatrogenic measures.Delirium pode ser conceituado como o declínio agudo na função cognitiva que geralmente dura de horas a dias. O delírio prolongado também pode afetar pacientes com múltiplos fatores predisponentes e/ou precipitantes. Na prática clínica, o delírio prolongado é muitas vezes não reconhecido, e pode ser diagnosticado como outros transtornos psiquiátricos. Aqui, descrevemos o caso de um homem de 59 anos apresentando sintomas comportamentais e cognitivos que foi diagnosticado inicialmente com transtorno de humor em um hospital geral. Após ser diagnosticado delirium prolongado devido a múltiplos fatores, o paciente foi tratado de acordo, evoluindo com melhora progressiva do seu estado clínico. O diagnóstico e o manejo precoces do delirium prolongado são importantes para melhorar o prognóstico do paciente e evitar medidas iatrogênicas.",

Are anxiety and depression entirely separate disorders which may co-exist in the same patient? Does anxiety give rise to the depression? Does depression give rise to the anxiety? Are anxiety and depression manifestations of a single underlying disorders, dysphoria? Therapeutic responsivity to specific drugs suggest: relief of anxiety may reveal an underlying depression; anxiety syndromes which fail to respond to anxiolytics may respond to antidepressants; short-term relief of depression may occur at times with anxiolytics. Proposed mechanisms of action of depression and anxiety also involve overlap of the elements and systems involved. The basic sensations of pain, anticipation, depression and euphoria alone or in combination are sufficient to account for the dysphoric feelings and emotions when these sensations are associated with specific mental content. These may be related in turn to biogenic amines, beta-endorphins, diazepam receptors and possibly cocaine receptors.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. In these patients, cognitive, mood, and emotional disturbances are commonly observed, including depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, and anger/aggression. The debilitating effect of TBI extends years after the initial injury and impairs the recovery process and patients' quality of life. Compared to other major neurological diseases such as stroke or degenerative diseases, TBI occurs relatively young. Therefore, patients have to endure the sequelae for a more extended period. Therefore, proper diagnosis and treatment of the cognitive–emotional symptoms are essential. Studies have been made to seek the pathogenesis of the cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Unfortunately, these emotional disturbances are not apparent and often unnoticed by busy clinicians. Their phenomenology, predicting factors, and pathophysiology have been underrecognized and understudied. In addition, well-designed clinical trials regarding these symptoms are rare. It has been suggested that the congitive and emotional sequelae are related to the \"remote\" effect of the initial brain injury rather than the initial pathology itself. This review will describe some of the most common or relevant poststroke mood and emotional disturbances. The phenomenology, factors or predictors, and relevant lesion locations will be described, and pharmacological treatment of these emotional disturbances will be discussed based on presumable pathophysiological mechanisms.",

Whereas these are often considered important indicators of mental health problems in people, in companion animals, many owners view these behaviours as quirky or even amusing features of their pet. However, the absence of self-report also means that the array of repetitive behaviour conditions in companion animals is also much more diverse than in humans and there is a danger of drawing simple analogies between human and non-human animals based on very superficial phenotypic features. For example, the following differentials might be considered for a dog who chases its tail:\r\n •Seizure possibly a primary partial seizure or secondary to a lesion in the brain such as damage to the vestibular system \r\n•Inner ear infection \r\n•Play \r\n•Pain in the tail or lower back due to damage to the nerves (neuralgia), bones or soft tissues \r\n•Pain around the region of the tail including skin inflammation and infections, impacted or infected anal sacs or trauma \r\n•A learned response aimed at attracting owner attention. \r\n•Acute conflict\r\n•Compulsive Disorder \r\n•Stereotypy \r\n\r\nThese explanations are not independent and a dog who starts chasing his tail for one reason may subsequently learn to do it at other times in order to gain attention, or the frequent repetition of the behaviour may potentially result in neurological sensitization and the expression of the behaviour becoming emancipated from its original triggering stimuli. From the simple (and by no means definitive) list of differentials for tail chasing given above it should be obvious that underlying cognition can vary enormously with a given presenting stereotypic behaviour. This presentation considers the value but also limitations of using companion animals as models of human conditions and especially the value of using real world rather than laboratory models.",

One of the common referral queries to clinicians of people with ID – ‘Is this a mental illness or just a problem behaviour?’ – tends to stir up more discussion. At one extreme, attempts to understand maladaptive behaviours are merely descriptive and simply default to the ID itself. For example, aggression or self-injurious behaviour is said to be a product of the individual's cognitive disability and does not warrant a ‘diagnosis’. At the same time, the degree to which an individual is held accountable for his behaviour is also placed into consideration, as is the appropriateness of pharmacotherapy, depending on the answer to the referral question.",

It is estimated that over 35% of Irish adults experience chronic pain, the treatment of which represents a significant financial burden on the health care system. It has been found that people who suffer from chronic pain also experience high levels of shame associated with their condition. Shame can be described as internalised stigma. It is a painful feeling of humiliation or distress caused by the self-consciousness of wrong or foolish behaviour. People who experience shame perceive themselves as wholly negative. Such judgement can further exacerbate feelings of worthlessness, leading to social avoidance, withdrawal and a deterioration of functioning in patients with chronic pain. Furthermore experiencing shame can dramatically impact the health-seeking behaviours of patients.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is one of the most frequent symptoms in medicine. A detailed history must include sleeping habits, other diseases, drugs, and concomitant symptoms. A physical examination is necessary, followed by laboratory tests and imaging techniques, which must be used in a cost-effective manner. When underlying diseases are excluded, a chronic fatigue syndrome may be present. Its pathogenesis is largely unknown. Established treatment options in chronic fatigue syndrome are graded exercise, antidepressants in case of depression and anxiety, and cognitive behaviour treatment. The large number of other treatments including diets have no proven value. Fatigue remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to the physician.",

Objetivos: Revisar as características e pontos principais da migrânea. Materiais e Métodos: revisão narrativa realizada em bases de dados digitais, livros e informações de organizações de referência mundial. Resultados: A migrânea é um tipo de cefaleia primária de alta prevalência, sendo mais comum em mulheres. Pode ser com ou sem aura – sintomas neurológicos focais que precedem a dor – ou crônica. Caracteriza-se por cefaleia pulsátil, unilateral, de intensidade de moderada a grave, associada a náusea, vomito, foto ou fonofobia e que se agrava com atividades físicas rotineiras. Deve ser diferenciada de outras cefaleias primarias e, quando na presença de sinais de alarme, também das secundárias, em especial se na terceira idade. Fatores como odores e luzes fortes, consumo de bebida alcoólica, certos alimentos, jejum prolongado, distúrbios do sono e ciclo menstrual podem desencadear uma crise. Seu tratamento pode ser farmacológico ou não, além de envolver medidas gerais; e pode ser sintomático ou profilático – mais indicado em casos mais graves ou refratários. Dentre os medicamentos utilizados durante as crises há os específicos (triptanos e derivados da ergotamina) e não específicos (analgésicos e anti-inflamatórios não esteroidais). Conclusão: Conclui-se que a migrânea deve ser reconhecida e diagnosticada correta e precocemente, objetivando uma terapêutica adequada e individualizada para que se alcance uma melhora na qualidade de vida do paciente.",

Unfortunately, such a disorder significantly hurts the spirit, soul, mind, emotions, memories, and physiological body functions. It is a complicated condition that can be under-reported, missed, or undiagnosed, accordingly, raising public awareness about its etiology, manifestations, and prompt ways to deal with is crucial for its early diagnosis and proper intervention that will improve the quality of life of its sufferers dramatically.

      "abstract": "<i>Background:</i> Social anxiety disorder (also known as social phobia) is characterized by extreme fear, avoidance, or both of one or more social or performance situations, such as making a presentation, meeting new people, or eating in front of others. This condition is common, with a lifetime prevalence of up to 13%, and one third of affected persons have major dysfunction. <i>Methods:</i> The English-language literature on social anxiety disorder indexed on MEDLINE was searched using the phrases \"social phobia\" or \"social anxiety disorder;\" this search was supplemented with other data sources, such as recent textbooks, to determine common clinical symptoms, differential diagnosis, and management in the primary care setting. <i>Results:</i> Recognition and treatment of social anxiety disorder is poor; only a small minority of patients with this condition have it appropriately diagnosed or treated. Primary care physicians should suspect social anxiety disorder in patients who have specific symptoms and signs (such as hyperhidrosis, flushing, tremor, and white-coat hypertension), in patients who have symptoms of anxiety (such as chest pain, palpitations, or dizziness), or in patients who have another known anxiety disorder, depression, or substance abuse. Drug treatment consists of serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or high-potency benzodiazepines. A specific type of psychotherapy called cognitive behavioral therapy is another effective treatment, but it is not acceptable or accessible to most patients. <i>Conclusions:</i> Because social anxiety disorder is common, disabling, and treatable, primary care physicians should intensify their efforts to recognize it.",

      "title": "Padma 28 bei Restless-Legs-Syndrom: Fallberichte wecken Hoffnungen auf Wirksamkeit",
      "abstract": "Beim sogenannten Restless-Legs-Syndrom (RLS) handelt es sich um eine neurologische, sensomotorische Störung, welche sich unter anderem durch Symptome wie Gefühlsstörungen und Bewegungsdrang in den Extremitäten äussert. Meist sind die Beine stärker betroffen als die Arme, und es kann neben den Empfindungsstörungen auch zu unwillkürlichen Bewegungen der betroffenen Körperpartien kommen. Folgende vier Symptome müssen für eine klinische Diagnose des RLS vorhanden sein: - Missempfindungen mit Bewegungsdrang;- motorische Unruhe;- verstärktes Auftreten der Beschwerden in Ruhephase und sofortige Verbesserung bei Bewegung;- gehäuftes Auftreten der Symptome gegen Abend bzw. in der Nacht.Man unterscheidet zwischen einer idiopathischen und einer symptomatischen Form des RLS. Die symptomatische Form tritt gehäuft bei verschiedenen Erkrankungen wie Eisenmangel, Diabetes mellitus, Polyneuro- pathie, rheumatoide Arthritis und chronisch venöse Insuffizienz sowie auch in der Schwangerschaft auf. Weiter können Medikamente wie Dopaminantagonisten und Antidepressiva ein RLS auslösen. Die idiopathische Form wird zu 30-92% familiär vererbt, wobei ein autosomal-dominanter Erbgang angenommen wird [1].Das RLS ist eine der häufigsten neurologischen Krankheiten. Seine Prävalenz beträgt in Westeuropa und in den USA etwa 7%. Die Ausprägung der Symptome erstreckt sich über einen weiten Bereich von «kaum bemerkbar» bis «schlafraubend». Da die Beeinträchtigung der Lebensqualität durch stärker ausgeprägte Symptome erheblich ist (Schlafmangel, Müdigkeit, Konzentrationsschwierigkeiten), suchen viele Betroffene Rat bei medizinischen Fachpersonen.Das therapeutische Spektrum zur Behandlung des RLS umfasst neben der Behandlung der zugrunde liegenden Krankheit das Absetzen möglicher «triggernder» Medikamente, den Verzicht auf Genussdrogen am Abend (Koffein, Nikotin, Alkohol), das Lösen kognitiver Aufgaben vor dem Schlafengehen sowie physiotherapeutische Übungen. Klassische pharmakotherapeutische Massnahmen bei RLS beinhalten Levodopa, Dopaminagonisten, Antiepileptika, Antiparkinsonika und Opiate - allerdings alle mit entsprechend hohem Nebenwirkungspotenzial. Viele Patienten sind trotz des hohen Leidensdrucks nicht gewillt, sich einer solchen Therapie zu unterziehen. Die Nachfrage und der Wunsch nach alternativen Behandlungsoptionen sind deshalb gross.Padma 28 ist ein pflanzliches Arzneimittel, das in der Schweiz nach den Prinzipien der Tibetischen Medizin hergestellt wird und aus 22 Komponenten besteht. Es wird in der Schweiz von der Zusatzversicherung erstattet, das identische Präparat Padmed Circosan von der Grundversicherung.Dieses tibetische Vielstoffgemisch wird bei Parästhesien wie Kribbeln, Ameisenlaufen, Schwere- und Spannungsgefühl in den Beinen und Armen, Einschlafen von Händen und Füssen und Wadenkrämpfen eingesetzt. Diese Symptome können sowohl durch arterielle Durchblutungsstörungen als auch durch eine gestörte venöse Mikrozirkulation im Gewebe verursacht werden. Die von der Swissmedic zugelassenen Indikationen sind: Durchblutungsstörungen wie Kribbeln, Einschlafen von Händen und Füssen, Schwere- und Spannungsgefühl von Beinen und Armen, Wadenkrämpfe.Es gibt Fallberichte, die darauf schliessen lassen, dass Padma 28 bei Erkrankungen wirksam ist, die ein symptomatisches RLS begünstigen oder auslösen können. Da die jeweiligen Erkrankungen in dieser Zeitschrift schon ausführlich vorgestellt wurden, sollen diese im Folgenden nur nochmals kurz erwähnt werden.In einem Fallbericht aus einer Schweizer Allgemeinpraxis [2] wurden 2 Fälle vorgestellt, bei denen Padma 28 bei Parästhesien Linderung schaffen konnte. In einem der Fälle litt ein 68-jähriger Diabetes-Patient (Typ 1) zusätzlich auch an PAVK (periphere arterielle Verschlusskrankheit) Fontaine-Stadium IIb. Er wurde mit Insulin und zusätzlich mit Azetylsalizylsäure 100 mg/Tag behandelt. Aufgrund von Gefühlsstörungen in den Füssen und Schmerzen in den Beinen erhielt der Patient zusätzlich 3 × 2 Tabletten (die galenische Form von Padma 28 und Padmed Circosan wurde inzwischen von Tabletten auf Kapseln gewechselt)/Tag Padma 28. Nach 6 Wochen waren die Beschwerden von mittelstarker auf schwache Intensität zurückgegangen. Nach weiteren 3,5 Monaten war der Patient beschwerdefrei. Deshalb wurde die Dosierung auf 3 × 1 Tablette/Tag reduziert. In den nächsten 8 Monaten reichte diese Erhaltungsdosis aus; die Beschwerden traten nie wieder auf. Die Dosierung wurde präventiv weitergeführt.In einem weiteren Fall litt ein 57-jähriger Diabetes-Patient (Typ 2) (Metformin 1000 mg/Tag sowie Pioglitazon 30 mg/Tag) unter mittelstarken Parästhesien in den Füssen und Dysästhesien in den Händen. Auch dieser Patient erhielt 3 × 2 Tabletten/Tag Padma 28. Dank einer deutlichen Besserung der Beschwerden wurde nach 6 Wochen die Dosis auf 2 × 1 Tablette/Tag reduziert. Nach weiteren 6 Wochen war der Patient beschwerdefrei. Die Erhaltungsdosis wurde weitergeführt.Auch dieser Fallbericht stammt aus einer Schweizer Allgemeinpraxis [3]. Hier handelte es sich um eine 71-jährige Patientin, die wegen mittelstarker Ödeme im rechten Fussknöchel sowie einem subjektiven Kältegefühl in den Füssen in die Behandlung ging. Sie wünschte zur Behandlung des Ödems ein natürliches Produkt und erhielt deshalb 3 × 2 Tabletten/Tag Padma 28. Das Kältegefühl in den Füssen verschwand innerhalb einiger Tage, und schon innerhalb von weniger als 2 Wochen verbesserte sich das Ödem von mittelstark auf schwach. In den nächsten 4 Monaten nahm die Patientin das Präparat nur noch unregelmässig ein. Prompt traten die Beschwerden wieder in mittelstarker Intensität auf. Eine erneute, konsequente Einnahme von 3 × 2 Tabletten brachte die Ödeme innerhalb von 2 Wochen zum Verschwinden. Die Einnahme wurde präventiv weitergeführt; die Ödeme traten nicht mehr auf.Dieser Fallbericht stammt aus einer Allgemeinpraxis in Näfels [4]. Hier handelte es sich um einen 68-jährigen Patienten mit einer diagnostizierten Polyneuropathie (PNP). Die damit verbundenen Beschwerden bestanden schon seit etwa 30 Jahren und äusserten sich in Form von Gefühllosigkeit der Füsse bis zur Mitte der Unterschenkel, Gehschmerzen in den Unterschenkeln, Kältegefühl in den Füssen sowie einer leichten Obstipation. Der Patient klagte auch über seit 20 Jahren bestehende Einschlafstörungen. Auch dieser Patient äusserte den Wunsch nach einer Alternative zur klassischen Medizin. Deshalb wurde ihm Padma 28 in einer Dosierung von 3 × 2 Kapseln/Tag verschrieben. Aufgrund einer deutlichen Verbesserung der Symptome wurde nach 17 Behandlungswochen auf eine Erhaltungsdosis von 2 × 2 Kapseln/Tag reduziert. Die anfänglich stark ausgeprägte Gefühllosigkeit der Füsse bis zur Mitte der Unterschenkel wurde vom Patienten nach 11 Behandlungswochen noch als mittelstark und nach 21 Wochen nur noch als schwach beschrieben. Das Kältegefühl in den Füssen nahm kontinuierlich ab und war nach 21 Wochen verschwunden. Auch die Gehschmerzen in den Unterschenkeln nahmen kontinuierlich ab und waren nach 21 Wochen nur noch schwach ausgeprägt. Auch die Obstipation war nach 21 Wochen nicht mehr vorhanden. Die Einschlafprobleme waren zu diesem Zeitpunkt nur noch schwach.Die 4 vorgestellten Fallberichte geben Hinweise auf eine Wirksamkeit des tibetischen Vielstoffgemischs Padma 28 bei Diabetes-bedingten Parästhesien, bei venösen Beinbeschwerden sowie bei Polyneuropathie. Die Einnahme von Padma 28 zeigte jeweils eine ausgeprägte Abnahme der Beschwerden. Deshalb würde es sich lohnen, weitere Abklärungen durchzuführen, um die Wirksamkeit bei diesen Indikationen zu bestätigen. Weiterhin könnte sich hieraus eine mögliche Wirksamkeit von Padma 28 beim RLS ergeben, da dieses häufig im Zusammenhang mit den in diesen Fallberichten beschriebenen Beschwerden auftritt. Wegen der sehr guten Verträglichkeit von Padma 28 und dem hohen Nebenwirkungspotenzial der klassischen Medikamente zur Behandlung des RLS könnte sich Padma 28 zur wirkungsvollen Alternative in der Behandlung des RLS anbieten.",

      "title": "Medically unexplained physical symptoms",
      "abstract": "Concern about physical symptoms is a common reason for people to seek medical help. Many of these symptoms, such as headache, chest pain, weakness, dizziness, and fatigue, remain unexplained by identi­fiable disease even after careful medical assessment. Several general terms have been used to describe these types of symptom— somatoform, medically un­explained, and functional. We prefer the terms ‘med­ically unexplained physical symptom’ or ‘functional symptom’, because they imply a disturbance of some kind in bodily functioning without implying that the symptom is psychogenic. Patients and doctors often assume that a physical symptom implies that a phys­ical pathology exists. However, commonly experienced and often severe, distressing, and disabling symp­toms, such as menstrual pain or ‘tension headache’, indicate that this is not always the case. By assuming that a physical symptom is explained by physical dis­ease/ pathology, we may be subjecting the patient to unnecessary tests and hospital visits, adding to pa­tient distress, and failing to deliver the integrated management required. There are many kinds of these symptoms (Box 25.1), presenting across healthcare settings. They are con­sidered in this psychiatry textbook because (1) psy­chological factors (including, at times, psychiatric disorder) are important in aetiology and (2) psycho­logical and behavioural interventions have a funda­mental role in treatment A major obstacle to effective management of pa­tients with functional symptoms is that they feel their doctor does not believe them. They are concerned that they may be thought to be ‘putting it on’. Note that the deliberate manufacture or exaggeration of symptoms or signs (malingering) is quite different (see p. 359). Diagnoses of three kinds may be given: … ● Descriptive physical syndromes. These include fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, non- cardiac chest pain, chronic pain syndrome, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although the specific terms are useful in everyday medical practice, there is substantial overlap, and many patients with, for example, fibromyalgia will also have IBS. ● Psychiatric syndromes as the primary cause of the functional symptoms. Psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and adjustment, are common primary causes of functional symptoms, and commonly present via the general hospital’s emergency department or cardiology clinic.",

Thus, when evaluating patients with muscle symptoms, an iatrogenic muscle problem should always be considered, to be able to distinguish a toxic from any other myopathy early on, preventing further muscle damage and to potentially reverse muscle injury by withdrawal of the toxic agent. Various commonly prescribed medications, as well as illicit drugs, may cause muscle damage. These substances may cause muscle injury through direct myotoxic effects, or indirectly through various mechanisms, such as electrolyte abnormalities and triggering, or disinhibiting the immune system response.",

In contrast to the symptoms of neurosis, psychotic symptoms are categorically outside the normal realm of experience, and as such they are beyond our common-sense powers of understanding and empathy. It is this aspect of psychotic symptoms that isolates persons experiencing them in \"a world of their own\". The availability of anti-psychotic drugs means that many sufferers today can obtain significant relief from symptoms. The experiences of persons in the grip of psychotic episodes recorded in centuries past are remarkably similar to the kinds of feelings and ideas described by sufferers. Delusions may present as part of a complex of psychotic phenomena as in schizophrenia, mania, or psychotic depression, or as the lone, predominant psychotic feature of a paranoid psychosis. The delusions associated with the affective psychoses tend to have contents that are congruent with the mood of the patient.",

      "title": "Depressive Mood Disorders",
      "abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy is most often used to treat disorders of mood. The internally experienced feeling is the emotional state reflected in the way we present ourselves to others and in the ways we react to them. Mood varies with daily circumstances and is sensitive to the conditions of the body, particularly physical health, fatigue, hunger, and hormonal activity. Moods are experienced internally and fluctuate widely. Two disorders are recognized. Depression, or depressive mood disorder, is dominated by sadness, hopelessness, fear of the future, and the persistent thought that life is not worth living. Mania, or manic mood disorder, is a state of excitement, grandiosity, expansiveness, and feelings of increased power and energy. In the present psychiatric classification, mania is labeled bipolar disorder and the depressed phase is labeled major depression. In a depressive mood disorder, body functions are disrupted. Patients are sleepless, appetite is poor, and weight loss may be pronounced, at times amounting to 20% of the body weight within a few weeks. Work, sexual activity, and family may be disregarded. The future appears hopeless, patients believe they are helpless to affect it, and their thoughts are filled with gloom. Threats of suicide reflect their distress. They are often agitated and restless. Many meet the criteria for the malignant syndrome of melancholia. Overwhelmed by feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, and worthlessness, the depressed patient dwells on thoughts of suicide. He may believe that others are watching or talking about him; voices are heard when no one is present; and concerns that his spouse is unfaithful dominate his thought. At times, the events depicted on the television or movie screen seem to apply directly to him. Such strange thoughts are delusions, and this severe state of depressed mood and disorder in thought is labeled delusional depression or psychotic depression. These disorders require intensive treatment and almost always hospital care. A depressed patient is commonly unaware of the day’s events, registers little of what happens around her, and has a compromised memory. This form of depression can be difficult to distinguish from an Alzheimer-type dementia. When the symptoms of dementia are brought about by depression, however, they can be reversed with treatment.",

Freud elucidated the fantasy distortion and elaboration of traumatic experience and retained the importance of actual trauma. Psychic trauma is associated with the alteration of self and object representations and ensuing new identifications, e.g., with victim and aggressor. The \"deferred action\" of psychic trauma is an antiquated concept and psychic trauma has immediate effects as well as far reaching developmental consequences. Prior trauma predisposes to later traumatic vulnerability and to trauma linked to phase specific unconscious conflict. The pathogenesis of child sex abuse and the enactment of oedipal incest extends before and after the oedipal phase, is often associated with other forms of abuse, and has a history of pathogenic parent-child relationship.",

      "title": "BIOLOGICALLY BASED DEFICIT IN THE IDENTIFIED PATIENT: INDICATIONS FOR PSYCHOEDUCATIONAL STRATEGIES",
      "abstract": "The phrase “identified patient” has attracted a wide following among family therapists representing a variety of approaches to family therapy. It is based on the assumption that persons referred for psychotherapeutic treatment are often incorrectly labeled “patients” when, in fact, their symptoms are manifestations of family, not individual, dysfunction or pathology. It is the thesis of this article that when biologically based deficits in the identified patient are a salient determinant of interpersonal dysfunction, such reframing is inappropriate. Psycho‐educational strategies for treating families of persons with such physically based conditions as learning disability, attention deficit disorder, epilepsy, autism, and various medical illnesses and handicaps, are recommended.",

      "title": "Identity – A critical but neglected construct in cognitive-behaviour therapy",
      "abstract": "In cognitive-behaviour therapy attention paid to the self and identity has primarily involved self-representations (the Me-Self) rather than how the self is experienced (the I-Self). Within the I-Self experiences vary on a continuum from pre-reflective consciousness (raw experienced perceptions and states of being) to self-awareness (permitting reflection on and evaluation of subjective experience). There is considerable evidence that the I-Self is affected in many if not all disorders, and I review illustrative studies of OCD, eating disorders, body dysmorphic disorder, PTSD, and personality disorder. These indicate that patients often experience themselves as being defective in various ways, or as having an unstable or contradictory I-Self. Recognition of this neglected aspect of patients' experience has major implications for assessment and treatment. For example, acknowledgment that their sense of self may fluctuate dramatically from moment to moment, may be fragmented, or may consist of a sense of emptiness, may help to build a more empathic therapeutic relationship. If frightening or distressing pre-reflective experiences are the cause of avoidance or other maladaptive coping strategies, conscious attention paid to them in therapy may help to better integrate the I-Self and Me-Self, restoring a sense of predictability and control.",

      "abstract": "Four cases of compulsive self-injurious behaviour (SIB) with variable degrees of tissue damage targeted to the painful body part are reported in humans with neuropathic pain. Review of human literature revealed several cases, primarily after central nervous system (CNS) lesions, during which non-psychotic verbally communicating humans (mostly with intact mental status) target specifically the painful part which is usually analgesic or hypoalgesic. In few instances, however, the involved part is not only sentient but also hyperalgesic in part or as a whole. The act is characterized by uncontrollable urge and compulsion, aggravated under conditions of stress, isolation, confusion or depression, and occasionally occurring in patients with personality disorders, ongoing drug abuse and pre-existing compulsive habits (i.e., habitual nail biting or picking). It fails to be deterred by the appearance of the injured part, social mores or even the experience of pain. Successful treatment of underlying painful dysesthesiae with specific medications, neurostimulation or surgery has resulted in marked improvement of dysesthesiae accompanied by wound healing in several cases. The four presented cases and the human literature experience provide evidence that compulsive targeted SIB in humans with neuropathic pain and painful dysesthesiae is consistent with the concept that animal autotomy may result from chronic neuropathic pain after experimental peripheral or CNS lesions.",

Psychotic disorders in early adulthood are most frequently diagnosed with the schizophrenia spectrum or mood disorders. However, they may be the manifestation of neurologic, endocrine or immunologic disease. Individuals with NDD's such as the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or intellectual developmental disorder (IDD) may also present initially in adulthood. Therefore it is not uncommon that the psychiatrist is the first physician to assess a psychotic patient with underlying medical illness or a NDD. Failure to identify the underlying cause will delay appropriate management. Overdiagnosis of primary psychiatric disorders may be misleading in planning the treatment, as evidence-based treatment algorithms relevant to psychosis are intended for primary psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, and symptomatic treatment may result in unnecessary exposure to antipsychotic drugs. Exclusion of other medical conditions and NDD's is essential before establishing a diagnosis of schizophrenia.",

Sport transitions may be accompanied by changes in identity, interpersonal relationships, schedules, and behavioural changes. Psychosocial outcomes following sport retirement can be broadly differentiated between acute psychological distress, mental health disorders, and healthy adjustment. Acute psychological distress following sport retirement may be best understood in the context of stressful life events. Stressful life events, such as job transitions and family conflict, have been shown to predict the onset of mental health concerns, such as depression. Sport retirement is a significant life event, and negative emotions are a common response to the transition. Adjustment disorder is characterised by the onset of emotional or behavioural symptoms within three months of an identifiable stressor and does not persist past six months after termination of the stressor.",

Forensic Neuropsychology establishes an expert valuation of the brain-injured patient (or supposed), or of the law offender people (or supposed) requiring law protection due to their illness. This discipline has a fundamental role in the study of cerebral organic syndromes, particularly in the dementias. DEVELOPMENT. The demential syndrome is common to a group of diseases as degenerative or cardiovascular disorders, brain tumors, syphilis, alcoholism or toxic factors, etc. When speaking of dementia we refer to a syndrome characterized by a progressive and global deterioration of the cognitive functions (memory, language, attention, space-temporal orientation, praxis, thinking, etc.) with preservation of the level of conscience (DSM-IV). This symptomatology affects the personality of the individual as reasonable being , as well as to his behavior and social adaptation. The decrease or loss of the intellectual and volitives abilities of the affected person of a demential syndrome, if it is permanent, also implies a change in its legal situation, since its legal capacity is altered. Therefore, it will be necessary to adopt protective measures for his person and his patrimony. Even if it is necessary, to promote a process of disability, whose sentence will be emitted by a judge, who will indicate: the degree of the mentioned disability, the trusteeship regime and who is designated as a legal tutor.",

      "title": "Can Functional Visual Loss Occur in an Older Adult Patient With a History of Stroke: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Aims Nonorganic visual loss, or functional blindness, is estimated to account for up to 5% of all presentations of blindness. This form of blindness can be ascribed to either a psychogenic aetiology or to malingering. Psychogenic blindness is often a manifestation of conversion disorder, in which a psychiatric condition impairs the normal physical functioning of the affected individual. This could lead to both motor and sensory defects, given that they are not better explained by an organic cause, which should be ruled out by investigations that prove an intact visual system. The individual would also commonly have an identifiable source of stress or trauma. Conversion disorders are less prevalent in older adults, and they may be missed where there are organic comorbidities. Methods A 67-year-old male with a recent history of stroke was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder, characterized by low mood, anhedonia, insomnia, fatigue, poor appetite, poor concentration, feelings of guilt, negative feelings about life, and hopelessness. Multiple social problems and family conflicts were identified as possible precipitating factors. Sertraline led to some good initial response, although it was later discontinued. A few months later, he developed severe depression with irritability and suicidal ideation, and he was repeatedly requesting euthanasia. At this point, there was a sudden loss of his vision. Following a thorough ophthalmology evaluation, neurological assessment, and investigations including MRI of the head, cortical blindness was ruled out. As a result, he was diagnosed with visual conversion disorder. After recommencing treatment for his depression with a psychotherapeutic approach as well as vortioxetine antidepressant medication, the visual loss resolved, and the issue has not recurred since then. There was also a significant improvement in his mood. He no longer feels suicidal and appears to be brighter and more socially interactive. Results Uncertainty regarding aetiology might initially arise if the patient has a history of trauma or a pathological condition that could cause blindness, such as diabetic retinopathy or stroke, both of which would have been differential diagnoses in the patient in this case had they not been debunked by further investigations, which included neuro-ophthalmic assessments and radiographic studies. The patient's improvement with antidepressants and counselling further supports the diagnosis of visual conversion disorder. Conclusion Functional blindness, which is an aspect of conversion disorder, may be a representation of how detrimental undiagnosed and untreated depression could be.",

Variations in the symptoms do not point to the primary syndrome. Both the patient and the doctor may be unaware that the patient is depressed.

      "abstract": "We all experience pain at one time or another. Pain is an essential “alarm bell” that tells us that something is wrong, and a “teacher” that reminds us not to do that same thing again. Usually, pain is felt when a stimulus, such as a pinch or an injury, causes electrical pulses to run along one of the cables of nerve fibers in our body and into the brain where they generate an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience. Sometimes pain occurs without any actual stimulus, such as when nerve fibers have been damaged. An example is the phantom pain that amputees sometimes feel in their missing limb. Certain drugs can stop pain by blocking the electrical pulses before they reach the brain. Other drugs stop pain in a different way, by preventing the brain from reading the pain message carried by the electrical pulses. This article explains what happens in the body when we are hurt, how the brain causes this to be felt as pain and how certain drugs can stop pain.",

The source may be limbic or peripheral, involving encoded memories or physiological changes. It is important to realise that physical symptoms such as those of functional dyspepsia do not only mean that the patient has a stomach disorder which needs to be identified and treated with specific pharmacological remedies, they often represent, in metaphorical and symbolic form, a state of disharmony brought about a specific psychosocial situation. It is only when that situation is understood and acknowledged that the patient can begin to get better.",

Medical field exhibit many type of data and thus it provide large statically and dynamic data, its relevant Meta data which contains a detail information about the observation made in different scenario. Medical data such as EEG, ECG reports, MRI reports, different lab test reports and other observation which are either in text format or graphical image format derived. These are different sample format describe various symptoms and prevention associate with those symptoms. Genetic activity, genes presence and repetition also gives user activity detail and problems in human body. Mental illness is a type of disease which relate with the mental disorder. It deals in human interaction, its behavior, and its regular and irregular activity. In this stage human sudden start misbehave or extra activities during the particular phase and hence an un-predictable incident may occur. Psychometric disease cases are increasing day by day with different symptoms in human being. These are diseases which occur due to over work pressure, mental activity, some past human life incident or may be the victim of some good or bad incident. It leads to several problems in society, as per well issue with the person who is suffering with the particular disorder. An human interaction and understanding capacity is different than a normal person which keep person separate from the normal society and social life. These disorders also occur sometime very violent and make it very tedious to recover. Psychiatric relate to brain disorder, Mental disorder, irregular work performing in public etc. Diagnosis over the disease is complex and not fixed. In the previous research on the same concern shows that the past data can be analyzed properly and it can further be useful for the precautions. Mental disorder records may leads to several Meta data, report activities observed by hospital or supervision person. A classification over the given symptoms, its action and medical treatment help in diagnosis. Past studies always parts in important role using which further decision can be taken. Mental disorder, mental health, further possibilities can be observed and driven remedy can be discussed. Data classification algorithm makes it possible to classify the normal and abnormal data cases. Hospital release dataset give the information which tends to changes, mental health of previous patients and their best precautions taken to cure them. Different algorithm model is used which help in mining the previous algorithm data rule over the past cases. It enable user to understand past cases, their symptoms, disease occurred and its diagnosis steps taken. Various algorithms such as Genetic algorithm, Naïve bayes, Ant colony optimization, Rule based reasoning (RBR), Case based reasoning (CBR) and Artificial neural network (ANN) is used for psychometric disease finding from the large dataset. In this paper survey of past techniques is performed. This paper also illustrates the work finding and limitation of previous research. An analysis using the real time dataset over the proposed algorithm is left for further work..",

From the moment clinicians first see patients, they quite naturally notice many things about their motor behavior: body posture, degree of muscle tension, amount of fidgeting or pacing and facial expression. The muscles of the eye and face are innervated by cranial nerves that originate in the brain. Consequently, disturbances in facial or eye muscle functioning provide crucial clues about whether individua's difficulties originate in the nervous system outside the brain or within brain. Neurological soft signs are subtle, lifelong abnormalities in motor and sensory functioning that are likely caused by imperfect embryonic development or minor, early brain injury. “Automatic behavior” refers to rote movement behaviors that are carried out by individuals in an altered state of consciousness. An apraxia might involve difficulty in performing relatively simple movements or complex action sequences involving objects.",

The opposite of defence mechanisms is coping mechanisms. The adaptiveness/maladaptiveness of defences are disputed. Various fields of research have given evidence to their maladaptiveness as ways of dealing with threatening stimuli. It has been found that defences can lead to insensitivity to danger signals, lowered coping capacity to life stresses with increased vulnerability to “psychosomatic diseases”, delay in seeking help for somatic symptoms, denial of death in dying patients, their relatives and medical attendants, and delayed or complicated grief reactions.",

There are many causes of ID including genetic, environmental, and idiopathic etiologies. The assessment of ID includes evaluating for underlying and/or associated medical conditions and neuropsychological testing to evaluate the child’s cognitive and functional abilities. The severity of ID is determined by the child’s functional abilities. Components of treatment may include speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, family counseling and respite care, behavioral interventions, and educational interventions. Families should also be educated on transition-to-adulthood topics including guardianship. Pharmacologic treatments can be used to treat behavioral symptoms, sleep difficulty, or comorbid psychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract": "Chronic pain is a sensory experience that produces suffering and functional impairment and is the result of both sensory input as well as secondary adaptation of the nervous system. The sensitization of the nervous system to pain is influenced by physical activity (or inactivity) and medication exposure. Medication taking and physical activity are behaviors that are increased or decreased by positive and negative reinforcement. Patients often have comorbid psychiatric conditions at presentation, including addictions, mood disorders, personality vulnerabilities and life circumstances that amplify their disability and impede their recovery. Behavioral conditioning contributes to chronic pain disorders in the form of both classical (Pavlov) and operant (Skinner) conditioning that increases the experience of pain, the liability to ongoing injury, the central amplification of pain, the use of reinforcing medications such as opiates and benzodiazepines, and behaviors associated with disability. The term 'abnormal illness behavior' has been used to describe behaviors that are associated with illness but are not explained physiologically. Behavioral conditioning often amplifies these abnormal behaviors in patients with chronic pain. Addiction can also be seen as a behavior that is reinforced and conditioned. The same factors that amplify abnormal illness behaviors also increase the liability to addiction. Psychiatric comorbidities also complicate and amplify abnormal illness behaviors and addictive behaviors and further contribute to the disability of chronic pain patients. Model interventions that reinforce healthy behaviors and extinguish illness behaviors are effective in patients with addictions and chronic pain. Maladaptive behaviors including addictive behaviors can be used as targets for classical and operant conditioning techniques, and these techniques are demonstrably effective in patients with chronic pain and addictions.",

Other names such as somatisation and somatoform disorder are also being used but imply different definitions.1–3 Patients with medically unexplained symptoms do not fit into the existing framework of a biomedical model that tends to focus on the exclusion of physical disease. However, the exclusion of relevant physical disease may not in itself cure the patient. He or she may still feel ill and seek medical care.

      "title": "De l’adversité à l’altérité. Le féminin en travail chez l’homme handicapé qui vieillit",
      "abstract": "Parmi les problématiques psychiques susceptibles d’entraver ou de soutenir le traitement des conflits engagés par l’expérience du vieillissement et/ou du handicap, la question des identifications sexuelles se révèle nodale. En effet, outre la question identitaire, des assises narcissiques et de la différenciation moi/non moi, la question des identifications secondaires mobilisées par les différences des sexes et des générations se révèle être une dynamique majeure du rapport que toute personne peut entretenir avec son corps. Le vécu des limitations liées à l’expérience du handicap, et de celles, plus communes, liées à la traversée du vieillissement et de la vieillesse – qu’elles soient brutales ou insidieuses, aiguës ou chroniques –, entretient des rapports complexes avec les fantasmes de castration et de passivité. L’expérience de psychothérapies analytiques d’hommes qui, pour cause accidentelle traumatique (chute, accident de la voie publique), ou pour cause de fragilité somatique (accident vasculaire cérébral), se retrouvent en situation de handicap (avec des séquelles plus ou moins invalidantes) et vieillissent ainsi, permet de discerner combien la question des identifications féminines joue un rôle capital dans l’élaboration des conflits psychiques inhérents à cette rencontre entre vieillissement et handicap. L’auteur propose d’illustrer cette question clinique par l’exposé des grandes étapes de la psychothérapie d’un homme de 75 ans qui permet de saisir comment la rigidité puis la souplesse des identifications sexuelles, de la revendication de la puissance à la possibilité d’y renoncer au profit de l’acceptation d’une certaine passivité-jouissance, organisent, gênent ou élaborent le conflit psychique et, partant, les relations aux proches, aux enfants, aux femmes et aux hommes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A diagnosis of toxic-related injury/illness requires a consideration of the illness related to the toxic exposure, including diagnosis, causation, and permanent impairment; these are best performed by a physician who is certified by a specialty board certified by the American Board of Preventive Medicine. The patient must have a history of symptoms consistent with the exposure and disease at issue. In order to diagnose the presence of a specific disease, the examiner must find subjective complaints that are consistent with the objective findings, and both the subjective complaints and objective findings must be consistent with the disease that is postulated. Exposure to a specific potentially causative agent at a defined concentration level must be documented and must be sufficient to induce a particular pathology in order to establish a diagnosis. Differential diagnoses must be entertained in order to rule out other potential causes, including psychological etiology. Furthermore, the identified exposure at the defined concentration level must be capable of causing the diagnosis being postulated before the examiner can conclude that there has been a cause-and-effect relationship between the exposure and the disease (dose-response relationship). The evaluator's opinion should make biological and epidemiological sense. The treatment plan and prognosis should be consistent with evidence-based medicine, and the rating of impairment must be based on objective findings in involved systems.",

From the hysterical state that is a total alteration of personality to the case in which hysterical manifestations appear as a sort of foreign body in the personality is a wide gap, which extends from an innate or constitutional disorder to an easily curable condition. The group of cases here presented have a physiology or, at any rate, a physiologic psychology which, once understood, opens the doors to a rapid cure. But unless their mechanism of disability is understood the patients may be markedly incapacitated and wander from physician to physician vainly seeking help. In other words, a superficial pathologic condition blocks the normal conduct reactions of the individual as thoroughly as the deeper lying disorder in those cases in which hysteria is really a psychosis demoralizes the individual.",

Symptoms may not be reported in conjunction by the patient and may not be coded as ‘syndrome’. Depending on the setting of the consultation, the cultural background of the participants, and organizational characteristics of the healthcare agency, the formulation for the presented problem may vary. ‘Medically unexplained symptoms’, ‘somatization’, or ‘depression’ may be the diagnostic vignettes for a heterogeneous set of symptoms with affective, visceral, somatic, and cognitive components. Fibromyalgia is one of them. In the context of fibromyalgia, this chapter highlights the interactive ‘looping effect’ of the term. This includes feedforward characteristics (what is the effect of labelling a person with the diagnosis of fibromyalgia?) and feedback functions (how does the concept ‘fibromyalgia’ change in response to being used in clinical contexts?).",

A escolha deste tema justifica-se pelos prejuizos causados pelas alteracoes posturais, tanto no ponto de vista fisiologico quanto mecânico, podendo gerar quadros de tensao, dor, retracoes muscular e alteracoes respiratorias. Nao foi encontrada na literatura nenhuma pesquisa que analise e trate a postura corporal de portadores desta patologia. A esquizofrenia e um transtorno de afeto inadequado ou embotado, caracterizado por distorcoes do pensamento e da percepcao. Normalmente a capacidade intelectual esta mantida e a consciencia e clara, podendo futuramente surgir deficits cognitivos. O portador desta patologia possui perturbacoes que envolvem funcoes basicas que dao a uma pessoa normal senso de individualidade, unicidade e de direcao de si mesmo, apresentando alucinacoes, usualmente auditivas, e outras formas de distorcao que afetam seu comportamento e seus pensamentos. Participarao deste estudo 20 pacientes portadores de Esquizofrenia CID F20, inscritos nos Projetos Terapeuticos do CAPS III Guarulhos. Serao incluidos pacientes de ambos os sexos com idade entre 18 e 59 anos. Serao excluidos deste estudo pacientes com outros tipos de transtornos mentais, pacientes que estejam em qualquer tipo de crises identificadas pelos profissionais do CAPS III. Apos a aprovacao do Comite de Etica em Pesquisa da Universidade Guarulhos, o pesquisador responsavel acompanhado de duas testemunhas, funcionarios do CAPS III Guarulhos que aceitarem esta tarefa fara um sorteio dos possiveis sujeitos da pesquisa, caso algum destes pacientes nao aceite a participacao novos sorteios poderao ser realizados ate que seja atingido o numero pretendido. Apos leitura e devidas explicacoes sobre a pesquisa os pacientes, agora denominados sujeitos da pesquisa em uma sala reservada do CAPS III Guarulhos assinarao o Termo de Consentimento Livre e Esclarecido. Os sujeitos da pesquisa individualmente em uma sala reservada do CAPS III passarao por uma Avaliacao Postural, a fim de detectar-se o padrao postural. Apos esta avaliacao este grupo sera subdividido em quatro subgrupos de cinco sujeitos cada grupo (para melhor adequacao dos horarios as atividades por eles ja desenvolvidas) que participarao de duas sessoes semanais com duracao de trinta minutos cada, durante vinte e cinco sessoes, aproximadamente tres meses, onde realizarao exercicios terapeuticos (cinesioterapia) para correcao das alteracoes posturais. As formacoes destes subgrupos poderao acontecer aleatoriamente ou por homogeneidade das alteracoes observadas. Caso os sujeitos da pesquisa se recusem a realizar os exercicios em grupo, estes poderao ser submetidos a sessoes individuais. Todos os sujeitos da pesquisa serao submetidos aos mesmos exercicios, que poderao variar de sessao para sessao de acordo com a necessidade e evolucao. Ao termino das vinte e cinco sessoes os sujeitos da pesquisa serao novamente submetidos a Avaliacao Postural para verificarmos se houve alteracao no seu padrao postural.",

      "abstract": "A atividade sexual satisfatória é um dos pilares da qualidade de vida, envolvendo das preliminares ao intercurso sexual, mecanismos neurológicos, vasculares, endocrinológicos, musculoesqueléticos, psicossociais, culturais, além do parceiro sexual e fatores individuais (autoestima, imagem corporal e habilidade pessoal). A disfunção sexual consiste na incapacidade para participar do ato sexual com satisfação, comprometendo desejo e/ou excitação e/ou orgasmo. Pode também se apresentar como dor que antecede, ocorre durante ou após o ato. Os numerosos fatores de risco para a disfunção sexual explicam sua alta prevalência nas diferentes fases da vida, podendo apresentar etiologia orgânica, psicossocial e/ou sociodemográfica. Entre estes últimos citam-se idade avançada, renda familiar baixa e educação precária. Quanto aos fatores orgânicos, encontram-se: deficiência hormonal, hipertensão arterial, diabetes, cardiopatias, neuropatias, alcoolismo, tabagismo, uso de drogas ilícitas, bem como uso de alguns medicamentos. Depressão e ansiedade respondem pelas causas psiquiátricas mais comuns de disfunção sexual. A prevalência é alta em homens, especialmente nos casos de disfunção erétil (DE) e de ejaculação precoce (EP). O mesmo se observa nas mulheres, quanto à diminuição do desejo, falta de lubrificação vaginal, transtornos do orgasmo e dor ao intercurso sexual. Por comprometer a satisfação sexual e a satisfação com a vida, a disfunção sexual resulta em menor qualidade de vida, baixa autoestima, depressão, ansiedade e prejuízo na relação interpessoal e dos parceiros. Doenças crônicas podem conduzir ao desinteresse sexual e à falta dessa atividade, por baixa autoestima e preocupação quanto à imagem corporal, por exemplo. A depressão também reduz a libido, deteriorando a qualidade do relacionamento sexual. Os pacientes, ansiosos sobre sua habilidade em satisfazer o parceiro, com o tempo desenvolvem ansiedade antecipatória e, pelo receio de falhar, acabam evitando o intercurso. Fadiga e estresse também acompanham as doenças crônicas, podendo contribuir para a disfunção sexual.",

All directly relate to the risk and expressions of depression and the bipolar spectrum. Related structural factors include housing quality; environmental hazards; quality of food, healthcare, and public education; and availability of highly lethal means of self-harm. It influences the prevalence of depression phenotypes: melancholic, anxious, primarily somatic, or highly externalized “masculine depression.” External stigma of depression is universal, but its details are culture-dependent. The acceptability and feasibility of specific treatments vary by culture. Before prescribing against a patient’s culturally based biases, a clinician should consider not only medication and psychotherapy but also lifestyle or environmental changes; complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine; antidepressant smartphone apps; light therapy; and non-invasive brain stimulation. Depression biomarkers soon may have a role in selection of treatments that are both culturally compatible and likely to work.",

      "abstract": "Cancer has been defined by the World Health Organization as “a disease caused by abnormal cells growing uncontrollably in the body, going beyond their usual boundaries, invading adjoining parts of the body and spreading to other organs”. Being diagnosed with cancer has been described as an experience with diverse emotional reactions and difficulties in adaptation, having psychological consequences, being most common depression, anxiety and psychological distress; but also, some patients present positive consequences after having a cancer diagnosis, such as post traumatic growth, which includes positive changes presented after the disease experience. Subjective appraisal about cancer has been defined as a mediating variable for the emotional response presented after a stressor, such as cancer diagnosis, treatment, or important changes during disease process (initiating and finalizing treatment, presenting relapse or remission, as well as when having control studies). The subjective appraisal can be presented with different thought content and styles. Thought style is referred as the way thoughts about the stressor are presented, it has been classified as rumination (thoughts that are intrusive and repetitive that also increase psychological distress), cognitive engagement (thoughts associated with problem solving and meaning finding) or avoidance (aiming to stop thinking about stressor or feeling associated with it). Depending on the thought style presented at a stressor, could be the emotional response (anxiety, depression, distress, post-traumatic growth). The aim of the present study was to describe the thoughts (style, content, valence and temporality) related to cancer diagnosis in a group of ten oncologic patients. To identify if differences between thought style, valence and temporality were presented. The study design is qualitative from a phenomenological point of view. Ten oncologic (different cancer type, clinical stage and treatment) patients were asked to write the five more frequent thoughts since their cancer diagnosis. Each thought was classified by: thought style, valence, and temporality (top-down, classifying the thoughts according to theory). The same thoughts were also classified in semantic units (bottom-up, classifying the thoughts according to their own contents), generating concerns from the content. Cross tabs were made to identify contents and temporality for thought style and valence, which were analyzed by chi square to identify differences between thought style, temporality and valence. The most common thought style was cognitive engagement, followed by rumination (almost same frequency). On what respects to thought style and temporality, rumination was more focused on past (causes and attributions of cancer) and future (uncertainty about death and treatment effectiveness); meanwhile, cognitive engagement was focused on present (to enjoy present moment and focus on daily actions). Chi square was made to identify if this difference was significant, showing temporality was significantly different in cognitive engagement and rumination. The concerns identified in study participants were uncertainty about future and disease, family (communication and wellness of the family), finances (due to expensive treatments), causes and guilt about having cancer. Thoughts that were more centered in present, were more likely to be associated with cognitive engagement. Cognitive engagement has been described previously as an important variable associated with post traumatic growth. Thoughts centered in the past and present were more associated with rumination. Rumination has been associated with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Because of mediating role of thought style in disease adaptation, emotional response to the disease, and the relation of this adaptation with the perception of quality of life in cancer patients, the design of psychological interventions aiming on promoting cognitive engagement by problem solving skills, meaning finding, and focusing on present could be a research line derived from present studies results. https://doi.org/10.16888/interd.2022.39.1.9",

      "abstract": "In Myofascial pain is a type of chronic soft tissue pain that is localized in muscles, fasciae and/or surrounding tissues and is characterized by the presence of muscle trigger points, the palpation of which causes localized or referred pain. One of the myofascial pain syndromes is the Serratus Anterior Muscle Pain Syndrome. The condition manifests itself as deep, dull, diffuse pain between the 5th and 7th ribs along the midaxillary line that radiates to the front of the chest wall, shoulder, shoulder blade and, less frequently, to the 4th and 5th fingers of the upper limb. It most often occurs in people who work hard physically and in athletes, and is favored by injuries, overstrain and muscle cooling, mental stress, fatigue, and lack of sleep. A medical history, characteristic clinical picture, physical examination with palpation assessment of muscles, and the exclusion of other disease entities with similar symptoms, such as radiculopathies, fibromyalgia, rheumatic polymyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, polymyositis, are key in the diagnosis of the Serratus Anterior Muscle Pain Syndrome. It is recommended to combine conservative methods (pharmacotherapy, physiotherapy, psychotherapy) and interventional methods such as needling, blockades, botulinum toxin injection and pulsed radiofrequency in the management. This article describes a patient with Serratus Anterior Muscle Pain Syndrome refractory to conservative management, in which the pulsed radiofrequency of the affected muscle gave significant and long-lasting pain relief without significant side effects. In the opinion of the authors and based on the available publications, pulsed radiofrequency can be considered in the therapeutic management of patients with myofascial pain.",

      "title": "Gambling Disorder",
      "abstract": "Gambling disorder is characterized by a persistent and recurrent maladaptive pattern of gambling behavior, preoccupation with gambling activities, loss of control, and continued gambling despite problems in social or occupational functioning (Box 62- ). It is associated with significant financial losses, legal problems, and disrupted interpersonal and familial relationships. Individuals with gambling disorder are also at increased risk for suicide attempts (Phillips et al. 1997), new-onset comorbid psychiatric disorders (Kessler et al. 2008), and several medical conditions (Morasco et al. 2006). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Gambling Disorder 312.31 F63.0 Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more) of the following in a 12-month period: Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble). Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed). After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (\"chasing\" one's losses). Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic episode . Specify if: Episodic: Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months. Persistent: Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for multiple years. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months. In sustained remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of 12 months or longer. Specify current severity: Mild: 4–5 criteria met. Moderate: 6–7 criteria met. Severe: 8–9 criteria met. Despite its serious consequences (Kessler et al. 2008; Petry et al. 2005), gambling disorder is rarely diagnosed and even more rarely treated (Slutske 2006). Less than 10% of individuals with gambling disorder ever seek treatment (Slutske 2006), probably because of a combination of ambivalence about seeking treatment on the part of the patients and limited access for those who wish to seek it. Although some data suggest that many individuals with gambling disorder recover without formal treatment (Hodgins and el-Guebaly 2000; Slutske et al. 2003), there is no available information on the time to remission in natural recovery or the risk of recurrence. Fortunately, despite our limited knowledge about the epidemiology and etiology of gambling disorders, a growing body of literature has examined pharmacological and psychological treatments for gambling disorder.",

      "abstract": "Many studies of social anxiety disorder (SAD) have been conducted because diagnostic criteria are defined as social phobia in DSM-III in the West. In Japan, several studies have examined pathological conditions similar to SAD, known as taijin-kyofu (TK). This highly remarkable disorder involves a convincing fear of giving another person discomfort from one's physical faults (e.g. feeling that neighboring people detect an unpleasant smell from one's body, \"jikoshu-kyofu\", or feeling that neighboring people feel unpleasant because of one's appearance,\"shukei-kyofu\") termed \"convinced subtype of TK\" (c-TK; also known as offensive subtype of TK). In DSM-5, the definitions of feeling rejection and offense of others are added to a fear of humiliating or embarrassing oneself. Moreover, TK is a sufficient criterion for SAD. However, it is confusing that body dysmorphic disorder is not in category of somatoform disorders but in that of obsessive-compulsive disorder and related disorders and that the Japanese terms of \"jikoshu-kyofu\" and \"shubo-kyofu\" are categorized as other specified obsessive-compulsive disorder and related disorders. The efficacy and tolerability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for the treatment of SAD has been reported in many controlled studies. Recently, SSRIs are regarded as first line pharmacotherapy for SAD. Cognitive behavioral therapy is also effective for SAD treatment. High rates of co-occurring SAD and other psychiatric disorders can be found in clinical samples and in the general population. Additional research must be conducted for these patients and for the management of treatment-refractory SAD patients.",

Such negative thoughts can be recognized by probing into the patient’s mental attitude. Similar is the adverse effect when the patient feels a lack of genuine love and understanding in one’s social circle. Not recognising the presence of negativity in a patient’s psycho-spiritual history can lead to inappropriate or ineffective treatment.

      "title": "Being psychotic is not necessarily being ill: Psychotic continuum and the relevance of lacanian psychoanalytic approach",
      "abstract": "Introduction The notion of subclinical psychosis is as old as Eugen Bleuler’s work on schizophrenia. It is also consistent with psychodynamic theories (see PDM-2) on the organization of personality on different levels including, among others, a psychotic level of personality organization. Research on the continuum of psychosis has offered substantial support to the view that psychotic phenotypes are significantly more prevalent than clinical psychosis. Objectives This may imply that being “psychotic” is not necessarily being ill. This assumption raises important theoretical and clinical questions: what causes psychosis to manifest itself clinically and, conversely, what possibly prevents it from doing so? Methods At the same time, it potentially frees psychiatry from certain diagnostic and therapeutic impasses. It allows for a shift of emphasis from misguiding classifications and often frustrating “evidence-based” therapeutic attempts to a more personalized approach. Results Diagnosis may thus rely on psychoanalytical “markers” or “indicators” regarding the subject (e.g. deficits in the symbolic register, dysregulated rapport with one’s body, problematic inscription in social relations etc.) at least as much as on symptomic phenomenology. Therapy may also take advantage of and deploy the unique coping strategies employed by the psychotic individual. Conclusions The diagnostic and therapeutic insights offered by Lacanian psychoanalysis create the possibility of a fruitful theoretical, diagnostic and therapeutic approach for clinical and subclinical psychotic conditions; indicate that psychoanalysis is indispensable for clinical psychiatry; and signal the possibility of a time-honored alternative to the in-vogue neurocognitive paradigm of “personalized” psychiatry.

This disorder, known as autotopagnosia, is often accompanied by other cognitive deficits, such as a general difficulty in naming things, known as an anomia, or a difficulty understanding any words that refer to concrete as opposed to abstract concepts. If autotopagnosia is accompanied by these kinds of problem, then it is possible to argue that it is caused by a general difficulty with word names or an inability to understand the meaning of concrete words. There are cases, however, in which patients can name body parts on their own bodies when these parts are pointed to by the examiner, although they cannot point to their own body parts on command or point to their own body part that corresponds to a numbered part on a picture of a body. These autotopagnosias cannot be caused by verbal deficits, but some patients with this pattern of disorder also have difficulty pointing, on verbal command, to parts of inanimate objects. As such patients are also unable to relate a well-known story in logical sequence, it has been argued that autotopagnosia is caused by a general inability to analyse a whole into its component parts.",

Misregulation occurs because of false assumptions or misdirected efforts, especially an unwarranted emphasis on emotion. The evidence supports a strength (limited resource) model of self-regulation and suggests that people often acquiesce in losing control. Loss of control of attention, failure of transcendence, and various lapse-activated causes all contribute to regulatory failure.",

      "title": "Poststroke spasticity",
      "abstract": "People who have strokes are subject to numerous potentially devastating sequelae, most often sensorimotor paresis, impairment of cognition and language, and other functional disabilities, including depression and dementia. Of these sequelae, spasticity occurring with motor dysfunction is a frequent finding that has to be evaluated in light of other diagnoses, such as central paresis, ataxia, pathologic stance or gait, and other coordination dysfunctions. Often, spasticity is not notably present in acute ischemic strokes but develops later on, and may then become a major obstacle for achieving independence in performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). Spasticity appearing after a stroke demonstrates quite convincingly that stroke is not a stable condition, but must be viewed instead as a dynamic condition that over time can precipitate additional impairments that were not necessarily noted or present in the acute phase. Poststroke spasticity (PSS) can indeed appear immediately after the ictus, but is most often seen later in the course of the illness. It then becomes a marker of changing or increasing sensorimotor malfunction and therefore requires repeated neurologic assessments. PSS can occur coupled with pain, be noted with decreased dexterity or positioning, or simply be associated with a gradual increase in sensorimotor paresis. When occurring late, PSS can induce changes in the entire health perception of the patient and caregiver.

      "abstract": "Deficits in emotional clarity, or difficulties identifying which emotions one feels, are increasingly associated with multiple forms of psychopathology. We addressed two fundamental, unresolved issues regarding the transdiagnostic nature of this dysfunction. First, we examined the relationship of deficits in emotional clarity to seven symptom types, accounting for possible confounding effects of overlapping symptoms. We found that deficits in emotional clarity were associated with symptoms of depression, social anxiety, borderline personality, binge eating, and alcohol use, but not anxious arousal or restrictive eating. Second, we tested whether deficits in emotional clarity would relate to psychopathology by way of impaired emotion regulation. Notably, the relationship between deficits in emotional clarity and each symptom type was mediated by a distinct, disorderspecific pattern of emotion regulation deficits. Findings suggest that deficits in emotional clarity can be conceptualized as a transdiagnostic process with diverging mechanisms involving emotion regulation difficulties that vary from disorder to disorder. We discuss these findings within a contextual approach to delineating transdiagnostic processes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizoaffective disorder was first described in the literature by Kasanin in 1933, referring to a group of patients in whom both psychotic (“schizo”) and mood (“affective”) symptoms are prominent features. A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is an extremely disabling symptom both in healthy people and in various diseases. Physical fatigue is characterized by limitations in physical functioning, while mental/cognitive fatigue involves difficulties in concentrating and performing cognitive tasks. Mental and physical fatigue exist in both pathological and physiological fatigue. Fatigue is primarily an adaptive physiological process. It is a signal to have a rest and helps conserve energy to prevent injury, which can be useful after intense work, or when the body’s defenses need to be redistributed, for example, during infectious disease. It is important to distinguish between fatigue or tiredness and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice. Chronic fatigue syndrome has multisystem manifestations and affects millions of people globally. Although the exact aetiology of chronic fatigue syndrome is uncertain, the studies point to neurological, immunological, autonomic and energy disorders. The main sings of chronic fatigue syndrome are debilitating fatigue that is worsened by activity, poor exercise tolerance, unrefreshing sleep and cognitive impairment. Reduced information processing speed is the most common cognitive impairment in chronic fatigue syndrome. Other manifestations include decreased reaction time, working memory, and attention. These symptoms must persist for at least 3–6 months for a diagnosis to be made. As there are no specific tests for chronic fatigue syndrome, a diagnosis can be established on the basis of a medical history and physical examination. Although there are no standards-based methods specific to chronic fatigue syndrome, clinicians can reduce the severity of symptoms using pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment approaches that have proved their efficacy in clinical practice. In particular, nootropics are widely used in asthenic conditions and chronic fatigue syndrome. Fonturacetam is a nootropic drug that directly activates brain integration activities, promotes memory consolidation, and improves concentration and mental activity.",

The chapter differs from others in the AMA Guides insofar as it does not provide percentages for estimates of mental impairment because such usage suggests a certainty that does not exist. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, is a widely accepted classification system for mental disorders, but it omits context. Few clinically standardized tests can identify functional or structural effects, and neuropsychological testing is not the standard for documenting subtle impairment. How individuals manage their illness and cope with life demands are better measures of impairment than diagnostic labels or numbers and kinds of symptoms. Further, assessment requires an evaluation of the context in which the illness unfolds, including premorbid function and previous response to treatment; details about the individual's life course; review of developmental and functional deficits; character style and comorbidities such as anxiety and substance abuse; severity of precipitants, current stage of the episode, and current effectiveness of treatment; and external supports that can moderate impairment. A table lists areas of functional impairment, symptoms to consider, and patient history relevant to symptoms.",

They emphasize the mechanisms that regulate or inhibit human renal, metabolic, reproductive, and other functions. Often their discussions are complex. For example, Livingston tells about neural integration and how pain disturbs vascular and other reflexes.

      "title": "RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SLEEP QUALITY, BODY PERCEPTION AND MOTOR AND SENSORY SYMPTOMS IN PEOPLE WITH RELAPSING-REMITTING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS",
      "abstract": "Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is an autoimmune neurological disease, where the immune system attacks the myelin sheath of the central nervous system, causing inflammation that impairs the transmission of nerve impulses. It is characterized by episodes of flare-ups with exacerbation of symptoms, such as fatigue, weakness in the lower and upper limbs, tremors and balance, difficulty walking, loss of vision, among others, followed by remissions with partial or complete recovery, which can last for months or years, during which the progression of the disease is minimal or absent. Insomnia or poor sleep quality can occur indirectly as a consequence of RRMS. That is, a secondary symptom that is caused by the presence of the specific symptoms of the disease and pseudo-outbreaks. Body Perception (PC) can be defined in two ways, such as Body Image (CI) and Body Schema (CE). HF is related to the psychic, emotional, cognitive, sociocultural, evolutionary, genetic and neuroscientific aspects, in relation to the expectation of the image of their body. The CS is the perspective that enables, through kinesthetic and proprioceptive mechanisms, the recognition of the anatomical body and the relationship it establishes with the environment and with the objects around it. In view of these definitions, the opportunity arose to relate sleep quality with body perception and symptomatological conditions. Thus, the objective of the study was to analyze the relationship between sleep quality and body perception, by the aspect of body schema and the symptomatological conditions of multiple sclerosis. Participants were 18 people, aged between 21 and 67 years, who were evaluated for sleep quality using the Pittsburgh questionnaire, body perception using the Askevold test, and symptoms through a structured interview. The results indicated that all participants with adequate sleep were classified as hyperschematic, while 67% of those who had inadequate sleep were classified as hyposchematic. In addition, individuals with inadequate sleep showed a balanced distribution between motor and sensory symptoms, while those with adequate sleep predominantly reported sensory symptoms. Fatigue was a relevant symptom in 67% of individuals with inadequate sleep. These findings suggest that sleep quality may be associated with body perception and symptom manifestation in RRMS, highlighting the importance of sleep-enhancing interventions for the management of this condition.",

      "title": "Effect of optimism/pessimism attitude on depression and coping strategies",
      "abstract": "Depression is a word used by mental health professional to refer an illness or group of illness called mood disorder. Depression may be described as feeling sad, blue, unhappy, miserable, or down in the dumps. Most of us feel this way at one time or another for short periods. It's impossible to escape life's ups and downs. Feeling unhappy or sad in response to disappointment, loss, frustration or a medical condition is normal. Many people use the word to explain these kinds of feelings, but that is really situational depression, which is a normal reaction to events around us. Clinical depression, though, overwhelms and engulfs your day to day life, interfering with your ability to work, study, eat, sleep, and have fun. It is unrelenting, with little if any relief. True clinical depression is a mood disorder in which feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration interfere with everyday life for an extended period of it.There is a difference, however, between a normal grief reaction and one that is disabling or unrelenting. While there's no set timetable for grieving, if it doesn't let up over time or extinguishes all signs of joy laughing at a good joke, brightening in response to a hug, appreciating a beautiful sunsetit may be depression. Brown and Haris (1978) reported that depression increases with the age due to several factors of day today life like burden of responsibility, sleeping problems, declining health etc.Coping strategies refer to the specific efforts, both behavioral and psychological, that people employ to master, tolerate, reduce, or minimize stressful events.There are many different ways of coping but they all involve making some change in input-output relationships. Thus some methods of coping involve changing, controlling and even avoiding certain inputs, whether the problem is attacked by working on inputs that in internal processes or outputs, it will be one of the two major ways of adjustingdefensive coping or direct coping. Defensive coping involves protecting oneself by getting away from threatening inputs. Direct coping involves meeting challenges head on. Coping with stress may begin with the occurrence of a stressful even, during exposure to stressor and finally after it has taken places. However, successful coping with stress should depend on a number of factors such as individual attitude, perception of life stress and suffering and personal skills, capability of problem solving and decision making. Raju, Rohini, and Naga (2008) revealed that among the old age people 21.3% of them were severely depressed and diabetes is experienced mostly by the elderly whose age is between 70-80 years. The severely depressed older adults were suffering with blood pressure and asthma. The mildly depressed older adult's experiences suicidal tendencies, hearing problems, loneliness, diabetes and problem with the eyes.Sahu, (2007) found gender differences on life stress and significant negative relationship between life stress and coping was observed. It was also extended for males but this relationship was not found significant for females. Folkman, S. and Lazarus, R.S (1980) evaluated age difference in the use of problem focused coping and emotion focused coping among individuals aged 45 to 64. The younger group was found to use emotion focused approach more i.e. they used more of accepting responsibility, distancing more than o lder group.Considering the above facts the present study was undertaken to observe the Optimists and Pessimists on Depression and Coping strategies.Hypotheses of the studyTo achieve the main objective of the study following hypothesis are framed;* Optimists will have significantly low level of Depression as compared to Pessimists and its dimensions.* Optimists and pessimists will differ significantly on the tendency of using Coping Strategies and its dimensions.MethodParticipantsThe total sample was consisted of 255 optimists and 191 pessimists subjects. …",

      "abstract": "Abstract Psychopathy is also known as psychopathic, antisocial, dissocial , and sociopathic personality disorder . It is a specific form of personality disorder that comprises a broad range of symptoms. The general course is characterized by onset in childhood and persistence into late adulthood. It can be diagnosed according to criteria in standard nosologies, although specialized psychometric procedures are often preferred by forensic mental health professionals. Using broad diagnostic criteria, estimates of lifetime prevalence in the United States were found to range from ∼1.5 to 3.5% in the general population and 50–75% in forensic populations; estimates based on more stringent diagnostic criteria are about one‐third of these rates. Psychopathy appears to be more prevalent in males, in younger generations, and in individualistic cultures; this may be due to symptom expression being facilitated by norms that promote strong individualism or, alternatively, to bias in the existing diagnostic criteria. Psychopathy is frequently comorbid with substance use disorders and some other personality disorders. The etiology of psychopathy is unknown. No reliably effective treatment for psychopathy has been identified. Psychopathy is associated with serious crime, including violence, and is often considered in psycholegal evaluations related to risk assessment.",

DMDD is a condition with an early age of onset (i.e., symptoms apparent by age 10, although the diagnosis cannot be made before age 6); however, nothing is known about the condition among adults in part because questions about temper outbursts (versus \"often losing temper\") are not consistently asked after 6 years of age. Other qualifiers are present so that better-known conditions are not overlooked. For instance, manic symptoms that are present for more than 1 day, symptoms that are not exclusively occurring during major depressive disorder, or symptoms that are better explained by autism, posttraumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety, and dysthymia are exclusionary. Although DMDD can co-occur with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, and substance use disorder, it preempts diagnoses of both oppositional defiant disorder and intermittent explosive disorder.",

      "title": "From fibrositis to fibromyalgia to nociplastic pain: how rheumatology helped get us here and where do we go from here?",
      "abstract": "Rheumatologists and rheumatology have had a prominent role in the conceptualisation of nociplastic pain since the prototypical nociplastic pain condition is fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia had been previously known as fibrositis, until it became clear that this condition could be differentiatied from autoimmune disorders because of a lack of systemic inflammation and tissue damage. Nociplastic pain is now thought to be a third descriptor/mechanism of pain, in addition to nociceptive pain (pain due to peripheral damage or inflammation) and neuropathic pain. Nociplastic pain can occur in isolation, or as a co-morbidity with other mechanisms of pain, as commonly occurs in individuals with autoimmune disorders. We now know that the cardinal symptoms of nociplastic pain are widespread pain (or pain in areas not without evidence of inflammation/damage), accompanied by fatigue, sleep and memory issues. There is objective evidence of amplification/augmentation of pain, as well as of non-painful stimuli such as the brightness of lights and unpleasantness of sound or odors. Nociplastic pain states can be triggered by a variety of stressors such as trauma, infections and chronic stressors. Together these features suggest that the central nervous system (CNS) is playing a major role in causing and maintaining nociplastic pain, but these CNS factors may in some be driven by ongoing peripheral nociceptive input. The most effective drug therapies for nociplastic pain are non-opioid centrally acting analgesics such as tricyclics, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and gabapentinoids. However the mainstay of therapy of nociplastic pain is the use of a variety of non-pharmacological integrative therapies, especially those which improve activity/exercise, sleep and address psychological co-morbidities.",

      "abstract": "Abstract My position statement on neglect is more of an agenda for further research than an attempt at explanation. I assume that neglect, caused, for example, by right parietal damage, results neither form simple sensory loss and nor from motor impairment. It also appears not to be a unitary disorder. Failures to orient towards salient stimuli, often labelled as “neglect”, can occur because of damage to other brain regions besides the parietal lobe, and in animals other than man. But failures to orient toward stimuli can result from several different types of difficulty. most crudely to organise a response towards the contralesional side (“output” or “intentional” neglect (Valenstein & Heilman, 1981) or from problems of detecting stimuli in contralesional space (“input” neglect). Sometimes these forms of neglect apparently occur together in the same individual, raising questions about the foci and extent of their brain lesions.",

The harms of an explosion would bring about a series of physiological, psychological, and behavioral changes to the different kinds of people that experienced the explosion, impacting their psychological health in different aspects. These impacts might exist only in the short term but could sustain for the long term and lead to serious psychological issues, stress disorder or adaptation disorder, or even psychological disorder. Serious cases might even suicide or hurt others. Therefore, carrying out psychological intervention and therapy in an effective and prompt manner has significant importance.",

      "title": "Feeding and swallowing dysfunction in genetic syndromes",
      "abstract": "Abstract Children with genetic syndromes frequently have feeding problems and swallowing dysfunction as a result of the complex interactions between anatomical, medical, physiological, and behavioral factors. Feeding problems associated with genetic disorders may also cause feeding to be unpleasant, negative, or even painful because of choking, coughing, gagging, fatigue, or emesis, resulting in the child to stop eating and to develop behaviors that make it difficult, if not impossible, for a parent to feed their child. In addition, limited experiences with oral intake related to the medical or physical conditions, or other variables such as prematurity, often result in a failure of the child's oral motor skills to develop normally. For example, a child with Pierre Robin sequence may be unable to successfully feed orally, initially, due to micrognathia and glossoptosis. Oral‐motor dysfunction may develop as a result of both anatomical problems, (e.g., cleft lip/palate), lack of experience (e.g., s/p. surgery), or oral motor abnormalities (e.g., brain malformation). Neuromotor coordination impairments such as those associated with Down syndrome (e.g., hypotonia, poor tongue control, and open mouth posture) frequently interfere with the acquisition of effective oral‐motor skills and lead to feeding difficulties. Management of these phenomena is frequently possible, if an appropriate feeding plan exist that allows for three primary factors: (1) feeding program must be safe, (2) feeding program must support optimal growth, and (3) feeding program must be realistic. Researchers have demonstrated the utility of behavioral approaches in the treatment of feeding disorders, such as manipulations in the presentation of foods and drink and consequences for food refusal and acceptance (e.g., praise, extinction, contingent access to preferred foods). However, because a child's failure to eat is not frequently the result of a single cause, evaluation and treatment are typically conducted by an interdisciplinary team usually consisting of a behavioral psychologist, pediatric gastroenterologist, speech pathologist, nutrition, and sometimes other disciplines. This chapter provides an overview of some of the feeding difficulties experience by some of the more common genetic disorders including identification, interventions, and management. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

Psychosis is a gross impairment of reality testing, often manifest by hallucinations or delusions. Psychotic symptoms can be an inherent aspect of an illness or a secondary complicating factor. Earlier-onset/primary psychotic disorders, schizophrenia and related disorders, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, often extend into old age. Severe functional disability affects the surrounding environment and worsens caregiver stress, leading to reduced productivity beyond that of the patient. The aging brain shows a disproportion in the synthesis, discharge, and inactivation of noradrenergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic neurons, loss of resilience, and loss of cognitive reserve, all increasing the risk for psychosis developing as a complication of an underlying pathology.",

Aggressive behaviour, however, can also be associated with mental disorders and this is the topic discussed by the present article. Isolated and occasional outbursts of anger, aggressiveness and rage in children and adolescents can often be confused with conduct disorder. However, conduct disorder is characterised by a stable aggressive behavioural pattern, recurrently violating either the basic rights of the others or of the generally accepted social norms. Aggressive behaviour can also be present in Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), Attention Deficit Hyperkinetic Disorder (ADHD), affective and psychotic disorders, autistic spectrum disorders and in some other developmental neurological disorders including intellectual disability ‒ but only as a possible and not a typical symptom. Child and adolescent psychiatrist can mainly help with aggressive behaviour associated with mental disorders. In all other possible causes of aggressive behaviour, child and adolescent psychiatry has neither the possibility/capacity nor the authority to intervene.",

      "title": "Post traumatic stress disorder in postpartum: when guilt delays recovery. A case report",
      "abstract": "Introduction PTSD is a mental disorder that may develop after exposure to threatening or horrifying events. PTSD is characterized by the following: 1) re-experiencing the traumatic event or events in the present in the form of vivid intrusive memories, flashbacks, or nightmares. Re-experiencing may occur via one or multiple sensory modalities and is typically accompanied by strong or overwhelming emotions, particularly fear or horror, and strong physical sensations; 2) avoidance of thoughts and memories of the event or events, activities, situations, or people reminiscent of the event(s); and 3) persistent perceptions of heightened current threat. The symptoms persist for at least several weeks and cause significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Some reviewes found that PTSD is prevalent during pregnancy and after birth and may increase during postpartum if not identified and treated. It can affect women, their relationship and birth outcomes aswell as infant emotion regulation and development. The findings indicate that there are links between psychological, traumatic and birth-related risk factors as well as the perceived social support and the possible PTSD following childbirth in mothers and partners. Objectives A case report is presented alongside a review of the relevant literature regarding the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of PTSD. Methods We present a case report of a 34-year-old woman with no previous contact with Mental Health Services. She got pregnant unexpectedly in the context of a long stable relationship. At the beginning she was feeling uncertain about carrying on with the pregnancy but finally decided to keep it. She states she felt well throughout the pregnancy. The night after giving birth her baby suffered from a cardiorespiratory arrest, which was noticed by the nursing team but not by the mother. The baby recovered with no medical sequelae but the patient started feeling depressed and presenting anergy, apathy, irritability, flashbacks, and intrusive memories of her sick baby and insomnia, checking every hour during the night that her child was still breathing. Later she developed separation anxiety from her baby, not being able to leave her in the kindergartner nor to leave her alone with other family members (including the father). Guilty feelings were persistantly observed during the therapy sessions. Results Psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatment was started with moderate improvement. Since breastfeeding was a rewarding experience and enforced the mother-daughter bond it was taken in consideration for the therapeutic plan. Conclusions The postpartum period is of special vulnerability and early treatment of symptoms in mothers is of great importance. Early diagnosis in maternity services should be a priority.

The absence of the perceptual awareness may be the most important clinical characterization for diagnosis. Differential diagnosis includes coma, brain death, locked-in syndrome and minimally responsive state. The pressure of economical factors (managed care) on medical care makes this problem even more complicated.",

However, the suspected diagnosis is not always told to the electromyography practitioner, who must be able to recognize such a condition to avoid false positive diagnosis without dismissing the possibility to uncover any true dysfunction. There are many clinical manoeuvers to assess the consistency of the patients' reported weakness or sensory deficit. The electrodiagnostic practitioner should be aware of those clinical tricks and interpret the electrodiagnostic findings in the clinical context. There are many electrodiagnostic tests that the practitioner can use for the assessment of motor and sensory functions but these tests have also important drawbacks and limitations. Only after a good clinical evaluation would the practitioner be able to give his/her opinion on the clinical relevance of the electrodiagnostic findings. Here we review some of the tests that can help the practitioner to define the electrophysiological characteristics of a suspected functional disorder presenting with weakness or sensory deficit.",

Estas se definen como un grupo de padecimientos de origen en muchos casos desconocido y que tienen como atributo común el curso progresivo de los síntomas derivados del daño estructural y funcional de diferentes zonas del sistema nervioso. La Demencia o Trastorno Cognitivo, ocurre cuando el cerebro se afecta por una enfermedad o afección específica que causa deterioro cognitivo. La secuencia en el espectro de la demencia puede terminar en la forma más grave de la enfermedad. El deterioro cognitivo en muchos casos transita desde el leve, referido a una disminución de la función cognitiva mayor de lo esperado por la edad y al nivel de educación del individuo, pero sin interferir con sus actividades cotidianas. El diagnóstico temprano de la enfermedad y la asunción de tratamientos y sobre todo estilos de vida saludables, puede evitar o enlentecer el tránsito hacia la gravedad de la enfermedad y por ende mejorar la calidad de vida. Con el objetivo de contribuir a este propósito se diseñó una herramienta de software denominada Neuromap que permite obtener patrones de conectividad a partir de señales de EEG y realizar una prueba de profundidad de la demencia. De esta forma se enriquecen los instrumentos con que cuentan en la actualidad los especialistas de las ciencias médicas para obtener un mejor y más eficaz diagnóstico. La herramienta fue desarrollada en Matlab, utilizando herramientas de estudio del EEG.",

Un alto porcentaje de casos se asocia a un trastorno orgánico cerebral de base, especialmente demencias neurodegenerativas, pero también puede ocurrir en enfermedades psiquiátricas primarias, tales como esquizofrenia y trastornos esquizoafectivos o afectivos. La exploración neurobiológica plantea diferentes hipótesis explicativas del síndrome, entre ellas los modelos de desconexión visuoanatómico de Ellis y Young, de lateralización de Gainotti y de distribución de redes neuronales de Gobbini y Haxby. El falso reconocimiento puede dar lugar a conductas violentas del paciente contra las personas implicadas como supuestos “dobles”, especialmente en casos de pacientes varones, con enfermedad psiquiátrica de fondo (i.e., esquizofrenia paranoide), con antecedentes de consumo de sustancias psicoactivas o presencia concomitante de alucinaciones auditivas imperativas. No existe tratamiento específico para el Síndrome de Capgras, pero ciertamente el cuadro psiquiátrico subyacente debe ser manejado con fármacos antipsicóticos e incluso terapia electroconvulsiva.",

Su evolucion natural sin tratamiento puede derivar en serias repercusiones negativas en el funcionamiento academico, social y familiar de los ninos, interfiriendo de forma importante en el desarrollo. Su identificacion puede ser dificil pues, en ocasiones, son expresiones exageradas o temporalmente inadecuadas de lo que se consideran reacciones normales y adaptativas: el miedo y la ansiedad. Los TA incluyen trastornos de inicio especifico en la infancia y adolescencia (ej. el trastorno de separacion) y otros cuya expresion sindromica es semejante a los TA del adulto (ej. trastorno de panico). Las manifestaciones de los TA son polimorfas y desconcertantes en ocasiones (quejas fisicas variadas, rechazo a ir al colegio, comportamientos de apego excesivo a los padres o a los principales cuidadores, resistencia a ir a dormir, hiperactividad y oposicionismo, etc.). La consulta del pediatra es el lugar idoneo para establecer un diagnostico de presuncion y proceder a la indagacion y posterior confirmacion de aquel. El pediatra debe estar familiarizado con el diagnostico, las herramientas basicas de tratamiento y los procedimientos de derivacion a salud mental. Las principales modalidades de tratamiento en la practica clinica son la terapia cognitivo-comportamental (TCC), las intervenciones informativas para familiares y el tratamiento farmacologico. Aunque se han producido importantes avances en el desarrollo y aplicacion de tratamientos para los TA, aun existe un numero limitado de estudios que prueben la eficacia de los mismos.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Dyspepsia can be defined as the presence of upper abdominal pain or discomfort; other symptoms referable to the proximal gastrointestinal tract, such as nausea, early satiety, and bloating, may also be present. Symptoms may or may not be meal related. To be termed chronic, dyspepsia should have been present for three months or longer. Over half the patients who present with chronic dyspepsia have no evidence of peptic ulceration, other focal lesions, or systemic disease and are diagnosed as having non‐ulcer (or functional) dyspepsia. Non‐ulcer dyspepsia is a heterogeneous syndrome. It has been proposed that this entity can be subdivided into a number of symptomatic clusters or groupings that suggest possible underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. These groupings include ulcer‐like dyspepsia (typical symptoms of peptic ulcer are present), dysmotility (stasis)‐like dyspepsia (symptoms include nausea, early satiety, bloating, and belching that suggest gastric stasis or small intestinal dysmotility), and reflux‐like dyspepsia (heartburn or acid regurgitation accompanies upper abdominal pain or discomfort). The aetiology of non‐ulcer dyspepsia is not established, although it is likely a multifactorial disorder. Motility abnormalities may be important in a subset of dyspepsia patients but probably do not explain the symptoms in the majority. Epidemiological studies have not convincingly demonstrated an association between Helicobacter pylori and non‐ulcer dyspepsia. Other potential aetiological mechanisms, such as increased gastric acid secretion, psychological factors, life‐event stress, and dietary factors, have not been established as causes of non‐ulcer dyspepsia. Management of non‐ulcer dyspepsia is difficult because its pathogenesis is poorly understood and is confounded because of a high placebo response rate. Until more data are available, it seems reasonable that treatment regimens target the clinical groupings described above. Antacids are no more effective than placebo in non‐ulcer dyspepsia, although a subgroup of non‐ulcer dyspepsia patients with reflux‐like or ulcer‐like symptoms may respond to H 2 ‐receptor antagonists. However, there is no significant benefit of these agents over placebo in many cases. Bismuth has been shown to be superior to placebo in patients with H. pylori in a number of studies, but these trials had several shortcomings and others have reported conflicting findings. Sucralfate was demonstrated in one study to be superior to placebo, but this finding was not confirmed by another group of investigators. Prokinetic drugs appear to be efficacious, and may be most useful in patients with dysmotility‐like and reflux‐like dyspepsia.",

During mood swings, there may be features of psychosis (delusions and hallucinations) that are mood-congruent. Although psychotic symptoms are seen only in a minority of patients, they explain the early terminology of manic–depressive psychosis. Stage 1a is defined as mild or non-specific symptoms of mood disorder and intervened as formal mental health literacy; family psychoeducation; substance abuse reduction; cognitive behavioral therapy. Euphoric means the experience of pleasure or excitement and intense feelings of well-being and happiness. Certain natural rewards and social activities, such as aerobic exercise, laughter, listening to or making music, and dancing, can induce a state of euphoria. Racing thoughts are consistent, persistent, often intrusive thoughts that come in rapid succession. There is a direct link between depression and anxiety and racing thoughts. Whereas jumping from topic to topic as in the flight of ideas can be observed by others, ascertainment of racing thoughts requires asking the child whether his or her thoughts seem to be going too fast.",

      "abstract": "Examples have been presented of children's behaviors that demonstrate the trauma-learning pattern of re-enactment, repetition, and displacement. They become persistent parts of the symptom complex of PTSD. The encapsulation phase occurs when the trauma event occurs and symptoms present themselves, but the events as yet are undisclosed. The trauma-specific behavior patterns, the general hyper-arousal symptoms, and the avoidant, numbing symptoms persist; the emerging disruptive behaviors are not linked to the traumatic event and reactions to the trauma. The response of the child's social and interpersonal context to the internalizing or externalizing behaviors post-trauma, continue shaping the internal cognitive schema of the child. When the child is unable to link ongoing, self-defeating, disruptive behavior to trauma experience, the underlying fear persists. This interferes with the child's ability to modulate emotions either through altering the persistence of refractory, self-limiting cognitive schema or the inability to use new experience to develop and grow. The flexibility of children to discriminate new information may be lost; the children are either numb to new information or hyperalert and perceive danger. Issues for treatment include children's distress over memories of the trauma and the lack of capacity to learn and develop from new interpersonal experiences. It has been our experience that nurses first must help the child relearn flexibility through self-observation, the element of self-soothing and calming behaviors, processing of new information, and strengthening of social relationships. With new and strengthened personal resources, the child then is able to begin to process the traumatic memories.",

A third criterion has been used, including several minor symptoms [fatigue, sleep disorders, stiff ness …] and probable FMS has been defined by two criteria out of three. These different definitions suggest that FMS is more than one disorder and that other criteria are probably needed.Conclusions: Our definition of probable or “in complete” FMS is based on the presence of spontaneous, wide spread, persistent pain, fatigue, and peripheral symptoms such as stiffness, of ten modulated by weather changes, stress, and exercise.Our definition of mechanical allodynia is based on pressure induced tendino-muscular pain [tenderness] usually associated with central symptoms such as sleep disorders [TePs syndrome].Fibromyalgia might then be defined by the association of two distinct conditions: incomplete FMS [spontaneous, diffuse pain, and fatigue], and tenderness [mechanical allodynia], both having been aggravated by physical deconditioning.",

Such individuals suffer from chronic depression which may or may not be masked, but which permeates their character. Although the condition is among the commonest seen in many of our clinics and practices, it remains without a generally accepted diagnostic form. It is suggested that the essential, clinical, dynamic, and structural features of the depressive character are: (1) consistently low self-esteem and a sense of helplessness, dependent object relations and chronic guilt; (2) self-directed aggression and masochism are frequent but not invariable; (3) extensive use of the mechanism of denial is as common as the previously described obsessional defenses seen in patients subject to psychotic depression; (4) often the depressive character suffers from intense oral envy; (5) depressive character traits may help to ward off any of the basic anxieties, namely, object loss, loss of love, castration anxiety, and superego anxiety (guilt) (6) the depressive character may be similar to a number of related disorders, namely, the obsessional character, hysterical characters with a large oral component, and depressive borderline states; (7) sensitivity to loss, sadness, and fragility of self-esteem makes the depressive character especially vulnerable to regression into overt depression; (8) the persistence of oral incorporative mechanisms, ambivalent, dependent object relations, ego versus superego tension with depressive affect, and sensitivity to loss are characteristic of the ego of the depressive character.",

The concept generally refers to the nature of an experience, resulting from persons interacting in the context of their environment, either through physiological overarousal or underarousal, with an outcome of psychological or physiological distress (bad stress outcome) or eustress (good stress outcome). Stressors range from minor to major, and can be positive or negative events. Generally stressors are life events, such as daily annoyances, pressures at home or on the job, marital discord and conflicts, emergencies, motor vehicle accidents, illness, and injury. Positive stressful life events and transitions include birth of a newborn, graduation ceremony, a family vacation, or a job promotion (Kaplan &amp; Sadock, 1998).",

Central to this discussion is the concept of formal thought disorder. Poverty of speech, or alogia, can be seen in schizophrenia and depression. Catatonic syndromes are associated with echolalia, in which the speaker automatically reproduces words or phrases uttered by the interviewer. Patients with posttraumatic stress disorder are condemned to relive certain memories of the trauma. The most common and striking agnostic deficit is anosognosia, in which the patient steadfastly refuses to acknowledge that she or he has any illness despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. No particular sign or symptom is pathognomonic of a specific psychiatric disorder. Clinical assessment is, instead, designed to discover a gestalt consisting of multiple signs and symptoms that tend to cluster together, which is characteristic of a particular psychiatric disorder.",

Mental disorders were seen as the results of sins and as signs of guilt. The mental disorders are divided into three groups: psychoses, neuroses and personality disorders and psychosomatic disorders. Psychosomatic disorders occur to a similar percentage of the population as neurotic disorders: approximately 12%. Psychosomatic diseases are complex disorders, which contain a somatic and a psychic part.",

The Illness Attitude Scales have been used in a number of studies concerned with patients suffering from DSM-III-R hypochondriasis, panic disorder, melancholia, in the medically ill, in pregnant women, during medical procedures such as mammography, and in experiments in therapeutics, such as drug trials. The results of these studies and of clinical investigations suggest that the differential diagnosis between hypochondriacal beliefs (characterized by resistance to reassurance), disease phobia, thanatophobia, and the other less specific illness attitudes, is worthy of clinical attention and may entail prognostic and therapeutic implications. Pilowsky's concept of abnormal illness behavior, unlike the DSM-III-R, provides a framework for such differentiation.",

Some psychiatric disorders are associated with loss of insight, and those afficted by these illnesses may accept changes in their thinking, mood, and behavior as “normal” or “understandable” under the circumstances of their lives. It frequently falls to friends and family members to recognize that something is wrong and to encourage the person to seek help.

      "abstract": "Non-organic voice disorders are characterised by an impaired voice sound, and/or reduced vocal capacity, and/or laryngeal sensory disturbances, all in the absence of causal organic laryngeal pathology. Psychogenic causes, a \"psychological disequilibrium\", and an increased tension of the laryngeal muscles are presumed to be one end of the spectrum of possible factors leading to the development of the disorder. In making a diagnosis, perceptive and acoustic methods for voice analysis are used in addition to the ENT-examination and the laryngostroboscopy. An assessment of the degree to which the patient feels him/herself subjectively affected by the voice disorder also plays an important role. If the history reveals any indication of psychosocial stress or conflict, the patient is offered psychological consultations. These conflicts seem less often to be deep rooted psychopathological problems but rather daily anxieties, failures, injuries, annoyances, disappointments regarding the sufferer him/herself and others, the non-fulfillment of desires, feelings of inadequacy and of lack of self-confidence. The patients may find it difficult to speak about conflicts and feelings, and they follow social conventions to an excessive extent. In frustrating situations patients tend to react aggressively towards themselves rather than towards others and are too quick in seeking a solution to any problem that may arise. The role of the voice as a \"barometer of emotion\", where a disorder may be regarded as a sign of emotional stress, has to be taken into consideration before starting a therapy: If the non-organic voice disorder is obviously due to vocal misuse and muscle tension, a more symptom-orientated voice therapy may be favoured. If psychosocial stress seems to play a greater role, additional counseling may be necessary. Only by using this approach can the patient be offered a therapy which goes into the causes and thereby addresses the whole person.",

The boundaries of disorders like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in relationship to stress-related psychotic phenomena found in disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or borderline personality disorder (BPD) are often unclear. This chapter seeks to describe and understand these areas of overlap and ambiguity. Simple rules that allow accurate separation of symptoms into a single diagnosis do not exist. Diagnostic comorbidity and common underlying risk factors occur frequently. Psychotic symptoms need to be interpreted in the entire context of a patient’s presentation. The most important aspect consider about the role of psychotic symptoms in diagnostic formulation is the impact on the patient.",

Insomnia is commonly classified according to different criteria including the time of onset during the night (beginning, middle or end), its course of evolution (occasional, short term or chronic) and the severity of the complaint. The presence of associated signs is a decisive feature in characterising insomnia: it may be isolated or associated with other symptoms. Thus insomnia may evolve in its own right or be part of the framework of a somatic disorder (algic or dyspnoeic, for example) or psychiatric (anxiety disorder, mood disorder, psychose, state of confusion or dementia).",

Whereas the first dimension is closely related to symptoms, such as impulsivity, suicidal behaviours or inappropriate anger, the latter can be associated with dissociative experiences and chronic feeling of emptiness. Although both dimensions have been related to negative experiences during childhood, however, little is known about the specific developmental pathways leading to emotional instability or emotional awareness in borderline adolescents.

      "title": "[Apathy: a useful but limited concept].",
      "abstract": "In the nineties, Marin proposed to define apathy as a clinical syndrome due to a lack of motivation. The syndrome is characterized by a diminished goal-directed overt behaviors, a lack of interest or concern for social and personal activities and a lack of responsiveness to positive and negative events. Apathy is clearly distinct from depression and can be observed in many conditions, in healthy people as well as in psychiatric disorders such as depression or schizophrenia. It is very common in patients with brain lesions involving the frontal lobes, the right hemisphere, but also in degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Motivation, considered as the source of apathy by Marin, is not a simple construct. It refers to a complex set of multiple affective and cognitive processes. However, it is considered, either in an energetic acception, as a single quantitative variable, a force which impulses action but not direct behavior or, in a more specific acception, as the factor which direct behavior towards specific actions. The description of apathy by Marin and the scales designed to its assessment, are based on the first acception. The term apathy is only descriptive, such as those of dysphasia or anosognosia. They do not allow to study the mechanisms underlying the motivation disorders, essential process for the management of apathetic patients. A tentative qualitative approach to assess motivation disorders is proposed, using a semi-structured interview. However, it should be stressed that motivation can not be directly assessed: motivation is a concept to explain some behavior disorders and an inference from the study of behavior.",

      "abstract": "A neuropsychiatric and -psychological update of the crime “profile” and “signature” is a necessary addition to the traditional sociopsychological model likely to miss limbic system dysfunctioning. Thus, occurrence of a brief (c. 20 minutes) limbic seizure has been proposed based on behaviors of 12 white male homicidal loners, who showed a dozen symptoms and signs: Limbic Psychotic Trigger Reaction. Readily overlooked can be (a) a transient psychosis (hallucinations and/or delusions), (b) autonomic hyperactivation (e.g., loss of bladder control, nausea, ejaculation), (c) motiveless, out-of-character, unplanned, and well-remembered homicidal acts, (d) committed with a flat affect (not emotionally or impulsively provoked), (e) typically involving a stranger who happened to provide an objectively harmless and only subjectively important stimulus. (f) Such an individualized stimulus triggered the memory revival of mild to moderate but repeatedly experienced hurts. Such a specific sequence of events implicates the specific mechanism of limbic seizure, “kindling,” which does not necessarily involve motor convulsions. Repetition of such limbic episodes with “criminal acts” is conceivable under specific circumstances including cases in which the triggering stimulus is associated with pleasurable delusions (e.g., of grandiose power or wealth) or constitutes a specific aspect of a basic drive motive. For example, eating or sexual activities might be planned but degenerate into a limbic episode with a specific core symptomatology.",

Although post-traumatic conditions can be elaborately classified, the intrinsic validity of such classifications is often questionable. Current methods of evaluating psychological sequelae of accidental injury are inaccurate and unsatisfactory, partly because of the protagonists' conceptual, motivational and semantic differences. In addition, there is no really satisfactory method of (a) determining and quantifying minor but significant degrees of brain damage, (b) distinguishing these from \"post-traumatic neurosis\", or (c) determining the relationship between the trauma and subsequent disturbance of function. Increasingly \"expert\" advice is solicited but owing to the nature of the data and conditions of examination, such advice does little to clarify the underlying problems. Furthermore, doctors are often unable to communicate effectively to the judiciary just how the trauma has affected the patient.

There is no such thing as a non‐physical illness. Asking whether emotions cause diseases, or diseases cause emotions, leads to many difficulties and is unprofitable. It is far more useful to ask about stimulus‐response relationships. There are more kinds of specificity relations in psychophysiology and psychosomatic medicine than are usually recognized, and the usual specificity statements in psychosomatic medicine are not concerned with I‐R or S‐R specificity. There are many problems in medicine which psychophysiology could help to solve.",

      "abstract": "Despite multiple and often overlapping definitions of disability and frailty, both are common clinical characteristics of aged individuals though not identical. The geriatric syndrome of frailty is described as status of global impairment of physiological reserves involving multiple organ systems. The clinical correlate of frailty manifests as increased vulnerability, impaired capability to withstand intrinsic and environmental stressors, and limited capacity to maintain physiological and psychosocial homeostasis. Geriatric frailty is found in 20–30% of the elderly population over 75 years and increases with advancing age. It was reported to be associated with long-term adverse health-related outcomes – increased risk of geriatric syndromes, dependency, disability, hospitalization, institutional placement, and mortality. The clinical phenotype of frailty manifests as multi-system pathologies characterized by low physical activity, global weakness with low muscle strength, fatigability/exhaustion, overall slowness particularly of gait, loss of weight among others. These above-mentioned clinical symptoms could be explained by (or related to) some ‘preclinical’ diagnoses such as sarcopenia, osteopenia, nonspecific balance disorders, nutritional problems, and overall deconditioning. More recent studies found the frailty clinical phenotype to be associated with pathologic laboratory markers (IL-6, CRP, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, IGF-1, D-dimers), which suggest possible pathogenesis involving hormonal dysregulation, immuno-aging, pro-coagulation and pro-inflammatory status. In the article, current recommendations for future research strategies of frailty syndrome will be discussed.",

Depression can seriously impact a child’s academic achievement, social interactions and other aspects of their daily lives. [1] The reported prevalence of depression is 1 to 2% in prepubescent children, 3 to 8% in younger teenagers and 14% in teenagers aged 15 to 18; overall, it is estimated that 20% of the population will experience at least one episode of depression prior to the age of 18. [2] During childhood there is no significant gender difference in the prevalence of depression, but after puberty female rates of depression become higher than those for males. [3] The etiology of childhood depression remains unclear: it may be caused by the interaction of various risk factors and protective factors including genetic predisposition, abnormalities of the structure and function of the brain, psychological and physiological stressors, poor parental relationships, and so forth.

Of note, two key changes in DSM-5 pertinent to older adults are elimination of minor depression from the appendix and elimination of the bereavement exclusion criterion for major depression. In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss. Depressive symptoms are likewise present in other DSM-5 disorders, such as adjustment disorder with depressed mood and mood disorder due to a general medical condition (see Table 5–1 ).

A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

A review of the empirical literature on psychological reactions to trauma suggest that this pattern of symptoms has often been identified across different kinds of traumatic events. It is likely to constitute a psychological adaptation to a stressful event, limiting painful thoughts and feelings associated with the event and allowing the person to function at least minimally. Continuation of these symptoms, however, may impair the person's quality of life and disrupt social and other functioning. If symptoms last beyond a month following the traumatic event, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may ensue, continuing for months or even years after the precipitating event. Hence, it is important to be able to identify this pattern of reactions that may be manifested in reaction to trauma, so that appropriate intervention can be provided. Although it was not officially recognized in the 3rd edition Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM‐III‐R), Acute Stress Disorder is included as a separate diagnosis in the DSM‐IV.",

      "abstract": "Pain is an ubiquitous human experience. It is one of the most common reasons for seeking medical attention, accounting for approximately one quarter of general practice consultations and half of all outpatient attendances and hospital admissions in the UK (Royal College of Physicians, 1996). For some people, persistent pain is an unrelieved condition of daily life. Yet despite the prevalence of chronic and debilitating conditions, indices of social well-being seldom include pain as a factor affecting the quality of life. Pain is commonly seen as a symptom of other complaints rather than an adversity in itself. Although injury and disease can be detected by observation and clinical tests, pain is a peculiarly private experience that cannot be reduced to anything else; it cannot be x-rayed, or calibrated like blood pressure on a standardized scale, nor can we feel another's pain. Unlike most other states of consciousness, pain has no object or referential content: it is not of anything or for anything, nor can it be easily defined. We commonly resort to suggestive metaphors to describe what we feel in terms of something else — as a 'shooting', 'burning', 'throbbing', 'gnawing' sensation. Sometimes the sheer intensity of what we feel seems to defy language and we can only speak of 'excruciating', 'unbearable' or 'indescribable' pain.KeywordsChronic PainPersistent PainDiscursive PracticeMedical DiscourseReal BodyThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

Improving engagement in physical activity is an important aspect of the management of the poor physical health that is associated with a range of mental health problems. Social isolation occurs alongside poor mental health; sports and exercise participation are a helpful means by which this can be addressed. Participation is important for recovery and in building an independent, hopeful, and fulfilling life away from a sick role in any chronic condition, but may be especially useful in severe mental illnesses such as psychoses.",

The patient's capacity to unfold appears to increase almost as a result of the psychiatrist's control over his own emotions. The author, who is here referring to Epinal's image of the infallible psychiatrist, believes that the psychiatrist, in moments of privacy can observe the effects of his own emotional stress and how they often relate to his unresolved neurotic problems. It is in his practice, nevertheless, that the psychiatrist can privilege and give meaning to his own emotional stress in order to gain deeper insight in his mode of relating to his patient. Such additional awarness should then permit a more careful and satisfying analysis of what is experienced in a two person or group relationship. The acknowledgment of physical state resulting from emotional stress precedes an insight which always corresponds to a signifier leading to a signified which is then to be decoded.",

The functions and implications of pain are clearest in situations of acute illness or injury or in chronic, organically based conditions in which actual or threatened tissue damage is signaled by its report. Much greater complexity is found in a variety of clinical presentations (conversion hysteria, hypochondriasis, chronic pain syndromes, Briquet's syndrome, Munchausen's syndrome) in which pain may form part or all of the clinical picture. In such conditions the relationship of the patient's report of pain to other phenomena (tissue damage, physiopathology, perceptual and cognitive styles, personality type, individual and family psychodynamics, anxiety, depression, behavioral patterns, social and economic factors, cultural influences) is important in elucidating pathogenetic mechanisms of which several may be operating in any one case. Awareness of the existence and interaction of these mechanisms facilitates the development and integration of treatment approaches.",

Postpartum psychosis is much less common than postpartum depression, commonly assumed to affect about 0.1–0.2% of women in the general population. The strongest risk factor for depression during pregnancy is a history of major depressive disorder. Women with a history of anxiety disorder, postpartum depression, or other previous psychiatric disorders are also at an increased risk for postpartum depression. Untreated maternal depression during pregnancy has been associated with poorer maternal physical and psychological health and with a worse quality of life. Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric illness characterized by episodes of depression alternating with sustained episodes of elevated mood and/or irritability, which are classified as either \"mania\" or \"hypomania.\" Hypomania is an attenuated form of mania with no associated functional impairment.",

Therefore, the aim of this review paper was to contribute towards a more coherent view on hypochondriasis, which would also allow its more adequate classification. The essential features of hypochondriasis were identified as an overvalued idea about the presence of disease, fear that the person has already become seriously ill, reassurance-seeking and other forms of health checking, and disturbances in the perception of bodily sensations and symptoms. These four aspects of hypochondriasis can be assessed dimensionally to ascertain to what extent they characterise each patient. Suggestions have been made to delineate more precisely hypochondriasis from health anxiety, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, other somatoform disorders, personality disorders, depression, and delusional disorder with disease-related delusions. In the absence of better alternatives, hypochondriasis should continue to be classified among the somatoform disorders. In order to improve communication between clinicians and reduce conceptual heterogeneity, the term 'hypochondriasis' should be used to refer only to primary hypochondriasis. The pressure to abandon this term should be resisted until an adequate substitution for it has been found.",

      "title": "Overreaching/Overtraining",
      "abstract": "Are you struggling with your exercise/conditioning routine or feeling a bit washed out, stale, and drained? Perhaps your muscles are persistently feeling heavy, stiff, a bit sore, and your exercise program has ceased to be enjoyable. If so, you may be suffering from a condition referred to as \"overreaching\" or, in more severe cases, \"overtraining syndrome.\" Overreaching is broken into functional and nonfunctional states, both of which respond to extra rest. Nonfunctional overreaching leads to a more extended period of decreased performance than functional overreaching and is accompanied by neuroendocrine and/or psychological symptoms. Overtraining is considered severe nonfunctional overreaching that results in a prolonged performance decrement (>2 months) and more severe symptoms. Effective conditioning requires a balance between intense training sessions and periods of rest/recovery. Too much overload and/or not enough recovery can result in both physiological and psychological symptoms that limit performance and may cause one to cease participation in a previously enjoyable activity. In many noncompetitive exercisers, the condition is often the result of inadequate rest/recovery because of busy work lives, family, work and health stressors, meal skipping, and poor sleep. Exercise can become addictive because of the effects of endorphins, dopamine, and other exercise-generated factors on the brain. This addiction can easily result in frequent intense training sessions that are not interspersed with adequate recovery periods. This phenomenon, especially when combined with the increasing popularity of intense multievent endurance competitions and intense group training programs, places individuals at increased risk for developing a nonfunctional state and, in more severe cases, overtraining syndrome. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS More than 125 signs and symptoms have been identified in published literature, making a definitive diagnosis challenging. The most common symptoms include: • Persistent heavy, stiff, and sore muscles • Persistent fatigue, washed-out feeling • Decreased performance and ability to maintain the training regimen • Increased susceptibility to infections, colds, headaches • Nagging and somewhat chronic injuries • Sleep disturbances • Decreased mental concentration and restlessness • Increased irritability • Depression • Tachycardia and, in some cases, bradycardia • Loss of appetite and weight loss • Bowel movement changes • Absence of menstruation TREATMENT AND PREVENTION The primary treatment is rest and, with more severe cases, an extended break from training. Improved quality of sleep, appropriate nutrition and hydration, and addressing nonexercise stressors are essential for full recovery. In some cases, your physician may choose to rule out other potential organic causes related to a variety of illnesses and health conditions. Prevention of nonfunctional overreaching and overtraining is critical to continued enjoyment of and benefit from your exercise training program. Following are a few key tips: • Listen to your body and take extra recovery time as indicated. • Follow the 10% rule; don't increase training volume and/or intensity by more than 10% at a time. • Follow a periodization format; intersperse periods of intense/high-volume training with extended periods of rest/recovery and/or cross-training. • Recovery/rest between intense workouts is critical because this is when muscle tissue repair and growth occur; usually 24 to 72 hours depending on the intensity and volume of the session. • You shouldn't feel wiped out following a hard workout; you should feel like you could do more; if not, you are doing too much. • Proper nutrition and hydration are important; consulting a sports dietician may be helpful. • Quality sleep is essential. • Variety in your training is healthy; don't do the same thing all the time. Maintaining a training log can be helpful in identifying periods of overreaching and the need for extra recovery. Include variables such as your resting heart rate, sleep, weight (for weight loss), mood, workout intensity/duration, and how muscles and joints respond. With appropriate recovery and using a periodization plan for your long-term training, you will be able to minimize the risk of overtraining and keep your exercise and competitions fun and enjoyable.",

      "abstract": "Health and disease processes are developed due to biological, psychological and social determinants. Obesity is usually associated with mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety. This association is evidenced in both directions. Mental disorders, such as depression, anxiety and eating disorders, contribute to the development of obesity, as well as obesity increases the incidence of mental disorders. When stability and homeostasis are disrupted, due to chronic stress and factors such as genetics, environment, affective relationships and psychosocial support, allostatic overload is evidenced. Through this overload, multiple systems are misbalanced and clinical diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes and metabolic syndrome, and mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, occur. The diagnoses of mental disorders are made based on a combination of somatic and psychiatric symptoms. Unexplained physical complaints and generic symptoms like depressed mood, sadness, impatience, irritability and restlessness are the most frequent ones, together with sleep and appetite disturbances, caused both by physical and mental disorders. These factors often make the correct diagnosis in obese patients more difficult. The primary care professionals must be alert to physical complaints and psychological distress present in organic disorders. The understanding of physiopathological effects of stress and emotional suffering in somatic disorders reinforces that effective care in chronic diseases, such as obesity, has to be organized including these aspects. Treatment needs to be comprehensive so that care can be effective and physical and mental disorders can be properly solved. New therapeutic approaches must be focused on the person, the family and the community instead of focused on the disease. This is essential in the treatment of obesity as it is directly associated with lifestyle, emotional state and stress level, which depends on a change of the individual and his ways of living to be solved. Through this approach, primary care may promote health and prevent diseases.",

Proponents of the Social Model agree that disabled people are impaired in the sense of deviating from the normal species functioning of humans. According to the Welfarist Model, disabilities are not inherently negative conditions – they are only harmful through their effects in specific environments. One important feature of the Welfarist Model is that it sees disability as highly context dependent. Another feature of the Welfarist Model is that disability becomes a matter of degree – and so common. People sometimes associate disability with visible and overt features of people's bodies, or with very severe mental limitations.",

      "abstract": "Stress is a complex phenomenon and commonly referred to as a range of bodily reactions toward a potentially harmful stimulus that may disturb homeostasis. It is important to understand that stress impacts psychological, physiological, immunological, and behavioral functions that not only require individual coping strategies but affect disease onset and/or progression in both humans and animals. Integrative studies have demonstrated significant consequences of stress on metabolic, cardiovascular, mental, and reproductive health as well as individual fitness and immune modulation. It is apparent that there exist many similarities between humans and animals encountering a stressful stimulus. Individual variation in stress susceptibility is related to genetic predisposition and early experience. This chapter provides an overview on stress concepts, physiological cascades, and stress-related diseases.",

      "title": "What does it Mean to be Rational?",
      "abstract": "Rationality can be broadly categorized into two types: rationality of action, which concerns behavior appropriate to achieving one's goals, and theoretical rationality, which involves conformity to norms, such as logical or social norms. Many philosophers and psychologists, including Graham, argue that a key aspect of mental disorder is a deficiency in rational control over one's behavior. This notion aligns with common perceptions that mental illness involves a lack of discipline or self-control. Contrary to popular belief, individuals with mental disorders may not necessarily demonstrate impaired rationality. Studies on schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety disorders suggest that individuals with these conditions can reason logically within their symptomatic domains and may even outperform non-disordered individuals in certain tasks. For instance, individuals with schizophrenia may exhibit logical reasoning and resistance to cognitive biases. Similarly, individuals with depression may demonstrate a more realistic outlook, devoid of positive illusions commonly found in mentally healthy individuals. Furthermore, individuals with anxiety disorders, such as phobias or obsessive-compulsive disorder, may display expert-level reasoning within their symptomatic domains, utilizing strategies like the Better Safe than Sorry or the semidialectic reasoning. Overall, the distinction between normal and pathological cognition cannot be solely based on rationality, as both groups exhibit similar patterns of cognitive processes and reasoning. Mental disorders involve complex interactions between cognitive processes and social factors, challenging traditional notions of rationality as a defining characteristic of mental health. In the second part of this chapter, we explore the roots of stigma, attributing it to both automatic and deliberate psychological processes. These processes lead to negative associations and attributions of responsibility to those with mental disorders, perpetuating stereotypes and discrimination. Furthermore, fear of contagion, unpredictability, and the belief that mentally ill individuals pose a threat to oneself contribute to stigmatization. Personal accounts highlight the dehumanizing effects of stigma, where individuals labeled as mentally ill face discrimination, abuse, and loss of identity. Moreover, the internalization of stigma can lead to low self-esteem and diminished quality of life. We conclude the book by emphasizing the importance of recognizing the rationality within madness and challenging societal attitudes toward mental illness. Reframing mental disorder involves acknowledging the humanity and dignity of individuals with mental illnesses, rather than perpetuating stereotypes and discrimination.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety and psychosomatic Desease. Escalation mechanisms and therapeutic strategies from the perspective of systems theory and behavioral therapy Abstract. There is unlikely to be a symptomatic malady or disease in humans that is not accompanied by more or less severe anxiety. This can directly negatively influence bodily disease processes, it always creates or intensifies mental suffering, often it causes the development of an independent anxiety disorder. Pathogenetically, nonlinear amplifications play a central role, as they are typical for complex dynamic systems. While these multiple vicious cycle mechanisms are responsible for the escalation of symptoms, misdirected learning processes bring about a chronification. An integrative model for these pathogenetic relationships is being developed, which at the same time makes it clear how one can synergistically combine established behavioral therapy methods for their treatment. This integrative behavioral therapy is exemplified by a case study.Zusammenfassung. Es dürfte kaum eine symptomatische Funktionsstörung oder Erkrankung geben, die beim Menschen nicht von mehr oder weniger starker Angst begleitet wird. Dies kann körperliche Krankheitsprozesse direkt negativ beeinflussen, immer erzeugt bzw. intensiviert es psychisches Leiden, oft verselbständigt es sich zu einer eigenständigen Angsterkrankung. Pathogenetisch spielen nichtlineare Verstärkungen eine zentrale Rolle, wie sie für Komplexe dynamische Systeme typisch sind. Während diese vielfältigen Teufelskreis-Mechanismen für die Eskalation der Symptome verantwortlich sind, bewirken fehlgeleitete Lernprozesse eine Chronifzierung. Es wird ein Integrierendes Modell für diese pathogenetischen Zusammenhänge entwickelt, das zugleich deutlich macht, wie man etablierte verhaltenstherapeutische Methoden zu ihrer Behandlung synergistisch kombinieren kann. Diese verfahrensintegrierende Verhaltenstherapie wird an einem Fallbeispiel exemplifiziert.",

      "abstract": "Jeongji(情志) in Chinese medicine refers to a series of psychological activity which is expressed as hui(喜), no(怒), wu(優), sa(思), bi(悲), gong(恐), gyeong(驚), together with emotion, sentiment, and cognition, which are manifested as responses of the human body to environmental changes both inside and outside. Sa(思) is a major cognitive activity, and the other six emotions are main emotional activities. The emphasis on the interrelationship between cognition, sentiment, and emotional activity is a unique characteristic of the Jeongji(情志) concept in China. Jeongji[Mental] disorder refers to a series of diseases that has a close link between the attack, clinical presentation and emotional stimulation. The attack is deeply affected by emotional stimulation, with which physical symptoms are either present or absent. However, emotional changes are clear most of the time, their effect on disease development noticeable as well. To sum up, Jeongji[Mental] disorder is related to a wide range of medical problems in fields such as internal, surgical, gynecology, pediatrics, and various psychiatric disorders, not to mention contemporary psychological disorders, neurosis, and all kinds of mental illnesses of today. Moreover, the mental and physical disorders of today all share a common pathogenesis, clinical manifestation and treatment discipline. All the more reason for deeper professional research.",

      "abstract": "The problem of epilepsy may be best approached by considering all convulsions which are accompanied by unconsciousness, whether periodic or otherwise, as symptoms of some underlying pathologic state or disease.By doing this the convulsion becomes a symptom.The question then arises, which I believe should be answered in the negative, whether any so-called epileptic state should, of itself, be con- sidered a disease. ETIOLOGIC FACTORSThus, among the underlying causes of convulsions are uremia, eclampsia and other toxicoses; several varieties of trauma, as birth trauma and that from blows on the head; certain intracranial irrita- tions, as brain tumors and cerebral hemorrhages; certain infections, as syphilis and varieties of meningitis; certain conditions of cerebral maldevelopment accompanied by a degree of brain cell deterioration; and certain conditions of the pituitary gland causing a change in its secretion.I believe, therefore, that convulsions, whether periodical and termed epilepsy, or not, are due to definite pathologic cerebral tissue changes which may be congenital or induced, and hence, that epilepsy is an organic and not a functional condition.In the toxic and pituitary cases there may exist previous malformation and instability of the cortical cells, or, on the other hand, it is perfectly conceivable that the toxic substance or the changed pituitary secretion may produce their own cortical cell deterioration.I published a paper on the relation of the pituitary gland to some cases of epilepsy, and in 19141 and again in 1916,2 a paper on the subject of hypopituitarism in its relation to epilepsy.These papers were the result of a personal suggestion of Dr. Harvey Cushing and also of the perusal of his most excellent book.",

Physical activity has been shown to have both preventative and therapeutic benefits for mental health. The mental health benefits of physical activity in the general population provide a rationale for therapeutic application in those with established mental health problems. Physical inactivity is one of the leading risk factors for global mortality with sedentary behaviour now recognised as a major public health issue. The benefits of being physically active are well documented and include the prevention and management of mental health conditions. The chapter introduces the scale of the challenge that mental health problems pose, globally and in the United Kingdom (UK), in terms of health, health care provision, and the economic burden. The multiple benefits of physical activity for mental, physical, and social health, and the absence of side-effects, make it an appealing adjunct or alternative to pharmacological treatments.",

The disorder is common in neurological services and frequently seen by psychiatrists working in such settings. It is often associated with chronic severe disability. The diagnosis previously hinged on the neurologist’s demonstration of the lack of disease and the psychiatrist’s hypothesis of a ‘conversion’ of stress into a physical symptom. It is now based on positive findings on neurological assessment supplemented by a psychiatric assessment to confirm the diagnosis. Comorbid anxiety and depression disorders are common. Treatment is multi-disciplinary. Explanation of the condition to the patient is a crucial initial step supplemented, where necessary, by psychological treatment (especially for dissociative or non-epileptic attacks) and physiotherapy for functional motor symptoms.

      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter examines chronic pain. Pain starts as a symptom—associated, for example, with arthritis or neuropathy—and, for one in five Americans, this symptom becomes “chronic,” that is, it lasts for weeks, or months, or even years. Chronic pain has its own reliable neurobiology and its own brain activation signature—although it cannot be localized in any specific “pain area” like other sensory perceptions, such as smell or sight. Still, pain changes the brain’s structure, its neuronal configurations. Moreover, pain’s significance in a person’s life is highly individualized. The experience of chronic pain can be altered by mood, sleep quality, distraction, suggestion, or even anticipation of new pain. This implies that pain may be exacerbated by social conditions—by violence, by anxiety. Living in poverty, for example, increases the odds of living with chronic pain. Although pain is real, it is still doubted and disputed. In the legal system, it is the subject of arguments over payment for disability claims and personal injury suits. The lack of an objective measure of pain means that some who might deserve compensation miss out because they cannot “prove” their discomfort. Assessing and treating pain, recognizing the pain of others, coping with its presence, and limiting its ruinous effects without misusing opioids or taking one’s own life remain central tests of people’s empathy and their efforts to promote health.",

      "abstract": "Addicts and alcoholics suffer vulnerabilities and deficits in self-regulation. A principal manifestation of their self-regulation disturbances is evident in the way they attempt to self-medicate painful affect states and related psychiatric problems. Individuals select a particular drug based on its ability to relieve or augment emotions unique to an individual which they cannot achieve or maintain on their own. Addicts and alcoholics usually experiment with all classes of drugs, but discover that a particular drug suits them best. Usually, painful affect states interact with other problems in self-regulation involving self-esteem, relationships, self-care, and related characterological defenses, making it more likely that addicts will experiment with and find the action of a particular drug appealing or compelling. Stimulants have their appeal because their energizing properties relieve distress associated with depression, hypomania, and hyperactivity; opiates are compelling because they mute and contain disorganizing affects of rage and aggression; and sedative hypnotics, including alcohol, permit the experience of affection, aggression, and closeness in individuals who are otherwise cut off from their feelings and relationships.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In the conclusion of this two-part article, the authors present the notion of psychiatric confounders to assist non–psychiatric physicians in assessing the “difficult pain patient.” Non–psychiatric physicians need not have a detailed understanding of all psychiatric diagnoses, but an understanding of certain diagnoses will assist in evaluating patients with enduring pain complaints. Psychosocial factors have important effects on the relationship between pain and disability. In one study, job satisfaction was a predictor of future disability in low back pain patients; in another study, psychiatric morbidity in a pain-free population predicted the development of back pain over a defined period. In many patients with persistent somatic and/or pain complaints, unrecognized psychiatric diagnoses drive or complicate symptoms and may precede the onset of low back pain. Mood, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders are common and can be associated with physical and pain complaints. Somatic symptoms often are the core feature of the depressed patient who presents to a primary care physician. Somatoform disorders are a spectrum of psychiatric disorders in which physical complaints are driven or aggravated by psychological factors; somatizing patients have chronic problems, many of which are pain-related and involve recurrent physical symptoms, often in different bodily systems, that wax and wane over time. Physicians who evaluate patients with pain complaints must understand the complexity of the challenge, including the probability that pain complaints indicate underlying psychopathology.",

However, the importance of diet, alcohol, activity, and other concurrent disease also was noted. Perforation usually occurred as a climax to a period of emotional turbulence when the patient faced situations which, consciously or unconsciously, he felt to be grossly damaging to his self-esteem and to which he reacted, predominantly, with impotent rage. The perfection prodrome is described and interpreted as a depressive equivalent. The ulcer patient's ordinal position in his family as the youngest or middle child and his difficulties in relation to his father are emphasized. Particularly where no other serious disease coexists, perforation should be taken as presumptive evidence that the patient has tried unsuccessfully to resolve an emotional crisis and that appropriate psychiatric help probably is indicated as part of the total treatment.",

Predominant in the psychology of most obsessed patients is their tie with an Other, a selfobject that helps to stabilize favorable aspects of the patient's unstable self-image. Clinical examples are provided, and issues of therapeutic alliance, gradual psychodynamic exploration, potential decompensation and violence, and countertransference are discussed.",

The close - knit family structure and lack of adequate government resources to support people with mental illness place the burden of care on the family which is perceived to be the ‘‘natural’’ caregiver. Socio-cultural expectations envision caregiving as an obligation and moral binding which is to be given by parents, children or the spouse. Religious-cultural attributions often causally implicate supernatural factors in the manifestation of mental illness.\r\nSchizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that usually starts in late adolescence or early adulthood, and is characterized by profound disruption in thinking, language, perception and the sense of self, and includes psychotic experiences, such as hearing voices or delusions. 6\r\nThe volatile nature of the disorder and its accompanying debilitating consequences burdens the family in multiple domains causing social, emotional and financial problems. Several studies had done worldwide reveal a high level of burden, social isolation and stigma among caregivers of schizophrenia. Indian data in this area is relatively sparse however some studies reports the presence of depression, anxiety, poor mental and physical health and other mental disorders among the caregivers. In view of the above the present study was undertaken to evaluate the quality of life and marital adjustment in spouses of schizophrenia patients.",

Compathy occurs when one person observes another person suffering a disease or injury and experiences in one's physical body a similar or related distress. Thus, compathy is the physical equivalent to empathy. Although the contagion of physiological (compathetic) responses has been previously documented (for example, as couvades or psychogenic epidemics of the workplace), it has not been theoretically explicated. Triggers for the compathetic response are identified and include observing the suffering, hearing, or reading—or even thinking about—descriptions of the symptoms. The relevance of the compathetic response in the caregiving relationship and the necessity of suppressing the response when inflicting pain as a part of providing therapy are described. The concept of compathy is analysed and defended.",

Their own experiences are processed by them in more emotional than rational manner, and their feelings are expressed spontaneously and creatively. They are willing to experiment with various systems of values and roles; they are charming and cheerful in the company of others. Apart from that, they are clearly on the look-out for the closeness in interpersonal contacts. In clinical terms, a typical set of symptoms observed in case of people with borderline personality includes: changeable or low level of internalization of relations with the object, peculiar defense mechanisms of ego, pathological narcissism and the lack of impulse zone control. It is reflected in the attitudes of people with formed borderline personality, who are alternately excessively demanding and strict, while at different times too tolerant and lenient.",

      "abstract": "A hypothesis raised in the first edition of this book, that psychotic symptoms often originate in traumatic experiences and relate to dissociation, is updated and expanded in this chapter. Evidence now demonstrates that traumatic experiences clearly may be linked to psychotic symptoms, and dissociation predicts not only voice hearing, but other forms of hallucinations and delusions as well. Strongly linked to dissociation are the so-called first-rank symptoms of schizophrenia, particularly passivity experiences such as believing that one’s thoughts, feelings, or actions are not under one’s own control. Traumatic, dissociation and, to a lesser extent, attachment-based explanations for psychotic symptoms are proposed. It is argued that psychotic symptoms are substantially overemphasized in the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, leading to a high likelihood of misdiagnosing dissociative disorders as schizophrenia, with the accompanying risks of stigma and inappropriate forms of treatment. This is particularly concerning as there is anecdotal evidence that antipsychotic medications are even less effective and more dangerous for dissociative disorders than for psychotic disorders, while trauma and dissociation-based treatments have demonstrated efficacy for psychotic symptoms. Thus, the traumatic and dissociative nature of some, if not most, psychotic symptoms should, for theoretical, clinical and ethical reasons, finally be acknowledged.",

      "abstract": "Subthreshold psychotic experiences are widely reported within otherwise healthy populations. Their phenomenology is broad and very heterogeneous ranging from meaningful coincidences and precognitive dreams over haunting to out-of-body experiences and visual as well as auditory hallucinations. Although creative aspects of these experiences are implied too, a similarity in form and content to positive symptoms in schizophrenia (e.g., delusion, disordered thought, and hallucinations) or schizotypy (e.g. magical thinking, unusual perceptual experiences, ideas of reference or paranoid ideation) seems to be obvious. However, the borderline between normal and pathological experiences and behaviour is unclear. The so called “continuum approach” assumes that schizophrenia or schizotypy are not discrete or categorical illness entities. It implies a gradient in the severity of the symptoms, ranging from healthy population to full-blown schizophrenia. As such, psychotic signs are no longer restricted to formal diagnoses according to DSM or ICD, but would, instead, complete the spectrum of psychological and biological features that characterize individual variations among human beings. Can subthreshold psychotic experiences be integrated in this continuum? Do individuals indicating such experiences lack some social cognitive abilities and are particularly vulnerable to false inferences in their social world. How are these experiences related to increased neural activity or an abnormal dopaminergic neurotransmission? These and similar questions will be discussed in the presentation.

It is essential to address the psychosocial aspect in these cases from a medical point of view. Drug therapy with serotonin reuptake inhibitors is therefore prescribed. Next, psychotherapy should be introduced. The final strategy usually is to collaborate with a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist.",

      "abstract": "The overarching concept of cerebral palsy involves several different definitions; it is as group of unprogressive and often changing motor disturbance syndromes caused by brain injury or developmental disorder in early stages of development as a result of premature or severe birth, neonatal complications such as infection or hypoxia, and brain trauma. Cerebral palsy affects two to three children per 1,000 live-born. Typological characteristics of the clinical image of cerebral palsy are the modified muscle tone characterized by muscular tension, altered body posture and disturbed motion. Cerebral palsy is a disorder of the central nervous system, so it affects the whole development and functioning of the physical psychomotor development of a child. It is accompanied by developmental disorders, sensomotor disorders, perceptual cognitive developmental disorders, socioemocional disorders and difficulties in functioning of everyday life, auditory - visual and other perceptual disorders, intellectual deficit, etc., and may be accompanied by epilepsy. Cerebral palsy, although a permanetn diagnosys, depending on the degree of damage, can be treated using different treatment methods and therapies such as kinesitherapy can which can significantly influence the overall functioning of the affected person. The key precondition is early detection and propercorrective and therapeutic or curative action. Kinesitheraphy as a motion treatment method can have a significant effect on treating a person, raising the body's psychomotor status and the quality of everyday life. Methods used, based on clinical kinesiology, and appropriate exercise and modification, kinesitherapy has positive effects in treating the condition of people with cerebral palsy",

The onset of symptoms within 1 month (ICD) and 3 months (DSM) is not evidence based. The symptoms may be depressive, anxious, behavioural, or a mixture of these. A useful clinical indicator that the event was the trigger is that the intensity of the symptoms increases when it is being recalled or recounted and diminishes when the person is removed from it. A number of differentials should also be considered. ICD-11 proposes specific criteria for ICD-11 that include preoccupation with the stressor and difficulty adapting, as evidenced by impaired concentration, sleep disturbance, and so on, causing impairment in functioning. It is unclear whether those diagnosed with AD using the new criteria will be the same clinically as those currently so diagnosed.",

Most authors also agree that fatigue does not depend on overall or motor disability (as measured with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)3).

On the other side, nowadays, Psychiatry is often asked to act in disruptive situation: difficulty in controlling impulses, aggressive behaviors and criminality. The authors present some case studies of personality disorders, in which the principal symptom at admission was violent behavior. The psychiatric action was limited by therapeutic solutions and ethic issues. According to literature there’s an association between personality disorders and criminal behavior. Antisocial personality is a strong predictor of violence and aggression. The clinical cases presented confirm these findings.",

      "abstract": "Use of the term overuse injury should be avoided until there is definite proof of the cause of the injury\n\nInjuries are often categorised as being due to trauma or overuse. When no moment of trauma is recalled, then an assumption is made that an injury is the result of overuse. In this article, I will argue that there is insufficient evidence to support this extensive use of the term “overuse” and that there are problems associated with using it. Thus, we should avoid the term, which implies the cause of the injury, until we have proof of the cause.\n\nOveruse injury is now categorised in medical subject headings as “cumulative trauma disorder (CTD)”. This is a subcategory of sprains and strains. CTD is defined as a “Harmful and painful condition caused by overuse or overexertion of some part of the musculoskeletal system, often resulting from work-related physical activities. It is characterized by inflammation, pain, or dysfunction of the involved joints, bones, ligaments, and nerves.” The term includes overuse injury, overuse syndrome, repetition strain injury, repetitive strain injury, and repetitive motion disorders. As CTD is defined as being caused by overuse, this definition fails to clarify the meaning of overuse injury. Overuse probably implies there is an amount of use that is excessive, and if use reaches or exceeds that amount then injuries arise.\n\nConsider now this term as used in sports medicine. Traumas, such as a fractured tibia caused by a tackle in soccer, are likely to be most common among players who play or train most. Yet, overuse is not said to be the cause of this injury. Injuries arising from obvious trauma are excluded from the category of overuse injuries. Such a trauma may be witnessed or may be felt as an acute moment of injury. An …",

      "title": "Mood and affect",
      "abstract": "Readers are grateful to Macpherson and Hikida1 for helping us understand the role of the basal ganglia in various mental disorders. In listing the symptoms of major depressive disorder, they mention, ‘low mood (also known as “flat affect”).’ This is a common mistake. Low mood refers to the feeling/internal emotional state of the individual – it is a symptom. It is a subjective matter and if the individual states that his/her mood is low, we are obliged to accept that assessment (we might, of course, comment that the signs are or are not consistent with the statement). The term ‘affect,’ when used in the assessment of the mental state, refers to the external manifestations of an internal feeling state – here, affect is a sign. (The term ‘affect’ is also sometimes used as an alternative to ‘mood,’ as is ‘affective disorders,’ but this is archaic and not much used currently.) The term ‘flat affect’ was coined to describe a sign of chronic schizophrenia. This largely refers to the unvarying immobile face and slow-moving body often associated with a loss (or absence) of emotional experience/life. It is a negative symptom. But ‘flat’ here is not interchangeable with ‘low’ – the important additional aspect is that the external manifestation does not vary. Where there is flat affect it is usually difficult to get an emotional response (reciprocal emotional response) from the patient. The face and behavior of the individual with a low mood may be similar, at times, to that of the person with schizophrenia with negative symptoms. However, the underlying processes are different. In one there is low mood, in the other there is absence of emotion. The external features (affect) associated with low mood revert to normal when the mood disorder resolves. The flat affect of schizophrenia changes little in response to treatment. Low mood and flat affect are distinct entities – ‘mood’ refers to subjective experience and ‘affect’ refers to objective evidence. Low mood is not always accompanied by psychomotor retardation (which limits facial and bodily movement) and the flat affect of schizophrenia may not be accompanied by low mood. The author has no conflicts of interest to declare.",

      "title": "Primary or secondary? What came first and how to treat?",
      "abstract": "Most of the literature regarding the importance of accurately and efficiently differentiating neuropsychiatric symptoms as secondary to medical conditions or as a primary psychiatric illnesses is found in the emergency department setting. It has been reported that 6 to 12% of patients presenting to the emergency department have psychiatric complaints or behavioral disturbances.12 Patients with psychiatric or behavioral disturbances are generally \"medically cleared\" prior to transfer to psychiatric care.2 Assessing if a patient is \"medically cleared\" helps to identify medical illnesses that could cause or contribute to psychiatric or behavioral symptoms which may make treatment at a psychiatric facility inappropriate or even dangerous.2 Appropriate treatment in the emergency department setting, therefore, may prevent morbidity and mortality associated with misdiagnosing of a medical illness as a psychiatric illness and from improper treatment of psychiatric illnesses.2 When psychiatric, neurologic, or behavioral manifestations are secondary to medical conditions, the focus of treatment should be on the underlying condition.3 This can be said for any kind of signs or symptoms – rarely is a single or set of signs or symptoms addressed without an evaluation for the underlying root cause. Symptomatic treatment of the neuropsychiatric manifestations, however, should not be overlooked and should run parallel to the primary condition.3To help identify a primary psychiatric illness compared to symptoms secondary to a medical illness, several factors that may assist in clarifying diagnosis include a focus on cognitive versus somatic symptoms, identification of personal or family history of psychiatric illness and response to treatment, careful neurologic exam emphasizing cognitive and mental status exam as part of the physical exam, and an understanding that a psychiatric diagnosis is not purely a diagnosis of exclusion of medical illnesses.3 Features suggesting that psychiatric symptoms are secondary to a medical illness include an abrupt onset with no known or readily recognizable precipitants, a temporal association with onset, worsening, or remission of the psychiatric symptoms concurrent with the medical illness, and the presence of atypical features.34 Additionally, the absence of a personal or family history of psychiatric diagnosis, late onset of new behavioral symptoms, obvious systemic disease, evidence of increased intracranial pressure, nonauditory hallucinations, use of psychoactive or centrally-acting medications, the occurrence of autonomic dysfunction with good premorbid function, and treatment resistance further suggest a medical origin.4 Though routine laboratory testing of all psychiatric patients presenting to the emergency department has not been supported in the literature, it is suggested that a complete history (including a detailed medication history) and physical exam with a full set of vital signs may be sufficient to exclude medical reasons for symptom presentation.125 Further laboratory and ancillary testing may be guided by the obtained information.125 Obtaining information directly from the patient may be, at times, difficult to obtain, therefore, collateral history from bystanders, family, friends, caregivers, health care professionals, law enforcement, paramedics, etc. is important.2Illnesses that may be commonly known to be associated with psychiatric symptoms are presented in Table 1. Increasing awareness and understanding of neuropsychiatric symptoms and adverse effects (and subsequently, management) may lead to more appropriate therapy choices or management and improved patient care. Additionally, comorbid medical illnesses may have implications on psychotropic medication selection. This issue of the Mental Health Clinician highlights psychiatric and neurologic manifestations of medical illnesses or those adverse effects secondary to medications.",

      "abstract": "The fact that general practitioner (GP) or psychiatrist understands the psychosocial effects of prescribing on the doctor-patient relationship is as important, if not more so, than knowing pharmacology. Any prescription of drugs modifies the doctor-patient relationship. Drugs, especially psychotropic drugs, act on symptoms and change thoughts, feelings, and behaviors; they can create both physical and psychological dependency; they can discourage a deep search for real solutions, both on the part of the doctor and the patient; they can affect the doctor’s access to the patient and the problem will be out of their reach. Psychotropic drugs can make the effect of the doctor in himself as a drug more difficult, favor an insignificant or problematic or little human relational context, where the GP/psychiatrist does not delve into the true meaning of the symptoms, and the patient tends not to get involved, to make an emotional withdrawal, to be passive before the prescribed drug, and can result in the chronification and structuring of functional symptoms that become organic, with lack of cooperation of the doctor and the patient, and paradoxically with over-compliance or therapeutic discontinuity and the lack of pharmacological adherence, absences to appointments or delays or cancellations of visits, and the denial of responsibility of both the doctor and the patient.",

So defined, it is neither a disorder nor a diagnostic category but a generic term for a set of experiential, cognitive, and behavioral characteristics of patients who complain of physical symptoms in the absence of relevant medical findings. Such patients are ubiquitous in all medical care settings, pose difficult diagnostic and management problems, and overutilize health care thus contributing to its cost. Somatization may be transient or persistent, and may or may not be associated with a diagnosable medical or psychiatric disorder. The most common concurrence of somatization is with affective and anxiety disorders, and, to a lesser degree, the somatoform disorders. Persistent somatization poses a serious clinical, social, and economic problem and hence early identification of potential chronic somatizers should be attempted to avoid its development. Pain, fatigue, dizziness, and dyspnea are the commonest symptoms. Etiology of somatization is multifactorial and so should be its management.",

La diagnosi psichiatrica del paziente formulata il giorno successivo alla messa in atto di un gesto criminale o violento e indispensabile, ma non e sufficiente. Non e necessariamente la stessa diagnosi dell’esame psichiatrico anamnestico prima del fatto e soprattutto non e necessariamente uguale alla diagnosi psichiatrica durante il fatto. Ad esempio, molte donne che hanno ucciso il figlio nel corso di una psicosi post-partum si presentano dopo l’omicidio con una sintomatologia prevalentemente depressiva, mentre al momento del gesto presentavano una sintomatologia piu facilmente riconducibile ad uno stato espansivo o misto, ed ancora prima del gesto presentavano non solo un temperamento irritabile in un contesto d’incapacita genitoriale. Ignorare l’evoluzione della psicopatologia psichiatrica, in generale e soprattutto in relazione alla criminalita, non permette una valutazione e un trattamento adeguati.\r\nE infine utile e necessario ricordare che comportamenti criminali e suicidio sono fenomeni ad eziologia multifattoriale in cui entrano in gioco variabili biologiche, psicologiche, psichiatriche, sociali, ideologiche ecc.

      "abstract": "Introduction: Mental disorders are defined as syndromes characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotional regulation or behavior, which reflect a dysfunction in the psychological, biological or developmental processes underlying mental functioning. These are often associated with suffering or disabilities. It is known that one of the striking characteristics of certain disorders is related to their chronicity, which reduces the possibility of a cure and raises the discussion about controlling their symptoms to maintain the quality of life of individuals who suffer from them. A little associated but relevant intervention, if the state of chronic users in mental health is analyzed, is palliative care and its palliative actions that do not seek a cure, but to offer the maximum possible comfort to the user from diagnosis until their last day of life. Objective: Gather and analyze information regarding palliative psychiatry and its benefits for patients with mental disorders. Methodology: Articles published in indexed journals in the Scientific Electronic Library Online (SCIELO), National Library of Medicine/NLM (MEDLINE), and National Library of Medicine/NLM (PUBMED) databases were evaluated, in addition to official sites such as the Ministry of Health of Brazil and the World Health Organization, covering the period from 2014 to 2024. Results and Discussion: After completing the data collection phase, 33 relevant articles were identified for analysis of the proposed theme. It has been noted that palliative psychiatry encompasses a wide range of issues, including widely known mental health conditions such as anxiety or depression, severe mental illnesses refractory to treatment, neuropalliative care, and symptom burden at various levels. Furthermore, it addresses ethical and psychosocial problems, psychological suffering, personality, desire and desire to die, dignity, loneliness, social isolation, as well as psychopharmacology. And that this care would be advantageous and of fundamental importance to patients with serious mental illnesses. Conclusion: Given the new perspectives for mental health care in an increasingly humanized way, the articles highlighted the benefits of palliative psychiatry and its importance in improving the quality of life of patients with serious mental disorders. However, it was also observed that many barriers need to be overcome to guarantee quality care for the group in question.",

      "title": "Non-verbal Cognitive Dysfunction in Children with Specific Language Impairment",
      "abstract": "Background: Language deficits occur in a series of developmental disorders and are widely recognized as characteristic symptoms of a range of developmental clinical conditions. In fact, Specific Language Impairment (hereafter SLI) is currently defined as a significant impairment of the child's linguistic abilities on several levels (phonology, morphology, lexical, syntax, narrative) by the presence of non-verbal IQ scores in the normal range; the diagnosis is based on a set of inclusionary and exclusionary criteria including performance at least one standard deviation below age expectations on a generic language assessment but 'normal' non-verbal intelligence. Of course, the term 'normal' non-verbal intelligence raises issues about what constitutes a 'normal' non-verbal IQ in a-/typical development and must be handled with care. However, according to the classical definition (ICD-10-GM version 2009; F80.- 'Umschriebene Entwicklungsstorungen des Sprechens und der Sprache') a child with SLI performs below age expectations on language measures despite having adequate cognitive and sensory skills for typical development with no obvious identifiable cause such as hearing loss, brain injuries or other neurological disorders.\r\nMorphology studies of individuals with developmental language disorders claim reversed asymmetry or symmetry of the planum temporale and the pars triangularis (Wernicke's and Broca's area), yet so far there is no clear evidence that children with SLI have marked anatomical differences from other children in either brain hemisphere. Moreover, some indication suggest a possible genetic link because SLI can be passed down from parents to children - although such a SLI-gene of course hasn't been identified thus far. Hence, the investigations of etiological factors are at a premature and inconclusive stage of inquiry and so far nothing but speculative causes can be mentioned.\r\nTo sum up, current literature on SLI hardly defines a language profile as 'typical' for SLI given that the spectrum of the disorder is very broad and yet unclear since in both, academic and clinical practice, the 'specific' characteristics of this developmental impairment have been questioned. After all, the fluidity of the diagnosis, making it difficult to border SLI, should actually be considered an important descriptive aspect, portraying the interactive nature of 'specific' cognitive systems. In fact, this study is motivated by the interest in the extensive issue whether there is a relationship between language impairments and impairments on general levels of nonverbal cognitive skills, as part of the broader question of the nature of language and cognition. \r\nThus, the aim of this study is to profile a child's performance across linguistic and cognitive domains, to determine if the domains are similar or discrepant in levels of performance.\r\nMethods: 30 typically developing children and 12 children with SLI between 5;0-9;0 years were tested on both their verbal and non-verbal abilities with respectively two standardized tests each. The children with SLI were all currently in therapy and classified as 'SLI' by their speech and language pathologists. All participants were from South Tyrol or Vienna and therefore German native speakers with dialectical colouring; some had a bilingual background, this fact was of course taken into consideration while analyzing the results. To 'measure' the child's non-verbal performances level the Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (parallel form) and the 'Zahlensymboltest' of the HAWIK-R was used. The Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices were used to give an indication about the child's (4;9-12;00) non-verbal performance; in each test item, a candidate is asked to identify the missing segment required to complete a larger pattern. \r\nThe verbal abilities were assessed with the German version of the standardized TROG-D (original edition by D.V.M. Bishop,1989; German by Annette V. Fox, 2006) which is used to test a child's (3;0-10;11) general linguistic and grammatical comprehension. However, some items (Set 'R') were discarded since the linguistic construction is not common in the children's dialect and therefore not recognizable by them. As a second test, the first part (forward digit span) of the 'Zahlennachsprechen' of the HAWIK-R assessed the phonological loop of the short term memory, while the second part (backward digit span) not only demands phonological memorizing but also the ability to act upon the shortly memorized item. \r\nThe test battery was reduced to these four items in order to successfully conduct the experiment without losing the child's attentiveness and interest. Each test session lasted for 20-35 minutes circa, depending on the child's accomplishment. In case the child was unable to concentrate or to carry out the given tasks, the experiment was stopped up and the results gained so far were used.\r\nResults: The preliminary results show a slight tendency towards underage-expected performance of the children diagnosed with 'SLI' in non-verbal tests compared to the control group. So far, this research alludes to a range of non-verbal cognitive mechanisms interacting with language and having its implications in delineating the profile of SLI. \r\nConclusions: Many of the studies of children with language impairments who do or do not display cognitive impairments are motivated by the interest in the broader issue of the relationship between language and cognition. The extent to which the two domains of language and general cognitive abilities are inherently singular or modular remains unresolved and controversial. However, this work has shown that to a small but noticeable extent the domains of cognition and language can operate as orthogonal dimensions. According to these findings, the definition of SLI as specifically and exclusively linked to language must be revised, since the characteristics of this developmental disorder seem to be wider than first documented.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Specific Language Impairment, Cognition, Non-verbal IQ, Developmental Disorder;\r\n\r\nReferences: \r\n[1]\tLeonard L.

It may have a beneficial, protective function to prevent exhaustion and overexertion. Sometimes fatigue can even be experienced as a pleasant feeling if it is of reasonable duration. On the other hand, fatigue as a pathological condition is always experienced as an ,unpleasant sensation. Asthenia is perceived as an unpleasant sensation whenever it exceeds one’s physiological resources, such as rest that must be recuperated. In a number of nontumor-associated conditions, asthenia, experienced as fatigue and/or weakness, is definitely a component or even a leading symptom (Table 9.1).",

She was very much concerned about the behavioural issues and wellbeing of her elder son since 12 years. According to the informant, the patient was having increased tension, repeated talking about her elder son, making loud noises and suicidal thoughts. Also, she had an attempt to suicide. She was treated on an IP level with a combination of Ayurvedic internal medications and Panchakarma procedures. The treatment protocol includes Snehapana, Virecana, Nasya, Shirodhara, and Dhoopana.

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Background Shame is a distressing self-conscious emotion which arises from evaluating oneself as immodest or indecorous and leads to avoidant behaviour as well as defensive anger. Guilt is the negative appraisal of a behaviour or thought and provides readiness to take action to compensate for the wrongdoing. Experiencing these emotions more intensely and frequently with interruptions during the daily life is named as shame or guilt-proneness. Emotion regulation includes processing and regulation of emotions to keep one pursuing goals in life. Individuals who lack effective skills to regulate their emotions or adopt ineffective ones experience difficulties in emotion regulation. Somatic symptoms include medically unexplained symptoms that one suffers from. Mostly, these symptoms, such as headache, dizziness or nausea, are due to unprocessed emotions carried from childhood as a result of maltreatment or abuse. The literature shows that these variables are related to each other. Methods This study focuses on how emotion regulation difficulties mediate between shame and guilt-proneness and somatic symptoms. The data were collected from 374 participants on online platforms using questionnaires with relevant scales. In order to summarize the data collected descriptive statistics was conducted and the relationship between variables was understood with correlation analysis. Furthermore, predictor role of shame-proneness was analysed with regression analysis and mediation analysis was employed to reveal the mediator role difficulties in emotion regulation in relationship between shame-proneness and somatic symptoms. Conclusion The results illustrated that all variables except guilt-proneness were associated with each other and difficulties in emotion regulation have a mediator role between two variables. The results can benefit mental health workers and patients who lack emotion regulation strategies and deal with somatic symptoms.",

      "title": "Delirium in Elderly People: A Review",
      "abstract": "The present review aims to highlight this intricate syndrome, regarding diagnosis, pathophysiology, etiology, prevention and management in elderly people. The diagnosis of delirium is based on clinical observations, cognitive assessment, detailed family history, physical and neurological examination. Clinically, delirium occurs in hyperactive, hypoactive or mixed forms, based on psychomotor behaviour. As an acute confusional state, it is characterized by a rapid onset of symptoms, fluctuating course and an altered level of consciousness, global disturbance of cognition or perceptual abnormalities and evidence of a physical cause. In spite of pathophysiological mechanisms of delirium remaining unclear, current evidence suggests that disruption of neurotransmission, inflammation or acute stress responses might all contribute to the development of this ailment. It usually occurs as a result of a complex interaction of multiple risk factors, such as cognitive impairment/dementia, current hip fracture and presence of severe illness. Despite all of the above, delirium is frequently under-recognized and often misdiagnosed by health professionals. In particular, this happens due to its fluctuating nature, its overlap with dementia and the scarcity of routine formal cognitive assessment in general hospitals. It is also associated with multiple adverse outcomes that have been well documented, such as increased hospital stay, function/cognitive decline, institutionalization and mortality. In this context, early identification of delirium will be essential. Timely and optimal management of people with delirium, should be performed with identification of possible underlying causes, dealing with a suitable care environment and improving education of health professionals. All these can be important factors, which contribute to a decrease in adverse outcomes associated with delirium.",

      "abstract": "Hallucinations are misperceptions of things or events with one or more senses when an internal or external trigger doesn’t exist. They can be divided into visual, audioverbal, olfactorical, tactile and gustatory. Hallucinations develop due to 3 main pathophysiologicalmechanisms: psychophysiological, psychobiochemical (neurohormone dependent) and psychodynamic. Etiology of these perceptions consists of many things and is not always binned to psychiatric illnesses. These are some of the etiological factors which will be mentioned further bellow: psychosis, delirium, dementia, Charles Bonnet syndrome, Anton syndrome, seizures, migraine, Lhermitte syndrome, sleep disorders and “Alice in Wonderland” syndrome. Audioverbal hallucinations are thought to be a misperceptionof one’s own thoughts which are understood as the speech of someone else. This happens because of distorted function of frontotemporal efferents. These parts of brain are known for their sensorial region activation in the brain and also for the identification and perception of triggers that arise in a person. Furthermore, and increased activity of Wernicke’s region, right putamen, thalamus, and nucleus caudatus was also noticed. During the events of audioverbalhallucinations increased activity of Broca’s region and dorsal cortex of gyrus cinguli were noticed. Subcortical structures might also be the reason or the regulating part of the brain responsiblefor the manifestation of hallucinations which originate in the cortex. Visual hallucinations appear after triggering the primary or associational visual cortex, deafferetion mechanism, when there is some sort of damage to the periferial or central parts of nervous system responsible for visual perceptions. In addition, sleep and wakefulness cycles might be unbalanced and there can be some cognitive disorders.",

In the absence of serious pathologic findings (e.g. fracture, tumor, instability), serious reported disability is usually associated with psychological, social or neurophysiological comorbidities. The presence of multiple chronic pain problems, psychological distress, compensation disputes and substance abuse disorders frequently complicate the treatment of this condition and are associated with a prolonged clinical course. Specific spinal treatments are most effective when clear pathological causes are found. Treatment efforts directed at the whole person with a cognitive behavioral approach are most effective in patients in whom only common degenerative changes are found and comorbid psychosocial or pain processes are found.",

ME describes a syndrome where there is general muscle pain associated with evidence of a disturbed nervous system [2]. ME, commonly referred to as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), or post-viral fatigue syndrome is a condition in which mental and physical fatigue predominate. It is characterized by gross abnormal muscle fatigue which occurs after relatively mild activity. Other symptoms regularly complained of include sleep disturbance, headaches, cognitive dysfunction, feeling depressed, bouts of low grade fever (not exceeding 38-6°C), increased sensitivity to light, back and neck pain, sore throat, irritable bowel and bladder [3]. The symptoms of ME typically become apparent following a viral infection [4], although other trigger factors have been noted. Vaccinations against cholera, tetanus, typhoid and influenza have been associated with the onset of ME [5]. It has also been observed that any psychological disturbances in ME occur secondary to, or share a common pathophysiology with an immunological dysfunction [6]. In many cases there appears to be no apparent triggering factor [7].",

In extreme circumstances, people can begin to fear that other people are plotting to harm them, and some of us even take our own lives. While it is overwhelmingly true that traumatic experiences or on-going deprivation or abuse are possible factors that contribute to psychological problems, there remains an apparent capriciousness to mental health problems. Some people seem to rise above trauma; other people are plagued by great misery without obvious external causes. There is a tendency to explain these differences as reflecting personal, even biological, vulnerabilities.

Common disorders that are classified as externalizing behavior disorders are attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiance disorder (ODD), and conduct disorder (CD). The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) resource is updated regularly, provides symptoms, signs, treatments, and characteristics, and is used throughout the United States and beyond. ADHD is classified with either predominately inattention or predominately hyper-activity and impulsivity. ODD is another externalizing behavior disorder. According to the DSM-5, this disorder is classified as externalizing because it manifests in behaviors that \"violate the rights of others and/or bring the individual into significant conflict with societal norms or authority figures\". Unlike other disorders, CD is difficult to treat, so the emphasis must be on proactive strategies and prevention.",

The paper focuses on cluster B, which is characterized by personality styles that are impulsive, dramatic, highly emotional, and erratic.Cluster B disorders include antisocial personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, and borderline personality disorder.The paper mainly discusses antisocial and narcissistic personality disorder.A person with antisocial personality disorder continuously violates the rights of others; often lies, fights, and has problems with the law; he or she can be deceitful and manipulative to gain profit or pleasure, and the patient lacks feelings for others and remorse over misdeeds.And people with narcissistic personality disorder have an overinflated and unjustified sense of self-importance and are preoccupied with fantasies of success.They believe they are entitled to special treatment from others, take advantage of others, and lack empathy.Case studies involved in the following paper will give authentic examples to demonstrate the specific symptoms of those disorders.Based on the features of being hard to communicate with, lacking remorse, tending to be violent, and being difficult to realize that they need psychological or medical help, patients with cluster B disorders are difficult to be treated.Although some treatments are developed and used to treat those disorders, few of them are effective and qualified.Hence, the paper contains studies and experiments that aim to question and qualify the effect and efficiency of specific treatment of Cluster B disorders.The future development of the treatment of Cluster B disorders is also expected in the last part of the paper.",

Any part of the body can be involved, especially when fibromyalgia is induced or aggravated by multiple factors. Complaints can be subjective and hard to verify or quantify. They consist of symptoms, or expressions of what is bothersome, and signs. Physical signs are observed during a physical examination, such as a rash or an irregular heartbeat, and are easier to validate. Constitutional symptoms or signs are generalized and do not belong to any specific organ system or region of the body. Generalized fatigue is a prominent feature of fibromyalgia. Between 60 and 80 percent of fibromyalgia patients complain of fatigue, which is defined as physical or mental exhaustion or weariness. However, there are many reasons for fatigue. In a recent survey, 20 percent of the women in the United States and 14 percent of the men rated themselves as being significantly fatigued. This feeling can come on like a wave or be continuous.",

      "abstract": "One cannot visit the wards of an asylum without realising that there are many types of mental disease, each with its own symptoms and physical signs, and that intercurrent and overlapping affections of the mind are especially common; thus, in maniacal excitement you may find delusions, in paranoia you find delusions with marked impairment of judgment, in general paralysis you get, in addition to physical signs, delusions, which vary from the facility of the early period to the more difficult mentation found in the advanced age, so that here we have three distinct types of disease, each of which may have delusions, and the delusions may all be of the exalted variety— the patients may consider themselves gods, kings, or mighty personages. The progress of research has had more difficulties to contend with in the subject of mind than in almost any other. It is a subject which is intangible, yet its reactions can be timed. It is unseen, yet its force can manifest itself in various ways through various channels, and it is even possible to transfer it from one person to another if the medium is so constituted, as in hypnotism, thought transference, and similar phenomena. It may occur to you to ask why has the subject of insane movement and obsession been chosen for this paper; well, gentlemen, for some years it has been my lot to witness, on my daily round of the wards, grotesque movements, antics and pantomimic display by patients, which, were they not interesting as symptoms and physical signs of nervous disease, might otherwise be depressing because of their meaninglessness. About three years ago, however, I had my attention drawn to a woman who seemed engaged in making movements, the precise character of which I had not read of or seen before in any asylum. I shall show you this patient making these movements by means of the cinematograph. We would have brought her here only she obstinately refuses to operate when watched, and it was necessary to have the cinematograph pictures focussed through a partly open window when she least suspected observation. Gentlemen, we are well acquainted with such terms as insane acts, insane expression, insane language, insane conduct, and insane movements.",

      "abstract": "Summary This paper explores the inter-relationships between impairment and disability in a sample of 119 teenagers in relation to their psychological adjustment and quality of social life. Poor psychological adjustment and extreme social isolation are associated not so much with individual functional limitations as with particular configurations of impairments and disabilities. It seems that social handicap is not a direct consequence of any impairment or disability but arises generally from severe functional loss and is shaped by dependency on others, restricted choices, physical barriers and adverse reactions of others.",

      "abstract": "The concept of depression includes clinical conditions whose main disorder concerns mood or affect. Traditionally, this group includes depressive disorders, mania and submaniacal states, and anxiety disorders. A light form of depression is often unrecognized. The person feels chronic fatigue, weariness and discouragement to life. Depression caused by reactive factors is manifested by a smaller number of psychosomatic symptoms. According to the WHO (World Health Organization) report, by 2020 depression may become the second largest health risk after cardiovascular disease. The clinical picture of depression is dominated primarily by the depressed mood, which is felt by the patient as a state of gloom, resignation, and sadness. The patient is unable to experience joy, happiness and satisfaction. Anhedonia appears, or inability to feel any pleasures. A separate problem is the recognition of depression in the elderly age, when symptoms characteristic to depression are very often considered a normal manifestation of the body aging or as an inherent element of the somatic disease. Currently, it is estimated that as many as 40% of cases of depression in people over 65 remain undiagnosed.",

The patient in depression displays a state of pseudodementia when he is regarded as having senile dementia by the people around him. The depressed patient falls into delirium when he is embarrassed by an unexpected situation. In other words, the patient shows pseudodementia when he is continuously out of the world of daily meaning; he would fall into a disturbance of consciousness when he is suddenly put out of the world of meanings. This principle is applicable not only to depression but also to all mental diseases. In mental diseases, the symptoms themselves have some meaning for the patient. However, when the patient is put out of the world of ordinary meaning, mental disease presents the aspect of a somatic disease such as dementia or disturbance of consciousness.",

In individuals with suicidal intent there is a strong narcissistic component integrated into the personality that is unable to accept defeat or combat reverses. In these individuals the ego becomes befuddled and as a result the libidinal drive is blocked. The result of this is destruction. The manner in which this destruction is carried out depends upon whether someone has wronged the individual or he has wronged himself. When it is the latter the act is generally carried out more or less quietly, whereas when it is the former it is carried out more dramatically and openly.

PTSD has not been demonstrated to represent a unified construct such as that established for other validated psychiatric disorders identified in this text, but a developing knowledge base for PTSD is promising for future validation of this diagnosis. PTSD is an unusual diagnosis because of the conditional nature of this disorder that requires exposure to a traumatic event for consideration of the diagnosis. Individuals who have not been exposed to a traumatic event cannot meet criteria for PTSD. This feature of PTSD has created difficulties in applying this diagnosis in both clinical and research settings.",

The grieving process is usually divided in five different stages, but in most cases presents a benign course, with decreased suffering and better adaptation to the new context. However, when high levels of emotional suffering or disability persist over a long time period, it becomes a case of complicated grief (CG), which should be adequately addressed. Objectives To review the characteristics of CG, the evidence that supports it as an individual pathological entity, and its place in current classification systems. Methods We performed a bibliographic search in Pubmed and PsychInfo, of articles written in English, Portuguese and Spanish, containing the key words: grief, bereavement, psychiatry, classification. Results The main issue regarding grief is the degree to which it is reasonable to interfere with a usually benign process. Since DSM-III bereavement has been referred to as an adaptive reaction to an important loss, which should not be diagnosed as major depressive disorder or adjustment disorder. However, DSM-5 has stated persistent complex bereavement disorder as an independent entity. In fact, CG fulfils the general criteria of every psychiatric syndrome, namely regarding specific diagnosis criteria, differential diagnosis from depressive disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder, and improvement with adequate treatment. Conclusion It is important to correctly approach CG, since it presents with characteristic diagnosis features and much improvement may be achieved once adequate treatment is provided.

Every strongly relevant individual concern, like fears, can yield cognitive bias or \"cognitive-emotional sensitization\". It might also be present for bodily and environmental information related to illness, and could be an etiological factor in medically unexplained complaints. Physiological and cognitive sensitization are theoretically compared. There is evidence for cognitive-emotional sensitization in some medically unexplained somatic complaints, and negative affect is suggested as a catalyst. Prolonged cognitive-emotional sensitization (\"perseverative negative cognition\" or worry, rumination) might even have demonstrable somatic pathological effects. It is concluded that sensitization may be organized at different levels, both in the organism and in the larger living system within which the organism is subsumed. This view might not only help to clarify medically unexplained pain syndromes, but virtually every subjective complaint, both with and without recognized physiopathology.",

The diagnostic definitions of GAD in various manuals, including ICD-10 and DSM-III/IV, differ in quality, number of symptoms, time frames and exclusion criteria. Consequently, lifetime prevalence rates vary between 1.2 and 6.4% in epidemiological surveys (). Although the diagnostic reliability of GAD is comparatively low, the features constituting the diagnostic criteria have been noted to be reliable (). A study that compared the distribution of somatic symptoms associated with GAD in patients with \"pure\" GAD and patients with GAD plus comorbid current or lifetime psychiatric diagnoses showed that GAD is a distinct disorder that is relatively consistent in presentation in patients with or without other psychiatric disorders (). The hypothesis of the existence of distinct subtypes of GAD, i.e. a \"pure\" GAD and a \"secondary\" type with comorbid disorder, representing possibly a prodromal/residual state or an epiphenomenon associated with another disorder, was therefore not confirmed.",

      "abstract": "A deficiencia visual e um fenomeno ao qual pessoas estao sujeitas. Entre outros, fatores como o envelhecimento podem levar a este acometimento. No Brasil, a deficiencia visual tem crescido, uma vez que e derivada de condicoes como deficiencia de vitamina A no sangue, ou doencas como diabetes. Acidentes graves tambem sao propiciadores da perda visual. Deficiencia em um importante sentido como a visao leva a pessoa a reconfiguracao da autoimagem, assim como a reestruturacao de seus papeis sociais, resultando em uma transicao psicossocial similar a de uma pessoa que perde um ente querido. Estudos recentes ressaltam que o luto e uma reacao esperada para diversos tipos de perda, conferindo ao luto um carater oscilatorio, no qual o enlutado transita entre ficar voltado para a perda sofrida, ou para o enfrentamento dela. Tal compreensao do carater oscilatorio confere ao luto caracteristicas peculiares a cada experiencia de enlutamento. Quando nao se confere ao enlutado o direito de expressar de sua propria maneira e em seu tempo tais singularidades, corre-se o risco de faze-lo passar por uma experiencia de luto nao reconhecido, podendo este ser um sofrimento adicional aquele ja vivido pela pessoa que enfrenta a dor de um evento estressor. O objetivo deste trabalho foi investigar o luto nao reconhecido vivido na experiencia da perda da visao. O metodo utilizado foi o Estudo de Caso clinico, aprofundando-se na historia de vida da pessoa. A coleta de dados foi feita a partir da transcricao e analise tematica da fala do participante. Encontrou-se apos a perda da visao uma experiencia de enlutamento, e pode-se estabelecer categorias que ajudaram a identificar fatores como preconceito e estigma social, barreiras ambientais e falta de compreensao acerca da deficiencia visual, que contribuem para a orientacao voltada para a perda. Fatores como apoio familiar e social, espiritualidade, rituais e a dinâmica posterior a perda contribuem para o enfrentamento e restauracao, identificando-se um processo de luto reativo a perda da visao, sem que haja um luto complicado",

The AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fourth Edition, defines two specific personality disorders, in addition to an eleventh condition, Personality Disorder Not Otherwise Specified. Cluster A personality disorders include paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal personalities; of these, Paranoid Personality Disorder probably is most common in the legal arena. Cluster B personality disorders include antisocial, borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic personality. Such people may suffer from frantic efforts to avoid perceived abandonment, patterns of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships, an identity disturbance, and impulsivity. Legal issues that involve individuals with cluster B personality disorders often involve determination of causation of the person's problems, assessment of claims of harassment, and assessment of the person's fitness for employment. Cluster C personality disorders include avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive personality. Two case histories illustrate some of the complexities of assessing impairment in workers with personality disorders, including drug abuse, hospitalizations, and inpatient and outpatient psychotherapy.",

      "title": "Suffering and the Dying Patient",
      "abstract": "SUMMARYSuffering in the dying patient derives from immediate sources of physical distress, perceived threats to the integrity of the self, and the psychological make up (memory, beliefs, expectations) of the individual at the end of life. The most common causes of somatic distress in dying patients with cancer are: (1) pain, (2) shortness of breath, and (3) nausea and/or vomiting. Other noteworthy problems include confusion, restlessness, itch, disturbed bladder and bowel function, sleep disruption, low energy, sedation and cachexia. Specific physiological mechanisms foster suffering in dying persons. These include tissue trauma, visceral distention and cardiovascular events. Neurological signals generated by tissue trauma or sensitization during inflammation lead to sensations of pain and also produce emotional arousal in noradrenergically innervated limbic brain structures. In addition, such signals stimulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. This creates a stress response which, if prolonged, disturbs circadian and ultracadian biological rhythms. One can direct preventative and palliative interventions toward such mechanisms. Patients also suffer because of unmet psychological needs or psychosocial problems. Identifying such needs or problems and addressing them can often contribute substantially to patient comfort. Since we have the resources to prevent or largely alleviate pain and other distressing conditions in the majority of cases, and care providers can meet most patients' psychological needs once they identify them, unaddressed suffering need not accompany death from cancer or other prolonged disease.",

      "title": "Different Childhood Adversities Are Associated with Different Symptom Patterns in Adulthood",
      "abstract": "A history of childhood adversities has been associated with the pathogenesis of several psychiatric conditions: major depressive disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, eating disorders, alcohol/substance dependence, personality disorders [1]. It has therefore been suggested that childhood traumata might be a non-specific risk factor for psychopathology [2].This is in contrast to most psychological models, that postulated a certain specificity between the kind of childhood trauma, the attachment style and adult psychopathology [e.g. [3]].Few studies have dealt with this issue on empirical grounds. It has been reported that patients with a history of maltreatment exhibit greater severity, higher comorbidity, greater risk for suicide and poorer treatment response compared with non-maltreated patients with the same diagnoses [4].Emotional neglect during childhood was reported to be associated with depression, dysthymia and social phobia and with the anhedonic symptoms of depression, whereas sexual abuse in the past was associated with anxious arousal and general distress [5,6].As these findings are scant and not fully consistent, we decided to study the effects of early traumata on adult psychopathology, exploring the hypothesis that different adversities might be associated with different symptom patterns.Operational diagnoses, with their high rate of comorbidity and lack of specificity, might not be an adequate way to explore this topic. It is conceivable that different types of early adversities might produce symptom patterns that range transdiagnostically. Since to our knowledge no study has systematically explored this hypothesis, we assessed the relationship between early adversities (loss, neglect and abuse) and symptoms in a representative sample of psychiatric patients according to a transnosographic perspective.During the period November to December 2010 it was possible to contact and interview 409 consecutive patients admitted, within 1 week of the interview, to all the psychiatric in- and outpatient facilities of Tuscany. A group of 200 people randomly drawn from the general population living in the same catchment area and matched with the psychiatric cases for age, gender and education made up the controls.The adversities of childhood/adolescence were studied by the Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse Questionnaire (CECA-Q [7]) and by an interview for early trauma widely used in the past [8]. For the purpose of this study early adversities were evaluated as follows: (a) presence of a loss event whenever a death or separation (for 1 year or more) from parents was reported; (b) presence of sexual abuse or physical abuse when the CECA-Q or the interview showed the occurrence of physical and/or sexual abuse; (c) the presence of neglect was based on the CECA-Q scores in the scales 'Mother's Neglect' and 'Father's Neglect' using the proposed cut-off [7].DSM-IV diagnoses were made using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders [9]. The symptoms were assessed independently of the diagnoses: the items of several well-known rating scales, combined in a single fully validated instrument [8], were used.Compared with controls, patients as a whole showed an excess of all early life events (below statistical significance only in the case of loss; p value used <0.05). When the patients were divided according to their DSM-IV diagnoses (only diagnoses with at least 30 cases were considered), almost all the main diagnostic groups showed a significantly higher rate of abuse and neglect compared with the control group. An excess of loss events was generally reported, but the significance level was attained only by non-affective psychosis, bipolar disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. When the diagnostic categories were compared with each other, no significant difference was found.The psychiatric symptoms of the patients who reported the occurrence of no adversity during childhood/early adolescence were compared with those of the cases who reported loss, neglect, sexual abuse or physical abuse. Of the 54 symptoms shown by at least 10% of cases, 17 bore significant associations with early adversities. Six maintained the significance (p < 0.001) after Bonferroni correction.Compared with patients with no early adversity, the patients reporting neglect were characterized by an excess of early awakening [odds ratio, OR (95% confidence interval, 95% CI) = 1.86 (1.06-3.30)], hyporexia [OR (95% CI) = 2.05 (1.13-3.70)], eating restrictions [OR (95% CI) = 2.87 (1.16-7.06)], suicidal ideation/attempts [OR (95% CI) = 1.83 (1.03-3.53)], decreased sexual desire [OR (95% CI) = 2.09 (1.17-3.74)] and sexual activity [OR (95% CI) = 1.91 (1.08-3.38)], mood-congruent delusions [OR (95% CI) = 2.61 (1.04-6.50)], and a previous history of hyperthymia [OR (95% CI) = 1.87 (1.03-3.38)].Sexual abuse was associated with night terror [OR (95% CI) = 2.46 (1.03-5.69)], recurrent nightmares [OR (95% CI) = 1.99 (1.02-3.91)], intrusive memories [OR (95% CI) = 2.96 (1.05-8.34)] and flashbacks of the event [OR (95% CI) = 3.4 (1.16-9.92)], aggressive impulses [OR (95% CI) = 2.96 (1.51-5.82)], hyporexia [OR (95% CI) = 1.99 (1.02-3.91)], binge eating [OR (95% CI) = 2.18 (1.07-4.42)], eating restrictions [OR (95% CI) = 3 (1.02-8)], suicidal ideation/attempts [OR (95% CI) = 2.04 (1.21-4.76)], decreased sexual desire [OR (95% CI) = 2.43 (1.22-4.83)], mood-congruent delusions [OR (95% CI) = 3.41 (1.03-8.96)], and a past history of substance abuse [OR (95% CI) = 3.02 (1.39-6.82)].Physical abuse bore significant associations with eating restrictions [OR (95% CI) = 3.09 (1.27-7.51)], recurrent nightmares [OR (95% CI) = 3.19 (1.11-9.14)], intrusive memories [OR (95% CI) = 2.63 (1.01-6.84)], decreased sexual desire [OR (95% CI) = 1.9 (1.07-3.67)] and a past history of substance abuse [OR (95% CI) = 2.25 (1.05-4.8)].Loss of parents was associated with a significantly increased risk of having weight loss [OR (95% CI) = 2.54 (1.37-4.59)] and grandiose thoughts [OR (95% CI) = 3.38 (1.54-7.42)].As the symptoms had some level of reciprocal association and the early life events also were not independent of each other, we adopted the stepwise forward conditional method of regression for controlling the multicollinearity. The adjusted ORs confirmed that each type of early adversity was associated with a specific symptom pattern (table 1).A huge number of previous studies already reported that early adversities differentiate psychiatric patients and controls, but failed to distinguish among specific DSM-IV diagnoses [1,2]. The well-known heterogeneity of DSM diagnoses and the high level of comorbidity can account for this. For this reason we chose the 'functional' approach proposed by Van Praag [10] and indeed in the present study early adversities seem to influence differentially specific symptom profiles rather than diagnoses.Retrospective recall may obviously bias the assessment of early adversities. However, the excess of even those early adversities that are reliably retrieved, such as death of parents, renders plausible that also the more subjective accounts retain a sufficient amount of credibility.The present study is one of the first yielding empirical evidence supporting the common psychotherapeutic position that different early adversities are associated with different adult clinical states. While these associations do not warrant a causal link, they suggest that the topic merits being studied from different perspectives rather than by adopting a purely nosological approach.",

In order to effectively treat someone, a clinician has to trust the patient’s reports of their symptoms, relevant experiences, medical history, and so on. Many psychiatric symptoms do not have physical markers that can be verified by clinical testing, and thus psychiatrists have to accept more on trust than clinicians treating somatic illnesses. However, many psychiatric diagnoses are stereotypically associated with traits that indicate untrustworthiness (such as irrationality). In this chapter, I illustrate how psychiatric labels can signal stereotypes of untrustworthiness, and how this can have repercussions in clinical contexts. In particular, I show how perceptions of untrustworthiness cause epistemic injustices by unfairly reducing the perceived epistemic credibility of patients with psychiatric conditions.",

      "abstract": "Pain has been defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as “an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.”106 Pain is the most common reason a patient presents to a physician for evaluation.80, 81 As expected, this physician is rarely a psychiatrist. If the patient suffers from chronic pain, defined by Bonica12 as pain persisting on a daily basis for a month beyond what would be considered the usual time for healing of underlying pathology, then many specialists are commonly involved in the care of the patient. The psychiatrist offers special skills in the care of patients with chronic pain. First, the psychiatrist is the examiner of mental life composed of thoughts, feelings, and actions. Patients with chronic pain suffer from depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric conditions often not recognized or, when recognized, undertreated. The psychiatrist possesses the expertise in making these diagnoses and providing treatment for them. When a complete evaluation of the individual patient is not performed, the opportunity for making a diagnosis is lost, and the patient's suffering cannot be optimally treated. Second, as a result of caring for patients with mental disorders, the psychiatrist is the keeper of a specialized fund of knowledge. It is this specialized fund of knowledge about the conditions psychiatrists treat and not the fundamental methods they use in clinical practice that distinguishes psychiatrists from other medical specialists. Psychiatrists follow the same process of evaluating a patient as other physicians. Psychiatrists then offer the opportunity of innovative applications of their psychiatric knowledge, especially to the treatment-resistant chronic pain syndromes. This application helps to reintegrate psychiatry with the other specialties of medicine. These two skills define the role of psychiatrists in the treatment of patients, and subsequently how they can make a substantial contribution to the management of chronic pain. Chronic pain as a field of study has grown considerably. Many individuals now are attempting to define pain management as a separate medical specialty. Although it is impossible to review this entire literature, several advances are especially relevant to psychiatry. Psychiatrists need to understand that in addition to providing treatment for the psychiatric disorders accompanying chronic pain, they can apply psychological and pharmacologic methods to the primary treatment of chronic pain. The multidisciplinary, integrated treatment model of chronic pain is particularly suited to use by the psychiatrist who examines the entire person and not just a particular organ system. As a result, psychiatrists offer the opportunity to provide assistance to other health care providers who are managing patients with this difficult problem.",

      "abstract": "A dysmorphism is difference in a body structure. If the dysmorphia is truly the only abnormality that you see in the child, further evaluation is often unnecessary. Isolated dysmorphisms are typically caused by malformation (abnormal tissue development), deformation (distortion caused by a mechanic force), disruption (destruction of a normal forming structure), or dysplasia (anomaly of growth and differentiation). A patient with multiple dysmorphisms, however, typically requires further workup to arrive at the cause, which could be chromosomal, genetic, or environmental such as in utero exposure to teratogen or infection. 1 Making the diagnosis relies on recognizing the pattern of dysmorphisms. The 4 major patterns to consider are the following 2 : Association: Physical features that often occur together more often than would be seen by chance alone, but no single etiology is yet known to explain the pattern. Vertebral anomalies, anal atresia, cardiac defects, trachea esophageal fistula, renal anomalies, and limb anomalies (VACTERL) are examples of associations with no unifying etiology. Sequence: A group of defects that stem from a sequential set of events that began with one malformation. An example is Potter sequence with renal agenesis resulting in no fetal urine production, which leads to severe oligohydramnios with the consequences of lung hypoplasia and intrauterine constraint that cause limb deformities and compressed facial features. Syndrome: A cluster of anomalies that occur in a consistent pattern that has a unifying cause, known or unknown. Developmental field defect: A group of malformations caused by harm to a particular region of the embryo. An example is hemifacial microsomia, unilateral facial hypoplasia, and ear anomalies that come from anomalous development of the first and second brachial arch structures.",

Significant mood/emotional disturbances include depression, anxiety, emotional incontinence, anger/aggression, and psychosis. Unfortunately, these emotional disturbances are not apparent and often unnoticed by busy clinicians. Their phenomenology, predicting factors, and pathophysiology have been under-recognized and under-studied. In addition, well-designed clinical trials regarding these symptoms are rare. These mood and emotional disturbances may be treated or prevented by various methods, including pharmacological therapy. To administer the appropriate therapy, we must understand the phenomenology and the similarities and differences in the pathophysiological mechanisms associated with these emotional symptoms. This narrative review will describe some of the most common or relevant posttumor mood and emotional disturbances. The phenomenology, factors or predictors, relevant lesion locations, and pharmacological treatment will be described.",

      "abstract": "Physical activity is an important public health tool used in the treatment and prevention of various physical diseases, as well as in the treatment of some psychiatric diseases such as depressive and anxiety disorders. However, studies have shown that in addition to its beneficial effects, physical activity can also be associated with impaired mental health, being related to disturbances like \"excessive exercise\" and \"overtraining syndrome\". Although the number of reports of the effects of physical activity on mental health is steadily increasing, these studies have not yet identified the mechanisms involved in the benefits and dangers to mental health associated with exercise. This article reviews the information available regarding the relationship between physical activity and mental health, specifically addressing the association between exercise and mood. A atividade física é, por seus efeitos no tratamento e na prevenção de várias patologias, um importante instrumento de saúde pública, sendo útil, inclusive, no tratamento de doenças psiquiátricas como transtornos depressivos e ansiosos. Todavia, além dos benefícios, a atividade física também está associada a prejuízos para a saúde mental, aparecendo ligada a quadros como \"exercício excessivo\" e \"síndrome de 'overtraining'\", segundo alguns estudos. Trabalhos sobre os efeitos de atividade física na saúde mental vêm se tornando mais comuns, no entanto ainda não permitem um conhecimento maior sobre os mecanismos implicados nos benefícios e malefícios associados a este tipo de atividade.

The usual environmental and psychological factors that influence maturation are modified by the attitudes of other persons toward the disabled one and by his own attitudes toward his defects and the limitations which they impose upon him. During the first few formative years, the normal child develops increasing physical independence as his motility and equilibrium patterns mature, enabling him to erect himself against gravity and to locomote independently. This growing capability is paralleled by the ego development and the appreciation of body image concept. The development of speech is a major step in communication and greatly facilitates the child's contact with his environment. The alteration of these patterns of maturation by central or peripheral neuromuscular disorders may influence profoundly the individual's personality. This results from the anxiety",

      "abstract": "Although a universally accepted definition is lacking, mild traumatic brain injury and concussion are classified by transient loss of consciousness, amnesia, altered mental status, a Glasgow Coma Score of 13 to 15, and focal neurologic deficits following an acute closed head injury. Most patients recover quickly, with a predictable clinical course of recovery within the first one to two weeks following traumatic brain injury. Persistent physical, cognitive, or behavioral postconcussive symptoms may be noted in 5 to 20 percent of persons who have mild traumatic brain injury. Physical symptoms include headaches, dizziness, and nausea, and changes in coordination, balance, appetite, sleep, vision, and hearing. Cognitive and behavioral symptoms include fatigue, anxiety, depression, and irritability, and problems with memory, concentration and decision making. Women, older adults, less educated persons, and those with a previous mental health diagnosis are more likely to have persistent symptoms. The diagnostic workup for subacute to chronic mild traumatic brain injury focuses on the history and physical examination, with continuing observation for the development of red flags such as the progression of physical, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms, seizure, progressive vomiting, and altered mental status. Early patient and family education should include information on diagnosis and prognosis, symptoms, and further injury prevention. Symptom-specific treatment, gradual return to activity, and multidisciplinary coordination of care lead to the best outcomes. Psychiatric and medical comorbidities, psychosocial issues, and legal or compensatory incentives should be explored in patients resistant to treatment.",

It starts because\r\nof a developmental mistake in an early dyadic relationship with the first important object. It is\r\na reaction to rejection, or to real or imaginary danger of losing that object. Complications\r\nduring the self structuring lead to lasting narcissistic sensitivity and a tendency to shame.\r\nShame hurts more than guilt because the whole self is subjected to a negative assessment, not\r\njust inadequate behavior. It is one of the main narcissistic affects. It exists in either open or hidden form. Narcissistic patients often suffer from overwhelming, conscious or unconscious\r\nchronic shame.

Results Hallucinations should be evaluated according to: type, onset and evolution, association with physical and /or neurological symptoms, association with other hallucinations and/or other psychopathology, characteristics. Auditory hallucinations may present along a continuum from tinnitus, simple, verbal, musical. The Pubmed search retrieved articles pertaining to auditory hallucinations associated with: 1.

      "title": "Behavioral And Psychological Symptoms In Dementia",
      "abstract": "Dementia is the colloquial term that denotes the nosological distinction of major neurocognitive disorder in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5 edition (DSM 5). Dementia refers to a collection of symptoms stemming from a broad array of etiologies precipitating in functionally impairing cognitive decline. While the presence of cognitive impairment is necessary and sufficient for a diagnosis of dementia, associated neuropsychiatric symptoms -known collectively as behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, or BPSD - are prevalent and can significantly impact the prognosis and management of dementia. For this reason, DSM 5 requires clinicians to specify whether BPSD is present and to specify the degree of severity; for example, a diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia might be coded as “major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease, with behavioral disturbances, severe.” BPSD includes emotional, perceptual, and behavioral disturbances that are similar to those seen in psychiatric disorders. It may be clinically useful to classify them into five domains: cognitive/perceptual (delusions, hallucinations), motor (e.g., pacing, wandering, repetitive movements, physical aggression), verbal (e.g., yelling, calling out, repetitive speech, verbal aggression), emotional (e.g., euphoria, depression, apathy, anxiety, irritability), and vegetative (disturbances in sleep and appetite).",

The standard diagnostic criteria often are not applicable since the neurological lesion may distort or even obliterate salient features of depression. Patients actually may deny being depressed or dysphoric, not have a depressive affect, or be totally unaware of abnormal vegetative behaviors. Furthermore, brain lesions themselves may produce striking behavioral alterations that can be mistakenly attributed to depression, or striking behavioral changes due to depression may be mistakenly attributed to the brain lesion. Based on five case studies, several clinical guidelines for recognizing and diagnosing depression in brain-damaged patients are offered. These cases also provide a data base to generate initial hypotheses about the neuroanatomical basis of the depressive syndrome.

X-rays commonly show age-related changes which have no association with LBP. History, physical examination, and spinal imaging can identify significant pathology, such as fracture or infection, but are not particularly helpful in identifying sources of pain. As there is no reliable means of permanently resolving pain from any spinal structure, it is more harmful than helpful to tell patients that they have discogenic, facet, or sacroiliac pain, as we do not know that such a statement is true, nor can we “fix” the problem. Fear and psychosocial stressors may amplify the perceived importance of identifying a “pain generator,” which is then tied to the expectation of a “cure.” A convenient but false biological narrative can lead to an extensive, wasteful, and potentially harmful search for that cure.",

      "abstract": "In addition to the disruptive impact of sport injury on physical functioning, injury can have psychological effects on athletes. Consistent with contemporary models of psychological response to sport injury, aspects of psychological functioning that can be affected by sport injury include pain, cognition, emotion, and behavior. Part of the fabric of sport and ubiquitous even among “healthy” athletes, pain is a common consequence of sport injury. Postinjury pain is typically of the acute variety and can be exacerbated, at least temporarily, by surgery and some rehabilitation activities. Cognitive responses to sport injury include appraising the implications of the injury for one’s well-being and ability to manage the injury, making attributions for injury occurrence, using cognitive coping strategies, perceiving benefits of injury, and experiencing intrusive injury-related thoughts and images, increased perception of injury risk, reduced self-esteem and self-confidence, and diminished neurocognitive performance. Emotional responses to sport injury tend to progress from a preponderance of negative emotions (e.g., anger, confusion, depression, disappointment, fear, frustration) shortly after injury occurrence to a more positive emotional profile over the course of rehabilitation. A wide variety of personal and situational factors have been found to predict postinjury emotions. In terms of postinjury behavior, athletes have reported initiating coping strategies such as living their lives as normally as possible, distracting themselves, seeking social support, isolating themselves from others, learning about their injuries, adhering to the rehabilitation program, pursuing interests outside sport, consuming alcohol, taking recreational and/or performance-enhancing substances, and, in rare cases, attempting suicide. Psychological readiness to return to sport after injury is an emerging concept that cuts across cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses to sport injury.",

The presence of abnormal behavior is often construed as a marker for ill being, indicating some adverse exposure to psychosocial stress. Abnormal behavior is any pattern of activity that differs from some standard. The ethological standard focuses on species-typical behaviors that have been shaped by natural selection. Abnormal behavior patterns are classified into four broad categories: stereotypic behaviors, which include locomotor, mouth-directed, and body-directed activities; dangerous self-directed behaviors that can cause tissue damage; affective behaviors indicative of abnormal mood states; and displacement activities. An association between painful disorders and the development of abnormal behavior has been noted in some animals.",

Although you can’t do anything about some of the causes and risk factors, you certainly can do a lot about others, particularly monitoring self-talk and “automatic” thoughts that put you in bad and discouraging moods (chapter 5). But that’s getting ahead of ourselves. First, we’ll explore specific causes of dysthymia and factors that make you especially vulnerable. Causes of Dysthymia There is no simple, single reason why some people develop persistent depression and others don’t. Dysthymia is caused by a variety of genetic, biological, psychosocial, and circumstantial factors. Although each person’s profile of risk factors is unique, dysthymia can be thought of as a biopsychosocial disorder, like other forms of depression.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The fatigue that arises from work manifests itself as a feeling of constant fatigue or weakness. It can be physical, mental, or a combination of both. The occurrence of fatigue is influenced by physical, mental and sensory loads, night work, psychological and physical factors of the working environment, personality characteristics of the worker. In order to speak with certainty about the impact of work on humans, one must determine precisely in each particular case what type of work it is. In this sense, the difference is made whether it is static or dynamic work. If the factors such as physical and psychological load act longer than the worker can tolerate, there is a psychophysiological overstretchand a state between normal physiological and pathological with a tendency to pass into the pathological form, i.e. disease. Acute and chronic fatigue of health care workers is very common. Given that every healthcare professional during his working life meets with numerous hazards and dangers, it is very important that they are recognized in a certain way, evaluated / ranked in order to pay special attention to these hazards and dangers that represent a potential threat to the safety and health of health workers. In this context, a study of health workers currently employed in the Kotor Health Center, Emergency Medical Service and Kotor General Hospital was conducted with the aim of establishing the connection between acute and chronic fatigue among medical workers with sociodemographic work and life characteristics of respondents. As for the methods in the process of collecting data from the respondents, two questionnaires were used, which the respondents themselves completed the OFER15 questionnaire and the general questionnaire. Based on the analysis of the data, it can be concluded that recovery, acute and chronic fatigue are significantly higher among the hospital medical workers, which corresponds to the number of working hours that is higher compared to the other population that was examined.",

The ubiquity of lying and others forms of deception suggests that they have \"normal\" aspects, but lying which is persistent or destructive to the quality of a person's life becomes pathological. Lying has many determinants, including developmental, biological, social, and psychodynamic. Antisocial, histrionic, narcissistic, borderline, and compulsive personalities have been associated with lying. The treatment of lying needs to be individualized according to the overall symptom complex in which it is embedded.",

It has clear genetic antecedents, which are shared across the spectrum of psychotic disorders; however, a range of other biological and social factors influence the onset and treatment of the disorder. Schizophrenia is diagnosed by a characteristic set of symptoms (positive, negative, disorganisation, cognitive and affective) accompanied by a functional decline. Investigations are used to exclude other organic causes of psychosis and to provide a baseline for the negative effects of pharmacological treatments. Treatment requires a combination of pharmacological and psychosocial interventions. Physical health is poor in this group of people and this is not helped by inconsistent care from health services. Although earlier intervention has improved the immediate outcomes, the longer-term outcome has not significantly shifted.",

We propose the following diagnostic criteria for PD, i.e., clinical criteria (resting tremor or at least two of the remaining cardinal features of PD), treatment criteria (good response to anti-parkinson drugs), image criteria (essentially normal cerebral MRI), and exclusion criteria (no history of encephalitis or exposure to parkinsonism-inducing substances or drugs).

The measurement of these symptoms is essential for understanding the individual and planning treatment. There are various instruments that have somatic symptoms measurement in their items. The tools have included somatic symptoms measurement in measuring general psychopathology, somatic symptoms as part of anxiety and depression, somatic symptoms specifically, and as a screening instrument for somatoform disorders. The advantages and disadvantages of common measures have been discussed. It appears that no one measure fulfils the essential criteria of an ideal measure for somatic symptoms. The measures of somatic symptoms should also be culturally sensitive and serve diagnostic, prognostic and heuristic purposes. These aspects are highlighted in the review.",

Patients also approach travel/tropical medicine specialists, \"experts\" in exotic parasites, even when a travel history does not exist. Patients are resistant to psychiatric referrals but typically go from one doctor to another. It is important to make sure that the patient does not have an organic skin disorder and the delusion is not secondary to another mental or physical illness. DP is considered a delusional disorder, somatic subtype, and treated with antipsychotic medication, with poor compliance and mixed outcomes. DP may also be understood as a chronic somatoform disorder (monosymptomatic hypochondriasis), in which some underlying emotional disturbance is expressed via physical symptoms. Treatment of the latter sometimes involves antiparasitic medication, stress reduction, and self-help techniques, as well as a family assessment.",

There are only individual patients complaining after injury to the head of headache, dizziness, fatigue, irritability, \"nervousness,\" impaired efficiency or other mental symptoms.

      "abstract": "La discapacidad intelectual (DI) o trastorno del desarrollo intelectual (TDI) es uno de los principales trastornos del neurodesarrollo y afecta al 2% de la poblacion, es decir, a mas de un millon de personas en Francia. Se caracteriza por una capacidad reducida para razonar y comprender informacion abstracta o compleja, que tiene un fuerte impacto en el aprendizaje escolar y limita la capacidad de adaptacion en la vida diaria, incluso en la edad adulta. La discapacidad intelectual, o discapacidad mental, es el resultado de una interaccion de la vulnerabilidad individual de una persona que tiene DI con su ecosistema, es decir, el entorno familiar, cultural o institucional que puede ser un obstaculo o un facilitador. La deteccion de un nino con una trayectoria de desarrollo inusual requiere un buen conocimiento del desarrollo psicomotor por parte de los profesionales. La DI puede estar aislada, pero tambien es muy frecuente que aparezca asociada a otros trastornos del neurodesarrollo, como autismo, trastornos motores o sensoriales (audicion, vision), trastornos graves del sueno, de la alimentacion, o patologias medicas como la epilepsia, o una amplia variedad de trastornos psicopatologicos como ansiedad, depresion y trastornos de la regulacion emocional. Las causas de la DI son multiples, y mas de una de cada dos veces son de origen genetico, existiendo varios centenares de enfermedades raras que pueden estar detras de su origen, pero es frecuente aun que sus causas sean desconocidas. La difusion de las nuevas tecnicas geneticas (secuenciacion de alto rendimiento) deberia reducir el numero de personas sin diagnosticar y devolver su lugar a un enfoque diagnostico razonado basado en la clinica. La evaluacion periodica y multidimensional de las competencias cognitivas, escolares, socioemocionales y adaptativas a lo largo de la vida permite comprender mejor el funcionamiento de las personas con una DI y prever estrategias adecuadas de aprendizaje, tratamiento, acompanamiento y apoyo para una mejor calidad de vida y participacion en la vida de la sociedad.",

Its point prevalence is believed to be in the range of 5–10%, with the lifetime prevalence being even higher. At least two subtypes of social phobia, discrete and generalized, are seen in clinical samples, with the latter subtype being associated with greater functional impairment. The onset of social phobia is early, usually preceding the onset of comorbid conditions such as major depression or alcohol use disorders. It thus represents a potential tar-gel for early intervention by those who seek to ameliorate the condition and thereby prevent secondary complications.",

      "abstract": "A 60-year-old, right-handed woman, with no focal brain lesions, suffered from a progressive impairment in recognising people of personal relevance and public figures familiar to her in the premorbid period. The patient did not suffer from general cognitive deterioration. There was no ecological or clear psychometric evidence of visuoperceptual or visuospatial deficits. Her defective person recognition was not overcome by extra-facial (e.g., observing animated people in their usual surroundings) or extra-visual information (e.g., listening to the voice). Moreover, presenting the correct name in the presence of an unrecognised familiar person failed to prompt her familiarity judgement, or retrieval of the relevant biographical knowledge. The patient also had some recognition difficulties with famous buildings and songs as well as with some common objects. It is argued that the patient's difficulty in identifying familiar people was the consequence of progressive loss of stored exemplars of familiar persons and perhaps also of some other \"unique items\" (famous songs and monuments) in an independent subsystem of semantics that we term \"exemplar semantics.\" We discuss the associative (semantic) nature and specificity of the deficit in person knowledge, the possible top-down negative influences of the loss of exemplars in the person recognition system, and the link between the disorders and the right/left temporal lobe.",

The state represents the acute stage of fear, anxiety and trauma and generally occurs in mental disorders, such as trauma- and stress-related disorders, but it can also manifest in healthy individuals as the initial trigger response, the point of mental dysregulation. The mental state of terror can be specified with the following parameters: (1) perceived loss of safety, (2) unpredictability and uncertainty, (3) intense consequent emotional reaction, (4) hypersensitivity to the trigger stimuli, and consequentially, (5) the outcome that can be either negative, such as resulting in developing a mental disorder, or positive, such as developing post-traumatic growth and resilience. Behavioural biases are also a for factor the development of the mental state of terror. The aim of this theoretical contribution is to define the mental state of terror in terms of cognitive factors, such as exposure to traumatic events and uncertainty of the environment for understanding the development of mental disorders within stress and trauma domains; highlight the importance of psychological resilience and social support.",

A tic is a sudden, rapid, repetitive, non-rhythmic movement (e.g. eye blinking) or vocalization (e.g. throat clearing). Tics are often described as semi-voluntary or 'unvoluntary', as, strictly speaking, they are neither voluntary nor involuntary, but may be experienced as a voluntary response to an unwanted distressing sensation called 'premonitory urge'. Premonitory urges are physical 'build-up' sensations to perform specific tics, which are perceived as suppressible yet irresistible, similar to the need to sneeze or scratch an itch. Patients often describe the need to tic as the mounting of inner tension, localized either to the body region where the tic is about to occur or throughout the body. Tic expression is typically associated with a transient sensation of relief.",

      "abstract": "Characteristic symptoms of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) are (muscle) weakness, muscle pain, cognitive deficits, neurological abnormalities, but above all post-exertional malaise: a long-lasting increase of symptoms after a minor exertion. In contrast, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is primarily defined by 鈥渃hronic fatigue鈥? Since 鈥渃hronic fatigue鈥?is not mandatory for the diagnosis ME, and post-exertional malaise and cognitive deficits are not obligatory for the diagnosis CFS, the case criteria for ME and CFS define two distinct, partly overlapping nosological entities. ME and CFS are considered to be enigmatic diseases, qualified by some authors as 鈥渕edically unexplained syndromes鈥?of 鈥渇unctional syndromes鈥? However, specific abnormalities consistently observed over the years and their direct and indirect sequels can plausibly explain characteristic symptoms, e.g. 鈥渆xhaustion鈥?and pain. Abnormalities established repetitively incorporate immunological aberrations (inflammation, immune activation, immunosuppression, and immune dysfunction), persistent and/or reactivating infections, gastro-intestinal dysbiosis, oxidative and nitrosative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, a (prolonged) deviant response to exertion and orthostatic stress, circulatory deficits, and neurological abnormalities.This article depicts the 4I hypothesis, an explanatory model for ME (CFS) with a central role for four types of immunological abnormalities: inflammation, (Th2-predominated) immune activation, immunosuppression, and immune dysfunction. The potential direct sequels of these abnormalities, e.g. increased oxidative and nitrosative stress, (reactivating or chronic) infections, and their possible indirect consequences, e.g. mitochondrial dysfunction, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) axis hypofunction, and cardiovascular dysregulation, can plausibly explain various distinctive symptoms of ME/CFS, e.g. 鈥渆xhaustion鈥?

Many people with personality disorder remain undetected in clinical practice and might be given treatments that are ineff ective or harmful as a result. Comorbidity with other mental disorders is common, and the presence of personality disorder often has a negative eff ect on course and treatment outcome.

If evidence of psychiatric disease arises during the medical examination, an additional expert advice should be obtained to differentiate between mild or reversible dysfunctions and severe or chronifying psychiatric diseases.

      "title": "Television: Fantastic Reality or Realistic Fantasy?",
      "abstract": "Delusions form a part of many dementing illnesses. They arise from the individual's defective or distorted appreciation of reality and the associated impairment of judgment. Often they are influenced by the emotional state, the environment and the previous personality. Systematization may occur or these may remain isolated events. Although television remains a valuable asset, not least to those using it as a social substitute, adverse reactions can occur. The induced delusions appear to develop in an elderly individual who has a dementia. As expected, the problem is not caused by program content, but by the individual's interpretation of those programs. These delusions may affect an individual's life, may influence a person's interindividual relations, and may have important financial and legal implications. Unless the origin of the delusion is recognized, its effective treatment is unlikely; the persistence of the delusion may cause distress both to the individual concerned and to his or her friends and carers. Accordingly, it is important to recognize the “deludogenic” influence of television as it has the exceptional advantage of being potentially curable with no known withdrawal effects. Finally, we also observed a new aspect of delusions: a reidentification syndrome. A television character's personality and behavior were transposed onto someone that the individual was very familiar with. The lag time between the program and the reidentification was only a few hours, but was very persistent. Admission to the relative haven of hospital does not necessarily protect the individual from the influence of television. Ward televisions often are permanently on and may be criticized for being principally for the benefit of the staff. This whole problem may worsen as technology advances: the development of alternative means of transmission and reception may engender greater variety and availability of programs as well as maximal use of airtime. Yet, it is conceivable that television could be used therapeutically, either to counter its own adverse effects or to act in a preemptive fashion. The extent of adverse reactions to television remains unknown and the implications may be vast. Recognition of the problem may prove difficult, but the treatment is simple, unassociated with any withdrawal reactions, and may be curative.",

Sin embargo, poco se sabe sobre los trastornos de comportamiento que presentan los adultos con dicho sindrome. Tras someter a uno de estos adultos a una bateria de pruebas psicologicas (DSM-IV-TR, MCMI-III y MMPI-2-RF, se puede afirmar que aparece un grave trastorno de personalidad no especificado o personalidad «mixta». Tales hallazgos sugieren que el discurso falsamente fluido, la estereotipa tematica o la perdida de categorias gramaticales pueden ser fruto de una tendencia a lo obsesivo-compulsivo, la hipomania, la hipocondria, la paranoia, la confusion mental, la esquizofrenia o la deseabilidad social elevada, entre otros muchos estados psicologicos alterados. El problema parece ser la imposibilidad de «leer» estados mentales ajenos y de actuar en consecuencia. Parece adecuado concluir que la paciente con sindrome de Williams no es capaz de adaptarse al mundo que la rodea desde la perspectiva de la teoria de la mente.",

      "abstract": "As it is well known, all living humans are subject to daily effects of stress; the stress response varies among individuals depending on the experience that has endowed each person to learn how to deal with stress. Stress relief may be obtained by procedures that lead the subject to “forget” the bad situation or to relax, for instance physical exercise, talking the problem to someone else, drinking alcoholic beverages or using drugs of abuse. Drug addiction develops in persons voluntarily seeking relief from a depressive situation, usually linked to personal catastrophic event, death of a dear family member or a valuable loss of personal belonging, or else also voluntarily aiming to a novel mood enhancing experience, in spite of being conscious of the unwanted effects – dependence – arising from repetitive drug taking, the most serious being addiction, a persistent state in which compulsive drug use escapes control. Addictive drugs besides providing a pleasant rewarding experience also generate reinforcing behaviors of the drug effects leading to tolerance, dependency compulsion, persistence, chronicity with multiple relapses and withdrawal syndrome. The compulsion and persistence are based on pathological molecular mechanisms similar to those involved in memory. Studies done both in humans and rodent models of addiction indicate that key behavior abnormalities associated with addiction are related to changes in the brain, both at molecular and cellular levels. The plastic changes in the dopaminergic VTA NAc pathway and the interconnected structures, also include changes in the gene transcription, RNA and protein processing and in synaptic structure. All the specific changes so far identified are not sufficiently long lasting to account for the behaviors associated with addiction.",

Patients complain of pain described as burning, associated with sensory, vasomotor, sudomotor, motor and/or trophic disorders. The pain appears disproportionate to the initial lesion. The diagnosis is purely clinical and based on the Budapest criteria. It is a diagnosis of exclusion. The pathophysiology is still poorly understood and is thought to be multifactorial. Several mechanisms have been described: an inflammatory state, an overactivation of the sympathetic autonomic nervous system and a poor perception of pain at the central level. The management of signs and symptoms is therefore global. It involves physiotherapy and occupational therapy, often combined with analgesic medications. Psychological treatment may be proposed in certain circumstances. The natural evolution is rather favourable.Le syndrome douloureux régional complexe constitue une entité clinique survenant habituellement suite à un traumatisme, une chirurgie ou un autre événement déclencheur.

When shame is avoided, pathological narcissism, counterfeit behaviour, hostility or violence may result. A move by a patient into a merged state with the therapist may, therefore, signal anxiety due to the presence of unconscious shame. The way that the therapist deals with the projected shame may be crucial to the outcome of the therapy. The situation may become an intractable \"shame-guilt cycle\" in which there is a repetition-compulsion, without insight, of an unconscious sado-masochistic relationship in the transference and countertransference. Defences against shame are manifestations of a wish to hide from oneself or from the seeing other. Whatever the sequence of cause and effect, shame and sexuality are closely associated. Shame undoubtedly plays a part in many, if not all, psychological disturbances and may be the most important factor in some.",

People with ID experience a different pattern of morbidity to the general population and die considerably younger than their counterparts without ID.1 Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by troubles with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behaviour. In both conditions, complex mental and physical health problems, as well as social issues, are common and are associated with communication difficulties that can result in maladaptive behavioural patterns (often referred to as ‘behaviour that challenges’). Ideally, all people presenting with behaviour that challenges should be assessed by a specialist multidisciplinary team (comprising psychiatrists, psychologists, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists) to develop an understanding of the behaviour and an appropriate support plan with tailored treatment strategies and specialist follow-up.2 Non-pharmacological interventions for challenging behaviour, such as positive behavioural support or cognitive–behavioural therapy and manipulation of environmental triggers, are preferred to psychotropic medication. However, antipsychotic medication is often prescribed to adults with ID and/or autism to manage behaviour that challenges in the absence of severe mental illness, despite there being little research evidence that antipsychotics are effective in this context.3 \n\nThere …",

Affective instability is often confused with mood lability, as in bipolar disorders, as well as with other terms. To clarify the concept, we searched databases for the termaffective instabilityand read related articles on the topic. In this article we situate the term within the current affective nomenclature and human emotional experience, explore its psychophysiological features, and place it within the context of psychopathology. We explain why the term can potentially be confused with mood pathology and then define affective instability as an inherited temperamental trait modulated by developmental experience.",

A variety of acquired insults may present with remarkably similar seizure syndromes that are age-specific and evolve with time. This evolution may be a consequence of the brain injury itself or an alteration of normal brain maturation due to an unfavorable electrical environment. Idiopathic epilepsies are now being correlated with specific gene defects, particularly those involving ion channels and/or neurotransmitter receptors. Despite this specificity, idiopathic seizure syndromes may be caused by mutations in different genes or different mutations in the same gene, and particular syndromes may manifest heterogeneous clinical seizure types. Not all localization-dependent epilepsies are symptomatic, as a growing number of genes have been identified with partial seizure syndromes. Febrile seizures probably do not represent a homogeneous entity, but multiple disorders that may be associated with developmental abnormalities and various coexisting seizure types.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatry is a speciality of medicine concerned with the diagnosis, treatment and study of mental diseases or disorders. Its practitioners are psychiatrists (in the United States, physicians who complete four years of approved training following their 148graduation from medical school). A number of professionals from other disciplines treat patients with psychiatric disorders. The most important of these are clinical psychologists, psychiatric social workers and psychiatric nurses. They commonly refer to those who seek help as 'clients' rather than 'patients'. These professionals may work in various collaborative relationships with psychiatrists or as independent practitioners. They employ the same verbal therapies as psychiatrists. Psychiatry differs from these specialities in being a medical discipline whose practitioners are physicians. As such, psychiatrists are specifically trained to (1) make precise syndromal or aetiological diagnoses, whenever possible, and distinguish one syndrome from another; (2) diagnose (or know when to refer to other physicians) those organic conditions which mimic psychiatric disorders such as brain tumour, cancer of the pancreas, and hyperthyroidism (these conditions can present as anxiety or depressive disorders); (3) treat particular psychiatric disorders with psychotropic medications or other somatic treatments; (4) manage untoward psychological reactions to medical illness; and (5) integrate the biological with the psychological and social dimensions of mental disorders. In addition, the psychiatrist's training in medicine may encourage a research career in the biology of mental disorders. American psychiatrists as a whole have a high level of expertise in psychological treatments, particularly the psychodynamic approach. This is due to the impact of psychoanalytic theory on academic psychiatry especially since 1945, when many distinguished psychoanalysts assumed the chairs of academic departments.",

      "title": "PSYCHIC TRAUMA IN PATHOGENESIS OF EXOPHTHALMIC GOITER*",
      "abstract": "The taking of a careful history in patients with exophthalmic goiter commonly yields three important facts: (1) Information to the effect that one or more blood relatives is or had been suffering with \"nervousness,\" exophthalmic goiter, or diabetes mellitus; (2) the patient has been of more or less \"nervous\" temperament, characterized by irritability, impatience, fractiousness, and emotionalism, usually since childhood; (3) the onset of the symptoms of the disease followed soon after the occurrence of a psychic trauma. From the frequency with which such histories are elicited,it appears that there is a strong congenital predisposition to the disease. Indeed, in quite a series of the cases herein reported, two, three, and even four members of a family have been afflicted with exophthalmic goiter. In the absence of an exciting cause, such a predisposition may not be recognizable nor tangibly mar the individual's physical and mental well-being throughout a normal span of existence. There are doubtless many thousands of individuals possessing a strong susceptibility to exophthalmic goiter who are going through life in an apparently normal manner, oblivious to possibilities which would likely follow the incidence of a psychic trauma.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder is the quintessential mind/body disorder that alters physiological, biological, and psychological homeostasis. People who have been traumatized often present with distressing and frequently intractable psychosomatic symptoms, often without knowing consciously that the source of their symptoms is the trauma they experienced. The stress response may be considered to exist along a continuum: eustress, stress, and traumatic stress. Traumatic stress precipitates a condition of physiological and psychobiological imbalance in the nervous system and in the endocrine, immune, and neuropeptide systems. Some evidence suggests that discrimination may constitute a stressor and contribute to a greater lifetime allostatic load. Conversely, social relationships mitigate the effects of allostatic load. This intersects with a new model of stress response called \"tend and befriend.\" Learned helplessness intersects with the central assertion of state-dependent memory, learning, and behavior: what we learn and remember is dependent on our psychophysiological state at the time of the experience.",

      "title": "THE ROLE OF THE PITUITARY GLAND IN EPILEPSY",
      "abstract": "The problem of epilepsy may be best approached by considering all convulsions which are accompanied by unconsciousness, whether periodic or otherwise, as symptoms of some underlying pathologic state or disease.By doing this the convulsion becomes a symptom.The question then arises, which I believe should be answered in the negative, whether any so-called epileptic state should, of itself, be con- sidered a disease. ETIOLOGIC FACTORSThus, among the underlying causes of convulsions are uremia, eclampsia and other toxicoses; several varieties of trauma, as birth trauma and that from blows on the head; certain intracranial irrita- tions, as brain tumors and cerebral hemorrhages; certain infections, as syphilis and varieties of meningitis; certain conditions of cerebral maldevelopment accompanied by a degree of brain cell deterioration; and certain conditions of the pituitary gland causing a change in its secretion.I believe, therefore, that convulsions, whether periodical and termed epilepsy, or not, are due to definite pathologic cerebral tissue changes which may be congenital or induced, and hence, that epilepsy is an organic and not a functional condition.In the toxic and pituitary cases there may exist previous malformation and instability of the cortical cells, or, on the other hand, it is perfectly conceivable that the toxic substance or the changed pituitary secretion may produce their own cortical cell deterioration.I published a paper on the relation of the pituitary gland to some cases of epilepsy, and in 19141 and again in 1916,2 a paper on the subject of hypopituitarism in its relation to epilepsy.These papers were the result of a personal suggestion of Dr. Harvey Cushing and also of the perusal of his most excellent book.",

      "abstract": "Symptoms of depression that are temporary or caused by physical illness can be difficult to differentiate from those that represent a depressive disorder. A diagnosis of depressive disorder depends on the underlying cause, and on the nature, severity and duration of symptoms. Management involves accurate diagnosis and treatment of medical illness, practical interventions to resolve concurrent family, social and economic stressors, and emotional support. Cognitive, behavioral and brief psychodynamic therapies may be helpful in selected cases. Antidepressants and electroconvulsive therapy have a role in the treatment of severe or persistent depression associated with suicidal behavior, marked psychomotor retardation, starvation or other life-threatening symptoms. Suicidal thoughts are frequent in older patients with concurrent major depression and chronic illness, and measures to ensure patient safety are a priority.",

Mental fatigue is a diffuse sensation of weariness; it is a functional state, one of several intermediate conditions between the two extremes of alarm and sleep. A neurophysiological model of fatigue, involving an activating and inhibitory system has been developed. Fatigue in industrial practice has clinical symptoms: psychic instability, fits of depression and increased liability to illness. Indicators of fatigue are work of performance, subjective feelings of fatigue, electroencephalography, flicker-fusion frequency and various psychomotor and mental tests.

AIM: To provide evidence in support of the view that suicidality is not only a symptom of other disorders or comorbid with them but is often a disorder in its own right. METHOD: We conducted a review of the literature. RESULTS: Suicidality manifests itself as a disorder in its own right without any one-to-one relationships with other psychiatric or somatic disorders or illnesses. CONCLUSION: Suicidality has specific features of its own such as susceptibility to interindividual contagion. By preventing suicide we may be able to forestall the development of other types of ill-health and thus improve the quality of the life that has been saved. Language: nl",

Depression and mania can be severe enough to produce hallucinations and delusions, but these and related phenomena are not necessary for a diagnosis of mood disorder. This dichotomy is dangerous because it influences you to not diagnose mood disorder when a patient is also psychotic. However, 20% of melancholic and 30%-50% of manic episodes are of psychotic severity, and if you understand the treatment needs of such patients their response to treatment is good.",

      "title": "[Induced abortion: shock and after-effects?].",
      "abstract": "It is generally agreed that the incidence of serious psychic side effects after abortion is very low. Most women undergoing abortion appear to experience nothing more than temporary depression that spontaneously resolves, and some surveys suggest that the psychic state may be improved under some circumstances after abortion. A minority of women, however, suffer considerably after abortion and their experiences, as elsewhere in psychopathology, shed light on the less obvious experience of other women. The author uses case studies to illuminate the dynamic and subconscious effects of abortion, which are revealed in attitudes, symptoms, or comments. Whether or not a woman seeks an abortion, the very fact of carrying an unwanted child can be enough to provoke psychic symptoms. If the partner abandons the woman because of her pregnancy, the blow may be even more strongly felt, resulting in a mixture of pain and aggression. The symptoms and the connection with a past abortion may remain unrecognized until a subsequent, desired pregnancy. Symptoms after an abortion may include frigidity, vaginismus, dyspareunia, pain, or poor tolerance of contraception desired at the conscious level. The manifestations are not specific and may occur after childbirth or at any other time. No matter how well accepted abortion seems to be by society, it is different from any other surgical procedure and it may therefore have some aftereffects. Social acceptance may provide some comfort but it is not enough to compensate for personal conflicts. Sometimes the conflict is expressed in the sexual relationship with the partner, who is considered responsible for the abortion. The effects of an abortion on a relationship depend in part of how satisfactory the relationship was before the pregnancy. Repeated requests for abortion may result from a woman's intrapsychic conflicts. It is well known that the desire to be pregnant is not always accompanied by a desire for motherhood. Pregnancy may be an expression of narcissistic need or a means of defense against feelings of unworthiness or doubts about identity. Guilt feelings may be increased by ambivalence about the abortion, by religious beliefs, or even by the desire for children at a later time. Feelings of guild over an abortion are often provoked by society. The practitioner can play an important role in identifying women at risk of serious psychic sequelae by listening attentively to their manifestations of ambivalence and distress.",

Although self injurious behavior is religiously and culturally sanctioned in some communities, it can be observed together with psychiatric disorders such as borderline personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, psychotic personality disorder and mood disorders. Research shows that the onset of self-injurious behavior is between the ages 13-19. Self-injurious behavior is classified as direct self-injury and indirect self-injury. Cigarette, alcohol and substance use, over eating; not taking ones medication although an illness is diagnosed are indirect self-injurious behaviors. Direct self-injurious behavior is categorized into four groups: typical, psychotic, compulsive and impulsive self-injurious behavior. Research that investigated the reasons of self-injurious behavior showed that physical abuse had a significant effect. People who had been physically abused were injuring themselves to handle the intense feelings and to punish themselves. It is reported that 90% of self-injuriers were using drugs and the majority of these people were addicted. (Anatolian Journal of Psychiatry 2003; 4:226-236)",

A strong correlation between epilepsy and depression has been demonstrated in a variety of studies; etiological factors include neurologic, genetic, and iatrogenic factors. At the time of the initial diagnostic evaluation, the physician who is managing the patient with seizure disorder should make a psychiatric and psychosocial assessment to identify the patient’s risk for depression. This approach enables the physician to assess the impact of epilepsy on the patient and to detect gross signs of psychiatric disorder. Effective treatment options include both somatic and nonsomatic therapies as well as combinations thereof.",

      "abstract": "Stwardnienie rozsiane (SM) to choroba powodująca powstawanie obszarów demielizacyjnych w centralnym układzie nerwowym, czego skutkiem mogą być objawy takie, jak: zaburzenia chodu, koordynacji, zaburzenia czucia, ból, zaburzenia wzroku, funkcji seksualnych czy funkcji kognitywnych. Udowodniono, że dysfunkcje seksualne występują u osób chorujących na SM często. Dysfunkcje te występują częściej niż w przypadku pacjentów cierpiących na inne przewlekłe choroby – 70% pacjentów ze stwardnieniem rozsianym dotkniętych jest problemami w sferze seksualnej. Patofizjologia tych zaburzeń jest wieloczynnikowa. Jednym z czynników są uszkodzenia w centralnym układzie nerwowym, innym współistniejące zaburzenia niezwiązane bezpośrednio z obszarami demielizacyjnymi, takie jak: zmęczenie, spastyczność, osłabienie siły mięśni czy skutki uboczne wdrożonej w procesie leczenia farmakoterapii. Należy podkreślić, że część dysfunkcji seksualnych u osób z SM ma podłoże psychologiczne i społeczne. Celem artykułu jest określenie medycznych i społecznych aspektów powstawania zaburzeń seksualnych u osób ze stwardnieniem rozsianym oraz zobrazowanie wpływu dysfunkcji seksualnych na funkcjonowanie jednostki w obrębie społeczeństwa.",

A healthy personality depends on our ability to integrate various aspects of our experience. The three integrative actions of synthesis, personification and presentification may happen more or less unconsciously, but they require energy and our ability to do them varies with circumstances. Synthesis describes the mental actions that bring different elements of our experience together. In the simplest form there is one elaborate the apparently normal part of the personality (ANP) and one, often rather rudimentary, the emotional part of the personality (EP). The classic example is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), where the ANP gets on with life, until the EP, which holds the traumatic memory, bursts through, creating what are commonly known as flashbacks.",

Is human emotional behavior based on primary biological mechanism that human inherited not only from close animal predecessors, but also significantly more distant kinds on evolutionary ladder? Results of researches indicate that aggressiveness is stable pattern of behavior in children and young people. Aggressive behavior of humans decreases over the years, although certain types of personalities preserve stability of aggressive behavior. Psychological profile of torturer includes diagnostical category of antisocial personality disorder. Mental consequences resulting from torture are depression, psychosomatic reactions, aggression, state of anxiety. The contribution of victimology is significant, particularly from aspect of “selecting” psychopathological reaction. It is also important whether the torturer is known to be victims or it is a stranger. It is understandable that consequences are much more severe with people who had unfortunate to be tortured by known person. The most common psychopathological reactions are: 1. Fear lived during the torture. 2. Depressive reaction. 3. Aggression - which may not be demonstrated in adequate manner, may be shifted to other people, which may create interpersonal disputes, before all for the victim and represents one of physical consequences resulting from torture. Torture prevention is problem of individuals, community and society as whole. Degradation of authorities in one society leads to moral erosion, and on its part, to torture on all functioning levels.",

The gradual deterioration of function with increasing age is so widely perceived and so expected that all deterioration in function in an elderly person tends to be attributed to age.

Functional disability due to disease attracts little medical interest, which is concentrated upon the specific features of the disease; thus the referral letter about a younger patient with suspected myocardial infarction is likely to discuss the features of the chest pain, but is unlikely to mention whether the patient can walk to the toilet or feed himself.",

      "title": "Making sense of the role of sense organs in trichotillomania",
      "abstract": "Hallopeau, a French dermatologist, coined the term trichotillomania to describe alopecia (baldness) caused by self-traction of the hair, but the term now encompasses the entire syndrome of pathological hair pulling.[1] In Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5),[2] the major change for trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) is the fact that it and related disorders now have their own chapter in the obsessive–compulsive disorder section. Trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) includes recurrent pulling out of one's hair, resulting in hair loss, repeated attempts to decrease or stop hair pulling, and the hair pulling causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Furthermore, the hair pulling or hair loss is not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., a dermatological condition), and the hair pulling is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder (e.g., attempts to improve a perceived defect or flaw in appearance in body dysmorphic disorder). There has been lot of debates and discussion if trichotillomania is an impulse control disorder, obsessive–compulsive spectrum disorder, or should be classified as a category of body-focused repetitive behavioral disorder.[3] Trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) has been moved to obsessive–compulsive and related disorders in DSM 5; however, in International Classification of Diseases-10, it is classified under habit and impulse control disorders.[4] Lifetime prevalence rates of trichotillomania have been estimated to vary from 0.6% to 3.6%. Trichotillomania often begins or is recognized in late childhood or early adolescence with an average age of onset around 13 years and displays a chronic but fluctuating course.[5] It involves an individual recurrently pulling hair, generally one hair at a time from any part of his/her body, the head, eyelashes, eyebrows, beard, genital area, underarms, chest, legs, or other area. The scalp is the most common area. Pulling typically is done with the fingers, but tools such as tweezers, brushes, or combs may also be used.[6] Trichotillomania is associated with a significant functional impairment and psychiatric comorbidity across the developmental spectrum. As trichotillomania usually strikes during the sensitive developmental years, it can be especially disabling. Young adults with trichotillomania report impaired school, work, and social functioning, lowered career aspirations, and missed work days. Pulling can also negatively impact family functioning, contributing to family arguments, and secrecy, which in turn can increase stress and exacerbate trichotillomania symptoms. Adults also report that spending considerable financial resources on concealment methods and on treatments.[7] POINT OF VIEW The majority of literature and definitions focus on the act of pulling the hair, the preceding tension, and the relief of anxiety following the act. A variety of factors such as a sensation of itch, boredom, mood changes, stress, and negative emotions serve as triggers to pull the hairs.[8] Pre- and post-pulling activities are documented in literature but are mentioned just as activities surrounding the hair pulling. They receive little or no attention in the whole diagnosis, understanding and management of the disorder. There are lack of satisfactory explanations provided for majority of the postpulling activities and behaviors. An article by Woods and Houghton[5] mentions \"Rituals and behavioral patterns often precede pulling, such as combing through the hair, feeling individual hairs, tugging at hairs, and visually searching the scalp and the hairline. Pre- and post-pulling behavior are also clinically relevant. Although some individuals simply discard pulled hairs, others may play with the hair between their fingers, inspect the hair, bite the hair between the teeth, or ingest all or parts of the hair\". Activities surrounding the hair pulling provide pleasure to the persons with trichotillomania which probably acts a positive reinforcement to pull the hair. The pleasure may come through various sensory modalities which may vary from person to person. If hair pulling is only the primary goal, the patients should just pull the hair one by one and throw which hardly happens. They are involved in varied activities seeking pleasure involving all the sense organs which may vary from person to person. Antecedent activities such as feeling the texture of the hair, twirling, curling, grooming, combing, desire to have an even hairline, identifying the right hair, and then, the particular hair is pulled, all involve the touch sensation. The pulled hair is actually visualized for its characteristics such as length and color which involves the visual modality. The hairs are rubbed against each other, the snap pulling sound involves the hearing modality; at times, patients do even smell the hairs mixed with sweat to experience pleasure (Olfaction). Swallowing, tasting, the whole hair or a part of the hair is widely reported in literature which may be a way of experiencing the hair or else why should a person interested in only pulling the hairs swallow it. Oral behavior using pulled hair is present in half the patients and 5%–18% ingest their hair.[9] Trichophagia is a condition where persons swallow hair. Few patients swallow only the root of the hair called trichorhizophagia. Trichobezoar is a condition wherein swallowed hair starts accumulating in the stomach over a period to form a concretion which presents later with features of malnutrition and intestinal obstruction.[10] In a study by Grant et al.,[11] the rate of trichophagia in 68 individuals with DSM-IV-TR trichotillomania was approximately 1 in 5 (20.6%). CONCLUSION All the sense organs are involved in the varied pre-/post-pulling activities which vary from person to person and serve to maintain the behavior by reinforcements. It is also possible that in a subset of people, the pleasure-providing behaviors are these surrounding acts and hair pulling is just the modality of fulfilling it. Our diagnostic guidelines focus only on the hair pulling act. The behaviors surrounding the hair pulling problem will further help in the psychological management and also bring new insights into this poorly understood illness.",

Even in cases where a patient presents with a known medical condition, functional or somatic symptoms may complicate the diagnostic and treatment processes and prognostic outcome. One umbrella category for neurologically related somatic symptoms, functional neurological disorder (FND), presents as involuntary neurological symptoms incompatible with another medical condition. Symptoms may include weakness and/or paralysis, movement disorders, non-epileptic seizures, speech or visual impairment, swallowing difficulty, sensory disturbances, or cognitive symptoms (1). While FND presents as neuropsychiatric, providers commonly report feeling hesitant to diagnose these disorders. Inexperience or lack of appropriate education on relevant research regarding evidence-based practices or standard of practice (SOP) may result in over- or underperforming diagnostic workups and consultations, utilizing inappropriate medications, and failing to offer evidence-based psychological interventions. Being mindful of these challenges when treating patients presenting with functional symptoms in acute care settings can help to support and protect the patients and care team and appropriately control healthcare costs.",

It is especially important to assess the safety of children in the food addict's care. School can present a number of problems for the food addict.

      "abstract": "Auditory hallucinations (AH) are often considered a sign of a psychotic disorder. This is promoted by the DSM-5 category of Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum And Other Psychotic Disorder (OSSSOPD), the diagnostic criteria for which are fulfilled with the sole presence of persistent AH, in the absence of any other psychotic symptoms. And yet, persistent AH are not synonymous with having a psychotic disorder, and should therefore not be uncritically treated as such. Many people who seek treatment for persistent AH have no other psychotic symptoms, have preserved reality-testing capacities, and will never develop a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Instead, hallucinations may be the result of many different causes, including borderline personality disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), hearing loss, sleep disorders or brain lesions, and they may even occur outside the context of any demonstrable pathology. In such cases, the usage of the DSM-5 diagnosis of OSSSOPD would be incorrect, and it may prompt unwarranted treatment with antipsychotic medication. We therefore argue that a DSM-5 diagnosis of Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder (or any other type of psychotic disorder) characterized by AH should require at least one more symptom listed under the A-criterion (i.e. delusions, disorganized speech, disorganized or catatonic behavior or negative symptoms). Adhering to these more stringent criteria may help to distinguish between individuals with persistent AH which are part of a psychotic disorder, for whom antipsychotic medication may be helpful, and individuals with AH in the absence of such a disorder who may benefit from other approaches (e.g. different pharmacological interventions, improving coping style, trauma-related therapy).",

In Vlaeyen’s model of fear avoidance, he proposes that in a first step negative affectivity and threatening illness information could trigger the development of pain catastrophizing thoughts and subsequently result in pain-related fear and avoidance, hypervigilance, physical disuse leading to deconditioning and physiological deterioration, depression, and disability. In turn all these consequences could again have an impact on the patient’s pain experiences [1].",

This review describes the clinical characteristics of PD with emphasis on those features that differentiate the disease from other parkinsonian disorders.A MedLine search was performed to identify studies that assess the clinical characteristics of PD. Search terms included \"Parkinson's disease\", \"diagnosis\" and \"signs and symptoms\".Because there is no definitive test for the diagnosis of PD, the disease must be diagnosed based on clinical criteria. Rest tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and loss of postural reflexes are generally considered the cardinal signs of PD. The presence and specific presentation of these features are used to differentiate PD from related parkinsonian disorders. Other clinical features include secondary motor symptoms (eg, hypomimia, dysarthria, dysphagia, sialorrhoea, micrographia, shuffling gait, festination, freezing, dystonia, glabellar reflexes), non-motor symptoms (eg, autonomic dysfunction, cognitive/neurobehavioral abnormalities, sleep disorders and sensory abnormalities such as anosmia, paresthesias and pain). Absence of rest tremor, early occurrence of gait difficulty, postural instability, dementia, hallucinations, and the presence of dysautonomia, ophthalmoparesis, ataxia and other atypical features, coupled with poor or no response to levodopa, suggest diagnoses other than PD.A thorough understanding of the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations of PD is essential to the proper diagnosis of the disease. Genetic mutations or variants, neuroimaging abnormalities and other tests are potential biomarkers that may improve diagnosis and allow the identification of persons at risk.",

In contrast, the loss of developmental milestones previously attained usually indicates a progressive disease of the nervous system, but also may result from parental misperception of attained milestones or by the development of new clinical features from an established static disorder as the brain matures ( Table 5–3 ).",

Other features are: vulnerable self-esteem; feelings of shame, sensitivity and intense reactions of humiliation, emptiness or disdain to criticism or defeat; and vocational irregularities resulting from difficulties tolerating criticism or competition. Hence, NPD should be understood from the context of grandiosity and self esteem dysregulation. The subtypes of NPD i.e. the shy, covert, besides the arrogant, overt, grandiose and unempathetic helps emphasise the phenomenologic range of narcissism. We report a case of narcissistic personality disorder, who presented with the unusual subtype with shyness, covertness, poor functioning, but grandiose.",

Relatively common after unilateral lesions are anosognosia and anosodiaphoria—that is, the denial of, or unconcern about, a sensorimotor hemisyndrome. Less familiar forms of altered limb perception include asomatognosia (lack of awareness of a part of the body), somatoparaphrenia (lack of ownership of a paralysed limb), the experience of supernumerary phantom limbs (reduplication of limbs on the affected side of the body), personification (nicknaming a limb and giving it an identity of its own) and misoplegia. The term misoplegia was coined by Critchley1,2 and refers to the morbid dislike or hatred of paralysed limbs in patients with hemiplegia. Minor manifestations of this condition may be restricted to verbal aggression towards a limb, but commonly misoplegia includes physical acts such as striking and beating the hemiplegic extremity.1–3 Although these verbal or physical acts of self-directed aggression are impressive, detailed case reports are rare. Apart from the anecdotal communications by Critchley1,2 and some passing notes by others, we are aware of only six published accounts.

      "title": "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Following Intraoperative Awareness",
      "abstract": "Intraoperative awareness (IA) is an anesthesia complication defined as the unexpected and explicit recall by patients of events that occurred during anesthesia. This complication represents a potentially traumatic event as it may lead to psychological or psychiatric consequences, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is the most frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA. However, the accurate proportion of PTSD following IA is not known. Due to the low incidence of IA, little is known about risk factors for developing psychiatric or psychological sequelae following IA. However, risk factors for the development of PTSD following trauma, in general, have been extensively explored and can be applied to IA. The common risk factors for PTSD are female gender, younger age, minority status, single status, low socioeconomic status, low level of education, low intelligence, psychiatric history, substance abuse or dependence, severity of the trauma, peritraumatic emotional responses, peritraumatic dissociation, lack of social support, low perceived support following the event, history of past traumatic event(s), life stress, childhood adversity, and family psychiatric history. PTSD symptoms may be experienced in the hours or days following IA but can also be delayed and appear months after the traumatic event. They are variable in duration, from a few weeks to several years. To make a diagnosis, they must be present for at least 1 month. Although PTSD is the more frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA, it is important to note that other syndromal or subsyndromal mental disorders such as the acute stress disorder and the subsyndromal PTSD may develop following IA. Early management strategies have to be provided in order to reduce the deleterious outcomes of IA, including taking complaints about IA seriously and offering early psychiatric care.",

The stimuli are called stressors and physiological and behavioral changes in response to exposure to stressors constitute the stress response. A stress response is mediated by a complex interplay of nervous, endocrine, and immune mechanisms that involves activation of the sympathetic-adreno-medullar (SAM) axis, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and immune system. The stress response is adaptive, to begin with, that prepares the body to handle the challenges presented by an internal or external environmental challenge (stressor) e.g., the body's physiologic responses to trauma and invasive surgery serve to attenuate further tissue damage. But if the exposure to a stressor is actually or perceived as intense, repetitive (repeated acute stress), or prolonged (chronic stress), the stress response becomes maladaptive and detrimental to physiology e.g., exposure to chronic stressors can cause maladaptive reactions including depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, and heart disease.",

Most people experience some small or large difficulties or problems at one time or another during the course of their life. The chapter offers a selection of commonly used mental health terms that can be useful to know. Mental disorders are classified into diagnostic categories that are defined in terms of patterns of signs and symptoms, the course the disorder takes and its 'usual' outcome.

      "title": "Some Remarks About Somato-Psychic Compared to Psychosomatic Relationships",
      "abstract": "Somato-psychic medicine refers to all those processes in which psychological phenomena are produced by alterations of the body's anatomy or physiology. It is often extremely difficult to determine the first cause of a psychic disturbance, since somatic influences may produce psychic phenomena, and these in turn may produce somatic processes, and vice versa. These relationships are graphically portrayed for a few well-known clinical pictures. At times it is possible, by analysis of the manifestations presented, to discover evidence of the various influences. Under certain conditions, however, a later process may exert such overwhelming effects in the temporal succession of events that the influence of earlier factors may not be manifest in the clinical picture. A simple classification of the various somato-psychic influences in three groups is presented for better visualization. The first group is comprised of processes taking place within the confines of the skull. The second is represented by those disease processes that are anatomically located extracranially but where changed metabolites or other agents exert influence on the brain cells with subsequent psychic signs. Drugs and other substances brought from outside into the body and exerting influence on the brain may be regarded as a subgroup of factors belonging to this second group. The third group comprises psychic processes that represent conscious or unconscious reactions by the individuals to somatic diseases or to permanent bodily conditions. The correlation of somatic abnormalities and psychological disturbance is, of course, not exhausted by psychosomatic and somato-psychic relationships, since a certain body build and a particular psychological make-up may be expressions of the same constitution.",

Negative symptoms may be either primary, or secondary to positive symptoms, antipsychotic side effects, dysphoric affect and environmental deprivation. Primary negative symptoms represent core features of the illness, and have been termed deficit symptoms. The differentiation of primary from secondary negative symptoms has important treatment implications, as treatment approaches vary greatly for the different types of negative symptoms. Specific pharamacological and psychosocial treatments are available for secondary negative symptoms. However, to date, there are no known effective treatments for primary negative symptoms. The importance of developing effective treatments for primary negative symptoms is underscored by the relationship of these symptoms to poor social, occupational, and global outcome.",

      "abstract": "develop schizophrenia and is generally not longer than a few years, with an average duration of about one year [7]. Thus it has been seen as a legitimate target for detection and intervention, with the aim of prevention of onset, or at least amelioration or delay of onset [8]. This is the background to the ‘ prodromal intervention ’ fi eld. However, even apparent prodromal symptoms lack specifi city. Characteristic prodromal features include sleep disturbance, irritability, lowered mood, anxiety and decline in school or work performance [7,9]. This clinical picture could be the result of a number of conditions, such as major depression, substance abuse and physical illness, as well as a psychotic prodrome. Even attenuated or isolated psychotic symptoms may not necessarily progress to a frank psychotic disorder, as these are now known to be quite common in the general population [10 – 14]. There are two implications of this lack of specifi city. First, is the recognition that a prodrome cannot be diagnosed as such prospectively, and that the terms ‘ prodrome ’ and ‘ prodromal ’ should not be used to refer to this clinical picture or those apparently presenting with it. This is more than pure semantics. Adoption of the term ‘ prodromal ’ to refer to individuals implies that they are on the path to schizophrenia. It suggests that the ‘ process ’ has already begun. Instead, as McGorry [15] has pointed out, terminology such as ‘ at risk mental state ’ should be used, to highlight that a person presenting with apparent prodromal symptoms may be at increased risk of onset of psychotic disorder within a brief time frame (1 – 2 years), but that onset is not inevitable. The second implication is that there needs to be some narrowing of the defi nition of ‘ at risk ’ so that those so identifi ed truly have a high likelihood of onset of fi rst episode psychosis within a brief period of time. One strategy to achieve this aim has been the development of the ultra high risk (UHR) criteria. These have been described elsewhere [8,16,17]. Essentially, there are three groups identifi ed: (i) attenuated psychotic symptoms",

      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia is a syndrome characterized by chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain, which may or may not be associated with muscle or joint stiffness, accompanied by other symptoms such as fatigue, sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression. It is a highly prevalent condition globally, being considered the third most common musculoskeletal disorder, following lower back pain and osteoarthritis. It is more prevalent in women than in men, and although it can occur at any age, it is more common between the ages of thirty and thirty-five. Although the pathophysiology and etiopathogenesis remain largely unknown, three underlying processes in fibromyalgia have been investigated. These include central sensitization, associated with an increase in the release of both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters; peripheral sensitization, involving alterations in peripheral nociceptor signaling; and inflammatory and immune mechanisms that develop concurrently with the aforementioned processes. Furthermore, it has been determined that genetic, endocrine, psychological, and sleep disorders may influence the development of this pathology. The accurate diagnosis of fibromyalgia remains challenging as it lacks specific diagnostic biomarkers, which are still under investigation. Nonetheless, diagnostic approaches to the condition have evolved based on the use of scales and questionnaires for pain identification. The complexity associated with this pathology makes it difficult to establish a single effective treatment. Therefore, treatment is multidisciplinary, involving both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions aimed at alleviating symptoms. The non-pharmacological treatments outlined in this review are primarily related to physiotherapy interventions. The effectiveness of physical exercise, both on land and in water, as well as the application of electrotherapy combined with transcranial therapy and manual therapy has been highlighted. All of these interventions aim to improve the quality of life of patients highly affected by fibromyalgia.",

PTSD is characterized by three symptom clusters: (1) reexperiencing of the traumatic event; (2) avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event and emotional numbing; and (3) hyperarousal symptoms (1). PTSD results in significant distress and morbidity. For example, following an assault a person may experience intrusive thoughts of the assault, suffer from nightmares of threat or assault, or experience flashbacks of all or some portions of the assault. Avoidance of reminders is common and may include, for example, avoidance of the site of the assault or similar places, avoidance of people who are similar to the perpetrator, or avoidance of conversations about community or domestic violence. Following a traumatic event, emotional numbing such as a sense of being unable to have loving feelings, feeling detached from others, or having decreased interest may occur. Difficulty falling asleep, being easily startled, irritability, and hypervigilance are common hyperarousal symptoms (see DSM-IV for criteria) (1).",

Patients complain of physical signs which they attribute to a medical disease and seek medical help for, but the symptoms do not fullfill diagnostic criteria of an organic disorder. Although somatization is known to be associated with many psychiatric disorders, it mostly accompanies depression and anxiety disorders. Somatic symptoms are thought to be a manifestation of somatized dysphoria in depression and/or anxiety. Somatization, stil accepted to be an unsolved problem in the borderland of medicine and psychiatry, leads to an increase in psychological distress and disability of patients and worsens the prognosis of psychiatric disorders. On the other hand, somatization may mask real psychiatric symptomatology leading to a delay in true diagnosis and effective treatment.

Pain is defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage (Mersky & Trimble, 1979). Pain is not a primary sensation such as smell, taste, touch, or vision, but rather it is an emotional state like sorrow or love. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines neuropathic pain as \"pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction of the nervous system\" (Mersky & Trimble, 1994). Neuropathic pain is characterized by lesions or dysfunction of the systems that under normal conditions, transmit noxious information to the central nervous system. This definition has been called vague, and the inclusion of \"dysfunction\" allows it to be assigned to disorders such as chronic regional pain syndrome.",

While neuropsychological testing is effective in discriminating the performance of brain damaged and non-brain damaged patients, the etiology of brain dysfunction must be inferred from the pattern of behavioral impairments and comparison to characteristic neurobehavioral patterns associated with specific types of neurological disorders. Strict reliance on test data can be misleading when testing patients with prominent orbital frontal lobe injury. The conditions of testing may also inadequately mask many of the patient's impairments and may lack sufficient \"ecological validity.\" Frequently psychologists fail to take a chronological history of the injury, the patient, or interview the family or significant others.

      "abstract": "Chronic musculoskeletal pain is defined as chronic pain arising from musculoskeletal structures such as bones or joints. Although comprising the most prevalent set of chronic pain conditions, it was not represented appropriately in the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), which was organized mainly according to anatomical sites, was strongly focused on musculoskeletal disease or local damage, and did not consider the underlying mechanisms of pain. The new ICD-11 classification introduces the concept of chronic primary and secondary musculoskeletal pain, and integrates the biomedical axis with the psychological and social axes that comprise the complex experience of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Chronic primary musculoskeletal pain is a condition in its own right, not better accounted for by a specific classified disease. Chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain is a symptom that arises from an underlying disease classified elsewhere. Such secondary musculoskeletal pain originates in persistent nociception in musculoskeletal structures from local or systemic etiologies, or it may be related to deep somatic lesions. It can be caused by inflammation, by structural changes, or by biomechanical consequences of diseases of the nervous system. It is intended that this new classification will facilitate access to patient-centered multimodal pain management and promote research through more accurate epidemiological analyses.",

The aim of defining diagnostic criteria of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo is to help clinicians to understand the terminology related to orthostatic dizziness/vertigo and to distinguish orthostatic dizziness/vertigo due to global brain hypoperfusion from that caused by other etiologies. Diagnosis of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo requires: A) five or more episodes of dizziness, unsteadiness or vertigo triggered by arising or present during upright position, which subsides by sitting or lying down; B) orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia syndrome or syncope documented on standing or during head-up tilt test; and C) not better accounted for by another disease or disorder. Probable hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo is defined as follows: A) five or more episodes of dizziness, unsteadiness or vertigo triggered by arising or present during upright position, which subsides by sitting or lying down; B) at least one of the following accompanying symptoms: generalized weakness/tiredness, difficulty in thinking/concentrating, blurred vision, and tachycardia/palpitations; and C) not better accounted for by another disease or disorder. These diagnostic criteria have been derived by expert consensus from an extensive review of 90 years of research on hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo, postural hypotension or tachycardia, and autonomic dizziness. Measurements of orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate are important for the screening and documentation of orthostatic hypotension or postural tachycardia syndrome to establish the diagnosis of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo.",

This is because the addictive thinking, feeling and acting is the dominant defense that blocks success in therapy. The therapist and the patient therefore externally symbolize with chairs 1. The patient’s healthy adult thinking, 2. His self-protection through his addictive thinking and feeling, and 3. His symptoms in everyday life. They develop further his addictive thinking and feeling in the as-if mode of play and paradoxically work out the positive meaning of this defense within the framework of his self-regulation. The patient’s self-development initially should take place in the symptom production. This is because metacognitive confusion prevents patients with addiction from adequately processing deeper conflicts. The patient should first gain ego control over his addictive self-regulation. This disorder-specific approach is indicated for harmful use or dependence on alcohol or drugs, and also for non-substance-related addictions such as eating disorders, internet addiction, sex addiction, and other addictions. It makes the experiences of Alcoholics Anonymous fruitful in digested form for depth psychological, behavioral, and systemic therapy.",

      "title": "Role of Social Support as a Mediator in Negative Stressful Life Event and Somatic Complaints of Managerial Personnel",
      "abstract": "In this Complex life scenario employees have to face different challenging task that either related to work or to day to day life situation, both of these causes some sort of problem to employees. Sometimes they express these problems in term of their bodily discomfort or simply somatic complaints. Somatic complaints are increasing day by day in this complex life scenario. Some of them are caused due to physical disturbances in the body while some of them are due to psychological stress that employees get from their life events. Somatic complaints like headache, abdominal pain, backache, insomnia, dizziness, and fatigue are common among employees (Aro, Paroncn, & Aro, 1987; Goodman & McGrath, 1991). Such complaints are inversely related to well-being (Millstein, 1993).Somatic complaints are reported either as in descriptive or subjective reports. Somatic complaints are a descriptive term that does not reflect any preassumptions about etiology. Somatic symptoms are subjective reports of physical symptoms such as headaches, stomachaches, or muscle pain. The expression of somatic complaints as a manifestation of social or psychological distress is recognized cross culturally (Escobar & Gureje, 2007; Murphy, 1989) but in low- and middle income countries (LAMICs) its evaluation is complicated by the high burden of undiagnosed disease and under nutrition, as well as by limited access to health services.It is also viewed that psychosomatic complaints are important indicators of psychosocial health (Piko, 2007) and well-being (Bemtsson, Kohler, & Gustafsson, 2001). By definition, they are subjective physical complaints (headache, stomachache, back ache, and dizziness) as well as psychological complaints (feeling low, irritability, nervousness, and difficulty in getting to sleep that are not caused by an underlying physical disease (Natvig, Albrektsen, Anderssen, & Qvamtstrom, 1999, p. 362).There are multiple socioemotional factors associated with reports of somatic symptoms (Garralda, 2010), including stress and reduced coping abilities (Walker et al., 2007). Children with chronic disease may have poor coping skills that may be related to somatic symptoms (Stewart et al., 2010).Findings indicate that somatic symptoms are associated with high levels of co-morbid psychological symptoms, like anxiety and depression (Haug, Mykletun, & Dahl, 2004), as well as high levels of functional impairment (Mulvaney, Lambert, Garber, & Walker, 2006; Aromaa, Sillanpaa, Rautava, & Helenius, 2000). Different theoretical approaches have dominated the research in understanding somatic symptomatology. Empirical support has been found for the idea that life events perceived as negative or stressful for individuals have the potential to produce somatic symptoms (Murberg, 2012).A stressful or traumatic life situation is one that generates challenges on which the organisms cannot completely respond. Life stress refers to the psychological response state of disturbed affect in relation to stressors in one's life as whole (Parasuram, Greenhouse, & Granrose, 1992). Life stress can result from specific major events or the cumulative effect of daily hassles (Rowdena, Matthewsb, Watsona, & Biggs, 2011). The life events tradition focuses on the global impact of life changes. It covers a wide range of events that either be positive or negative in nature. Research has shown that stressors are detrimental not only to indicators of psychological well-being, such as mood, but also to somatic complaints (Spector & Jex, 1998). Among others, the stress response is characterized by the activation of the sympatheticadrenal medullar system, including increased heart rate, blood pressure, and catecholamine secretion. Over time, such reactions can result in the experience of somatic com-plaints, such as headache, back pain, and gastrointestinal problems.Social support is a significant feature of an individual's social environment and varying levels of support will be perceived as available to the individual in times of need (Snow, Swan, Raghavan, Connell, & Klein, 2003). …",

There are different types of delusional disorder, some of which are centered on issues of love, hate, obsession, persecution or physical illness. These patients sometimes present to non-psychiatrists and have no insight into their problems. Occasionally, aggressive acting out behaviour, including homicide and suicide, can be frightening. Although treatment is difficult, many do respond well to anti-psychotic medications.",

It consists of multi-dimentional phenomenon having sensory discriminative, cognitive-evaluative and effective motivational components. Though the technology has advanced, still it is very difficult to objectively assess all the attributes of pain, including alteration in cognitive behaviour. However, subjective methods like Visual Analog Scale rating (VAS) and preliminary objective methods like pain evoked responses, behaviral monitoring and event related evoked potentials for cognition are currently in vogue. It will take some more time and effort to evolve yet other newer and sophisticated techniques to measure all aspects of pain in human beings.",

The problems in communication with the persons with mental disorders are often connected with the nature of their disabilities. The psychotic patients have quite developed and saved senses, but they have difficulties in the processing and interpretation of what they hear, see and touch. The speech of the persons with mental disabilities is poor and with a limited vocabulary. it reflects with a disability in the mental processes, emotions and motivation. The face expression of the persons with acute mental disabilities does not match the verbal message, and is usually expressed as illogical thinking processes in the form of illusions an hallucinations. To be able to enable persons with mental disabilities to communicate, we should do the following: • in the communication with the users we have to be patient, with a high level of tolerance and respect towards the personality of the user; • a shorter transfer of communication is better, a shorter exchange, use of simple, short sentences, giving different shapes of social support e.g. organizing different games, walks in nature, collation of the psychical appearance with the purpose to encourage a certain type of interaction; • it is not good to interfere with the hallucinogenic contents of the user and • it’s necessary to understand, accept and support their feelings with the purpose to develop a mutual trust. With the users who have a certain type of communication limitations regarding their abilities it is necessary: • to talk loud and clearly with a certain normal speed with the purpose, the user to understand the content of the message easily; • if we notice that the user has not understood the message we are sending towards him, it is necessary to repeat the message, but use different words; • it is desirable to accept a certain member of the user’s family that would aid as a mediator in the communication of the user and as a source for gaining information; • to check if the user has understood what we’ve told him by the repetition or via short summarizing of the conversational content; • Using other forms of communication (sign language, written messages or pictures); • not to make fast conclusions of what the user is saying, but change of the type of communication (use of additional questions of a closed type - yes or no) and • to motivate the user’s memory, to remind him/her of a certain therapy or a certain event that occurred recently.",

Individuals with BDD suffer from time-consuming obsessions about their bodily appearance and excessive compulsive behaviors (for example, mirror-checking, excessive grooming, and skin-picking). Functioning and quality of life are typically very poor, and suicidality is markedly elevated. BDD currently affects 0.7% to 2.9% of the population; however, BDD typically goes unrecognized in clinical settings. This chapter discusses BDD’s definition and classification, epidemiology, demographics, and clinical features, including several case descriptions of BDD, age at onset, course of illness, comorbidity, morbidity (including suicidality), gender similarities and differences, and healthcare utilization. In addition, BDD’s relationships to obsessive-compulsive disorder, psychotic disorders, and social anxiety disorder are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Neurologists frequently see patients with symptoms or inconsistent signs that are not explicable in terms of any recognized neurological disease process. Often it is clear that such symptoms and signs are being manufactured psychologically, either consciously or, more often, by an unconscious process. Such patients are frequently polysymptomatic, and may have a long history of consulting other specialists, particularly abdominal, dental, gynaecological, and otorhinological surgeons. They run the risk of developing secondary abnormalities induced by surgical and other invasive procedures. Psychologically determined symptoms are a very common cause of neurological out-patient referral. Of those with psychogenic disorders, pain is the commonest symptom, followed by motor symptoms, gait disturbances, dizziness, blackouts, sensory symptoms, and visual dysfunction (Lempert et al. 1990). Depressive and anxiety disorders are twice as common in those with psychologically determined disorders and those with emotional disorders have a greater number of somatic symptoms but are unenthusiastic about psychiatric treatment. Clinical syndromes including Briquet’s syndrome, hypochondriasis, conversion disorder, body dysmorphic disorder and pain disorders are explained and described. The presentation and characteristics of malingering (a process of deliberate deceit, in which symptoms are fabricated) is described, including Munchausen’s syndrome. In addition, associated psychiatric states and the symptoms and physical signs of psychologically determined disorders are discussed. Finally, the management and prognosis of psychologically determined states are outlined.",

Functional (psychogenic) neurological diseases, also called conversion disorders, are involuntary. There are two voluntary mimics of functional disorders: factitious disease, where patients have a psychiatric illness, and malingering, where persons have no illness and are just lying. The term “functional” is beginning to replace “psychogenic” in many circumstances. This chapter discusses clinical features of functional neurological disorders in detail. Negative neurological symptoms like loss of consciousness, blindness, constriction of visual field, motor paralysis, and loss of pain sense are commonly seen in functional diseases, but positive symptoms like convulsion and involuntary movements are more common. Among others, functional movement disorders are not infrequent and have drawn particular attention in the recent years. Within the movement disorders, functional tic-like movements might be difficult to distinguish from real tics, and in fact these two may overlap within the patient.",

      "abstract": "The concepts of spirituality and religiosity are studied in the context of cardiac disease and prevention. In psychology, psychosomatics, psychocardiology, spirituality is studied as a feature of human experience, attributed to certain transcendental ideas. Religiosity is a part of a person's self-identification, influencing his experience of interaction with medicine, and more broadly, in general, his worldview and conceptualizations. Spirituality and religiosity are culturally specific, in particular, in Russia, where society has historically formed stereotypes of attitudes on God and other inaccessible ideas. Thus, the Russian society is characterized by lay religiosity, which includes Eastern Orthodox metaphysics along with paganism. In practical cardiology, the concepts of spirituality and religiosity can be realized explicitly (manifestation of faith by a patient and a doctor) and implicitly, without manifestation. Spirituality and religiosity can influence patient adherence, decision making, and more complex psychosomatic processes. Spirituality and religiosity can be a salutogenic factor, which promotes health, improves the psychological and physical state. But they can also mediate morbid effects if a doctor incorrectly addresses them during communication with a patient. Spirituality and religiosity are a part of complex downward system of somatic manifestation of cultural and social factors, the study and consideration of which is obvious in practice.",

They yearn for coherence and meaning and, like the Biblical Job, often ask, “Why me?” This statement can reflect anger and depression, and can also represent several different questions: (1) Why am I singled out? (why me vs. someone else); (2) What did I do to cause this, and what if I had acted differently? (3) Is this punishment? and (4) Does this fate reflect some kind of order, rather than mere randomness? Many patients wonder if they somehow deserve bad outcomes, and sometimes feel that they do, related to guilt, anger, and fear, even if recognizing, intellectually, that such emotions are unhelpful. Physical explanations of illness (e.g., genetics) often don’t feel fully satisfying. Psychotherapy can potentially ease but not necessarily eliminate these ponderings, and not everyone can afford it. Countless patients and families struggle in ways with which chaplains can assist.",

Not surprisingly, the pediatric rheumatologist is frequently called to distinguish organic from functional symptoms. During the past decade, the pediatric rheumatology community has been evaluating increasing numbers of adolescents and preadolescents who experience musculoskeletal symptoms presumably as a defense against emotional stress from achievement either in academic work or in sports. To complicate the challenge further, coexistent organic and psychologic disturbance is not rare. Clearly, organic illness does not protect a patient from emotional plan, and it may be most difficult to differentiate nonorganic pain in a patient with a known organic illness. Conversely, adolescents with organic illness may use their disease for secondary gain. Fear of misdiagnosis of physical illness as psychiatric and the notion that all of the patient's complaints should be explained by a unifying diagnosis cause diagnostic error in both psychogenic illness with physical manifestations and physical illness with psychogenic symptoms.",

Treatment usually consists of psychological/behavioral interventions in combination with relaxation techniques, physical activation and antidepressants.Rückenschmerzen können als Symptom bei verschiedenen somatoformen Störungen vorkommen, besonders typisch aber bei der spezifischen somatoformen Schmerzstörung. Eine somatoforme Schmerzstörung lässt sich bei ca. 10 % bis 20 % der Patienten mit Rückenschmerzen diagnostizieren, zusätzlich finden sich mit einer Häufigkeit von bis 50 % noch andere psychiatrische Störungen wie Depression und Angststörungen. Differentialdiagnostisch müssen noch andere Syndrome mit Ganzkörperschmerzen abgegrenzt werden. Psychotherapie (psychologische Schmerztherapie) in Kombination mit Entspannungsverfahren sowie allenfalls eine Kombination mit Psychopharmakotherapie sind die Behandlungsmethode der Wahl.",

The event usually involves a real or potential severe injury or the threat of death. It causes feelings of extreme fear, helplessness, or horror. After being involved in such an event, many people have trouble sleeping, have nightmares or daytime memories of the event, and feel emotionally numb and cut off from others. For most people, these symptoms stop within a month after the stressful event. When these symptoms continue for months or years, it is called post-traumatic stress disorder.",

      "title": "Nondrowning Asphyxia in Veterinary Forensic Pathology",
      "abstract": "Asphyxia in a forensic context refers to death by rapid cerebral anoxia or hypoxia due to accidental or nonaccidental injury. Death due to nondrowning asphyxia can occur with strangulation, suffocation, and mechanical asphyxia, each of which is categorized based on the mechanism of injury. Individuals dying due to various types of asphyxia may or may not have lesions, and even those lesions that are present may be due to other causes. The interpretation or opinion that death was due to asphyxia requires definitive and compelling evidence from the postmortem examination, death scene, and/or history. Beyond the postmortem examination, pathologists may be faced with questions of forensic importance that revolve around the behavioral and physiological responses in animals subjected to strangulation, suffocation, or mechanical asphyxia to determine if the animal suffered. While there is no prescriptive answer to these questions, it is apparent that, because of physiological and anatomical differences between humans and animals, for some mechanisms of asphyxia, consciousness is maintained for longer periods and the onset of death is later in animals than that described for people. Veterinary pathologists must be cognizant that direct extrapolation from the medical forensic literature to animals may be incorrect. This article reviews the terminology, classification, mechanisms, and lesions associated with asphyxial deaths in companion animals and highlights significant comparative differences of the response to various types of asphyxia in animals and people.",

When the patient is motivated, the pain is easily cured in most of the cases by using the tools of consciousness-based medicine, primarily therapeutic touch, conversation, and coaching the patient in a positive philosophy of life. The pains are often caused by “blockages” that may cause problems other than just pain. Often it turns out that the blocked areas develop actual physical damage over time: a slipped disk in the back, articular degeneration, or osteoarthritis when the cartilage is affected, can often be explained in this way. Apparently, the exact areas where the blockage is situated cause cellular problems, disrupting cellular order. The holistic process theory of healing and the related quality of life theories state that return to the natural state of being is possible, whenever the person gets the resources needed for existential healing. The resources needed are “holding” in the dimensions of awareness, respect, care, acknowledgment, and acceptance with support and processing in the dimensions of feeling, understanding, and letting go of negative attitudes and beliefs. The preconditions for holistic healing are trust and the intention for the healing to take place. Case stories of holistic treatment of patients with chronic back pain, low back pain, muscle problems, knee pain, and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis are discussed with exercises relevant for patients with these conditions in the holistic clinic.",

      "abstract": "In the Indian system of medicine, there are two psychosomatic stages, namely ‘Prakriti’ (natural stage) and ‘Vikriti’ (deform stage), that are significantly discussed in the context of human wellbeing. The natural stage is identified as the 'Prakriti', and the deformed stage is the ‘Vikriti’. When the Tridosha (or Panchadosha) becomes balanced (the natural stage), no psychosomatic diseases occur, and when the Tridosha (or Panchadosha) becomes misbalanced (the deform stage), then all diseases appear in their psychosomatic forms. According to the Indian system of medical philosophy, various types of diseases are caused by the mind, i.e., Panchavikara. These Panchavikaras produce the Panchadosha, which causes entire diseases on the psychophysical dimensions. All psychosomatic diseases manifest on the mental or physical level in two forms. Firstly, diseases are caused by the negative law of Karma, where almost 95% of psychosomatic diseases are caused by internal factors deeply rooted in the subconscious mind due to past acquired negative Karma, namely Panchavikara. Conversely, almost 05% of psychosomatic diseases are caused by external factors that are connected to the present negative karma-made subconscious mind. The principles of modern pathology are prominently based on these three misconceptions. Firstly, the cause of similar diseases in the various individuals is assumed to be similar. Secondly, it is assumed that most diseases occur on a physical level. Thirdly, the existence of the soul is denied. Vice versa, the soul-centric system of Indian medicine strongly considers that every individual is a unique and incredible being. Diseases are caused by the different factors for similar diseases in the different individuals due to the deferring law of Karma individually; thus, most diseases are considered psychic Ragatmaka Mantra therapy heals especially the outer subconscious (Manomaya Sharira) and inner subconscious mind (Karana Sharira). This therapy eradicates all psychosomatic diseases from their root causes in the subconscious mind forever.",

The good physician cannot abandon his charges at this point, but he must study these obstacles and assist in surmounting them. He must match modern drug and surgical therapy with practical sociopsychological therapy. The good physician is concerned not only with turbulent brain waves but with disturbed emotions and with social injustice, for the epileptic is not just a nervemuscle preparation; he is a person, in health an integrated combination of the physical, the mental, the social, and the spiritual.

Symptom exaggeration is best understood in the context of clinical phenomena that lie along a continuum from unconscious and unintentional to conscious and intentional. Illness behavior refers to the ways in which given symptoms may be perceived, evaluated, and acted upon by different persons, and such behavior can be appropriate or inappropriate, depending on context, and can be learned and reinforced. Further, certain illness behaviors potentially confound the association between illness or injury, on the one hand, and impairment or disability, on the other hand. For example, any deficit can be exaggerated, including neuropsychological deficits, pain, and loss of sensation. Specialized assessments include symptom validity testing to assess memory or sensory deficits, and maximum voluntary effort testing assesses strength deficits. In their assessment of illness behavior, physicians should employ the same degree of thoroughness as they would with any condition. Written reports should include not only the conclusion that symptom exaggeration is present but also the basis for this determination. A table shows the characteristics of symptom magnification syndromes and other related conditions vs the presence of symptoms such as seeking gain or deception.",

In the writer's own case psychosis eventually encroached after real persecution, severe life stress and enhanced arousal and was prompted by an ascription of high distinctiveness to self and a low distinctiveness to others. The impact of coincidences generated and confirmed an interpretation of an externallocus of control. Abnormality ('illness') was reflected in a massive escalation of confirmation blas. It is argued that psychosis has its own intrinsic motivation; that life events must be understood in a developmental context; that cognitive factors, often critical, can sometimes be tied to emotional determinants and that gross damage to the self concept, with consequences for spiritual life, plays a causal role in psychosis. A genetic fragility, which biases ongoing emotional and cognitive life, is nonetheless strongly indicated.",

      "title": "Alien Hand Syndrome: Ethical Issues",
      "abstract": "Abstract At the nexus of theories of mind and the science of the brain is alien hand syndrome, a rare neurologic disorder in which one hand displays complex nonvolitional behaviours. The causative lesion disconnects brain regions that initiate hand movement from those needed for conscious recognition of volition. The aberrant behaviours may be unwilled and automatic, or in other cases they may be unconsciously willed yet unrecognised as the patient's own. Although sometimes touted as proof that free will does not exist, scientific descriptions of alien hand phenomenon are neutral in regard to competing philosophical theories attributing human decision to free agency or to determined physical processes. How one thinks about the nature of free will is important for ethics, which respects the validity of personal autonomy in moral decision making. Demonstration that some purposeful actions may be unwilled does not mean that all thoughts are predetermined. Therefore, neuroscientific explanations of alien hand syndrome can help to inform but do not dismantle traditional approaches to biomedical ethics. Key Concepts: Alien hand syndrome is a neurologic condition in which the affected hand exhibits complex nonvolitional behaviours. It results from disconnection of brain regions that control the hand from those that signal conscious recognition of volition. Other clinical examples of complex involuntary behaviours are recognised. Purposeful yet nonvolitional behaviour calls into question common understandings of free will. If no human decisions were freely made, then the ethical principle of respect for autonomy would be meaningless. Personal culpability for unwilled harmful actions is ethically and legally diminished. Just because some actions may be unwilled does not mean that all are. Scientific accounts of alien hand syndrome are philosophically neutral with respect to theories of agency versus determinism. Some instances of alien hand syndrome may be a form of agnosia of agency.",

      "title": "Agnosia",
      "abstract": "Agnosia is a rare disorder characterized by an inability to recognize and identify objects or persons.People with agnosia may have difficulty recognizing the geometric features of an object or face or may be able to perceive the geometric features but not know what the object is used for or whether a face is familiar or not.Agnosia can be limited to one sensory modality such as vision or hearing.For example, a person may have difficulty in recognizing an object as a cup or identifying a sound as a cough.Agnosia can result from strokes, dementia, developmental disorders, or other neurological conditions.It typically results from damage to specific brain areas in the occipital or parietal lobes of the brain.People with agnosia may retain their cognitive abilities in other areas.",
